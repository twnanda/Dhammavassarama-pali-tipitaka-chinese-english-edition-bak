DIET FOR A MINDFUL SOCIETY</font></h2>

    <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">Aware of the suffering caused by unmindful

    my parents, my society and future generations. I will work to transform violence, fear,

    society. I understand that a proper diet is crucial for self-transformation and for the

  </em><p><font face="Times New Roman">Aware of the suffering caused by unmindful

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Whenever we take a bath or a shower, we can look at our
  body and see that it is a gift from our parents and their parents. Even though many of us
  do not want to have much to do with our parents--they may have hurt us so much--when we
  look deeply, we see that we cannot drop all identification with them. As we wash each part
  of our body, we can ask ourselves, &quot;To whom does this body belong? Who has
  transmitted this body to me? What has been transmitted?&quot; Meditating this way, we will
  discover that there are three components: the transmitter, that which is transmitted, and
  the one who receives the transmission. The transmitter is our parents. We are the
  continuation of our parents and their ancestors. The object of transmission is our body
  itself. And the one who receives the transmission is us. If we continue to meditate on
  this, we will see clearly that the transmitter, the object transmitted, and the receiver
  are one. All three are present in our body. When we are deeply in touch with the present
  moment, we can see that all our ancestors and all future generations are present in us.
  Seeing this, we will know what to do and what not to do--for ourselves, our ancestors, our
  children, and their children.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At first, when you look at your father, you probably do
  not see that you and your father are one. You may be angry at him for many things. But the
  moment you understand and love your father, you realize the emptiness of transmission. You
  realize that to love yourself is to love your father, and to love your father is to love
  yourself. To keep your body and your consciousness healthy is to do it for your ancestors,
  your parents, and future generations. You do it for your society and for everyone, not
  just yourself. The first thing you have to bear in mind is that you are not practicing
  this as a separate entity. Whatever you ingest, you are doing it for everyone. All of your
  ancestors and all future generations are ingesting it with you. That is the true meaning
  of the emptiness of the transmission. The Fifth Precept should be practiced in this
  spirit. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are people who drink alcohol and get drunk, who
  destroy their bodies, their families, their society. They should refrain from drinking.
  But you who have been having a glass of wine every week during the last thirty years
  without doing any harm to yourself, why should you stop that? What is the use of
  practicing this precept if drinking alcohol does not harm you or other people? Although
  you have not harmed yourself during the last thirty years by drinking just one or two
  glasses of wine every week, the fact is that it may have an effect on your children, your
  grandchildren, and your society. We only need to look deeply in order to see it. You are
  practicing not for yourself alone, but for everyone. Your children might have a propensity
  for alcoholism and, seeing you drinking wine every week, one of them may become alcoholic
  in the future. If you abandon your two glasses of wine, it is to show your children, your
  friends, and your society that your life is not only for yourself. Your life is for your
  ancestors, future generations, and also your society. To stop drinking two glasses of wine
  every week is a very deep practice, even if it has not brought you any harm. That is the
  insight of a bodhisattva who knows that everything she does is done for all her ancestors
  and future generations. The emptiness of transmission is the basis of the Fifth Precept.
  The use of drugs by so many young people should also be stopped with the same kind of
  insight.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In modern life, people think that their body belongs to
  them and they can do anything they want to it. &quot;We have the right to live our own
  lives.&quot; When you make such a declaration, the law supports you. This is one of the
  manifestations of individualism. But, according to the teaching of emptiness, your body is
  not yours. Your body belongs to your ancestors, your parents, and future generations. It
  also belongs to society and to all the other living beings. All of them have come together
  to bring about the presence of this body--the trees, clouds, everything. Keeping your body
  healthy is to express gratitude to the whole cosmos, to all ancestors, and also not to
  betray the future generations. We practice this precept for the whole cosmos, the whole
  society. If we are healthy, everyone can benefit from it--not only everyone in the society
  of men and women, but everyone in the society of animals, plants, and minerals. This is a
  bodhisattva precept. When we practice the Five Precepts we are already on the path of a
  bodhisattva.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we are able to get out of the shell of our small self
  and see that we are interrelated to everyone and everything, we see that our every act is
  linked with the whole of humankind, the whole cosmos. To keep yourself healthy is to be
  kind to your ancestors, your parents, the future generations, and also your society.
  Health is not only bodily health, but also mental health. The Fifth Precept is about
  health and healing. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Aware of the suffering caused by unmindful
  consumption, I vow to cultivate good health, both physical and mental, for myself, my
  family, and my society...&quot; Because you are not doing it only for yourself, to stop
  drinking one or two glasses of wine a week is truly an act of a bodhisattva. You do it
  everyone. At a reception, when someone offers you a glass of wine, you can smile and
  decline, &quot;No, thank you. I do not drink alcohol. I would be grateful if you would
  bring me a glass of juice or water.&quot; You do it gently, with a smile. This is very
  helpful. You set an example for many friends, including many children who are present.
  Although that can be done in a very polite, quiet way, it is truly the act of a
  bodhisattva, setting an example by your own life. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Everything a mother eats, drinks, worries about, or fears
  will have an effect on the fetus inside her. Even when the child inside is still tiny,
  everything is in it. If the young mother is not aware of the nature of interbeing, she may
  cause damage to both herself and her child at the same time. If she drinks alcohol, she
  will destroy, to some extent, the brain cells in her fetus. Modern research has proven
  this. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mindful consumption is the object of this precept. We are
  what we consume. If we look deeply into the items that we consume every day, we will come
  to know our own nature very well. We have to eat, drink, consume, but if we do it
  unmindfully, we may destroy our bodies and our consciousness, showing ingratitude toward
  our ancestors, our parents, and future generations. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we eat mindfully we are in close touch with the food.
  The food we eat comes to us from nature, from living beings, and from the cosmos. To touch
  it with our mindfulness is to show our gratitude. Eating in mindfulness can be a great
  joy. We pick up our food with our fork, look at it for a second before putting it into our
  mouth, and then chew it carefully and mindfully, at least fifty times. If we practice
  this, we will be in touch with the entire cosmos. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Being in touch also means knowing whether toxins are
  present in the food. We can recognize food as healthy or not thanks to our mindfulness.
  Before eating, members of a family can practice breathing in and out and looking at the
  food on the table. One person can pronounce the name of each dish, &quot;potatoes,&quot;
  &quot;salad,&quot; and so on. Calling something by its name helps us touch it deeply and
  see its true nature. At the same time, mindfulness reveals to us the presence or absence
  of toxins in each dish. Children enjoy doing this if we show them how. Mindful eating is a
  good education. If you practice this way for some time, you will find that you will eat
  more carefully, and your practice of mindful eating will be an example for others. It is
  an art to eat in a way that brings mindfulness into our life.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We can have a careful diet for our body, and we can also
  have a careful diet for our consciousness, our mental health. We need to refrain from
  ingesting the kinds of intellectual &quot;food&quot; that bring toxins into our
  consciousness. Some TV programs, for example, educate us and help us to lead a healthier
  life, and we should make time to watch programs like these. But other programs bring us
  toxins, and we need to refrain from watching them. This can be a practice for everyone in
  the family. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We know that smoking cigarettes is not good for our
  health. We have worked hard to get the manufacturers to print a line on a pack of
  cigarettes: &quot;WARNING, SMOKING MAY BE HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH.&quot; That is a strong
  statement, but it was necessary because advertisements to promote smoking are very
  convincing. They give young people the idea that if they don't smoke, they are not really
  alive. These advertisements link smoking with nature, springtime, expensive cars,
  beautiful men and women, and high standards of living. One could believe that if you don't
  smoke or drink alcohol, you will not have any happiness at all in this life. This kind of
  advertising is dangerous; it penetrates into our unconscious. There are so many wonderful
  and healthy things to eat and drink. We have to show how this kind of propaganda misleads
  people. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The warning on cigarette packs is not enough. We have to
  stand up, write articles, and do whatever we can to step up campaigns against smoking and
  drinking alcohol. We are going in the right direction. At last it is possible to take an
  airplane flight without suffering from cigarette smoke. We have to make more effort in
  these directions. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I know that drinking wine runs deep in Western culture. In
  the ceremony of the Eucharist and the Passover seder, wine is an important element. But I
  have spoken to priests and rabbis about this, and they have told me it is possible to
  substitute grape juice for the wine. Even if we don't drink at all, we can still get
  killed on the streets by a drunk driver. To persuade one person to refrain from drinking
  is to make the world safer for us all.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes we don't need to eat or drink as much as we do,
  but it has become a kind of addiction. We feel so lonely. Loneliness is one of the
  afflictions of modern life. It is similar to the Third and Fourth Precepts--we feel
  lonely, so we engage in conversation, or even in a sexual relationship, hoping that the
  feeling of loneliness will go away. Drinking and eating can also be the result of
  loneliness. You want to drink or overeat in order to forget your loneliness, but what you
  eat may bring toxins into your body. When you are lonely, you open the refrigerator, watch
  TV, read magazines or novels, or pick up the telephone to talk. But unmindful consumption
  always makes things worse. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There may be a lot of violence, hatred, and fear in a
  film. If we spend one hour looking at that film, we will water the seeds of violence,
  hatred, and fear in us. We do that, and we let our children do that, too. Therefore we
  should have a family meeting to discuss an intelligent policy concerning television
  watching. We may have to label our TV sets the same way we have labelled cigarettes:
  &quot;WARNING: WATCHING TELEVISION CAN BE HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH.&quot; That is the
  truth. Some children have joined gangs, and many more are very violent, partly because
  they have seen a lot of violence on television. We must have an intelligent policy
  concerning the use of television in our family. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We should arrange our schedules so that our family has
  time to benefit from the many healthy and beautiful programs on TV. We do not have to
  destroy our television set; we only have to use it with wisdom and mindfulness. This can
  be discussed among the family and the community. There are a number of things we can do,
  such as asking the TV stations to establish healthier programming, or suggesting to
  manufacturers to offer television sets that receive only stations that broadcast healthy,
  educational programs, like PBS. During the war in Vietnam, the American army dropped
  hundreds of thousands of radio sets in the jungles that could receive only one station,
  the one that made propaganda for the anticommunist side. This is not psychological
  warfare, but I think many families would welcome a TV set that would allow us to see only
  healthy programs. I hope you will write to TV manufacturers and TV stations to express
  your ideas about this. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We need to be protected because the toxins are
  overwhelming. They are destroying our society, our families, and ourselves. We have to use
  everything in our power to protect ourselves. Discussions on this subject will bring about
  important ideas, such as to how to protect ourselves from destructive television
  broadcasts. We also have to discuss in our families and communities which magazines that
  we and our children enjoy reading, and we should boycott those magazines that spill toxins
  into our society. Not only should we refrain from reading them, but we should also make an
  effort to warn people of the danger of reading and consuming these kinds of products. The
  same is true of books and conversations. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because we are lonely, we want to have conversations, but
  our conversations can also bring about a lot of toxins. From time to time, after speaking
  with someone, we feel paralyzed by what we have just heard. Mindfulness will allow us to
  stop having the kinds of conversations that bring us more toxins. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Psychotherapists are those who listen deeply to the
  sufferings of their clients. If they do not know how to practice to neutralize and
  transform the pain and sorrow in themselves, they will not be able to remain fresh and
  healthy in order to sustain themselves for a long time.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The exercise I propose has three points: First, look
  deeply into your body and your consciousness and identify the kinds of toxins that are
  already in you. We each have to be our own doctor not only for our bodies, but also for
  our minds. After we identify these toxins, we can try to expel them. One way is to drink a
  lot of water. Another is to practice massage, to encourage the blood to come to the spot
  where the toxins are, so the blood can wash them away. A third is to breathe deeply air
  that is fresh and clean. This brings more oxygen into the blood and helps it expel the
  toxins in our bodies. There are mechanisms in our bodies that try to neutralize and expel
  these substances, but our bodies may be too weak to do the job by themselves. While doing
  these things, we have to stop ingesting more toxins. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the same time, we look into our consciousness to see
  what kinds of toxins are already in there. We have a lot of anger, despair, fear, hatred,
  craving, and jealousy--all these things were described by the Buddha as poisons. The
  Buddha spoke of the three basic poisons as anger, hatred, and delusion. There are many
  more than that, and we have to recognize their presence in us. Our happiness depends on
  our ability to transform them. We have not practiced, and so we have been carried away by
  our unmindful life-styles. The quality of our life depends very much on the amount of
  peace and joy that can be found in our bodies and consciousness. If there are too many
  poisons in our bodies and consciousness, the peace and joy in us will not be strong enough
  to make us happy. So the first step is to identify and recognize the poisons that are
  already in us. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second step of the practice is to be mindful of what
  we are ingesting into our bodies and consciousness. What kind of toxins am I putting into
  my body today? What films am I watching today? What book am I reading? What magazine am I
  looking at? What kind of conversations am I having? Try to recognize the toxins. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third part of the practice is to prescribe for
  yourself a kind of diet. Aware of the fact that there are this many toxins in my body and
  consciousness, aware of the fact that I am ingesting this and that toxin into my body and
  consciousness every day, making myself sick and causing suffering to my beloved ones, I am
  determined to prescribe for myself a proper diet. I vow to ingest only items that preserve
  well-being, peace, and joy in my body and my consciousness. I am determined not to ingest
  more toxins into my body and consciousness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Therefore, I will refrain from ingesting into my body and
  consciousness these things, and I will make a list of them. We know that there are many
  items that are nutritious, healthy, and delightful that we can consume every day. When we
  refrain from drinking alcohol, there are so many delicious and wholesome alternatives:
  fruit juices, teas, mineral waters. We don't have to deprive ourselves of the joys of
  living, not at all. There are many beautiful, informative, and entertaining programs on
  television. There are many excellent books and magazines to read. There are many wonderful
  people and many healthy subjects to talk about. By vowing to consume only items that
  preserve our well-being, peace, and joy, and the well-being, peace, and joy of our family
  and society, we need not deprive ourselves of the joys of living. Practicing this third
  exercise brings us deep peace and joy.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Practicing a diet is the essence of this precept. Wars and
  bombs are the products of our consciousness<b> </b>individually and collectively. Our
  collective consciousness has so much violence, fear, craving, and hatred in it, it can
  manifest in wars and bombs. The bombs are the product of our fear. Because others have
  powerful bombs, we try to make bombs even more powerful. Then the other nations hear that
  we have powerful bombs, and they try to make even more powerful bombs. Removing the bombs
  is not enough. Even if we could transport all the bombs to a distant planet, we would
  still not be safe, because the roots of the wars and the bombs are still intact in our
  collective consciousness. Transforming the toxins in our collective consciousness is the
  true way to uproot war. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we saw the video of Rodney King being beaten on the
  streets of Los Angeles, we did not understand why the five policemen had to beat a
  defenseless person like that again and again. We saw the violence, hatred, and fear in the
  policemen. But it is not the problem of the five policemen alone. Their act was the
  manifestation of our collective consciousness. They are not the only ones who are violent
  and full of hatred and fear. Most of us are like that. There is so much violence in all
  big cities, not only Los Angeles, but also San Francisco, New York, Washington, D.C.,
  Chicago, Tokyo, Paris, and elsewhere. Every morning, when going to work, policemen say,
  &quot;I have to be careful or I may be killed. I will be unable to return to my
  family.&quot; A policeman practices fear every day, and because of that, he may do<b> </b>things
  that are quite unwise. Sometimes there is no real danger, but because he suspects he may
  be shot, he takes his gun and shoots first. He may shoot a child playing with a toy gun.
  One week before Rodney King was beaten, a policewoman in Los Angeles was shot in the face
  and killed. It is natural that the police in the area became angry when they heard this,
  and they all went to the funeral to demonstrate their anger and hatred to society and to
  the administration for not providing them with enough safety. The government is not safe
  either--presidents and prime ministers get assassinated. Because society is like this,
  policemen and policewomen are like that. &quot;This is, because that is. This is like
  this, because that is like that.&quot; A violent society creates violent policemen. A
  fearful society creates fearful policemen. Putting the policemen in jail does not solve
  the problem. We have to change the society from its roots, which is our collective
  consciousness, where the root-energies of fear, anger, greed, and hatred lie. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We cannot abolish war with angry demonstrations. We have
  to practice a diet for ourselves, our families, and our society. We have to do it with
  everyone else. In order to have healthy TV programs, we have to work with artists,
  writers, filmmakers, lawyers, and legislators. We have to step up the struggle. Meditation
  should not be a drug to make us oblivious to our real problems. It should produce
  awareness in us, and also in our families and in our society. Enlightenment has to be
  collective for us to achieve results. We have to stop the kinds of consuming that poison
  our collective consciousness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I do not see any other way than the practice of these
  bodhisattva precepts. We have to practice them as a society in order to produce the
  dramatic changes we need. To practice as a society will be possible only if each of us
  vows to practice as a bodhisattva. The problem is great. It concerns our survival and the
  survival of our species and our planet. It is not a matter of enjoying one glass of wine.
  If you stop drinking your glass of wine, you do it for the whole society. We know that the
  Fifth Precept is exactly like the first one. When you practice non-killing and you know
  how to protect the lives of even small animals, you realize that eating less meat has do
  with the practice of the precept. If you are not able to entirely stop eating meat, at
  least make an effort to reduce eating meat. If you reduce eating meat and drinking alcohol
  by fifty percent, you will already be performing a miracle; that alone can solve the
  problem of hunger in the Third World. Practicing the precepts is to make progress every
  day. That is why during the precept recitation ceremony, we always answer the question of
  whether we have made an effort to study and practice the precept by deep breathing. That
  is the best answer. Deep breathing means that I have made some effort, but I can do
  better. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Fifth Precept can be like that, too. If you are unable
  to completely stop drinking, then stop four-fifths, or three-fourths. The difference
  between the First and the Fifth Precept is that alcohol is not the same as meat. Alcohol
  is addictive. One drop brings about another. That is why you are encouraged to stop even
  one glass of wine. One glass can bring about a second glass. Although the spirit is the
  same as the First Precept, you are strongly recommended not to take the first glass of
  wine. When you see that we are in great danger, refraining from the first glass of wine is
  a manifestation of your enlightenment. You do it for all of us. We have to set an example
  for our children and our friends. On French television they say, &quot;One glass is all
  right, but three glasses will bring about destruction.&quot; (Un verre ça va; trois
  verres bonjour les dégâts.)<b> </b>They do not say that the first glass brings about the
  second, and the second brings about the third. They don't say that, because they belong to
  a civilization of wine. Here in Plum Village, in the Bordeaux region of France, we are
  surrounded by wine. Many of our neighbors are surprised that we don't profit from being in
  this area, but we are a pocket of resistance. Please help us. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When I was a novice, I learned that from time to time we
  had to use alcohol in preparing medicines. There are many kinds of roots and herbs that
  have to be macerated in alcohol to have an effect. In these instances, alcohol is allowed.
  When the herbs have been prepared, we put the mixture in a pot and boil them. Then they no
  longer have an intoxicating effect. If you use some alcohol in cooking, the result may be
  the same. After the food is cooked, the alcohol in it will not have an intoxicating
  nature. We should not be narrow-minded about this. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">No one can practice the precepts perfectly, including the
  Buddha. The vegetarian dishes that were offered to him were not entirely vegetarian.
  Boiled vegetables contain dead bacteria. We cannot practice the First Precept or any of
  the precepts perfectly. But because of the real danger in our society--alcoholism has
  destroyed so many families and has brought about much unhappiness--we have to do
  something. We have to live in a way that will eradicate that kind of damage. That is why
  even if you can be very healthy with one glass of wine every week, I still urge you with
  all my strength to abandon that glass of wine. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I would also like to say something about not using drugs.
  As alcohol has been the plague of one generation, drugs are the plague of another. One
  young girl in Australia told me that she did not know anyone in her age group who does not
  take drugs of one kind or another. Often young people who have taken drugs come to
  meditation centers to deal with the problem of facing life as it is. They are often
  talented and sensitive people--painters, poets and writers--and by becoming addicted to
  drugs they have, to a small or large extent, destroyed some brain cells. It means that
  they now have little stability or staying power, and are prone to sleeplessness and
  nightmares. We do what we can to encourage them to stay for a course of training in the
  meditation center, but because they are easily disillusioned, they tend to leave when
  things become difficult. Those who have been addicted to drugs need discipline. I am not
  sure that a meditation center like Plum Village is the best place to cure victims of drug
  addiction. I think that experts and specialists in this field are better equipped than we
  are. A meditation center should be able to receive educators and specialists in drug
  addiction as well as the victims of drug addiction for short courses in meditation to make
  its resources available where they are truly needed.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The practice that we offer is that of the Fifth Precept,
  to prevent someone from becoming involved with drugs in the first place. Parents
  especially need to know what spiritual food to give their children. So often, children
  feel spiritually starved by the wholly materialistic outlook of their parents. The parents
  are unable to transmit to the children the values of their spiritual heritage, and so the
  children try to find fulfillment in drugs. Drugs seem to be the only solution when
  teachers and parents are spiritually barren. Young people need to touch the feeling of
  deep-seated well-being within themselves without having to take drugs, and it is the task
  of educators to help them find spiritual nourishment and well-being. But if educators have
  not yet discovered for themselves a source of spiritual nourishment, how can they
  demonstrate to young people how that nourishment may be found?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Fifth Precept tells us to find wholesome, spiritual
  nourishment, not only for ourselves but also for our children and future generations.
  Wholesome, spiritual nourishment can be found in the moon, the spring blossoms, or the
  eyes of a child. The most basic meditation practices of becoming aware of our bodies, our
  minds, and our world can lead us into a far more rich and fulfilling state than drugs
  could ever do. We can celebrate the joys that are available in the simplest pleasures.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The use of alcohol and drugs is causing great damage to
  our societies and families. Governments work hard to stop the traffic of drugs. They use
  airplanes, guns, and armies to do so. Most people know how destructive the use of drugs is
  but they cannot resist, because there is so much pain and loneliness inside them, and the
  use of alcohol and drugs helps them to forget for a while their deep malaise. Once people
  get addicted to alcohol and drugs, they might do anything to get the drugs they need--lie,
  steal, rob, or even kill. To stop the drug traffic is not the best way to prevent people
  from using drugs. The best way is to practice the Fifth Precept and to help others
  practice. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Consuming mindfully is the intelligent way to stop
  ingesting toxins into our consciousness and prevent the malaise from becoming
  overwhelming. Learning the art of touching and ingesting refreshing, nourishing, and
  healing elements is the way to restore our balance and transform the pain and loneliness
  that are already in us. To do this, we have to practice together. The practice of mindful
  consuming should become a national policy. It should be considered true peace education.
  Parents, teachers, educators, physicians, therapists, lawyers, novelists, reporters,
  filmmakers, economists, and legislators have to practice together. There must be ways of
  organizing this kind of practice. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The practice of mindfulness helps us be aware of what is
  going on. Once we are able to see deeply the suffering and the roots of the suffering, we
  will be motivated to act, to practice. The energy we need is not fear or anger; it is the
  energy of understanding and compassion. There is no need to blame or condemn. Those who
  are destroying themselves, their families, and their society by intoxicating themselves
  are not doing it intentionally. Their pain and loneliness are overwhelming, and they want
  to escape. They need to be helped, not punished. Only understanding and compassion on a
  collective level can liberate us. The practice of the Five Wonderful Precepts is the
  practice of mindfulness and compassion. For a future to be possible for our children and
  their children, we have to practice.</font></p>
