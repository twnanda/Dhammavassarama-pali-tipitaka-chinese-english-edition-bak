DEEP LISTENING AND LOVING SPEECH</font></h2>

<hr width="30%">

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">Aware of the suffering caused by unmindful speech and
    the inability to listen to others, I vow to cultivate loving speech and deep listening in
    order to bring joy and happiness to others and relieve others of their suffering. Knowing
    that words can create happiness or suffering, I vow to learn to speak truthfully, with
    words that inspire self-confidence, joy, and hope. I am determined not to spread news that
    I do not know to be certain and not to criticize or condemn things of which I am not sure.
    I will refrain from uttering words that can cause division or discord, or that can cause
    the family or the community to break. I will make all efforts to reconcile and resolve all
    conflicts, however small. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  </em><p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a saying in Vietnamese, ``It doesn't cost
  anything to have loving speech.'' We only need to choose our words carefully, and we can
  make other people happy. To use words mindfully, with loving kindness, is to practice
  generosity. Therefore this precept is linked directly to the Second Precept. We can make
  many people happy just by practicing loving speech. Again, we see the interbeing nature of
  the Five Precepts. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many people think they will be able to practice generosity
  only after they have accumulated a small fortune. I know young people who dream of getting
  rich so they can bring happiness to others: ``I want to become a doctor or the president
  of a big company so I can make a lot of money and help many people.'' They do not realize
  that it is often more difficult to practice generosity after you are wealthy. If you are
  motivated by loving kindness and compassion, there are many ways to bring happiness to
  others right now, starting with kind speech. The way you speak to others can offer them
  joy, happiness, self-confidence, hope, trust, and enlightenment. Mindful speaking is a
  deep practice. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva is a person who has learned the
  art of listening and speaking deeply in order to help people let go of their fear, misery,
  and despair. He is the model of this practice, and the door he opens is called the
  ``universal door.'' If we practice listening and speaking according to Avalokitesvara, we
  too will be able to open the universal door and bring joy, peace, and happiness to many
  people and alleviate their suffering. </font></p>
  <blockquote>
<!-- It looks like these are supposed to be separate lines.  So I made them
 separate lines. -->
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The universal door manifests itself<br>
    in the voice of the rolling tide.<br>
    Hearing and practicing it, we become a child,<br>
    born from the heart of a lotus,<br>
    fresh, pure, and happy,<br>
    capable of speaking and listening<br>
    in accord with the universal door.<br>
    With only one drop of the water<br>
    of compassion<br>
    from the branch of the willow,<br>
    spring returns to the great Earth.<br>
    </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I learned this beautiful poem when I studied the <em>Lotus
  Sutra</em> at age sixteen. When you hear ``the voice of the rolling tide,'' which is
  Avalokitesvara's practice, symbolizing the universal door, you are transformed into a
  child born in the heart of a lotus. With only one drop of the water of compassion from the
  willow branch of the bodhisattva, spring returns to our dry Earth. The dry Earth means the
  world of suffering and misery. The drop of compassionate water is the practice of loving
  kindness, symbolized by the water on the willow branch. Avalokitesvara is described by the
  Chinese, Vietnamese, Koreans, and Japanese as the person holding the willow branch. He
  dips the branch into the water of compassion of his heart, and wherever he sprinkles that
  water, everything is reborn. When he sprinkles it on dry, dead branches, they turn green.
  Dead branches also symbolize suffering and despair, and green vegetation symbolizes the
  return of peace and happiness. With only one drop of that water, spring returns to our
  great Earth. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the ``Universal Door'' chapter of the <em>Lotus Sutra</em>,
  Avalokitesvara's voice is described in five ways: the wondrous voice, the voice of the
  world regarded, the <em>brahma</em> voice, the voice of the rising tide, and the voice of
  world surpassing. We should always keep these five voices in mind. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">First, there is the wondrous voice. This is the kind of
  speaking that will open the universal door and make everything possible again. This voice
  is pleasant to hear. It is refreshing and brings calm, comfort, and healing to our soul.
  Its essence is compassion. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Second, there is the voice of the world regarded. The
  meaning of the word Avalokitesvara is ``the one who looks deeply into the world and hears
  the cries of the world.'' This voice relieves our suffering and suppressed feelings,
  because it is the voice of someone who understands us deeply -- our anguish, despair, and
  fear. When we feel understood, we suffer much less. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Third, here is the brahma voice. Brahma means noble -- not
  just the ordinary voice of people, but the noble speech that springs forth from the
  willingness to bring happiness and remove suffering. Love, compassion, joy, and
  impartiality are the <em>Four Brahmaviharas</em>, noble dwellings of buddhas and
  bodhisattvas. If we want to live with buddhas and bodhisattvas, we can dwell in these
  mansions. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">During the time of the Buddha, the aim of the practice of
  many people was to be born and to live together with Brahma. It was similar to the
  Christian practice of wanting to go to Heaven to be with God. ``In my Father's house there
  are many mansions,'' and you want to live in one of these mansions. For those who wanted
  to be with Brahma, the Buddha said, ``Practice the four noble dwellings: love, compassion,
  joy, and impartiality.'' If we want to share one teaching of the Buddha with our Christian
  friends, it would be the same: ``God is love, compassion, joy, and impartiality.'' If you
  want to be with God, practice these four dwellings. If you don't practice these four, no
  matter how much you pray or talk about being with God, going to Heaven will not be
  possible. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Fourth, the voice of the rising tide is the voice of the
  Buddhadharma. It is a powerful voice, the kind of voice that silences all wrong views and
  speculations. It is the lion's roar that brings absolute silence to the mountain and
  brings about transformation and healing. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Fifth, the voice of the world surpassing is the voice with
  which nothing can be compared. This voice does not aim at fame, profit, or a competitive
  edge. It is the thundering silence that shatters all notions and concepts. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The wondrous voice, the voice of the world regarded, the
  brahma voice, the voice of the rising tide, and the voice of the world surpassing are the
  voices we are to be mindful of. If we contemplate these five kinds of voices, we assist
  Avalokitesvara in opening the universal door, the door of real listening and real
  speaking. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because he lives a mindful life, always contemplating the
  world, and because he is the world regarder, Avalokitesvara notices a lot of suffering. He
  knows that much suffering is born from unmindful speech and the inability to listen to
  others; therefore he practices mindful, loving speech and listening deeply. Avalokitesvara
  can be described as the one who teaches us the best way to practice the Fourth Precept. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>``Aware of the suffering caused by unmindful speech,
  and the inability to listen to others, I vow to cultivate loving speech and deep listening
  in order to bring joy and happiness to others and relieve others of their suffering.''</em>
  This is exactly the universal door practiced by Avalokitesvara. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Never in the history of humankind have we had so many
  means of communication -- television, telecommunications, telephones, fax machines,
  wireless radios, hot lines, and red lines -- but we still remain islands. There is so
  little communication between the members of one family, between the individuals in
  society, and between nations. We suffer from so many wars and conflicts. We surely have
  not cultivated the arts of listening and speaking. We do not know how to listen to each
  other. We have little ability to hold an intelligent or meaningful conversation. The
  universal door of communication has to be opened again. When we cannot communicate, we get
  sick, and as our sickness increases, we suffer and spill our suffering on other people. We
  purchase the services of psychotherapists to listen to our suffering, but if
  psychotherapists do not practice the universal door, they will not succeed.
  Psychotherapists are human beings who are subject to suffering like the rest of us. They
  might have problems with their spouses, children, friends, and society. They also have
  internal formations. They may have a lot of suffering that cannot be communicated to even
  the most beloved person in their life. How can they sit there and listen to our suffering,
  and understand our suffering? Psychotherapists have to practice the universal door, the
  Fourth Precept -- deep listening and mindful speech. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Unless we look deeply into ourselves, this practice will
  not be easy. If there is a lot of suffering in you, it is difficult to listen to other
  people or to say nice things to them. First you have to look deeply into the nature of
  your anger, despair, and suffering to free yourself, so you can be available to others.
  Suppose your husband said something unkind on Monday and it hurt you. He used unmindful
  speech and does not have the ability to listen. If you reply right away out of your anger
  and suffering, you risk hurting him and making his suffering deeper. What should you do?
  If you suppress your anger or remain silent, that can hurt you, because if you try to
  suppress the anger in you, you are suppressing yourself. You will suffer later, and your
  suffering will bring more suffering to your partner. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The best immediate practice is to breathe in and out in
  order to calm your anger, to calm the pain: ``Breathing in, I know that I am angry.
  Breathing out, I calm my feeling of anger.'' Just by breathing deeply on your anger, you
  will calm it. You are being mindful of your anger, not suppressing it. When you are calm
  enough, you may be able to use mindful speech. In a loving and mindful way, you can say,
  ``Darling, I would like you to know that I am angry. What you just said hurt me a lot, and
  I want you to know that.'' Just saying that, mindfully and calmly, will give you some
  relief. Breathing mindfully to calm your anger, you will be able to tell the other person
  that you are suffering. During that moment, you are living your anger, touching it with
  the energy of mindfulness. You are not denying it at all. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When I speak about this to psychotherapists, I have some
  difficulty. When I say that anger makes us suffer, they take it to mean that anger is
  something negative to be removed. But I always say that anger is an organic thing, like
  love. Anger can become love. Our compost can become a rose. If we know how to take care of
  our compost, we can transform it into a rose. Should we call the garbage negative or
  positive? It can be positive, if we know how to handle it. Anger is the same. It can be
  negative when we do not know how to handle it, but if we know how to handle our anger, it
  can be very positive. We do not need to throw anything away. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">After you breathe in and out a number of times to recover
  your calmness, even if your anger is still there, you are mindful of it, and you can tell
  the other person that you are angry. You can also tell him that you would like to look
  deeply into it, and you would like him to look deeply into it also. Then you can make an
  appointment for Friday evening to look at it together. One person looking at the roots of
  your suffering is good, two people looking at it is better, and two people looking
  together is best. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I propose Friday evening for two reasons. First, you are
  still angry, and if you begin discussing it now, it may be too risky. You might say things
  that will make the situation worse. From now until Friday evening, you can practice
  looking deeply into the nature of your anger, and the other person can also. While driving
  the car, he might ask himself, ``What is so serious? Why did she get so upset? There must
  be a reason.'' While driving, you will also have a chance to look deeply into it. Before
  Friday night, one or both of you may see the root of the problem and be able to tell the
  other and apologize. Then on Friday night, you can have a cup of tea together and enjoy
  each other. If you make an appointment, you will both have time to calm down and look
  deeply. This is the practice of meditation. Meditation is to calm ourselves and to look
  deeply into the nature of our suffering. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Friday night comes, if the suffering has not been
  transformed, you will be able to practice the art of Avalokitesvara. You sit together and
  practice deep listening -- one person expressing herself, while the other person listens
  deeply. When you speak, you tell the deepest kind of truth, and you practice loving
  speech. Only by using that kind of speech will there be a chance for the other person to
  understand and accept. While listening, you know that only with deep listening can you
  relieve the suffering of the other person. If you listen with just half an ear, you cannot
  do it. Your presence must be deep and real. Your listening must be of a good quality in
  order to relieve the other person of his suffering. This is the practice of the Fourth
  Precept. The second reason for waiting until Friday is that when you neutralize that
  feeling on Friday evening, you have Saturday and Sunday to enjoy being together. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Suppose you have some kind of internal formation regarding
  a member of your family or community, and you don't feel joyful being with that person.
  You can talk to her about simple things, but you don't feel comfortable talking with her
  about anything deep. Then one day, while doing housework, you notice that the other person
  is not doing anything at all, is not sharing the work that needs to be done, and you begin
  to feel uneasy. ``Why am I doing so much and she isn't doing anything? She should be
  working.'' Because of this comparison, you lose your happiness. But instead of telling the
  other person, ``Please, Sister, come and help with the work,'' you say to yourself, ``She
  is an adult. Why should I have to say something to her? She should be more responsible!''
  You think that way because you already have some internal formation about the other
  person. The shortest way is always the direct way. ``B'' can go to ``A'' and say,
  ``Sister, please come and help.'' But you do not do that. You keep it to yourself and
  blame the other person. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next time the same thing happens, your feeling is even
  more intense. Your internal formation grows little by little, until you suffer so much
  that you need to talk about it with a third person. You are looking for sympathy in order
  to share the suffering. So, instead of talking directly to ``A,'' you talk to ``C.'' You
  look for ``C'' because you think that ``C'' is an ally who will agree that ``A'' is not
  behaving well at all. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you are ``C,'' what should you do? If you already have
  some internal formations concerning ``A,'' you will probably be glad to hear that someone
  else feels the same. Talking to each other may make you feel better. You are becoming
  allies -- ``B'' and ``C'' against ``A.'' Suddenly ``B'' and ``C'' feel close to each
  other, and both of you feel some distance from ``A.'' ``A'' will notice that. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">``A'' may be very nice. She would be capable of responding
  directly to ``B'' if ``B'' could express her feelings to her. But ``A'' does not know
  about ``B's'' resentment. She just feels some kind of cooling down between herself and
  ``B,'' without knowing why. She notices that ``B'' and ``C'' are becoming close, while
  both of them look at her coldly. So she thinks, ``If they don't want me, I don't need
  them.'' She steps farther back from them, and the situation worsens. A triangle has been
  set up. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If I were ``C,'' first of all, I would listen to ``B''
  attentively, understanding that ``B'' needs to share her suffering. Knowing that the
  direct way is the shortest way, I would encourage ``B'' to speak directly to ``A.'' If
  ``B'' is unable to do this, I would offer to speak to ``A'' on ``B's'' behalf, either with
  ``B'' present, or alone. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">But, most important, I would not transmit to anyone else
  what ``B'' tells me in confidence. If I am not mindful, I may tell others what I now know
  about ``B's'' feelings, and soon the family or the community will be a mess. If I do these
  things -- encourage ``B'' to speak directly with ``A'' or speak with ``A'' on ``B's''
  behalf, and not tell anyone else what ``B'' has told me -- I will be able to break the
  triangle. This may help solve the problem, and bring peace and joy back into the family,
  the community, and the society. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If, in the community, you see that someone is having
  difficulty with someone else, you have to help right away. The longer things drag on, the
  more difficult they are to solve. The best way to help is to practice mindful speech and
  deep listening. The Fourth Precept can bring peace, understanding, and happiness to
  people. The universal door is a wonderful door. You will be reborn in a lotus flower and
  help others, including your family, your community, and your society, be born there also. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Speech can be constructive or destructive. Mindful
  speaking can bring real happiness; unmindful speech can kill. When someone tells us
  something that makes us healthy and happy, that is the greatest gift he or she can give.
  Sometimes, someone says something to us that is so cruel and distressing that we want to
  go and commit suicide; we lose all hope, all our <em>joie de vivre</em>. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">People kill because of speech. When you fanatically
  advocate an ideology, saying that this way of thinking or organizing society is the best,
  then if anyone stands in your way, you have to suppress or eliminate him. This is very
  much linked with the First Precept -- that kind of speech can kill not only one person,
  but many. When you believe in something that strongly, you can put millions of people into
  gas chambers. When you use speech to promote an ideology, urging people to kill in order
  to protect and promote your ideology, you can kill many millions. The First and Fourth of
  the Five Wonderful Precepts inter-are. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Fourth Precept is also linked to the Second Precept,
  on stealing. Just as there is a ``sex industry,'' there is also a ``lying industry.'' Many
  people have to lie in order to succeed as politicians, or salespersons. A corporate
  director of communications told me that if he were allowed to tell the truth about his
  company's products, people would not buy them. He says positive things about the products
  that he knows are not true, and he refrains from speaking about the negative effects of
  the products. He knows he is lying, and he feels terrible about it. So many people are
  caught in similar situations. In politics also, people lie to get votes. That is why we
  can speak of a ``lying industry.'' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">This precept is also linked with the Third Precept. When
  someone says, ``I love you,'' it may be a lie. It may just be an expression of desire. And
  so much advertising is linked with sex. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Buddhist tradition, the Fourth Precept is always
  described as refraining from these four actions: </font><ol>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Not telling the truth. If it's black, you say it's white. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Exaggerating. You make something up, or describe something
      as more beautiful than it actually is, or as ugly when it is not so ugly. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Forked tongue. You go to one person and say one thing and
      then you go to another person and say the opposite. </font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Filthy language. You insult or abuse people. </font></li>
  </ol>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>``I vow to learn to speak truthfully, with words that
  inspire self- confidence, joy, and hope.''</em> This must be practiced with children. If
  you tell children they are good-for-nothing, they will suffer in the future. Always
  emphasize the positive, hopeful things with your children, and also with your spouse. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>``I am determined not to spread news that I do not
  know to be certain and not to criticize or condemn things of which I am not sure. I will
  refrain from uttering words that can cause division or discord, or that can cause the
  family or the community to break. I will make all efforts to reconcile and resolve all
  conflicts, however small.''</em> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Reconciliation is a deep practice that we can do with our
  listening and our mindful speech. To reconcile means to bring peace and happiness to
  nations, people, and members of our family. This is the work of a bodhisattva. In order to
  reconcile, you have to possess the art of deep listening, and you also have to master the
  art of loving speech. You have to refrain from aligning yourself with one party so that
  you are able to understand both parties. This is a difficult practice. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">During the war in Vietnam, we tried to practice this. We
  tried not to align ourselves with either of the warring parties, the communists or the
  anticommunists. You will be able to help only if you stand above the conflict and see both
  the good and the bad aspects of both sides. Doing this, you put yourself in a dangerous
  situation, because you may be hated by both sides. One side suspects that you are an
  instrument of the other side, and the other side suspects you are an instrument of the
  first side. You may be killed by both sides at the same time. That is exactly what many
  Buddhists in Vietnam suffered during the war. We did not align ourselves with the
  communists, but we did not align ourselves with the pro-American side either. We just
  wanted to be ourselves. We did not want any killing; we only wanted reconciliation. One
  side said that you cannot reconcile with the pro-Americans. The other side said that you
  cannot reconcile with the communists. If we had listened to both sides it would have been
  impossible to reconcile with anyone. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We trained social workers to go into the rural areas to
  help with health, economic, and educational problems, and we were suspected by both sides.
  Our work of reconciliation was not just the work of speaking, but also of acting. We tried
  to help the peasants find hope. We helped many refugees settle in new villages. We helped
  sponsor more than ten thousand orphans. We helped the peasants rebuild their destroyed
  villages. The work of reconciliation is not just diplomatic; it is concrete. At the same
  time, we were voicing the peace in our hearts. We said the people in one family must look
  upon each other as brothers and sisters and accept each other. They should not kill each
  other because of any ideology. That message was not at all popular in the situation of
  war. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">My writings were censored by both sides. My poetry was
  seized by both sides. My friends printed one of my poetry books underground because the
  Saigon government would not allow its publication. Then the communist side attacked it on
  the radio saying that it was harmful to the struggle, probably motivated by the CIA.
  Nationalist policemen went into bookshops and confiscated the poems. In Hue, one kind
  policeman went into a Buddhist bookshop and said that this book should not be displayed;
  it should be hidden and given out only when someone asked for it. We were suppressed not
  only in our attempts to voice our concerns and propose ways to settle the problems between
  brothers and sisters, we were also suppressed in our attempts to help people. Many of our
  social workers were killed and kidnapped by both sides. Each side suspected we were
  working for the other side. Some of our workers were assassinated by fanatic Catholics who
  suspected us of working for the communists, and some of our workers were taken away by the
  communist side. Our workers were quite popular in the countryside. They were very
  dedicated young men and women, including many young monks and nuns. They did not have
  salaries; they just wanted to serve and to practice Buddhism. In the situation of war,
  they brought their loving kindness, compassion, and good work, and received a small
  stipend to live. They went to the countryside without hoping for anything in return. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I remember a young man named An who specialized in helping
  peasants learn modern methods of raising chickens. He taught them disease prevention
  techniques. He was asked by a farmer, ``How much do you earn from the government each
  month?'' An said, ``We don't earn anything from the government. In fact we are not from
  the government, we are from the temple. We are sent by the Buddhist temple to help you.''
  An did not tell the farmer, who was not so sophisticated, that he was associated with the
  School of Youth for Social Service, founded by the Department of Social Work of the
  Unified Buddhist Church. That was too complicated, so he only said that he was sent by the
  temple. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">``Why have you come here from the temple?'' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">An said, ``We are performing merit.'' This is a very
  popular term in Buddhism. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The farmer was surprised. He said, ``I have learned that
  in order to perform merit people go to the temple. Now why are you performing merit
  here?'' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The young man said, ``You know, my Uncle, during these
  times the people suffer so much that even the Buddha has to come out here to help. We
  students of the Buddha are performing merit right here, where you suffer.'' That statement
  became the ground of our philosophy of social service, engaged Buddhism. The Buddha has to
  be in society. He cannot remain in the temple any longer, because people are suffering too
  much. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In a few years, we became very popular in the countryside
  of Vietnam. We did not have a lot of money, but because we worked in the way of performing
  merit, we were loved by the people. The communist side knew that and did not want us to be
  there, so they came to us during the night and asked us who had given us permission to
  work there. Our workers said that we did not have permission from either the government or
  the communist side. We were just performing merit here. One time the communists gave the
  order for our social workers to evacuate an area, saying, ``We will not be responsible for
  your safety if you stay beyond twenty-four hours.'' Another time, some fanatics came from
  the government, unofficially, and asked our social workers if they were really social
  workers from the Buddhist community. Then they brought five of the students to the
  riverbank, and, after checking once more to be sure that they were Buddhist social
  workers, said, ``We are sorry, but we have to kill you.'' They shot all five of them. We
  were suppressed by both sides during the night. They knew that if they suppressed us
  during the day, the peasants in the countryside would disapprove. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One grenade thrown into my room was deflected by a
  curtain. Another night, many grenades were thrown into our School's dormitories, killing
  two young workers, and injuring many others. One young man was paralyzed, and later
  treated in Germany. One young lady got more than 1,000 pieces of shrapnel in her body. She
  lost a lot of blood, and was saved by a Japanese friend who was helping us. Later, we were
  able to bring her to Japan for surgery. They tried to remove the small metal pieces, but
  300 pieces that could not be taken out were left in her body. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day when I was in Paris as representative of the
  Vietnamese Buddhist Peace Delegation, to be present at the Paris Peace Talks, I received a
  phone message from Saigon telling me that four social workers had just been shot and
  killed. I cried. It was I who had asked them to come and be trained as social workers. A
  friend who was there with me, said, ``Thây, you are a kind of general leading a
  nonviolent army, and when your army is working for love and reconciliation, there surely
  will be casualties. There is no need to cry.'' </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I said, ``I am not a general. I am a human being. I need
  to cry.'' I wrote a play six months later about the deaths of these students, entitled, <em>The
  Path of Return Continues the Journey.</em> [see <em>Love in Action: Writings on Nonviolent
  Social Change</em> (Berkeley: Parallax Press, 1993)] </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The work of reconciliation is not diplomatic work alone.
  It is not because you travel and meet with dozens of foreign ministers that you do the
  work of reconciliation. You have to use your body, your time, and your life to do the work
  of reconciliation. You do it in many ways, and you can be suppressed by the people you are
  trying to help. You have to listen and understand the suffering of one side, and then go
  and listen to the suffering of the other side. Then you will be able to tell each side, in
  turn, about the suffering being endured by the other side. That kind of work is crucial,
  and it takes courage. We need many people who have the capacity of listening, in South
  Africa, in the Middle East, in Eastern Europe, and elsewhere. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Fourth Precept is a bodhisattva precept. We need deep
  study to be able to practice it well, within ourselves, our families, our communities, our
  society, and the world. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">THICH NHAT HANH is a Zen Buddhist monk, peace activist,
  scholar, and poet. He is the founder of the Van Hanh Buddhist University in Saigon, has
  taught at Columbia University and the Sorbonne, and now lives in southern France, where he
  gardens, works to help those in need, and travels internationally teaching ``the art of
  mindful living.'' Martin Luther King, Jr., nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize in
  1967, saying, ``I do not personally know of anyone more worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize
  than this gentle monk from Vietnam.'' </font></p>
