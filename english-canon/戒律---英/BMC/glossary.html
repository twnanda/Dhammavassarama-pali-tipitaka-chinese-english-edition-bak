This Glossary is designed to help the reader in two sorts of situations: (1) when encountering a Pali term in this book in a passage where it is not explained; and (2) when encountering Vinaya terminology in other books or conversations and wanting to know how it is defined and/or where it is discussed here. For terms that have entire chapters devoted to them -- such as <i>nissaya</i> and <i>pacittiya</i> -- see the relevant chapter.

<i>Sangha:</i> Community. This may refer to the entire Community of bhikkhus or bhikkhunis, or to the Community living in a particular location. In this book I have tried to distinguish between the two by calling the first <i>Sangha,</i> and the second <i>Community,</i> but there are some contexts where it is difficult to draw a clear line between the two.

<p>
<i>Sutta (suttanta):</i> discourse.
<p>
<i>Tajjaniya-kamma:</i> an act of censure, whereby a Community may strip a bhikkhu of some of his communal rights if he is a maker of strife, if he refuses to see or confess an offense he admits to having committed, or if he criticizes the Buddha, Dhamma, or Sangha. If he mends his ways, the act can be repealed. See <A HREF="ch5.html#8">Sanghadisesa 8</A>, <A HREF="ch6.html#1">Aniyata 1</A>, and <A HREF="ch11.html">Chapter Eleven</A>.

<i>Uposatha:</i> Observance day, the day of the new and of the full moon; traditionally, in India, a time of special spiritual practices. The Buddha adopted this as the day for reciting the Patimokkha.
<p>
<i>Vassa:</i> Rains Retreat -- a three-month period, generally beginning the day after the full moon in July (or the second, if there are two), during which certain restrictions are placed on the bhikkhus' wanderings; usually considered a time to accelerate one's efforts in study or practice.
<p>
<i>Vikappana:</i> an arrangement whereby an item not in use is placed under shared ownership. See <A HREF="ch7-1.html#1">NP 1</A>, <A HREF="ch8-6.html#59">Pacittiya 59</A>, and <A HREF="app.html#5">Appendix V</A>.
