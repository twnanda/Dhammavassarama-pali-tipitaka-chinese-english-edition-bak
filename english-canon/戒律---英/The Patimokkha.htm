in the training and livelihood of the Bhikkhus, without having renounced the 
training, without having declared his weakness -- engage in the sexual act, even 
with a female animal, he is defeated and no longer in communion.</P><B>
<P>2.</B> Should any Bhikkhu, in the manner of stealing, take what is not given 
from an inhabited area or from the wilderness -- just as when, in the taking of 
what is not given, kings arresting the criminal would flog, imprison, or banish 
him, saying, "You are a robber, you are a fool, you are benighted, you are a 
thief" -- a Bhikkhu in the same way taking what is not given is defeated and no 
longer in communion.</P><B>
<P>3.</B> Should any Bhikkhu intentionally deprive a human being of life, or 
search for an assassin for him, or praise the advantages of death, or incite him 
to die (thus): "My good man, what use is this wretched, miserable life to you? 
Death would be better for you than life," or with such an idea in mind, such a 
purpose in mind, should in various ways praise the advantages of death or incite 
him to die, he also is defeated and no longer in communion.</P><B>
<P>4.</B> Should any Bhikkhu, without direct knowledge, boast of a superior 
human state, a truly noble knowledge and vision as present in himself, saying, 
"Thus do I know; thus do I see," such that regardless of whether or not he is 
cross-examined on a later occasion, he -- being remorseful and desirous of 
purification -- might say, "Friends, not knowing, I said I know; not seeing, I 
said I see -- vainly, falsely, idly," unless it was from over-estimation, he 
also is defeated and no longer in communion.</P>

<P>2.</B> Should any Bhikkhu, overcome by lust, with altered mind, engage in 
bodily contact with a woman, or in holding her hand, holding a lock of her hair, 
or caressing any of her limbs, it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the 
Community.</P><B>
<P>3.</B> Should any Bhikkhu, overcome by lust, with altered mind, address lewd 
words to a woman in the manner of young men to a young woman alluding to sexual 
intercourse, it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</P><B>
<P>4.</B> Should any Bhikkhu, overcome by lust, with altered mind, speak in the 
presence of a woman in praise of ministering to his own sensuality thus: "This, 
sister, is the highest ministration, that of ministering to a virtuous, 
fine-natured follower of the celibate life such as myself with this act" -- 
alluding to sexual intercourse -- it entails initial and subsequent meetings of 
the Community.</P><B>
<P>5.</B> Should any Bhikkhu engage in conveying a man's intentions to a woman 
or a woman's intentions to a man, proposing marriage or paramourage -- even if 
only for a momentary liaison -- it entails initial and subsequent meetings of 
the Community.</P><B>
<P>6.</B> When a Bhikkhu is building a hut from (gains acquired by) his own 
begging -- having no sponsor, destined for himself -- he is to build it to the 
standard measurement. Here the standard is this: twelve spans, using the sugata 
span, in length (measuring outside); seven in width, (measuring) inside. 
Bhikkhus are to be assembled to designate the site. The site the Bhikkhus 
designate should be without disturbances and with adequate space. If the Bhikkhu 
should build a hut from his own begging on a site with disturbances and without 
adequate space, or if he should not assemble the Bhikkhus to designate the site, 
or if he should exceed the standard, it entails initial and subsequent meetings 
of the Community.</P><B>
<P>7.</B> When a Bhikkhu is building a large dwelling -- having a sponsor and 
destined for himself -- he is to assemble Bhikkhus to designate the site. The 
site the Bhikkhus designate should be without disturbances and with adequate 
space. If the Bhikkhu should build a large dwelling on a site with disturbances 
and without adequate space, or if he should not assemble the Bhikkhus to 
designate the site, it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the 
Community.</P><B>
<P>8.</B> Should any Bhikkhu, malicious, angered, displeased, charge a (fellow) 
Bhikkhu with an unfounded case involving defeat, (thinking), "Surely with this I 
may bring about his fall from the celibate life," then regardless of whether or 
not he is cross-examined on a later occasion, if the issue is unfounded and the 
Bhikkhu confesses his anger, it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the 
Community.</P><B>
<P>9.</B> Should any Bhikkhu, malicious, angered, displeased, using as a mere 
ploy an aspect of an issue that pertains otherwise, charge a Bhikkhu with a case 
involving defeat, (thinking), "Surely with this I may bring about his fall from 
the celibate life," then regardless of whether or not he is cross-examined on a 
later occasion, if the issue pertains otherwise, an aspect used as a mere ploy, 
and the Bhikkhu confesses his anger, it entails initial and subsequent meetings 
of the Community.</P><B>
<P>10.</B> Should any Bhikkhu agitate for a schism in a Community in concord, or 
should he persist in taking up an issue conducive to schism, the Bhikkhus should 
admonish him thus: "Do not, Ven. sir, agitate for a schism in a Community in 
concord or persist in taking up an issue conducive to schism. Let the venerable 
one be reconciled with the Community, for a Community in concord, on 
complimentary terms, free from dispute, having a common recitation, dwells in 
peace."</P>
<P>And should that Bhikkhu, admonished thus by the Bhikkhus, persist as before, 
the Bhikkhus are to rebuke him up to three times so as to desist. If while being 
rebuked up to three times he desists, that is good. If he does not desist, it 
entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</P><B>
<P>11.</B> Should Bhikkhus -- one, two, or three -- who are followers and 
partisans of that Bhikkhu, say, "Do not, Ven. sirs, admonish that Bhikkhu in any 
way. He is an exponent of the Dhamma, an exponent of the Vinaya. He acts with 
our consent and approval. He knows, he speaks for us, and that is pleasing to 
us," other Bhikkhus are to admonish them thus: "Do not say that, Ven. sirs. That 
Bhikkhu is not an exponent of the Dhamma and he is not an exponent of the 
Vinaya. Do not, Ven. sirs, approve of a schism in the Community. Let the 
venerable ones' (minds) be reconciled with the Community, for a Community in 
concord, on complimentary terms, without dispute, with a common recitation, 
dwells in peace."</P>
<P>And should those Bhikkhus, thus admonished, persist as before, the Bhikkhus 
are to rebuke them up to three times so as to desist. If while being rebuked up 
to three times by the Bhikkhus they desist, that is good. If they do not desist, 
it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</P><B>
<P>12.</B> In case a Bhikkhu is by nature difficult to admonish -- who, when 
being legitimately admonished by the Bhikkhus with reference to the training 
rules included in the (Patimokkha) recitation, makes himself un-admonish-able 
(saying), "Do not, venerable ones, say anything to me, good or bad; and I will 
not say anything to the venerable ones, good or bad. Refrain, venerable ones, 
from admonishing me" -- the Bhikkhus should admonish him thus: "Let the 
venerable one not make himself un-admonish-able. Let the venerable one make 
himself admonish-able. Let the venerable one admonish the Bhikkhus in accordance 
with what is right, and the Bhikkhus will admonish the venerable one in 
accordance with what is right; for it is thus that the Blessed One's following 
is nurtured: through mutual admonition, through mutual rehabilitation."</P>
<P>And should that Bhikkhu, thus admonished by the Bhikkhus, persist as before, 
the Bhikkhus are to be rebuke him up to three times so as to desist. If while 
being rebuked up to three times he desists, that is good. If he does not desist, 
it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</P><B>
<P>13.</B> In case a Bhikkhu living in dependence on a certain village or town 
is a corrupter of families, a man of depraved conduct -- whose depraved conduct 
is both seen and heard about, and the families he has corrupted are both seen 
and heard about -- the Bhikkhus are to admonish him thus: "You, Ven. sir, are a 
corrupter of families, a man of depraved conduct. Your depraved conduct is both 
seen and heard about; the families you have corrupted are both seen and heard 
about. Leave this monastery, Ven. sir. Enough of your staying here."</P>
<P>And should that Bhikkhu, thus admonished by the Bhikkhus, say about the 
Bhikkhus, "The Bhikkhus are prejudiced by favoritism, prejudiced by aversion, 
prejudiced by delusion, prejudiced by fear, in that for this sort of offense 
they banish some and do not banish others," the Bhikkhus are to admonish him 
thus: "Do not say that, Ven. sir. The Bhikkhus are not prejudiced by favoritism, 
are not prejudiced by aversion, are not prejudiced by delusion, are not 
prejudiced by fear. You, Ven. sir, are a corrupter of families, a man of 
depraved conduct. Your depraved conduct is both seen and heard about, and the 
families you have corrupted are both seen and heard about. Leave this monastery, 
Ven. sir. Enough of your staying here."</P>
<P>And should that Bhikkhu, thus admonished by the Bhikkhus, persist as before, 
the Bhikkhus are to rebuke him up to three times so as to desist. If while being 
rebuked up to three times he desists, that is good. If he does not desist, it 
entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</P></FONT>

(his kathina privileges are in abeyance): If he dwells apart from (any of) his 
three robes even for one night -- unless authorized by the Bhikkhus -- it is to 
be forfeited and confessed.</P><B>
<P>3.</B> When a Bhikkhu has finished his robe-making and the kathina privileges 
are in abeyance: If out-of-season robe-cloth accrues to him, he may accept it if 
he so desires. Once he accepts it, he is to make it up immediately (into a cloth 
requisite). If it should not be enough, he may lay it aside for a month at most 
if he has an expectation for filling the lack. Should he keep it beyond that, 
even when there is an expectation (for further cloth), it is to be forfeited and 
confessed.</P><B>
<P>4.</B> Should any Bhikkhu have a used robe washed, dyed, or beaten by a 
Bhikkhuni unrelated to him, it is to be forfeited and confessed.</P><B>
<P>5.</B> Should any Bhikkhu accept robe-cloth from a Bhikkhuni unrelated to him 
-- unless it is in exchange -- it is to be forfeited and confessed.</P><B>
<P>6.</B> Should any Bhikkhu ask for robe-cloth from a man or woman householder 
unrelated to him, except at the proper occasion, it is to be forfeited and 
confessed. Here the proper occasion is this: The Bhikkhu뭩 robe has been stolen 
or destroyed. This is the proper occasion in this case.</P><B>
<P>7.</B> If that unrelated man or woman householder presents the Bhikkhu with 
many robes (pieces of robe-cloth), he is to accept at most (enough for) an upper 
and an under robe. If he accepts more than that, it is to be forfeited and 
confessed.</P><B>
<P>8.</B> In case a man or woman householder prepares a robe fund for the sake 
of an unrelated Bhikkhu, thinking. "Having purchased a robe with this robe fund, 
I will supply the Bhikkhu named so-and-so with a robe:" If the Bhikkhu, not 
previously invited, approaching (the householder) should make a stipulation with 
regard to the robe, saying, "It would be good indeed, sir, if you supplied me 
(with a robe), having purchased a robe of such-and-such a sort with this robe 
fund" -- out of a desire for something fine -- it is to be forfeited and 
confessed.</P><B>
<P>9.</B> In case two householders -- men or women -- prepare separate robe 
funds for the sake of a Bhikkhu unrelated to them, thinking, "Having purchased 
separate robes with these separate robe funds of ours, we will supply the 
Bhikkhu named so-and-so with robes": If the Bhikkhu, not previously invited, 
approaching (them) should make a stipulation with regard to the robe, saying, 
"It would be good indeed, sirs, if you supplied me (with a robe), having 
purchased a robe of such-and-such a sort with these separate robe funds, the two 
(funds) together for one (robe)" -- out of a desire for something fine -- it is

<P>10.</B> In case a king, a royal official, a Brahmin or a householder sends a 
robe fund for the sake of a Bhikkhu via a messenger (saying), "Having purchased 
a robe with this robe fund, supply the Bhikkhu named so-and-so with a robe": If 
the messenger, approaching the Bhikkhu, should say, "This is a robe fund being 
delivered for the sake of the venerable one. May the venerable one accept this 
robe fund," then the Bhikkhu is to tell the messenger: "We do not accept robe 
funds, my friend. We accept robes (robe-cloth) as are proper according to 
season."</P>
<P>If the messenger should say to the Bhikkhu, "Does the venerable one have a 
steward?" then, Bhikkhus, if the Bhikkhu desires a robe, he may indicate a 
steward -- either a monastery attendant or a lay follower -- (saying), "That, my 
friend, is the Bhikkhus' steward."</P>
<P>If the messenger, having instructed the steward and going to the Bhikkhu, 
should say, "I have instructed the steward the venerable one indicated. May the 
venerable one go (to him) and he will supply you with a robe in season," then 
the Bhikkhu, desiring a robe and approaching the steward, may prompt and remind 
him two or three times, "I have need of a robe." Should (the steward) produce 
the robe after being prompted and reminded two or three times that is good.</P>
<P>If he does not produce the robe, (the Bhikkhu) should stand in silence four 
times, five times, six times at most for that purpose. Should (the steward) 
produce the robe after (the Bhikkhu) has stood in silence for the purpose four, 
five, six times at most, that is good.</P>
<P>If he should not produce the robe (at that point), should he then produce the 
robe after (the Bhikkhu) has endeavored further than that, it is to be forfeited 
and confessed.</P>
<P>If he should not produce (the robe), then the Bhikkhu himself should go to 
the place from which the robe fund was brought, or a messenger should be sent 
(to say), "The robe fund that you, venerable sirs, sent for the sake of the 
Bhikkhu has given no benefit to the Bhikkhu at all. May the you be united with 
what is yours. May what is yours not be lost." This is the proper course 
here.</P>

face="Book Antiqua">
<P>1.</FONT></B><FONT face="Book Antiqua"> <I>A verdict "in the presence of" 
should be given.</I> This means that the formal act settling the issue must be 
carried out in the presence of the Community, in the presence of the 
individuals, and in the presence of the Dhamma and Vinaya.</P><B>
<P>2.</B> <I>A verdict of mindfulness may be given.</I> This is the verdict of 
innocence given in an accusation, based on the fact that the accused remembers 
fully that he did not commit the offense in question.</P><B>
<P>3.</B> <I>A verdict of past insanity may be given.</I> This is another 
verdict of innocence given in an accusation, based on the fact that the accused 
was out of his mind when he committed the offense in question and so is absolved 
of any responsibility for it.</P><B>
<P>4.</B> <I>Acting in accordance with what is admitted.</I> This refers to the 
ordinary confession of offenses, where no formal interrogation is involved. The 
confession is valid only if in accord with the facts, e.g., a Bhikkhu actually 
commits a pacittiya offense and then confesses it as such, and not as a stronger 
or lesser offense. If he were to confess it as a dukkata or a sanghadisesa, that 
would be invalid.</P><B>
<P>5.</B> <I>Acting in accordance with the majority.</I> This refers to cases in 
which Bhikkhus are unable to settle a dispute unanimously, even after all the 
proper procedures are followed, and -- in the words of the Canon -- are 
"wounding one another with weapons of the tongue." In cases such as these, 
decisions can be made by majority vote.</P><B>
<P>6.</B> <I>Acting in accordance with the accused's further misconduct.</I> 
This refers to cases where a Bhikkhu admits to having committed the offense in 
question only after being formally interrogated about it. He is then to be 
reproved for his actions, made to remember the offense and to confess it, after 
which the Community carries out a formal act of "further misconduct" against him 
as an added punishment for being so uncooperative as to require the formal 
interrogation in the first place.</P><B>
<P>7.</B> <I>Covering over as with grass.</I> This refers to situations in which 
both sides of a dispute realize that, in the course of their dispute, they have 
done much that is unworthy of a contemplative. If they were to deal with one 
another for their offenses, the only result would be greater divisiveness. Thus 
if both sides agree, all the Bhikkhus gather in one place. (According to the 
Commentary, this means that all Bhikkhus in the <I>sima</I> must attend. No one 
should send his consent, and even sick Bhikkhus must go.) A motion is made to 
the entire group that this procedure will be followed. One member of each side 
then makes a formal motion to the members of his faction that he will make a 
confession for them. When both sides are ready, the representative of each side 
addresses the entire group and makes the blanket confession, using the form of a 
motion and one announcement (<I>natti-dutiya-kamma</I>).</P></FONT><!--mstheme--></FONT></BODY></HTML>
