<P>001.01. I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery 
offered by Anathapindika in Jeta's grove in Savatthi. The Blessed One addressed

<P>001.07. Bhikkhus, sentient beings dally much in sensuality. Bhikkhus, a 
clansman thoroughly burnt by sensuality turns away from home and becomes 
homeless. True to the words such a one has gone forth, through faith. What is 
the reason? When young, people gain sensual pleasures in one or another manner. 
There is sensual pleasure, which is low, middling and exalted. All this goes as 
sensuality. Just as a toddler owing to some negligence of the wet nurse would 
put a stick or a pebble in his mouth the wet nurse quickly thinking about it 
would take it out. If not possible to be taken out, the wet nurse would hold the 
toddler's head with the left hand and put a finger of the right hand into his 
mouth and would pull out the object together with blood. What is the reason? She 
knows its danger and does it out of compassion for the toddler. When he has 
grown up and also grown wise, he would suitably protect himself diligently, not 
needing a wet nurse any more. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in the same manner, so long as the bhikkhu does not engage in 
meritorious things based on faith, shame, remorse, effort and wisdom, he has to 
be protected by me. When the bhikkhu is engaged in meritorious things based on 
faith, shame, remorse, effort and wisdom, he does not need my protection any 
more. Thus he becomes a bhikkhu. It is not possible that the self protected 
bhikkhu should be negligent. </P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>
