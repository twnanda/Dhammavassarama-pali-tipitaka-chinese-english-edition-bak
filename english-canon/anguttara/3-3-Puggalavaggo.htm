<P>1. Saviññhasuttaü-Venerable Saviññha</P>
<P>21. At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by 
Anathapindika in Jeta's grove in Savatthi. Then venerable Saviññha and venerable 
Mahakoññhita approached venerable Sariputta, exchanged friendly greetings and 
sat on a side. Then venerable Sariputta said to venerable Saviññha:- Friend, 
Saviññha, three kinds of persons are evident in the world. What three? The body 
witness, the one come to righteousness of view and the one released through 
faith. Of these three persons which person is excellent and more pleasing to 
you?</P>
<P>Friend, Sariputta, of these three, such as the body witness, the one come to 
righteousness of view and the one released through faith, that one released 
through faith is more pleasing to me as his faculty of faith is much developed. 
</P>
<P>Then venerable Sariputta said to venerable Mahakoññhita:- Friend, Koññhita, 
three kinds of persons are evident in the world. What three? The body witness, 
the one come to righteousness of view and the one released through faith. Of 
these three persons which person is more pleasing to you?</P>
<P>Friend, Sariputta, of these three, such as the body witness, the one come to 
righteousness of view and the one released through faith, the body witness is 
more pleasing to me as his faculty of concentration is much developed. </P>
<P>Then venerable Mahkoññhita said to venerable Sariputta:- Friend, Sàriputta, 
three kinds of persons are evident in the world. What three? The body witness, 
the one come to righteousness of view and the one released through faith. Of 
these three persons which person is more pleasing to you?</P>
<P>Friend, Mahkoññhita, of these three, such as the body witness, the one come 
to righteousness of view and the one released through faith, the one come to 
righteousness of view is more pleasing to me as his faculty of wisdom is much 
developed. </P>
<P>Then venerable Sariputta said thus to venerable Saviññha and venerable 
Mahakoññhita:- Friends, we have each declared this according to our individual 
understandings. Now let us approach the Blessed One and ask, as to which is the 
excellent and most pleasing. </P>
<P>Venerable Sariputta, venerable Saviññha and venerable Mahakoññhita approached 
the Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side and venerable Sariputta related 
all the conversation that took place between himself, venerable Saviññha and 
venerable Mahakoññhita. </P>
<P>The Blessed One said:- Sariputta, it cannot be stated easily, of these three 
persons, which one is more pleasing and excellent. It can be stated that when 
the one released through faith has come to the path of worthiness. The body 
witness and the one come righteousness of view are either to return to this 
world or not return.</P>
<P>Sariputta, it cannot be stated easily, of these three persons, which one is 
more pleasing and excellent. It can be stated that when the body witness has 
come to the path of worthiness. the one released through faith and the one come 
to righteousness of view are either to return to this world once or not return.. 
</P>
<P>Sariputta, it cannot be stated easily, of these three persons, which one is 
more pleasing and excellent. It can be stated that when the one come to 
righteousness of view, has come to the path of worthiness. The body witness and 
the one released through faith are either to return to this world once or not 
return. </P>
<P>&nbsp;2. Gilànasuttaü-Sick persons</P>
<P>22. Bhikkhus, these three sick persons are evident in the world. What three? 
A certain sick person, whether he gains or does not gain suitable food, medicine 
and a suitable attendant, he does not recover from that illness. </P>
<P>The second sick person, whether he gains or does not gain suitable food, 
medicine and a suitable attendant, he recovers from that illness. </P>
<P>The third sick person gains not that he does not gain, suitable food, 
medicine and a suitable attendant and he recovers from that illness. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, on account of this sick person, who gains not that he does not 
gain, suitable food, medicine and a suitable attendant and recovers from that 
illness, I grant the supplication of suitable food, medicine and a suitable 
attendant for the sick. Bhikkhus, on account of this sick person other sick 
persons should be attended to. These three sick persons are evident in the 
world. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in the same manner there are three persons in the world comparable 
to these three sick persons. Which three? </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, a certain person whether he gains sight of the Thus Gone One or 
does not gain sight of the Thus Gone One, whether he hears the Teaching and 
Discipline of the Thus Gone One or does not hear it, he does not enter the right 
path to become proficient in meritorious thoughts..</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the second person whether he gains sight of the Thus Gone One or 
does not gain sight of the Thus Gone One, whether he hears the Teaching and 
Discipline of the Thus Gone One or does not hear it, he enters the right path to 
become proficient in meritorious thoughts. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the third person gains sight of the Thus Gone One, not that he does 
not gain sight of the Thus Gone One. Hears the Teaching and Discipline of the 
Thus Gone One, not that he does not hear it, and enters the right path to become 
proficient in meritorious thoughts. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it is on account of this person, who gains sight of the Thus Gone 
One, not that he does not gain sight of the Thus Gone One, hears the Teaching 
and Discipline of the Thus Gone One, not that he does not hear it, and enters 
the right path to become proficient in meritorious thoughts, that I grant the 
Teaching should be given. Bhikkhus on account of this person, others also should 
be taught. These three persons are evident in the world. </P>
<P>3. Sankhàarasuttàm.-Cooks trouble</P>
<P>23. Bhikkhus, these three persons are evident in the world. What three? The 
person who cooks up troublesome bodily, verbal and mental dispositions and is 
born in a troublesome world and there, touched by troublesome feelings, feels 
only unpleasant, like beings born in hell. </P>
<P>The person who cooks up non-troublesome bodily, verbal and mental 
dispositions and is born in a non-troublesome world and there, touched by 
non-troublesome feelings, feels only pleasant, like beings born in heaven. </P>
<P>The person who cooks up troublesome and non-troublesome bodily, verbal and 
mental dispositions and is born in a troublesome and non-troublesome world and 
there, touched by troublesome and non-troublesome feelings, feels unpleasant and 
pleasant, like humans, sometimes heavenly and sometimes hellish. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these three persons are evident in the world. </P>
<P>4. Bahukàrasuttaü-Has done much</P>
<P>24. Bhikkhus, these three persons have done much to a person. Which three? 
Bhikkhus, the person gone to whom this person takes refuge in the Enlightenment, 
in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. . </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the person gone to whom this person knows as it really is, this is 
unpleasant, this is the arising of unpleasantness, this is the cessation of 
unpleasantness and this is the path leading to the cessation of unpleasantness. 
</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the person gone to whom, this person destroys desires, 
releases the mind and released through wisdom, here and now abides having 
realized. Bhikkhus, these three persons have done much to this person. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it is not possible that these three persons could be thoroughly 
repaid with gratitude, by this person revering him, attending on him, clasping 
hands towards him and honouring him with robes, morsel food, dwellings and 
medicinal requisites.</P>
<P>&nbsp;5. Vajråpamasuttaü-Comparable to a diamond. </P>
<P>25. Bhikkhus, these three persons are evident in the world. What three? The 
person whose mind is comparable to a sore, the person whose mind is comparable 
to lightning and the person whose mind is comparable to a diamond. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, who is the person with a mind comparable to a sore? Bhikkhus, a 
certain person is angry and has grudges. When a few words are told he becomes 
angry, swears and retorts angrily showing anger and displeasure, like a festered 
sore touched by a clod or stone would ooze much pus. Bhikkhus, in like manner a 
person with a mind comparable to a sore is angry, has grudges and when a few 
words are told he becomes angry, swears and retorts angrily showing anger and 
displeasure. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, who is the person with a mind comparable to lightning? Bhikkhus, a 
certain person knows, as it really is, this is unpleasant, this is the arising 
of unpleasantness, this is its cessation and this is the path leading to the 
cessation of unpleasantness. Just as a man would see forms in pitch darkness 
when there is lightning. In the same manner a certain person knows as it really 
is, this is unpleasant, this is the arising of unpleasantness, this is the 
cessation of unpleasantness and this is the path leading to the cessation of 
unpleasantness. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, who is the person with a mind comparable to a diamond? Bhikkhus, a 
certain person having destroyed desires, the mind released and released through 
wisdom abides here and now by himself realizing. Bhikkhus, just as there is 
nothing that a diamond would not cut, a gem or a stone. In the same manner a 
certain person having destroyed desires, the mind released and released through 
wisdom, abides here and now by himself realizing. Bhikkhus, these three persons 
are evident in the world. </P>
<P>&nbsp;6. Sevitabbasuttaü- Should be associated</P>
<P>26. Bhikkhus, these three persons are evident in the world. What three? 
Bhikkhus, there is a person that should not be associated, there is one that 
should be associated and there is another that should be honoured and revered 
and associated. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, who is the person that should not be associated? Bhikkhus, a 
certain person is below par in virtues, concentration and wisdom. Such should 
not be associated unless out of sympathy and compassion.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, who is the person that should be associated? Bhikkhus, a certain 
person is par in virtues, concentration and wisdom. Such should be associated. 
What is the reason? Those par in virtues converse on virtues, those par in 
concentration converse on concentration and those par in wisdom converse on 
wisdom. For them it becomes a pleasant abiding, therefore they should be 
associated. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, who is the person that should be honoured, revered and associated? 
Bhikkhus, a certain person is much above in virtues, concentration and wisdom. 
Such should be honoured, revered and associated. What is the reason? I will 
complete virtues not yet completed, will be satisfied seeing my completed 
virtues, then and there. I will complete my wisdom not yet completed and I will 
wisely see whether it is complete Therefore, bhikkhus, such persons should be 
honoured, revered and associated. Bhikkhus, these three persons are evident in 
the world. </P>
<P>Associating someone low is deterioration,</P>
<P>Associating an equal there's no deterioration</P>
<P>Therefore bend down to a superior, </P>
<P>It is quick growth. </P>
<P>7. Jigucchitabbasuttaü- Should be loathed</P>
<P>27.Bhikkhus, these three persons are evident in the world. Which three? A 
certain person should be loathed, should not be associated. The second should be 
looked after not associated and the third should be associated. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, which person should be loathed and not associated. Here a certain 
person is unvirtuous, with evil thoughts like rubbish, with secret actions, with 
only a promise to recluseship, festering inside and filth oozing out. Bhikkhus, 
this kind of person should be loathed, should not be associated. What is the 
reason? In some way if this person is not imitated, ill fame spreads, this is an 
evil friend, an associate of evil. Just as a serpent with excreta on its body 
would not sting anyone, for he smears excreta. In the same manner an unvirtuous 
person with evil thoughts similar to rubbish, with secret actions, with only a 
promise to recluseship, festering inside and filth oozing out should be loathed, 
should not be associated. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what kind of person should be carefully watched, not associated? 
Bhikkhus, a certain person is angry and has grudges. When a few words are told 
he becomes angry swears and retorts angrily showing anger and displeasure, like 
a festered sore touched by a clod or stone would ooze much pus. Or like a heap 
of rotting food in a monastery when hit with a clod or stone would give a 
hissing sound. Or like a heap of excreta when hit with a clod or stone would 
give an evil smell Bhikkhus, in like manner a person with a mind comparable to a 
sore is angry, has grudges and when a few words are told he becomes angry, 
swears and retorts angrily showing anger and displeasure. Bhikkhus, this person 
should be carefully watched, not associated. What is the reason? He may scold 
me, rebuke me and do me some harm. Therefore this person should be carefully 
watched, not associated. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what kind of person should be closely associated? Here a certain 
person is virtuous, with good behaviour. Such a person should be associated 
closely. What is the reason? If for some reason this person is imitated, good 
fame spreads. He is a good friend, behaves well. Such a person should be 
associated. These three persons are evident in the world. </P>
<P>. . . </P>
<P>Associating someone low is deterioration,</P>
<P>Associating an equal there's no deterioration</P>
<P>Therefore bend down to a superior, </P>
<P>It is quick growth.</P>
<P>&nbsp;8. Gåtabhànisuttam. -Foul speech</P>
<P>28. Bhikkhus, these three persons are evident in the world. What three? The 
person who has foul speech, the person who speaks the truth and the person who 
has pleasant speech. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, who is the person with foul speech? A certain person gone to a 
gathering, in the midst of relations, associates or in the presence of an 
eminent person, when asked to witness, not knowing says, I know and knowing says 
I do not know. Not seeing, says I saw and seeing says I did not see. Aware it's 
a lie, he tells lies for some small gain, for another's cause or some material 
gain. This is a man with foul speech.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, who is the person who speaks the truth? A certain person gone to a 
gathering, in the midst of relations, associates or in the presence of an 
eminent person, when asked to witness, not knowing says, I do not know and 
knowing says I know. Not seeing, says I did not see and seeing says I saw. Aware 
it's a lie, he does not tell lies for some small gain, for another's cause or 
some material gain. This is the person who speaks the truth..</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, who is the person who has pleasant speech? Here, a certain person 
giving up rough speech, abstains from it. He speaks words that are polite and 
pleasing to the ears, words that are entertained by the populace at large. This 
is the person with pleasant speech. These three persons are evident in the 
world. </P>
<P>9 Andhasuttaü </P>
<P>29. Bhikkhus, these three persons are evident in the world. What three? The 
blind man, the man with one unimpaired eye and the man with unimpaired eyes. 
Bhikkhus, who is the blind man? Bhikkhus, this person is not clever to acquire 
wealth that is not acquired and to prosper on wealth already acquired He is 
blind to it. Further he hasn't the eye to know merit and demerit, the fault and 
non fault, the non-exalted and exalted and the counterparts of purity and 
impurity. This is the blind man Bhikkhus who is the man with one unimpaired eye?

Bhikkhus, these three persons are evident in the world. </P>
<P>Both throws being unlucky, the blind do not have wealth and do not accrue 
merit, </P>
<P>The man with one unimpaired eye begets wealth righteously or otherwise </P>
<P>By theft, telling lies or cheating, the clever young man accumulates wealth 
</P>
<P>Partaking sensual pleasures comes to unpleasantness.</P>
<P>The man with one unimpaired eye goes to hell and wails.</P>
<P>The man with both eyes unimpaired is the best, </P>
<P>With wealth rightfully acquired, he rises with the Teaching</P>
<P>He gives with a pure mind and attains the non grieving state</P>
<P>Keep away from the blind and those with one eye unimpaired</P>
<P>Associate the man with unimpaired eyes. Of the three he is the best. </P>

bhikkhus in the monastery. The bhikkhus declare to him the Teaching good at the 
beginning, in the middle and the end, full of meaning even in the words and 
letters complete and pure.</P>
<P>Seated in his seat he does not attend to the beginning, the middle or the end 
of that talk. Getting up from his seat, he does not recall the beginning, the 
middle or the end of that talk. Like a vessel turned upside down would not hold 
any water poured to it. Bhikkhus, in the same manner, a certain person 
constantly goes to the presence of the bhikkhus in the monastery. The bhikkhus 
declare to him the Teaching good at the beginning, in the middle and the end, 
full of meaning even in the words and letters complete and pure Seated in his

Getting up from his seat, he does not recall the beginning, the middle or the 
end of that talk Bhikkhus, this is the person with wisdom turned upside down. 
</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, who is the person with wisdom on the lap? </P>

bhikkhus in the monastery. The bhikkhus declare to him the Teaching good at the 
beginning, in the middle and the end, full of meaning even in the words and 
letters complete and pure </P>
<P>Seated in his seat he attends to the beginning, the middle and the end of 
that talk. Getting up from his seat, he does not recall the beginning, the 
middle or the end of that talk. Like a person's lap, where various kinds of 
eatables are amassed, such as sesame, rice, sweet meats and jujube fruit. 
Getting up from that seat without mindfulness, he throws that food here and 
there. Bhikkhus, in the same manner, a certain person constantly goes to the 
presence of the bhikkhus in the monastery. The bhikkhus declare to him the 
Teaching good at the beginning, in the middle and the end, full of meaning even 
in the words and letters complete and pure. Seated in his seat he attends to the

talk. Getting up from his seat, he recalls the beginning, the middle or the end

<P>Constantly goes to the presence of the bhikkhus,</P>
<P>But does not learn the beginning, the middle or the end</P>
<P>Lacking in wisdom, he cannot learn.</P>
<P>The one whose wisdom is on the lap is better </P>
<P>Seated he learns the beginning, the middle and the end,</P>
<P>Getting up from his seat, he becomes confused and forgets</P>
<P>The one with wide wisdom is the best</P>
