<P>167. On that full moon day the Brahmin Janussoni having bathed and dressed in 
a suit of linen cloth , with some freshly plucked grass in his fist, was 
standing close to The Blessed One. The Blessed One saw the Brahmin Janussoni 
bathed and dressed in a suit of linen cloth, with some freshly plucked grass in 
his fist standing close to him, and said:-</P>
<P>ßBrahmin, on this full moon day, having bathed and dressed in a suit of linen 
cloth and with some freshly plucked grass in your hand, why do you stand here? 
What is the significance of the day to the Brahmin clans? </P>
<P>ßGood Gotama, today is the day of going down to the holy fire, for the 
Brahmin clans. </P>
<P>ßHow do the Brahmins observe the day of going down to the holy fire? </P>
<P>ßHere, good Gotama, on the full moon day, the Brahmins bathe and dress in a 
suit of linen cloth, rub wet cowdung on the ground, spread some grass on the 
ground and lie on the grass at the right time inside the fire house. During that 
night they get up three times and worship the fire with clasped hands saying: 
`Good one, we worship you!' They feed the fire with much ghee, oil and butter. 
At the end of that night they feed the Brahmins with nourishing eatables and 
drinks. Good Gotama, this is the ceremony of going down to the holy fire, done 
by the Brahmins. </P>
<P>ß Brahmin, going down to the holy fire in the noble ones' discipline is 
something different from this. </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, what is, going down to the holy fire in the noble ones' 
discipline? It is good if I be taught the going down to the holy fire in the 
noble ones; discipline. </P>
<P>ßThen Brahmin, listen and attend carefully I will tell.</P>
<P>Here, Brahmin, the noble disciple reflects :- </P>
<P>Results for destroying living things is in this very life and also after 
death. Judging carefully he gives up and steps down from destroying living 
things </P>
<P>Results for taking the not given is in this very life and also after death. 
Judging carefully he gives up and steps down from taking the not given.</P>
<P>Results for sexual misbehaviour is in this very life and also after death. 
Judging carefully he gives up and steps down from sexual misbehaviour. </P>
<P>Results for telling lies is in this very life and also after death. Judging 
carefully he gives up and steps down from telling lies. </P>
<P>Results for slandering is in this very life and also after death. Judging 
carefully he gives up and steps down from slandering. </P>
<P>Results for talking roughly is in this very life and also after death. 
Judging carefully he gives up and steps down from talking roughly.</P>
<P>Results for frivolous talk is in this very life and also after death. Judging 
carefully he gives up and steps down from frivolous talk.</P>
<P>Results for coveting is in this very life and also after death. Judging 
carefully he gives up and steps down from coveting.</P>
<P>Results for hatred is in this very life and also after death. Judging 
carefully he gives up and steps down from hating. </P>
<P>Results for wrong view is in this very life and also after death. Judging 
carefully he gives up and steps down from wrong view. </P>
<P>ßGood Gotama, attending to the holy fire in the discipline of the noble ones 
is different from the Brahmins' attending the holy fire. The Brahmins' attending 
to the holy fire is not worth one sixteenth part to attending to the holy fire 
in the discipline of the noble ones. Good Gotama, now I undersstand,....re.... 
bear me as a lay disciple who has taken refuge from today until life lasts.

<P>176. I heard thus. At one time The Blessed One was abiding in Pava in 
Cundakammaraputta's mango orchard. Then Cundakammaraputta approached The Blessed 
One, worshipped and sat on a side. The Blessed One said to him:- ßCunda, how do 
you give your consent to the purification? </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, the Brahmins face the west, with the water spout in hand, 
wearing special garlands attend to the holy fire, then descend the water and 
give the consent for the purification Here I am one who has given the consent 
for the purification. </P>
<P>ßCunda, how do the Brahmins face the west, with the water spout in the hand, 
wearing special garlands attend to the holy fire descend the water and appoint 
the purification? </P>
<P>ßHere, venerable sir, the Brahmins face the west, with the water spout in the 
hand, wearing special garlands attend to the holy fire descend the water and 
instruct the disciples:- `Come good ones, get up early in the morning sweep the 
floor. If you do not sweep the floor, smear some wet cowdung on the floor. If 
you do not smear some wet cowdung, spread some green grass on the ground. If you 
do not spread some green grass on the ground, attend to the fire. If you do not 
attend to the fire, worship the sun with clasped hands. If you do not worship 
the sun with clasped hands, descend to the water up to the third time. Thus 
venerable sir, the Brahmins appoint the purification by turning to the west, 
taking the water spout in the hand, wearing garlands of special 
flowers,attending to the fire, worshipping the sun with clasped hands and 
descending to water and I have got their consent for the purification. </P>
<P>ßCunda, the purification in the discipline of the noble ones is different 
from the Brahmins' purifiaction, such as turning to the west, taking the water 
spout in the hand, wearing garlands of special flowers, attending to the fire 
and descending to water. </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, how is the purification in the discipline of the noble ones. 
It is suitable that I should be taught the purification in the discipline of the 
noble ones. </P>
<P>ßThen Cunda, listen and attend carefully.:-Cunda, there comes bodily impurity 
in three ways. Verbal impurity in four ways and mental impurity in three 
ways.</P>
<P>Cunda, what are the three ways of bodily impurity? </P>
<P>Here, Cunda, a certain one destroys living things, is cruel with bloody 
hands, is engaged in destruction, without compassion for any living thing. </P>

no spontaneously arisen beings. In this world there are no recluses and 
Brahmins, who have come to the right path have realized this world and the other 
world by themselves and declare it. Thus Cunda, there is impurity of the mind in 
three ways. </P>
