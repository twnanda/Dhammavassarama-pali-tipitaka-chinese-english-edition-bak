various sceptical doubts.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, how is the bhikkhu with various desires appeased? </P>

the roots, made a thing that would not rise in the future'. `My hate is 
dispelled, pulled out with the roots, made a thing that would not rise in the 
future'. `My delusion is dispelled, pulled out with the roots, made a thing that 
would not rise in the future' Thus the bhikkhu is thoroughly released with 
wisdom.</P>

noble abidings. Whoever noble ones will be in the future, all of them will abide 
in these ten noble abidings. Whoever noble ones there are at present, all of 
them abide in these ten noble abidings. Bhikkhus, these ten are the abiding in
