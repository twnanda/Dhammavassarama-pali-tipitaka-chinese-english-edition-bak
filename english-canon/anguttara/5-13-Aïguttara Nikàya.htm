Great forest in Vesali. The Blessed One getting up from his seclusion in the 
evening approached the hall for the ailing. There The Blessed One saw a certain 
bhikkhu weak and ailing and sat on the prepared seat and addressed the 
bhikkhus:- </P>

this:- Before long he will destroy desires and releasing the mind and released 
through wisdom, will abide here and now having realized. What five?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu abides seeing loathsomeness in the body, seeing 
loathsomeness in food, with disenchantment for all the world, seeing 
impermanence in all determinations and the perception of death thoroughly 
established in him Bhikkhus, a weak, ailing bhikkhu not forsaking these five 
things could expect this:- Before long he will destroy desires and releasing the
