<P>001.01. I heard thus. At one time The Blessed One was living in the monastery 
offered by Anathapindika in Jeta's grove in Savatthi. The Blessed One addressed 
the bhikkhus: </P>
<P>ßBhikkhus, if wandering ascetics of other sects ask you, friends by what 
means should factors associated with enlightenment be developed, how would you 
explain it? ßVenerable sir, The Blessed One is the origin of the Teaching 
....re..... the bhikkhus will bear it in mind hearing it from The Blessed One." 
</P>
<P>ßThen bhikkhus, listen carefully and attend, I will tell. Bhikkhus, if 
wandering ascetics of other sects ask you, friends by what means should factors 
associated with enlightenment be developed, you should explain it thus:</P>
<P>Here, friends, the bhikkhu becomes a spiritual friend, with good association 
and good friendship. This is the first means of developing factors associated 
with enlightenment </P>
<P>Again, friends, the bhikkhu becomes virtuous restrained in the higher code of 
rules, observing the rules, conducts himself seeing fear in the slightest fault. 
This is the second means of developing factors associated with enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>Again, friends, the bhikkhu becomes a quick and easy gainer for nothing of 
such talk about austere penances, providing explanations of the mind's 
activities such as wanting little, satisfaction, seclusion, not wanting company, 
arousing effort, talk about virtues, concentration, wisdom, release and talk 
about knowledge and vision of release This is the third means of developing 
factors associated with enlightenment </P>
<P>.Again, friends, the bhikkhu abides with aroused effort, to dispel 
demeritorious things and to amass meritorious things with the firm endeavour of 
not giving up the main aim in meritorious things. This is the fourth means of 
developing factors associated with enlightenment </P>
<P>Again, friends, the bhikkhu becomes wise endowed with wisdom about the rising 
and fading nature of the five holding masses for the noble penetration to 
rightfully end unpleasantness. This is the fifth means of developing factors 
associated with enlightenment. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, from a spiritual friend; a good association and good friendship is 
desirable to the bhikkhu, to become virtuous restrained in the higher code of 
rules, to conduct himself observing the rules, seeing fear in the slightest 
fault. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, from a spiritual friend; a good association and good friendship is

desirable to the bhikkhu to become wise, endowed with wisdom about the rising

<P>Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu established in these five things should further develop 
four things. -to dispel greed loathing should be developed, to dispel anger 
lovingkindness should be developed, to cut up thoughts, in and out breathing 
should be developed, to root out the measuring `I be', the perception of 
impermanence should be developed. Bhikkhus, to one developed in the perception 
of impermanence, the perception of no self gets established. One with the 
perception of no-self completely destroys the perception `I be' and here and now 
enjoys extinction. </P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>
<P align=center>2. Nissayasuttaü- Supportive condition.</P></B></FONT><FONT 
face=Times_CSX+>
<P>001.02. Then a certain bhikkhu approached The Blessed One, ....re..... sat on 
a side and said: </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, it is said, is endowed with supportive conditions. How far is 
a bhikkhu endowed with supportive conditions?"</P>
<P>ßBhikkhu, the bhikkhu supported by faith too, dispels demerit and develops 
merit, by that his demerit gets dispelled. Bhikkhu, the bhikkhu supported by 
shame too,...re...remorse too, ...re....effort too, ....re...wisdom too, he 
thoroughly dispels demerit as he dispels seeing with the noble one's wisdom and 
dispels</P>
<P>Bhikkhu, the bhikkhu established in these five things should abide supported 
on four things. What four? </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhu, the bhikkhu discriminating pursues a certain thing, 
discriminating patiently bears a certain thing, discriminating avoids a certain 
thing and discriminating drives out a certain thing. Bhikkhu, thus the bhikkhu 
is endowed with the supportive conditions.</P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+

<P>001.03. At one time The Blessed One was living on the Calika rock in Calika. 
At that time venerable Meghiya attended on The Blessed One. Then venerable 
Meghiya approached The Blessed One, worshipped, stood on a side and said: 
"Venerable sir, I desire to go to my native village for the alms round"</P>
<P>ßMeghiya, do as you think is fit."</P>
<P>Then venerable Meghiya putting on robes in the morning taking bowl and robes 
went the alms round in his native village, returning from the alms round and 
after the meal was over he approached the bank of river Kimikala. Wandering up 
and down the bank of river Kimikala, he came to a pleasant mango orchard and it 
occurred to him: This mango orchard is pleasant. It is ideal for the son of a 
clansman to make effort. If I get permission from The Blessed One I will come to 
this mango orchard to make effort." </P>
<P>Venerable Meghiya approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and 
said: </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, I put on robes in the morning, took bowl and robes and went 
the alms round in my native village. Returning from the alms round and after the 
meal was over I approached the bank of river Kimikala. Wandering up and down the 
bank of river Kimikala, I came to a pleasant mango orchard and it occurred to 
him: This mango orchard is pleasant. It is ideal for the son of a clansman to 
make effort. If I get permission from The Blessed One I will come to this mango 
orchard to make effort."</P>
<P>The Blessed One said: ßMeghiya, wait! I am by myself, wait until another 
bhikkhu comes"</P>
<P>For the second time venerable Meghiya said to The Blessed One: ßVenerable 
sir, The Blessed One has nothing more to do. As for me, there is something more 
for me to do. There is something more, left for me to do. If The Blessed One 
grants me permission, I will go to the mango orchard for making effort." 
ßMeghiya, wait! I am by myself, wait until another bhikkhu comes"</P>
<P>For the third time venerable Meghiya said to The Blessed One: ßVenerable sir, 
The Blessed One has nothing more to do. As for me, there is something more, for 
me to do. There is something more, left for me to do. If The Blessed One grants 
me permission, I will go to the mango orchard to make effort."</P>
<P>ßMeghiya, when you say it's to make effort, what shall I say! Do as you think 
is fitting."</P>
<P>Then venerable Meghiya getting up from his seat worshipped and 
circumambulated The Blessed One, and approached and entered the mango orchard, 
and sat under a certain tree to spend the day. When venerable Meghiya was 
abiding in that mango orchard, three evil demeritorious thoughts assailed him 
constantly, such as sensual thoughts, angry thoughts and hurtful thoughts. Then 
it occurred to venerable Meghiya: `It is wonderful and surprising I left home 
and became homeless out of faith. Yet am beset by these evil demeritorious 
thoughts of sensuality, anger and hurtfulness" </P>
<P>Venerable Meghiya approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and

evil demeritorious thoughts of sensuality, anger and hurtfulness.'" </P>
<P>ßMeghiya, it is immaturity. The maturity of five things lead to the release 
of mind. What five? Here, Meghiya the bhikkhu becomes a spiritual friend, a good 
associate with good friendship. Meghiya, for the mind, immature for release this 
is the first thing leading to maturity. </P>
<P>Again, Meghiya, the bhikkhu becomes virtuous restrained in the higher code of 
rules, conducting himself, seeing fear in the slightest fault he observes the 
rules. Meghiya, for the mind, immature for release this is the second thing 
leading to maturity. . . </P>
<P>Again, Meghiya, the bhikkhu becomes a quick and easy gainer for nothing of

<P>001.04. At one time The Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by 
Anathapindika in Jeta's grove in Savatthi. At that time venerable Nandaka was in 
the attendance hall advising, inciting and making the hearts light of the 
bhikkhus, with a talk. The Blessed One having got up from his seclusion in the 
evening, approached the attendance hall and stood waiting outside, until the 
talk ended. The Blessed One knowing that the talk ended, clearing his throat, 
knocked on the door. The bhikkhus opened the door to The Blessed One. </P>
<P>The Blessed One entered the attendance hall, sat on the prepared seat and 
addressed venerable Nandaka: ßNandaka your disposition was a long address to the 
bhikkhus. My back ached standing outside until the end of the disposition." </P>
<P>When this was said venerable Nandaka in an antaganized tone said: ßVenerable 
sir, we did not know that The Blessed One was standing outside. If we knew that 
The Blessed One was standing outside, we would not have said so much."</P>
<P>The Blessed One knowing that venerable Nandaka was antagonized said: Nandaka, 
it is good! Sons of clansmen like you who have left home and have become 
homeless, should sit with a righteous talk, as you have done. Nandaka, for those 
who have come together, there are two things to do. Either a talk on 
righteousness or observe noble silence. Nandaka the bhikkhu has faith and not 
virtues. By that factor he is incomplete. He should be complete in that factor. 
How shall I have faith and virtues. Nandaka, when the bhikkhu has faith and 
virtues, he becomes complete. </P>
<P>Nandaka, when the bhikkhu has faith and virtues, not gained internal 
appeasement, by that factor he is incomplete. He should be complete in that 
factor. How shall I have faith, virtues.and internal appeasement. Nandaka, when 
the bhikkhu has faith, virtues and internal appeasement by that he becomes 
complete. </P>
<P>Nandaka, when the bhikkhu has faith, virtues, gained internal appeasement and 
not gained higher wisdom to penetrate the Teaching by that factor he is 
incomplete. He should be complete in that factor. How shall I have faith, 
virtues. internal appeasement and gain higher widom to penetrate the Teaching. 
Nandaka, when the bhikkhu has faith, virtues internal appeasement and gain 
higher wisdom to penetrate the Teaching by that factor he become complete. 
Nandaka, just as to a fourfooted when one foot is lame, by that factor he 
becomes incomplete. In the same manner when the bhikkhu has faith, virtues, 
gained internal appeasement and not gained higher wisdom to penetrate the 
Teaching by that factor he is incomplete. He should be complete in that factor. 
How shall I have faith, virtues. internal appeasement and gain higher widom to

<P>The Blessed One saying this got up and went into his dwelling. </P>
<P>Soon after The Blessed One had gone venerable Nandaka addressed the bhikkhus: 
ßHere, friends, The Blessed One with four lines declared the complete and pure 
holy life -Nandaka the bhikkhu has faith and not virtues. By that factor he is 
incomplete. He should be complete in that factor. How shall I have faith and

<P>ßFriends, these five are the benefits for listening and discussing the 
Teaching at the right time. What five? </P>
<P>Here, friends, the bhikkhu preaches the Teaching good at the beginning,

good at the beginning, middle and end, full of meanings even in the letters,

<P>001.05. Bhikkhus, these five are powers. What five? </P>
<P>The power of wisdom, the power of effort, the power of non-faultiness and the 
power of collectiveness. Bhikkhus, what is the power of wisdom? </P>
<P>Here bhikkhus, the bhikkhu has wisely recognized and penetrated these things 
that are merit and reckoned as merit, demerit and reckoned as demerit, faulty 
and reckoned as faulty, not faulty and reckoned as not faulty, impure and 
reckoned as impure, pure and reckoned as pure, practiced and reckoned as should 
be practiced, not practiced and reckoned as should not be practiced, not noble 
and reckoned as not noble, noble and reckoned as noble, Bhikkhus, to this is 
called the power of wisdom. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the power of effort?</P>
<P>Here bhikkhus, the bhikkhu arouses interest and effort pursues the mind and 
endeavours to dispel, things that are demerit and reckoned as demerit, faulty 
and reckoned as faulty, impure and reckoned as impure, not practiced and 
reckoned as should not be practiced, not noble and reckoned as not noble and 
arouses interest and effort to pursue the mind and make endeavour to gain, 
things that are merit and reckoned as merit, not faulty and reckoned as not 
faulty, pure and reckoned as pure, practiced and reckoned as should be 
practiced, noble and reckoned as noble Bhikkhus, to this is called the power of 
effort. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the power of non-faultiness?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the noble disciple is endowed with non-faulty bodily, verbal 
and mental action. Bhikkhus, to this is called the power of non-faultiness.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the power of collectiveness? </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these four are the characteristics of sympathy-giving gifts, 
pleasant words, leading an useful life and equality. Bhikkhus, out of giving 
gifts, the foremost is giving gifts of the Teaching. Out of pleasant words the 
foremost is giving the Teaching again and again to those who attend carefully 
until the meaning is attained. Bhikkhus, out of leading an useful life the 
foremost, is establishing those who have, no faith in faith, no virtues in 
virtues, the selfish in benevolence, the lacking in wisdom in wisdom. Bhikkhus, 
out off equality, the foremost is the equality of a stream enterer with a stream 
enterer, once returner with a once returner, non-returner with a non-returner 
and a noble one with a noble one. Bhikkhus, these are the four powers. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the noble disciple endowed with these four powers has overcome five 
fears. What five? The fear of, a livelihood, the lack of virtues, antagonizing 
the gathering, death and an evil birth. The noble disciple reflects: -'I have no 
fears of a livelihood. Why should I have fears of a livelihood? I have these 
four powers of wisdom, effort, non-faultiness and collectiveness. Those lacking 
in wisdom, the lazy, those with faulty bodily, verbal and mental activity, those 
without the power of collectiveness may have fears of a livelihood. I have no 
fears of the lack of virtues....re.... I have no fears of antagonzing the 
gathering...re...I have no fears of death, ....re...I have no fears of an evil 
birth Why should I have fears of an evil birth? I have these four powers of 
wisdom, effort, non-faultiness and collectiveness. Those lacking in wisdom, the 
lazy, those with faulty bodily, verbal and mental activity, those without the 
power of collectiveness may have fears of an evil birth. . </P>

these five fears. </P>

Rajagaha. Then the wandering ascetic Sutava approached The Blessed One, 
exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side and said: </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, at one time The Blessed One was living among the Gijjha peaks 
in Rajagaha and I heard this in the presence of The Blessed One and it was 
accepted by The Blessed One: `Sutava, it is not possible for the bhikkhu who is 
worthy, destroyed desires, lived the holy life, done what should be done, has 
put the load down, have come to the highest good, has destroyed the bond `to 
be', is released rightfully knowing, to go beyond five things- It is not 
possible for the bhikkhu who has destroyed desires, to destroy living things 
knowing, to take the not given with a thievish mind, to enjoy sexual 
intercourse, to say lies knowingly, to partake sensual things accumulating them 
as they have done in a household.' Venerable sir, does The Blessed One recall it 
and remember it completely?"</P>
<P>ßSutava, I recall it and remember it completely, not only earlier, even now I 
tell, Sutava, it is not possible for the bhikkhu who is worthy, destroyed 
desires, lived the holy life, done what should be done, has put the load down, 
have come to the highest good, has destroyed the bond `to be', is released 
rightfully knowing, to go beyond nine things- It is not possible for the bhikkhu 
who has destroyed desires, to destroy living things knowing, to take the not 
given with a thievish mind, to enjoy sexual intercourse, to say lies knowingly, 
to partake sensual things accumulating them as they have done in a household, to 
follow the wrong course of action out of interest, to follow the wrong course of 
action through anger, to follow the wrong course of action through delusion, to 
follow the wrong course of action out of fear. Sutava, earlier and now also I 
tell, it is not possible for the bhikkhu who is worthy, destroyed desires, lived 
the holy life, done what should be done, has put the load down, have come to the 
highest good, has destroyed the bond `to be', is released rightfully knowing, to 
go beyond these nine things. </P>
