den arouses himself, looks in the four directions, roars three times and goes in 
search of food. Bhikkhus, the animals who hear the lion's roar become frightened 
and shivering much - those living in holes enter their holes, those living in 
water, enter the water, those living in the forest enter the forest and birds 
fly away. The king's elephants securely bound in villages and hamlets, break 
their bonds and frightened and shivering, throw urine and excreta and run in all 
directions. Bhikkhus, so powerful is the lion, the king of beasts.</P>

knower of the worlds, the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, the teacher 
of gods and men, enlightened and blessed. He declares the Teaching- This is the 
individual, this its arising, this its cessation and this is the path to the 
cessation of the individual. Bhikkhus, those gods enjoying long life born into 
pleasantness established long, in lofty palaces, they too hearing the Teaching 
become anxious and frightened and think-We being impermanent thought were 
permanent. Not lasting for ever, we thought we would last for ever. We too are 
impermanent, changeful, do not last for ever are an embodiment of an individual. 
. Bhikkhus, the Thus Gone One is so powerful and wields power over the world.

men.</P>

<P>Hearing this, gods enjoying long life, beauty and fame were anxious and 
frightened</P>

Magadha.</P></B></FONT><FONT face=Times_CSX+>
<P>004.05. At one time the Blessed One was living in the squirrels' sanctuary, 
in the bamboo grove in Rajagaha. The Brahmin Vassakara the chief minister of 
Magadha approached the Blessed One exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side 
and said to the Blessed One:- Good Gotama, endowed with four things we disclose 
a great wise man. What four?</P>
<P>Here, Good Gotama, he is learned. His words indicate the meanings of whatever 
he learned and retained. He is mindfull, remembers and recalls things done and 
said long ago. He is clever and not lazy in the work of a layman and knows the 
method to do them and superintend them in the correct way. Good Gotama, endowed 
with these four things we disclose a great wise man. If my words are appreciated 
may that be so, if they are blamed, may good Gotama blame them.</P>
<P>Brahmin, I neither appreciate your words nor blame them. Brahmin, I disclose 
the great wise man endowed with these four things. What four?</P>
<P>Here, Brahmin, he falls to the method, for the good and pleasantness of many, 
establishing many in the noble method, such as building a virtuous character 
with good qualities. He thinks and intends, what he wants to think and intend 
and not what he does not want to think and intend. Thus he becomes the master 
over his thoughts. Of the higher states of the mind, the pleasant abidings here 
and now, he becomes a gainer for nothing, an easy quick gainer. Destroying 
desires, releasing the mind and released through wisdom, here and now he 
realizes and abides. Brahmin, I neither appreciate your words nor blame them. I 
disclose the great wise man endowed with these four things.</P>
<P>It is surprising and wonderful good Gotama, I think good Gotama is endowed 
with these four qualities. Here, good Gotama falls to the method, for the good 
and pleasantness of many, establishing many in the noble method, such as 
building a virtuous character with good qualities. Good Gotama thinks and 
intends, what he wants to think and intend and not what he does not want to 
think and intend. Thus good Gotama becomes the master over his thoughts. Of the 
higher states of the mind, the pleasant abidings here and now, good Gotama 
becomes a gainer for nothing, an easy quick gainer. Destroying desires, 
releasing the mind and released through wisdom, here and now good Gotama 
realizing abides.</P>
<P>Brahmin, you speak words close to praise, yet I will tell you. Here, Brahmin, 
I have fallen to the method, for the good and pleasantness of many, establishing 
many in the noble method, such as building a virtuous character with good 
qualities. I think and intend, what I want to think and intend and not what I do 
not want to think and intend. Thus I am the master over my thoughts. Of the 
higher states of the mind, the pleasant abidings here and now, I am a gainer for 
nothing, an easy quick gainer. Destroying desires, releasing the mind and 
released through wisdom, here and now realizing I abide.</P>
<P>He told the release from the snare of death to all sentient beings,</P>
<P>With compassion for gods and men declared the good method.</P>
<P>The populace is pleased with the seen and the heard,</P>
<P>The Enlightened One clever in the path and non path,</P>
<P>Has done his duties, is without desires, bears the last 
body.</P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>

<P>004.06. At one time the Blessed One left Ukkaññha to go to Setavya and the 
Brahmin Dona too left Ukkaññha for Setavya and both were on the way to Setavya. 
The Brahmin Dona saw the foot prints of the Blessed One with its thousandfold 
spokes, circumferences and naves, complete in every way and it occured to him: 
It is wonderful and surprising, these foot prints are not those of a human.</P>
<P>The Blessed One stepping out of the main road, sat at the root of a certain 
tree, with legs crossed, body straight and mindfulness established in front of 
him. The Brahmin Dona following close after the foot steps of the Blessed One, 
saw the Blessed One seated under a certain tree, pleasant, inspiring confidence 
with appeased mental faculties and appeased mind, with the highest taming and 
appeasement, approached the Blessed One and said:-</P>
<P>Good one are you a god? Brahmin, I am not a god.</P>
<P>Good one are you a celestial musician? Brahmin, I am not a celestial musician 
.</P>
<P>Good one are you a ghost? Brahmin, I am not a ghost</P>
<P>Good one are you a human? Brahmin, I am not a human</P>
<P>When asked good one are you a god, you said Brahmin I am not a god. When 
asked good one are you a celestial musician, you said Brahmin I am not a 
celestial musician. When asked good one are you a ghost, you said Brahmin I am 
not a ghost. When asked good one are you a human, you said Brahmin I am not a 
human. Then what indeed is the good one?</P>
<P>Brahmin, if the desire to be a god was not dispelled I would have become a 
god, it is dispelled, pulled out with the roots, made palm stumps, made things 
that would not arise again. Brahmin, if the desire to be a celestial musician,. 
. . re. . . a ghost,. . . re. . . a human was not dispelled I would have become 
a human, it is dispelled, pulled out with the roots, made palm stumps, made 
things that would not arise again.</P>
<P>Brahmin, blue lotuses, white lotuses or red lotuses, born and developped in 
the water, come out of the water and stand untouched by the water. In the same 
manner Brahmin I born and bred in the world abide above it untouched by the 
world. Brahmin, know I am enlightened.</P>
<P>The desire to be a god, celestial musician, a ghost to go through the 
air,</P>
<P>A human being, or birth in an egg are shattered and destroyed.</P>
<P>As the lotus is not soiled by mud or water, I am not soiled by the world.</P>
<P>Brahmin, I am the Enlightened One.</P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>

to lead the holy life. Thus I put an end to earlier feelings and do not arouse 
new feelings. May it not hinder my light abiding Bhikkhus, thus the bhikkhu 
knows to partake the right amount of food</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, how is the bhikkhu wakeful?</P>

purifies his mind of obstructing things. In the first watch of the night too he 
does the same. In the middle watch of the night he turns to his right side and 
keeping one foot over the other goes to sleep mindfull of the perception of 
rising. In the last watch of the night sitting in a suitable place he purifies 
his mind of obstructing things</P>
