<hr>
"Monks, these six are conditions that are conducive to amiability, that engender feelings of endearment, engender feelings of respect, leading to a sense of fellowship, a lack of disputes, harmony, &amp; a state of unity. Which six?
<p>
"There is the case where a monk is set on bodily acts of good will with regard to his fellows in the holy life, to their faces &amp; behind their backs. This is a condition that is conducive to amiability, that engenders feelings of endearment, engenders feelings of respect, leading to a sense of fellowship, a lack of disputes, harmony, &amp; a state of unity.
<p>
"Furthermore, the monk is set on verbal acts of good will with regard to his fellows in the holy life, to their faces &amp; behind their backs. This is a condition that is conducive to amiability, that engenders feelings of endearment, engenders feelings of respect, leading to a sense of fellowship, a lack of disputes, harmony, &amp; a state of unity.
<p>
"Furthermore, the monk is set on mental acts of good will with regard to his fellows in the holy life, to their faces &amp; behind their backs. This is a condition that is conducive to amiability, that engenders feelings of endearment, engenders feelings of respect, leading to a sense of fellowship, a lack of disputes, harmony, &amp; a state of unity.
<p>
"Furthermore, whatever righteous gains the monk may obtain in a righteous way -- even if only the alms in his bowl -- he does not consume them alone. He consumes them after sharing them in common with his virtuous fellows in the holy life. This is a condition that is conducive to amiability, that engenders feelings of endearment, engenders feelings of respect, leading to a sense of fellowship, a lack of disputes, harmony, &amp; a state of unity.
<p>
"Furthermore -- with reference to the virtues that are untorn, unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered, liberating, praised by the wise, untarnished, leading to concentration -- the monk dwells with his virtue in tune with that of his fellows in the holy life, to their faces &amp; behind their backs. This is a condition that is conducive to amiability, that engenders feelings of endearment, engenders feelings of respect, leading to a sense of fellowship, a lack of disputes, harmony, &amp; a state of unity.
<p>
"Furthermore -- with reference to views that are noble, leading outward, that lead those who act in accordance with them to the right ending of suffering &amp; stress -- the monk dwells with his views in tune with those of his fellows in the holy life, to their faces &amp; behind their backs. This is a condition that is conducive to amiability, that engenders feelings of endearment, engenders feelings of respect, leading to a sense of fellowship, a lack of disputes, harmony, &amp; a state of unity.
<p>
"These are the six conditions that are conducive to amiability, that engender feelings of endearment, engender feelings of respect, leading to a sense of fellowship, a lack of disputes, harmony, &amp; a state of unity."
