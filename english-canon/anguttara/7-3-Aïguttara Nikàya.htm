<P>003.01. I heard thus. At one time the Blesed One was abiding in the Sarandada 
monument in Vesali. Then many Licchavis approached The Blessed One worshipped 
sat on a side and The Blessed One said to the Licchavis : I will teach you seven 
things for non-decrease, listen and attend carefully . The Licchavis agreed and 
The Blessed One said thus</P>
<P>Licchavis. what are the seven things for non-decrease? </P>
<P>As long as the Vajjis constantly come together and meet many times, their 
growth not decrease should be expected. </P>
<P>As long as the Vajjis get together in unity for their activities and dismiss 
in unity, their growth not decrease should be expected. </P>
<P>As long as the Vajjis do not appoint new rules and do not break already 
appointed rules and as long as the ancient laws of the Vajjis are observed, 
their growth not decrease should be expected. </P>
<P>As long as the Vajjis honour, revere and esteem the elder Vajjis and consider 
to listen to them, their growth not decrease should be expected. </P>
<P>As long as the Vajjis do not use force and oppress women and girls of high 
clans to live with them, their growth not decrease should be expected. </P>
<P>As long as the Vajjis worship, esteem and honour the Vajji monuments 
internally and externally giving whatever offerings earlier given without 
disturbing them, their growth not decrease should be expected. </P>
<P>As long as the Vajjis arrange the rightful protection of the worthy ones so 
that those who have not come would come to the kingdom and those who have come 
would abide pleasantly, their growth not decrease should be expected. </P>
<P>Licchavis, as long as these seven non-decreasing things are seen with the 
Licchavis and as long as they are observed by them their growth not decrease 
should be expected.</P>

<P>003.02. I heard thus. At one time The Blessed One was living among the Gijja 
peaks in Rajagaha. At that time king Ajatasattu of Magadha the son of Vedeha was 
to attack the Vajjis. He said. I will destroy the powerful Vajjis, I will put 
them into trouble.</P>
<P>Then king Ajatasattu of Magadha the son of Vedeha addressed the Brahmin 
Vassakara the chief minister of Magadha: Brahmin, approach The Blessed One, in 
my words worship him with your head at his feet and ask whether he has a light 
and pleasant abiding and tell The Blessed One: Venerable sir, king Ajatasattu of 
Magadha, son of Vedeha worships The Blessed One with his head at the feet of the 
Blessed and asks whether The Blessed One abides with few ailments, lives lightly 
and has a pleasant abiding and also tell venerable sir, king Ajatasattu of 
Magadha the son of Vedeha wants to attack the Vajjis. He says. I will destroy 
the powerful Vajjis, I will put them into trouble. To whatever The Blessed One 
says, listen carefully and report it back to me. Thus Gone Ones do not tell 
lies. </P>
<P>Brahmin Vassakara the chief minister of Magadha agreed to do the words of k 
ing Ajatasattu of Magadha and approached The Blessed One, exchanged friendly 
greetings, sat on a side, and said to The Blessed One: Good Gotama, king 
Ajatasattu of Magadha the son of Vedeha wants to attack the Vajjis. He says. I 
will destroy the powerful Vajjis, I will put them into trouble. </P>
<P>At that time venerable Ananda was standing behind The Blessed One fanning 
him, The Blessed One addressed venerable Ananda: Ananda, do you hear that the 
Vajjis assemble constantly? Yes, venerable sir, I have heard that the Vajjis 
assemble constantly. </P>
<P>Ananda, as long as the Vajjis assemble constantly their growth not decrease 
should be expected.</P>
<P>Ananda, do you hear that the Vajjis get together in unity for their 
activities and dismiss in unity? Yes, venerable sir, I hear that the Vajjis get 
together in unity for their activities and dismiss in unity. As long as the 
Vajjis get together in unity for their activities and dismiss in unity, their 
growth not decrease should be expected. </P>
<P>Ananda, do you hear that the Vajjis do not appoint new rules and do not break 
already appointed rules? Yes, venerable sir, I hear that the Vajjis do not 
appoint new rules and do not break the already appointed rules.</P>
<P>As long as the Vajjis do not appoint new rules and do not break already 
appointed rules and as long as the ancient laws of the Vajjis are observed, 
their growth not decrease should be expected. </P>
<P>Ananda, do you hear that the Vajjis revere and esteem the elder Vajjis and 
consider to listen to them? Yes, venerable sir, I hear that the Vajjis revere 
and esteem the elder Vajjis and consider to listen to them.</P>
<P>As long as the Vajjis honour, revere and esteem the elder Vajjis and consider 
to listen to them, their growth not decrease should be expected. </P>
<P>Ananda, do you hear that the Vajjis do not force and oppress women and girls 
of high clans to live with them? Yes, venerable sir, I hear that the Vajjis do 
not force and oppress women and girls of high clans to live with them. </P>
<P>As long as the Vajjis do not use force and oppress women and girls of high 
clans to live with them, their growth not decrease should be expected. </P>
<P>Ananda, do you hear that the Vajjis worship esteem and honour the Vajji 
monuments internally and externally, giving whatever offerings earlier given 
without interrupting them? Yes, venerable sir, I hear that the Vajjis worship, 
esteem and honour the Vajji monuments internally and externally, giving whatever 
offerings earlier given without interrupting. </P>
<P>As long as the Vajjis worship, esteem and honour the Vajji monuments 
internally and externally giving whatever offerings earlier given without 
interrupting them, their growth not decrease should be expected. </P>
<P>Ananda, do you hear that the Vajjis arrange the rightful protection of the 
worthy ones so that those who have not come to the kingdom would come and those 
already come would abide pleasantly? Yes, venerable sir, I hear that the Vajjis 
arrange the rightful protection of the worthy ones, so that those who have not 
come to the kingdom would come and those already come would abide 
pleasantly.</P>
<P>As long as the Vajjis arrange the rightful protection of the worthy ones so 
that those who have not come would come to the kingdom and those who have 
already come would abide pleasantly, their growth not decrease should be 
expected. </P>
<P>Then The Blessed One addressed the Brahmin Vassakara: Brahmin, at one time I 
was abiding in the Sarandada monument and I taught the Vajjis these seven 
non-decreasing things. So long as the Vajjis abide by those non-decreasing 
things, their growth is to be expected not their decrease. </P>
<P>Good Gotama, to the Vajjis endowed with one of these things, increase should 
be expected not decrease. To them observing these seven things undoubtedly 
increase should be expected not decrease. Good Gotama, king Ajatasattu of 
Magadha, the son of Vedeha cannot do it, other than by a battle, a persuation or 
breaking up their unity. Now we will go, we have much work to do. Brahmin, do as 
you think fit. The Brahmin Vassakara delighting and agreeing with the words of 
The Blessed One got up from his seat and went away. </P></FONT><B><FONT
