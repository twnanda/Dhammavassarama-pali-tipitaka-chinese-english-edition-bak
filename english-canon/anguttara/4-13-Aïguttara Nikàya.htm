<P align=center>1. Attànuvàdasuttaü - Blame from the self.</P></B></FONT><FONT

<P>013.01. Bhikkhus, these four are fears. What four?</P>
<P>Fear of blame from the self, fear of blame from others, fear of punishment, 
and fear of evil states.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is fear of blame from the self?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain one reflects thus- If I misconduct by body by words 
and mind, those actions tell tales about my virtues. He frigthtened of blame 
from the self dispels bodily misconduct and develops bodily right conduct, 
dispels verbal misconduct and develops verbal right conduct, dispels mental 
misconduct and develops mental right conduct. Bhikkhus, this is fear of blame 
from the self.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is fear of blame from others?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain one reflects thus- If I misconduct by body by words 
and mind, those actions will be insults to my virtues. He frigthtened of blame 
from others dispels bodily misconduct and develops bodily right conduct, dispels 
verbal misconduct and develops verbal right conduct, dispels mental misconduct 
and develops mental right conduct. Bhikkhus, this is fear of blame from 
others.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is fear of punishment?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain person sees the king punishing a highwayman or a 
robber in various ways such as whipping, beating with the, jungle rope, poisoned 
stick. Cutting hands, cutting feet, cutting hands and feet. Cutting the ears, 
cutting the nose, cutting ears and nose. Putting in the gruel pot, giving the 
shell tonsure, putting in Rahu's mouth, garlanding with a flaming garland, 
burning the hands with a torch, beating until the body is like straw, making to 
behave like an antelope, hooking the flesh, cutting squares out of flesh, 
burning in an alkaline solution, driving a spike from ear to ear to turn, making 
like a straw foot stool, sprinkling boiling oil on the body, giving to the dogs 
to be eaten, raising on a pole until death and also cutting the neck. Then it 
occurs to him the king punishes the highwayman or the robber in various ways for 
his evil actions and if I do evil actions the same will be done to me, such as 
whipping, beating with the, jungle rope, poisoned stick. Cutting hands, cutting 
feet, cutting hands and feet. Cutting the ears, cutting the nose, cutting ears 
and nose. Putting in the gruel pot, giving the shell tonsure, putting in Rahu's 
mouth, garlanding with a flaming garland, burning the hands with a torch, 
beating until the body is like straw, making to behave like an antelope, hooking 
the flesh, cutting squares out of flesh, burning in an alkaline solution, 
driving a spike from ear to ear to turn, making me like a straw foot stool, 
sprinkling boiling oil on the body, giving to the dogs to be eaten, raising on a 
pole until death and also cutting the neck. So he does not rob fearing 
punishment from the king. To this is called fear of punishment.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is fear of an evil state?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain one reflects thus:- Evil results for bodily 
misbehaviour are here after, evil results for verbal misbehaviour are here 
after, and evil results for mental misbehaviour are here after. If I misbehave 
by body, by words and mind, I too after death will go to decrease, to hell, to a 
bad state and thinking thus he dispels bodily misconduct and develops bodily 
right conduct, dispels verbal misconduct and develops verbal right conduct and 
dispels mental misconduct and develops mental right conduct. He conducts himself 
purely. To this is said the fear of evil states. Bhikkhus, these four are fears.

waters. What four?</P>
<P>Fear of waves, fear of crocodiles, fear of whirlpools and the fear of 
alligators.</P>

the holy life advise and instruct him:- You should approach in this manner, 
recede in this manner, look on in this manner, look back in this manner, bend in 
this mannr and stretch in this manner, you should bear bowl and robes thus. It 
occurs to him:- Earlier, when I was a householder, I advised and instructed 
others, now those who are like my sons and grandsons advise and instruct me. He

precepts are a covering for the mouth. Thinking thus he decreases to the lower 
life. Bhikkhus, fear of crocodiles is a synonym for stomach filling. This is

puts on robes and taking bowl and robes enters the village or hamlet for alms 
his body, words and mind unprotected, without mindfull awareness established in 
his mental faculties. There he see a householder or the son of a householder 
enjoying the five strands of sense pleasures being endowed and provided with 
them. It occurs to him:- Earlier when I was a householder I was endowed and 
provided with the five strands of sense pleasures. There is wealth in my clan 
and it is possible for me to enjoy my wealth and do merit Thinking thus he 
decreases to the lower life. Bhikkhus, fear of whirlpools is a synonym for the

<P>013.03. Bhikkhus, these four persons are evident in the world. What four?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain person secluding from sensual desires and 
demeritorious thoughts, with thoughts and discursive thoughts and with joy and 
pleasantness born of seclusion attains to the first higher state of mind. 
Enjoying it, longing for it, he attains prosperity in it. Keenly applying 
himself to it, making much of it and not decreasing from it, he dies and is born 
with the gods of the sphere of Brahma. The life span of those gods is a forward 
world cycle. Finishing his complete life span there, he would either be born in 
hell, as a beast, or as a ghost. As for the noble disciples of The Blessed One, 
they would finish the complete life span there and would extinguish in that same 
birth. Bhikkhus, this is the difference and diversity between the learned noble 
disciple and the not learned ordinary man in their course of action, birth and 
conscience</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, a certain person overcoming thoughts and discursive thoughts 
and internally appeasing the mind making it one pointed without thoughts and 
discursive thoughts and with joy and pleasantness born of concentration attains 
to the second higher state of mind. Enjoying it, longing for it he attains 
prosperity in it. Keenly applying himself to it, making much of it, not 
decreasing from it he dies and is born with the gods of Radiance. The life span 
of those gods is two forward world cycles. Finishing his complete life span 
there, he would either be born in hell, as a beast, or as a ghost. As for the 
noble disciples of The Blessed One, they would finish the complete life span 
there and would extinguish in that same birth. Bhikkhus, this is the difference 
and diversity between the learned noble disciple and the not learned ordinary 
man in their course of action, birth and conscience</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, a certain person with equanimity to joy and detachment 
abides mindfull and aware experiencing pleasantness with the body tooòo this the 
noble ones say mindfull abiding in pleasantness with equanimity. He attains to 
this third higher state of mind. Enjoying it, longing for it he attains 
prosperity in it. Keenly applying himself to it, making much of it and not 
decreasing he dies and is born with the lustrous gods. The life span of those 
gods is four forward world cycles. Finishing his complete life span there, he 
would either be born in hell, as a beast, or as a ghost. As for the noble 
disciples of The Blessed One, they would finish the complete life span there and 
would extinguish in that same birth. Bhikkhus, this is the difference and 
diversity between the learned noble disciple and the not learned ordinary man in 
their course of action, birth and conscience</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, a certain person dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness, 
and earlier having dispelled pleasure and displeasure without unpleasantness and 
pleasantness and purifying mindfulness with equanimity attains to the fourth 
higher state of mind. Enjoying it, longing for it he attains prosperity in it. 
Keenly applying himself to it, making much of it and not decreasing he dies and 
is born with the gods of Space. The life span of those gods is five hundred 
forward world cycles. Finishing his complete life span there, he would either be 
born in hell, as a beast, or as a ghost. As for the noble disciples of The 
Blessed One, they would finish the complete life span there and would extinguish 
in that same birth. Bhikkhus, this is the difference and diversity between the
