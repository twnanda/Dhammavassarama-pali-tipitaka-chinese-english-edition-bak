<P>003.03. Bhikkhus, these five are the defilements of raw gold, defiled by 
which the raw gold is not soft, workable, does not shine, is brittle and is not 
ready to work with. What five? </P>
<P>Iron, metals, tin, lead and silver. Bhikkhus, these five are the defilements 
of raw gold, defiled by which the raw gold is not soft, workable, does not 
shine, is brittle and is not ready to work with. When raw gold is released from 
these defilements, it becomes soft, workable, it shines, is not brittle and 
becomes ready to work with. Then the gold becomes suitable to make whatever 
desired ornament, a ring for the finger, earings, a neck lace or a gold chain. 
</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in the same manner these five are the minor defilements of the 
mind, defiled by which the mind is not soft, not workable, does not shine, is 
brittle and does not concentrate in one point for the rightful destruction of 
desires. What five? </P>
<P>Interest for sensuality, anger, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry and 
doubts. Bhikkhus, these are the five minor defilements of the mind, defiled by 
which the mind is neither soft nor workable, does not shine and is brittle and 
does not concentrate for the rightful destruction of desires. Bhikkhus, when the 
mind is released from these minor defilements, it becomes soft, workable, it 
shines, is not brittle and comes to one point for the rightful destruction of 
desires. For the realization of whatever things the mind is directed, the 
mindfulness in that sphere, becomes the eye witness . </P>
<P>If it's his desire he partakes various psychic fetes, one becomes many and 
many becomes one, manifestly goes through rocks and walls unobstructed, as 
traveling in space. Dives into earth as though diving in water. Walks on water 
unbroken as though walking on earth. Sits in space as birds large and small do. 
Touches the moon and sun, as powerful as they are. Thus wields power as far as 
the world of Brahma. Thus mindfulness becomes the eye witness in that and that 
sphere. </P>
<P>If it's his desire, with the purified heavenly ear beyond human he hears 
sounds both heavenly and human, far or near and mindfulness in that and other 
sphere becomes the eyewitness in the respective sphere. </P>
<P>If it's his desire he penetrating sees the minds of others and knows the mind 
with greed, without greed, the angry mind and the not angry mind, the deluded 
mind and the not deluded mind. Knows the contracted mind, the distracted mind, 
the mind that has grown great, that has not grown great, the mind with a 
compare, the mind without a compare, the concentrated mind, the unconcentrated 
mind, the released mind and the unreleased mind, and mindfulness in that and 
other sphere becomes the eye witness in the respective sphere. </P>
<P>If it's his desire, he recollects manifold previous births- such as one 
birth, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred 
births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, innumerable forward world 
cycles, innumerable backward world cycles, innumerable forward and backward 
world cycles of births - There I was of such name, clan, disposition, such 
supports, feeling such pleasant and unpleasant feelings and enjoying such a life 
span. Disappearing from there is born here. Thus with all modes and details he 
recollects the manifold previous births, and the mindfulness in that and other 
sphere becomes the eye witness in the respective sphere. </P>
<P>If it's his desire, with the purified heavenly eye beyond human, he sees 
beings disappearing and appearing in states unexalted and exalted, beautiful and 
ugly in good and evil births, knows beings born according to their actions- 
These good beings endowed with bodily, verbal and mental misconduct, rebuking 
noble ones, with wrong view and the wrong view of actions, after death are born 
in loss, in a bad state, in decrease, in hell; as for these good beings endowed 
with the right bodily, verbal and mental conduct, not rebuking noble ones, with 
right view and the right view of actions, after death are born in a good state, 
in increase, in heaven. Thus he sees beings disappearing and appearing in states 
unexalted and exalted, beautiful and ugly in good and evil births, knows beings 
born according to their actions and the mindfulness in that and other sphere 
becomes the eye witness in the respective sphere. </P>
<P>If it's his desire, destroying desires, releasing the mind from desires and 
released through wisdom, here and now, by him self realizing abides, and the 
mindfulness in that sphere becomes the eye witness. </P></FONT><B><FONT

when the bhikkhu dwells diligent to dispel, either the not released mind is 
released, or the unexhausted desires get exhausted or the noble end of 
unpleasantness not yet attained is attained. What five? Here, bhikkhus, the 
Teacher or else a certain eminent co-associate in the holy life, teaches the 
bhikkhu. Then he gradually understands the meanings and experiences the 
Teaching. When understanding the meanings and experiencing the Teaching delight 
arises, to the delighted joy arises Of one with a joyful mind the body appeases. 
The appeased body experiences pleasa ntness. The mind of one who experiences 
pleasantness comes to one point. Bhikkhus, this is the first of the five 
releases, in which spheres when the bhikkhu dwells diligent to dispel, either 
the not released mind is released, or the unexhausted desires get exhausted or 
the noble end of unpleasantness not yet attained is attained. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, neither the Teacher nor an eminent co-associate in the holy

<P>003.08. Bhikkhus, I will tell the five factored right concentration of the 
noble ones, listen and attend carefully. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the five factored right concentration of the noble ones? 
Here, the bhikkhu secluded from sensual desires. . . re. . . . abides in the 
first higher state of mind. Then he over flows and touches this body with joy 
and pleasantness born of seclusion, up and above and from all sides and around 
not leaving any spot of the body untouched. Like a clever bather or his 
apprentice, putting some bathing powder in a bronze bowl and sprinkling water on 
it would mix it, until it is a smooth ball of moist, oily foam not dripping 
anything. In the s ame manner he over flows and touches this body with joy and 
pleasantness born of seclusion, up and above and from all sides and around not 
leaving any spot of the body untouched by the joy and pleasantnes born of 
seclusion. Bhikkhus, this is the first of the five factored right concentrations 
of the noble ones. </P>
<P>Again, the bhikkhu overcoming thoughts and thought processes . . . re. . . . 
abides in the second higher state of mind. Then he over flows and touches this 
body with joy and pleasantness born of concentration, up and above and from all 
sides and around not leaving any spot of the body untouched with joy and 
pleasantness born of concentration . Like a deep pond with spring water, without 
inlets from the east, west, north or south and from time to time refreshed with 
rain water. Thus cold water springing up from the bottom touches the pond up and 
above and all round not leaving any spot in the pond untouched by the cold 
water. In the same manner he over flows and touches this body with joy and 
pleasantness born of concentration, up and above and from all sides and around 
not leaving any spot of the body untouched by the joy and pleasantnes born of 
concentration. Bhikkhus, this is the second of the five factored right 
concentrations of the noble ones. </P>
<P>Again, the bhikkhu with equanimity to joy and disenchantment . . . re. . . . 
abides in the third higher state of mind. Then he over flows and touches this 
body with pleasantness free of joy, up and above and from all sides and around 
not leaving any spot of the body untouched with pleasantness free of joy. Like 
some of the blue lotuses, white lotuses or red lotuses in a pond are born, grow 
and bloom in the water and their tops and roots are touched with the cold water 
and leaves nothing untouched by the cold water. In the same manner he over flows 
and touches this body with pleasantness free of joy, up and above and from all 
sides and around, not leaving any spot of the body untouched by the pleasantness 
free of joy. Bhikkhus, this is the third of the five factored right 
concentrations of the noble ones. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness . . . 
re. . . . abides in the fourth higher state of mind. Then he sits touching this 
body with the pure and clean mind, not leaving any spot of the body untouched 
with the pure and clean mind. Like a man sitting with his head and body covered 
with a white piece of cloth. There is not a single spot in his body that is not 
touched with the white cloth. In the same manner he sits touching this body with 
the pure and clean mind, not leaving any spot of the body untouched by the pure 
and clean mind. Bhikkhus, this is the fourth of the five factored right 
concentrations of the noble ones. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, to the bhikkhu the sign of reflection becomes well grasped, 
well considered and thoroughly penetrated with wisdom. Bhikkhus, it is like 
someone reflecting himself as another, standing, he reflects as though sitting, 
seated he reflects as though lying In the same manner, to the bhikkhu the sign 
of reflection becomes well grasped, well considered and thoroughly penetrated 
with wisdom. Bhikkhus, this is the fifth of the five factored right 
concentrations of the noble ones. Bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu practises and makes 
much of these five factored right concentrations, to the mind directed for the 
realization of this and other thing, the mindfulness in that and other sphere 
becomes the eye witness in the respective sphere. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it is like a water vessel placed on a stand, full to the brim 
possible for crows to drink. Would a man consider it, as water, in whatever 
manner he sees it. Yes, venerable sir. In the same manner, when the bhikkhu 
practises and makes much of these five factored right concentrations, to the 
mind directed for the realization of this and other thing, the mindfulness in 
that and other sphere becomes the eye witness in the respective sphere. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it is like a pool on some level ground, with embankments on the 
four sides, full of water to the brim possible for crows to drink. Would a man 
releasing the water, in whatever manner, know it's water. Yes, venerable sir. In 
the same manner, when the bhikkhu practises and makes much of these five 
factored right concentrations, to the mind directed for the realization of this 
and other thing, the mindfulness in that and other sphere becomes the eye 
witness in the respective sphere. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it is like a chariot with horses yoked on level ground with reins 
and whip ready at hand. A clever charioteer comes and mounting the chariot 
taking the reins in the left hand and the whip in the right hand, leads it 
forwards and backwards as he wishes. In the same manner, when the bhikkhu 
practises and makes much of these five factored right concentrations, to the 
mind directed for the realization of this and other thing, the mindfulness in 
that and other sphere becomes the eye witness in the respective sphere. </P>
<P>If it is his desire he partakes various psychic fetes, one becomes many and 
many becomes one, manifestly goes through rocks and walls unobstructed, as 
travelling in space. Dives into earth as though diving in water. Walks on water 
unbroken as though walking on earth. Sits in space as birds large and small do. 
Touches the moon and sun, as powerful as they are. Thus weilds power as far as

<P>If it's his desire he penetrating sees the minds of others and knows the mind 
with greed, without greed, the angry mind and the not angry mind, the deluded

the mind that has grown great, that has not grown great, the mind with a 
compare, the mind without a compare, the concentrated mind, the unconcentrated 
mind, the released mind and the unreleased mind, and mindfulness in that and 
other sphere becomes the eye witness in the respective sphere. </P>
<P>If it's his desire, he recollects manifold previous births- such as one

<P>003.10. I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was touring the country of 
Kosala with a large Community of bhikkhus and entered the Brahmin hamlet 
Icchanagala and lived in the forest stretch of Icchanagala. The Brahmin 
householders of Icchanagtala heard that the good recluse Gotama, the son of the 
Sakyas gone forth from the Sakya clan has come to Icchanagala and lives in the 
forest stretch there. The good name, spread about that good Gotama- That Blessed 
One is worthy, rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well 
gone, the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, 
enlightened and Blessed. He teaches to this world together with its gods, Mara, 
Brahma and the community of recluses and Brahmins, the Teaching he had known and 
realized, good at the beginning, in the middle and the end, purely and 
completely explaining the holy life. It is good to see such worthy ones. Then 
the Brahmin householders of Icchanagala at the end of that night carrying a lot 
of eatables and nourishments approached the forest stretch of Icchangala, and 
they stood outside the entrance making a lot of noise. . </P>
<P>At that time venerable Nagita attended on the Blessed One and the Blessed One 
addressed venerable Nagita:- Nagita, who makes such great noise, like hauling a 
catch of fish. Venerable sir, they are the Brahmin householders of Icchanagala 
standing outside, come with a lot of eatables and nourishments for the Blessed 
One and the Community of bhikkhus Nagita, I do not tolerate that eminent fame, 
the enjoyment of gain, honour and fameýay it not come to me. It is vile and 
sluggish pleasure in comparison to this emancipation from worldliness, the 
pleasures of seclusion, appeasement, enlightenment, non sensual pleasure gained 
for nothing and gained quickly. </P>
<P>Venerable sir, may the Blessed One tolerate. Well Gone One, it is the right 
time to give consent. Wherever the Blessed One inclines now, whether hamlet or 
state, the Brahmin householders too would bend, to that hamlet or state. Like 
huge drops of rain that fall would turn towards the inclines. In the same 
manner, wherever the Blessed One inclines now, whether hamlet or state, the 
Brahmin householders too would bend, to that hamlet or state. What is the 
reason? It is on account of the virtues and wisdom of the Blessed One. </P>
<P>Nagita, I do not tolerate that eminent fame, the enjoyment of gain, honour 
and fameýay it not come to me. It is vile and sluggish pleasure in comparison to 
this emancipation from worldliness, the pleasures of seclusion, appeasement, 
enlightenment, non sensual pleasure gained for nothing and gained quickly. The 
enjoyment of gain, honour and fame is a vile and sluggish pleasure. Nagita, what 
is tasted, drunk, eaten and enjoyed is urine and excreta. It trickles and flows 
from what is tasted, drunk, eaten and enjoyed. Nagita, to dear ones change into 
another form occurs and grief, lament, unpleasantness displeasure and distress 
arises, those are the tricklings from them. Nagita, to one attending to the sign 
of impurity, on account of a pleasant sign loathsomeness arises, those are the 
tricklings from them. Nagita, to one abiding with the sign of impermanence in 
the six spheres of contact, with a contact loathsomeness gets established, those 
are the tricklings from them. Nagita, to one abiding seeing the arising and 
falling of the five holding masses, in a holding loathsomeness gets established, 
those are the tricklings from them. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
