<P>1. Pubbesambodhasuttaü Before enlightenment</P>
<P>104. Bhikkhus, when I was not yet enlightened, it occured to me:- In this 
world what is the satisfaction, what is the danger and what is the escape? Then 
I occured to me:- The arising of pleasure and pleasantness in the world on 
account of something, is the satisfaction in this world. That there is 
impermanence, unpleasantness and change in the world, that is the danger. The 
driving out, interest and greed in the world, the dispelling of interest and 
greed is the escape from the world. Bhikkhus, until I knew as it really is, the 
satisfaction as the satisfaction, the danger as the danger and the escape as the 
escape, I did not announce to the world together with its gods, Maras, Brahmas, 
the community of recluses and brahmins, my rightful enlightenment. Knowledge 
arose to me about my vision. - The release of my mind is unshakeable. This is my 
last birth, there will be no more rebirths. </P>
<P>2. Pañhamassàdasuttaü- The first on satisfaction</P>
<P>105. Bhikkhus, I went in search of satisfaction in the world, whatever 
satisfaction there is in the world, I experienced it and thoroughly saw it with 
wisdom Bhikkhus, I went in search of the danger in the world, whatever danger 
there is in the world, I found out and thoroughly saw it with wisdom. Bhikkhus, 
I went in search of the escape in the world, whatever escape there is in the 
world, I found it out and thoroughly saw it with wisdom</P>
<P>The arising of pleasure and pleasantness in the world is on account of 
something is the satisfaction in this world. That there is impermanence, 
unpleasantness and change in the world, that is the danger. The driving out, 
interest and greed in the world, the dispelling of interest and greed is the 
escape from the world. Bhikkhus, until I knew as it really is, the satisfaction 
as the satisfaction, the danger as the danger and the escape as the escape, I 
did not announce to the world together with its gods, Maras, Brahmas, the 
community of recluses and brahmins, my rightful enlightenment. Knowledge arose 
to me about my vision. - The release of my mind is unshakeable. This is my last 
birth, there will be no more rebirths. </P>
<P>3. Dutiyassàdasuttaü- The second on satisfaction</P>
<P>106.Bhikkhus, if there was no satisfaction in the world, sentient beings 
would not be attached to this world. Since there is a satisfaction, sentient 
beings are attached to this world Bhikkhus, if there was no danger in the world, 
sentient beings would not turn away from this world. Since there is a danger, 
sentient beings turn away from this world Bhikkhus, if there was no escape from 
the world, sentient beings would not escape from this world. Since there is an 
escape, sentient beings escape from this world. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, until the sentient being knows as it really is, the satisfaction as 
the satisfaction, the danger as the danger and the escape as the escape, he 
would not free himself, unfetter and release himself without restrictions from 
this world together with gods and men, Maras, Brahmas and the community of 
recluses and brahmins Bhikkhus, when the sentient being knows as it really is, 
the satisfaction as the satisfaction, the danger as the danger and the escape as 
the escape, he frees himself, unfetters and releases himself and abides without 
restrictions from this world together with gods and men, Maras, Brahmas and the 
community of recluses and brahmins </P>
<P>4. Samanabrahmanasuttaü- Recluses and brahmins.</P>
<P>107.Bhikkhus, those recluses and brahmins who do not know as it really is, 
the satisfaction as the satisfaction, the danger as the danger and the escape as 
the escape, are not my recluses, or brahmins, or those doing the recluseship, or 
those that can be called recluses or brahmins or those that can be called 
brahmins. These venerable ones will not come to recluseship or brahminship in 
this very life by themselves realizing and abide. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, those recluses and brahmins who know as it really is, the 
satisfaction as the satisfaction, the danger as the danger and the escape as the 
escape, are recluses, or brahmins, or those doing the recluseship, or those that 
can be called recluses or brahmins or those that can be called brahmins. These 
venerable ones will come to recluseship or brahminship in this very life by 
themselves realizing and abide. </P>
<P>5. Ruõõasuttaü- Crying </P>
<P>108.Bhikkhus, singing is crying in this discipline of the noble ones and 
dancing is insanity. Bhikkhus, it is childish to laugh too long showing your 
teeth. Therefore give up singing, dancing and it is suitable that you, 
delighting in the Teaching should laugh to a certain extent only. </P>
<P>6. Atittisuttaü -Not satiated</P>
<P>109.Bhikkhus, indulging in these three there is no satiation. What three?
