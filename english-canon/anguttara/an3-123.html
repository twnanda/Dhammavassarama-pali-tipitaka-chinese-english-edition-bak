<hr>
Monks, there are these <A NAME="3sagacity">three forms of sagacity</A>. Which three? Bodily sagacity, verbal sagacity, and mental sagacity.
<p>
And what is bodily sagacity? There is the case where a monk abstains from taking life, abstains from theft, abstains from unchastity. This is called bodily sagacity.
<p>
And what is verbal sagacity? There is the case where a monk abstains from lying, abstains from divisive tale-bearing, abstains from harsh language, abstains from idle chatter. This is called verbal sagacity.
<p>
And what is mental sagacity? There is the case where a monk who -- with the wasting away of the mental fermentations -- remains in the fermentation-free release of awareness and release of discernment, having known and made them manifest for himself right in the here and now. This is called mental sagacity.
<p>
These, monks, are the three forms of sagacity.
<blockquote>
A sage in body, a sage in speech,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sage in mind, without fermentation:<br>
a sage consummate in sagacity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is said to have abandoned<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; everything.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- the All.
