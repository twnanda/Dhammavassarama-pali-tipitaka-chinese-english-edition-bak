<P>1. Kusinàrasuttaü - At Kusinara.</P>
<P>124. At one time the Blessed One lived in Kusinara in a stretch of forest in 
Baliharana. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:- </P>
<P>Here bhikkhus, the bhikkhu abides relying on a certain village or hamlet. a 
householder or his son approaches him and invites for the next days meal. If the 
bhikkhu wishes he accepts it The next morning the bhikkhu putting on his robes 
and taking bowl and robes approaches the home of that householder or 
householder's son. He sits on the prepared seat. The householder or his son with 
his own hands serves the bhikkhu with nourishing eatables and drinks. Then it 
occurs to the bhikkhu:- It is good that the householder or his son has served me 
with nourishing eatables and drinks with his own hands. It also occurs to him:- 
O! Good if this same householder or the householder's son serves me with 
nourishing eatables and drinks, of similar nature with his own hands in the 
future as well. He partakes that morsel food enslaved and swooned to greed, 
without seeing the danger and the escape from it. There he thinks sensual 
thoughts, hateful thoughts and hurting thoughts.Bhikkhus, I say, giving gifts to 
such a bhikkhu is not of the highest benefit. What is the reason? That bhikkhu 
abides negligently. . </P>
<P>Here bhikkhus, the bhikkhu abides relying on a certain village or hamlet. a 
householder or his son approaches him and invites for the next days meal. If the 
bhikkhu wishes he accepts it The next morning the bhikkhu putting on his robes 
and taking bowl and robes approaches the home of that householder or 
householder's son. He sits on the prepared seat. The householder or his son with 
his own hands serves the bhikkhu with nourishing eatables and drinks. Then it 
does not occur to the bhikkhu:- It is good that the householder or his son has 
served me with nourishing eatables and drinks with his own hands. It also does 
not occur to him:- O! Good if this same householder or the householder's son 
serves me with nourishing eatables and drinks, of similar nature with his own 
hands in the future as well. He partakes that morsel food not enslaved and not 
swooned to greed, wisely seeing the danger and the escape from it. There he 
thinks non sensual thoughts, not hateful thoughts and non hurting 
thoughts.Bhikkhus, I say, giving gifts to such a bhikkhu is of the highest 
benefit. What is the reason? That bhikkhu abides diligently. </P>
<P>2. Bhaõóanasuttaü- Quarrelling</P>
<P>125. Bhikkhus, in a direction the bhikkhus quarrel, fight and form a dispute 
using the mouth as the weapon and abide, I find it unpleasant even to think of 
that direction, the least to go there. I conclude- Indeed these venerable ones 
have given up three things and make much of three things. What three things have 
they given up? Non-sensual thoughts, non hateful thoughts and non-hurting 
thoughts. They have given up these three.</P>
<P>What have they practised much? Sensual thoughts, hateful thoughts and hurting 
thoughts. They have practised much of these three.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in a direction the bhikkhus quarrel, fight and form a dispute using 
the mouth as the weapon and abide, I find it unpleasant even to think of that 
direction, the least to go there. I conclude- Indeed these venerable ones have 
given up three things and make much of three things.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in a direction the bhikkhus are united, delighted, without a 
dispute abide seeing each other with friendly eyes mixing like milk and water, I 
find it pleasant to go in that direction, and more so to think of them I 
conclude- Indeed these venerable ones have given up three things and made much 
of three things.</P>
<P>What three things have they given up? Sensual thoughts, hateful thoughts and 
hurting thoughts. They have given up these three.</P>
<P>What have they practised much? Non-sensual thoughts, non-hateful thoughts and 
non-hurting thoughts. They have practised much of these three.</P>
<P>3. Gotamakasuttaü - At the monument Gotamaka.</P>
<P>126.At one time the Blessed One was living in the Gotamaka monument in Vesali 
and addressed the bhikkhus:- Bhikkhus, I teach thoroughly knowing, with reasons, 
not without, with wonders, not without. Since I teach you thoroughly knowing, 
with reasons and wonders, there is a cause that I should advise you and instruct 
you. Bhikkhus, you should be pleased and happy- The Blessed One is rightfully 
enlightened</P>
<P>The Teaching of the Blessed One is well declared and the Community of 
bhikkhus have come to the right path. The Blessed One said this and those 
bhikkhus were pleased. When this was said, the thousandfold world element shook 
</P>
<P>4. Bharaõóukàlàmasuttaü- The Kalama Bharandu</P>
<P>127.At one time the Blessed One touring the country of Kosala arrived in 
Kapilavatthu. The Sakya Mahanama hearing that the Blessed One had arrived in 
Kapilavatthu, approached, worshipped and stood on a side. The Blessed One said 
thus to the Sakya Mahanama:-Mahanama, go. Find me a suitable dwelling for one 
night in Kapilavatthu. </P>
<P>The Sakya Mahanama accepted and wandered every where in Kapilavatthu looking 
for a suitable dwelling for the Blessed One for a single night, not finding a 
suitàble dwelling approached the Blessed One and said to the Blessed One:-</P>
<P>Venerable sir, in Kapilavatthu there is no suitable dwelling for the Blessed 
One for one night. There is the monastery of the Kalama Bharaõóu, who was a 
previous co-associate in the holy life of the Blessed. Tonight the Blessed One 
could dwell there.</P>
<P>Go! Mahanama prepare a spread. The Sakya Mahanama accepted and going to the 
monastery of the Kalama Bharandu prepared a spread, placed water for washing the 
feet and approached the Blessed One and said:-</P>
<P>Venerable sir a spread is made, water is placed for washing the feet. It is 
ready when the Blessed One thinks to go.</P>
<P>The Blessed One approached the monastery of the Kalama Bhraõóu sat on the 
prepared seat and washed his feet. Then it occured to the Sakya Mahanama:- This 
is not the right time to associate the Blessed One, he is tired, I will 
associate him tomorrow and he worshipped the Blessed One, circumambulated the 
Blessed One and went away. </P>
<P>The next morning the Sakya Mahanama approached the Blessed One worshipped and 
sat on a side. The Blessed One said thus to him:-</P>
<P>Mahanama, these three teachers are evident in the world. What three?</P>
<P>Mahanama, a certain teacher appoints the comprehension of sensuality and does 
not appoint the comprehension of matter and feelings. Mahanama, a certain other 
teacher appoints the comprehension of sensuality and the comprehension of matter 
and not the comprehension of feelings. Mahanama, a certain other teacher 
appoints the comprehension of sensuality the comprehension of matter and the 
comprehension of feelings. Mahanama, these three teachers are evident in the 
world. Mahanama, are the perfections of these three teachers the same or 
various? </P>
<P>When this was said the Kalama Bhrandu promted to the Sakya Mahanama say it is 
the same </P>
<P>Then the Blessed One said to the Sakya Mahanama, say it is various.</P>
<P>For the second time the Kalama Bhrandu promted to the Sakya Mahanama say it 
is the same </P>
<P>For the second time the Blessed One said to the Sakya Mahanama, say it is 
various.</P>
<P>For the third time the Kalama Bhrandu promted to the Sakya Mahanama say it is 
the same </P>
<P>For the third time the Blessed One said to the Sakya Mahanama, say it is 
various.</P>
<P>Then it occured to the Kalama Bhrandu:- I am depreciated up to the third time 
by the Blessed One in the face of this powerful Sakya Mahanama. I should go away 
from Kapilavatthu.</P>
<P>The Kalama Bhrandu left Kapilavatthu but did not return to Kapilavatthu. </P>
<P>5. Hatthakasuttaü- To Hatthaka the son of gods</P>
<P>128. At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by 
Anathapindika in Jeta's grove in Savatthi. Then Hatthaka the son of the gods 
when the night was far spent approached the Blessed One illuminating the whole 
of Jeta's grove when trying to stand before the Blessed One was sinking. As 
though oil or ghee put on sand would sink. In the same manner Hatthaka the son 
of the gods when trying to stand before the Blessed One was sinking and could 
not stand. </P>
<P>The Blessed One said to Hatthaka:- Hatthaka, create a rough form. Hatthaka 
consented and creating a rough form worshipped the Blessed One and stood on a 
side. Then the Blessed One said thus to him:-</P>
<P>Hatthaka, those thoughts that you developped when you were a human, are they 
yet evident in you </P>
<P>Venerable sir, those thoughts that prevailed when I was a human, they prevail 
in me now and those thoughts that did not prevail when I was a human, they too 
prevail in me now. As the Blessed One now abides crowded by bhikkhus, 
bhikkhunis, lay disciples male and female, kings, kings' ministers, by those 
with different faiths and their disciples. In the same manner I am crowded by 
sons of gods. Venerable sir, even from afar sons of gods come to my presence to 
hear the Teaching</P>
<P>Venerable sir, not satiated and not hindered by three things, I passed away. 
What three? Venerable sir, I passed away not satiated with the unhindered sight 
of the Blessed One. Venerable sir, I passed away not satiated with the 
unhindered hearing of the Teaching. Venerable sir, I passed away not satiated 
with the unhindered attention towards the Community.Venerable sir, not satiated 
and not hindered by these three things, I passed away.</P>
<P>I was never satisfied seing the Blessed One, </P>
<P>Attending on the Community and hearing the Teaching.</P>
<P>Training in higher virtues, I was attached to the Teaching.</P>
<P>Hatthaka passed away not satiated in these three things. </P>
<P>6. Kañuviyasuttaü- On defiling</P>
<P>129. At one time the Blessed One was abiding in the deer park in Isipatana in 
Benares. The Blessed One putting on robes in the morning and taking bowl and 
robes entered Benares for the alms round and saw a certain bhikkhu going for 
alms, under a fig tree where cattle are bound. He was internally dissatisfied 
and his interests were turned out wards, forgetful, not aware and distracted the 
mind straying with uncontrolled mental faculties. Seeing him the Blessed One 
said:- Bhikkhu, do not defile yourself. When you defile yourself an evil smell 
emanates and it is impossible that flies would not settle.</P>
<P>That bhikkhu advised by the Blessed One in this manner became remorseful. The 
Blessed One after going the alms round and after the meal was over addressed the 
bhikkhus:- Bhikkhus, I put on robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes 
entered Benares for the alms round and saw a certain bhikkhu going for alms, 
under a fig tree where cattle are bound. He was internally dissatisfied and his 
interests were turned out wards, forgetful, not aware and distracted, his mind 
straying with uncontrolled mental faculties. Seeing him I said:- Bhikkhu, do not 
defile yourself. When you defile yourself an evil smell emanates and it is 
impossible that flies would not settle.</P>
<P>That bhikkhu advised by me became remorseful.</P>
<P>When this was said a certain bhikkhu said:- Venerable sir, what is defiling, 
what is the evil smell and what are flies? </P>
<P>Bhikikhu, the defiling is covetousness, the evil smell is aversion and flies 
are evil demeritorious thoughts. That bhikkhu defiling himself and emanating an 
evil smell, that flies should not settle is not possible.</P>
<P>With unprotected eyes and ears and mental faculties uncontrolled,</P>
<P>Flies in the form of greedy thoughts will settle. </P>
<P>The defiled bhikkhu emanates evil smells</P>
<P>Far from extinction, he has destroyed bliss.</P>
<P>In village or in forest not achieving his inner peace,</P>
<P>The fool sets forth followed by flies.</P>
<P>He that is virtuous and wisely attached to appeasemment </P>
<P>Sleeps well having destroyed the flies. </P>
<P>7. Pañhamànuruddhasuttaü - The first about venerable Anuruddha.</P>
<P>130. Venerable Anurudddha approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a 
side and said to the Blessed One:- Venerable sir, with my heavenly eye, purified 
beyond human, I see many women after death going to loss, to a bad state, to 
decrease, to hell. </P>
<P>Venerable sir, on sccount of what kind of thoughts do women after death go to 
loss, to a bad state, to decrease to hell? Anuruddha, on account of three kinds 
of thoughts many women after death are born in loss, in a bad state, in 
decrease, in hell. </P>
<P>What three? </P>
<P>Here, Anuruddha, during the early part of their lives women live overcome by 
selfish and stingy thoughts, during the middle part of their lives they live 
overcome by jealous thoughts and during the final part of their lives they live 
overcome by sensual thoughts. </P>
<P>Anuruddha, on account of these three kinds of thoughts many women after death 
are born in loss, in a bad state, in decrease, in hell. </P>
<P>8ôutiyànuruddhasuttaü - The second about venerable Anuruddha.</P>
<P>131. Venerable Anurudddha approached venerable Sariputta, exchanged friendly 
greetings and sitting on a side said thus to venerable Sariputta:-</P>
<P>Friend, Sariputta, with my heavenly eye purified beyond human I look at the 
thousandfold world system, my effort is aroused, mindfulness is established 
unconfused, body is appeased without aversion, the mind is concentrated and in 
one point. Yet my mind is not released from desires without anything 
remaining.</P>
<P>Friend, Anuruddha, when it occurs to you-With my heavenly eye purified beyond 
human I look at the thousandfold world system. That to you is conceit. Friend, 
Anuruddha, when it occurs to you- my effort is aroused, mindfulness is 
established unconfused, body is appeased without aversion, the mind is 
concentrated and in one point. That to you is distraction. Friend, Anuruddha, if 
it occurs to you-Yet my mind is not released from desires without anything 
remaining. That, to you is worry. </P>
<P>Good! If venerable Anuruddha dispelling these three thoughts, not attending 
to them should lead the mind to the deathless element.</P>
<P>Venerable Anuruddha in the meantime dispelling these three thoughts, not 
attending to them, led the mind to the deathless element. Then venerable 
Anuruddha alone and secluded from the crowd, diligently arousing effort to 
dispel, before long for whatever reason sons of clansmen, rightfully leaving the 
household become homeless, that noble end of the holy life he here and now by 
himself realizing abode. He thoroughly knew, birth is destroyed, the holy life 
is lived, what should be done is done, there is nothing more to wish. Venerable 
Anuruddha became one of the noble ones. </P>
<P>9. Pañicchannasuttaü - The covered up.</P>
<P>132. Bhikkhus, these three are carried away covered, not openly. What three? 
Women are carried away covered not openly. Brahmanical mutterings are done under 
cover and Wrong view is covered not made manifest. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these three when made manifest shine. What three? </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the moon shines when manifest, the sun shines when manifest and the 
Teaching and Discipline declared by the Thus Gone One shines when manifest and 
not when covered. These three shine when manifest and not when covered. </P>
<P>10. Lekhasuttaü - Writings.</P>
<P>133. Bhikkhus, these three persons are evident in the world. What three? </P>
<P>The person comparable to a writing on a rock, the person comparable to a 
writing on earth and the person comparable to a writing on water.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, who is the person comparable to a writing on a rock?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus a certain person is always angry. He lies with that anger a 
long while. As the writing on a rock is not rubbed off quickly, by water or by 
the wind. In the same manner bhikkhus, a certain person is always angry. He lies 
with that anger a long while. Bhikkhus, this person is comparable to a writing 
on a rock. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, who is the person comparable to a writing on earth?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus a certain person is always angry. He does not lie with that 
anger a long while. As a writing on earth is rubbed off quickly, by water or by 
the wind. In the same manner bhikkhus, a certain person is always angry. He does 
not lie with that anger a long while. Bhikkhus, this person is comparable to a 
writing on earth. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, who is the person comparable to a writing on water? </P>
<P>Here bhikkhus, a certain person when spoken harshly or roughly gets arranged, 
is not cross becomes friendly. As a writing on water quickly gets rubbed off. In 
the same manner bhikkhus, a certain person when spoken harshly or roughly gets 
arranged, is not cross becomes friendly. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these three persons are evident in the 
world.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
