<P>012.01. òhen Kesi the trainer of horses, to be trained approached The Blessed 
One, worshipped and sat on a side. The Blessed One said thus to him:-</P>
<P>Kesi, you are skilled in training horses, how do you train horses?</P>
<P>Venerable sir, I train horses kindly, roughly, and I train horses kindly and 
roughly.</P>
<P>Kesi, when the horse to be tamed is not tamed when trained kindly, roughly 
and also kindly and roughly, what do you do to it?</P>
<P>Venerable sir, when the horse to be tamed is not tamed when trained kindly, 
roughly and also kindly and roughly, I kill it. What is the reason? May there be 
no blame for the clan of the master. Venerable sir, The Blessed One is the 
incomparable tamer of those to be tamed. How does The Blessed One tame those to 
be tamed?</P>
<P>Kesi, I train those to be tamed kindly, roughly and train them kindly and 
roughly.</P>
<P>Kesi, I train them kindly thus. This is bodily good conduct, these are the 
results for bodily good conduct. This is verbal good conduct, these the results 
for verbal good conduct. This is mental good conduct, these the results for 
mental good conduct, thus its heavenly and thus its human. Kesi, I train them 
roughly thus. This is bodily evil conduct, these are the results for bodily evil 
conduct. This is verbal evil conduct, these are the results for verbal evil 
conduct. This is mental evil conduct, these are the results for mental evil 
conduct, thus its hellish and thus its the sphere of beasts and ghosts. .</P>
<P>Kesi, I train them kindly and harshly thus. This is bodily good conduct, 
these the results for bodily good conduct. This is bodily evil conduct and these 
the results for bodily evil conduct This is verbal good conduct, these the 
results for verbal good conduct. This is verbal evil conduct, these the results 
for evil verbal conduct. This is mental good conduct, these the results for 
mental good conduct. This is mental evil conduct, these the results for mental 
evil conduct. Thus its heavenly and human and hellish in the spheres of beasts 
and ghosts.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, when those to be tamed are not tamed when trained kindly, 
roughly and also kindly and roughly, what does The Blessed One do to them? Kesi, 
when those to be tamed do not get tamed when trained kindly, harshly and also 
kindly and harshly, I kill them. Venerable sir, it is not suitable for The 
Blessed One to destroy living things, yet The Blessed One says I kill them</P>
<P>Kesi, it's true, destroying living things is not suitable for the Thus Gone 
One, if those to be tamed do not tame, when trained kindly, harshly and also 
kindly and harshly, the Thus Gone One does not think they should be tolerated 
and adised and wise co-associates in the holy life do not think they should be 
tolerated and advised. Kesi, it is death in the noble ones' discipline when the 
Thus Gone and the wise co-associates in the holy life do not think to tolerate 
and advise.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, isn't it destruction in the well going path, when the Thus 
Gone One and the wise co-associates in the holy life do not thik to tolerate and 
advise them. Venerable sir, I am a lay disciple who has taken refuge from today 
until life lasts.</P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>

unpleasantly and it should not be done as it leads to the unprofitable.</P>

profitable, the fool and the wise one should be known by the manly power, manly 
effort and manly attainment. The fool does not think, this thing done 
unpleasantly, leads me to the profitable, so he does not do it and it leads him 
to the unprofitable. The wise one thinks, this thing done unpleasantly, leads me 
to the profitable, so he does it and it leads him to the profitable.</P>
<P>There bhikkhus, in doing this thing done pleasantly leading to the 
unprofitable, the fool and the wise one should be known by the manly power, 
manly effort and manly attainment. The fool does not think, this thing done 
pleasantly, leads me to the unprofitable, so he does it and it leads him to the 
unprofitable. The wise one thinks, this thing done pleasantly, leads me to the 
unprofitable, so he does not do it and it leads him to the profitable.</P>
<P>There bhikkhus, in doing this thing done pleasantly leading to the 
profitable, it should be done on two counts. I think it should be done, as it is 
done pleasantly and it should be done as it is profitable. Therefore it should 
be done on both counts. Bhikkhus, these are the four achievements.
