"These are five ways of subduing hatred by which, when hatred arises in a monk, he should wipe it out completely. Which five?
<p>
"When one gives birth to hatred for an individual, one should develop good will for that individual. Thus the hatred for that individual should be subdued.
<p>
"When one gives birth to hatred for an individual, one should develop compassion for that individual...equanimity toward that individual...one should pay him no mind &amp; pay him no attention...When one gives birth to hatred for an individual, one should direct one's thoughts to the fact of his being the product of his kamma: 'This venerable one is the doer of his kamma, heir of his kamma, born of his kamma, related by his kamma, and is dependent on his kamma. Whatever kamma he does, for good or for evil, to that will he fall heir.' Thus the hatred for that individual should be subdued.

"These are five ways of subduing hatred by which, when hatred arises in a monk, he should wipe it out completely."
