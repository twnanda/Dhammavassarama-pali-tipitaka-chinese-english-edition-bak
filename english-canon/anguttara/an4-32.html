"There are these four grounds for the bonds of fellowship. Which four? Generosity, kind words, beneficial help, consistency. These are the four grounds for the bonds of fellowship."
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Generosity, kind words, beneficial help,<br>
&amp; consistency in the face of events,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in line with what's appropriate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in each case, each case.<br>
<A NAME="linchpin">These bonds</A> of fellowship [function] in the world<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like the linchpin in a moving cart.
<p>
Now, if these bonds of fellowship were lacking,<br>
a mother would not receive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the honor &amp; respect owed by her child,<br>
nor would a father receive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what his child owes him.<br>
But because the wise show regard<br>
for these bonds of fellowship,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they achieve greatness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and are praised.
