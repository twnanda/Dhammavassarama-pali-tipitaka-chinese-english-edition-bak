<P>3. Saükhittasutta,m- In short. </P>
<P>63. A certain bhikkhu approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on side and 
said: </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, it is suitable that The Blessed One should teach me in short, 
hearing which I would withdraw from the crowd, alone, abide diligent to dispel." 
</P>
<P>ßIn this manner, a certain foolish man entreats me. To teach, they think to 
follow me only,. Saying: `Teach me in short! Well Gone One teach me in short! 
The words of The Blessed One would be of much use, to become an heir of the 
Teaching.' Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train in this manner:</P>
<P>`My mind will be internally well established. My mind should not be overcome 
by arisen demeritorious things. When your mind is internally well established 
not overcome by arisen demeritorious things, then you should train thus-'The 
release in loving kindness to me is well developed, made much, made a habit, 
thoroughly practised to carry on, undisturbed, as an undertaking.</P>
<P>Bhikkhu, when that concentration is well developed and made much, it develops 
with thoughts and with discursive thoughts, without thoughts it develops 
discursively, it develops without thoughts and without discursive thoughts. The 
concentration develops with joy and without joy. It develops with agreeability 
and with equanimity</P>
<P>Bhikkhu, when the concentration is thus developed and thoroughly developed, 
you should further train thus: 'The release in compassion,....re..... The 
release in intrinsic joy, ....re.... The release in equanimity to me is well 
developed, made much, made a habit, thoroughly practised to carry on, 
undisturbed, as an undertaking.</P>
<P>Bhikkhu, when that concentration is well developed and made much, it develops 
with thoughts and with discursive thoughts, without thoughts it develops 
discursively, it develops without thoughts and without discursive thoughts. The 
concentration develops with joy and without joy. It develops with agreeability 
and with equanimity</P>
<P>Bhikkhu, when the concentration is thus developed and thoroughly developed, 
you should further train thus: I will abide reflecting the body in the body 
mindful and aware to dispel covetousness and displeasure in the world. </P>
<P>Bhikkhu, when that concentration is well developed and made much, it develops 
with thoughts and with discursive thoughts, without thoughts it develops 
discursively, it develops without thoughts and without discursive thoughts. The 
concentration develops with joy and without joy. It develops with agreeability 
and with equanimity</P>
<P>Bhikkhu, when the concentration is thus developed and thoroughly developed, 
you should further train thus: I will abide reflecting feelings in feelings 
mindful and aware to dispel covetousness and displeasure in the world. I will 
abide reflecting the mental states in the mind mindful and aware to dispel 
covetousness and displeasure in the world. I will abide reflecting thoughts in 
the Teaching, mindful and aware to dispel covetousness and displeasure in the 
world. </P>
<P>Bhikkhu, when that concentration is well developed and made much, it develops 
with thoughts and with discursive thoughts, without thoughts it develops 
discursively, it develops without thoughts and without discursive thoughts. The 
concentration develops with joy and without joy. It develops with agreeability 
and with equanimity</P>
<P>Bhikkhu, when the concentration is thus developed thoroughly developed, 
wherever you move, you move with ease, wherever you stand, you stand with ease, 
wherever you sit, you sit with ease, wherever you lie, you lie with ease."</P>
<P>That bhikkhu thus advised by The Blessed One, got up from his seat, 
worshipped and circumambulated The Blessed One and went away. That bhikkhu alone 
and withdrawn from the crowd, abode diligent to dispel. And before long, for 
whatever purpose sons of clansmen rightfully leave the household and become 
homeless, that noble end of the holy life, he here and now by himself realizing 
abode. He thoroughly knew, birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived, what 
should be done is done, there is nothing more to wish. He became a worthy one. 
</P>
<P>4. Gayàsãsasuttaü.- At the source of river Gaya.</P>
<P>64. At one time The Blessed One was abiding at the source of river Gaya. From 
there The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: </P>
<P>ßBhikkhus, when I was a seeker of enlightenment, not yet enlightened, I 
perceived light did not see forms.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it occured to me: `If I perceive light and see forms, my knowledge 
and vision should be more pure'</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in the meantime I abode diligent to dispel and perceived light and 
saw forms. I did not stand with those gods did not talk with them and discuss 
with them. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it occured to me-'If I perceive light, see forms, stand with those 
gods, talk and discuss with them, my knowledge and vision will be still more 
pure</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in the meantime I abode diligent to dispel and perceived light, saw 
forms stood with them, talked and discussed with them. Yet did not know, to 
which clan of gods they belonged. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it occured to me-'If I perceive light, see forms, stand with those 
gods, talk and discuss with them, and know to which clan of gods they belonged 
my knowledge and vision will be still more pure</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in the meantime I abode diligent to dispel and perceived light, saw 
forms stood with them, talked and discussed with them and knew, to which and 
which clans of gods they belonged- Yet I did not know, these gods disappeared 
from here and were born there as a result of this action.....re.....I knew those 
gods -'These gods as a result of this action disappeared from here and were born 
there':.....re......I knew those gods-'On account of this action disappearing 
from here were born there. I did not know, these gods on account of this action 
enjoyed these supports and these pleasant and unpleasant feelings ....re..... I 
knew those gods on account of this action enjoyed these supports and these 
pleasant and unpleasant feelings. I did not know on account of this action these 
gods enjoyed long life and a long standing - I knew on account of this action 
these gods enjoyed long life and this long standing. Yet I did not know whether 
I lived with them earlier or did not lived with them earlier</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it occured to me:If I perceive light, see forms, stand with those 
gods, talk and discuss with them, and know these gods belong to this clan of 
gods. These gods disappeared from here and were born there on account of this 
action. And know those gods enjoyed these supports and these pleasant and 
unpleasant feelings and know these gods enjoyed long life and a long standing on 
accout of the results of this action my knowledge and vision will be still more 
pure</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in the meantime I abode diligent to dispel and perceived light, saw 
forms stood with them, talked and discussed with them and knew, to which and 
which clans of gods they belonged- I knew, these gods disappeared from here and 
were born there as a result of this action. I knew those gods on account of this 
action enjoyed these supports and these pleasant and unpleasant feelings 
....re..... I knew those gods on account of this action enjoyed these supports 
and these pleasant and unpleasant feelings. I knew on account of this action 
these gods enjoyed long life and this long standing. I knew whether I lived with 
them earlier or did not lived with them earlier</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, until my knowledge and vision of higher gods in this eightfold 
cycle was completely pure I did not acknowledge my rightful enlightenment to the 
world together with its gods Mara, Brahma and to the Community of recluses and 
Brahmins.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, when my knowledge and vision of higher gods in this eightfold cycle 
was completely pure I acknowledged my rightful enlightenment to the world 
together with its gods Mara, Brahma and the Community of recluses and Brahmins. 
Knowledge and vision arose to me, my release of mind was immovable. This is my 
last birth. Now there is no more birth. </P>
<P>5. Abhibhàyatanasuttaü- Stations of mastery over the senses</P>
<P>65.Bhikkhus, these eight are the stations of mastery over the senses. What

external forms. Mastering them he becomes perceptive as I know and see. This is 
the first mastery over the senses. </P>

<P>With material sees matter. This is the first release. </P>
<P>With internal immaterial perception sees external forms. This is the second 
release. </P>
<P>Is released in good only. This is the third release. </P>
<P>Overcoming all perceptions of matter and perceptions of aversion not 
attending to various perceptions, with space is boundless abides in the sphere 
of space. This is the fourth release. </P>
<P>Overcoming all the sphere of space, with consciousness is boundless abides in 
the sphere of consciousness. This is the fifth release. </P>

<P>Bhikkhus, I know of the approach of innumerable hundreds of warrior 
gatherings. Then too I sit as I was sitting earlier, talk what I was talking 
earlier and discuss the topic I was earlier discussing. Then whatever be their 
shade, my shade is that same, whatever be their intonation, that same is my 
intonation. I advise, incite and make their hearts light. While talking I do not

<P>10. Bhåmicàlasuttaü- Earthquakes</P>
<P>70. At one time The Blessed One was living in the gabled hall in the Great 
forest in Vesali. The Blessed One putting on robes in the morning, taking bowl 
and robes entered Vesali for alms. Wandering the alms round in Vesali, returning 
from the alms round after the meal was over, addressed venerable Ananda: Ananda, 
take a seat and let us approach the Capala monument to spend the day. Venerable 
Ananda consenting, took a seat and followed close behind The Blessed One. </P>
<P>The Blessed One approached the Capala monument, sat on the prepared seat and 
addressed venerable Ananda: </P>
<P>ßAnanda, Vesali is pleasant, the Udena monument is pleasant, the Gotamaka 
monument is pleasant, the Sattamba monument is pleasant, the Bahuputtaka 
monument is pleasant, Sarandada monument is pleasant and the Capala monument is 
pleasant. </P>
<P>Ananda, whoever has developed, made much, mastered, practised thoroughly, 
could carry out undisturbed the four psychic powers, could if he desired live 
until the end of the world cycle or even more. Ananda, the Thus Gone One has 
developed, made much, mastered, practised thoroughly, could carry out 
undisturbed the four psychic powers, and if he desired could live until the end 
of the world cycle or even more. Even when The Blessed One was giving this ample 
sign, gross appearance venerable Ananda did not realize it and did not entreat, 
`May The Blessed One abide through out the world cycle, for the good of many, 
out of compassion for the world, for the welfare and pleasantness of gods and 
men.' his mind being overwhelmed by Mara.</P>
<P>For the second time....re....for the third time The Blessed One said:Ananda, 
Vesali is pleasant, the Udena monument is pleasant, the Gotamaka monument is 
pleasant, the Sattamba monument is pleasant, the Bahuputtaka monument is 
pleasant, Sarandada monument is pleasant and the Capala monument is pleasant. 
</P>
<P>Ananda, whoever has developed, made much, mastered, practised thoroughly, 
could carry out undisturbed the four psychic powers, could if he desired live 
until the end of the world cycle or even more. Ananda, the Thus Gone One has 
developed, made much, mastered, practised thoroughly, could carry out 
undisturbed the four psychic powers, and if he desired could live until the end 
of the world cycle or even more. Even when The Blessed One was giving this ample 
sign, gross appearance venerable Ananda did not realize it and did not entreat, 
`May The Blessed One abide through out the world cycle, for the good of many, 
out of compassion for the world, for the welfare and pleasantness of gods and 
men.' his mind being overwhelmed by Mara. </P>
<P>Then The Blessed One addressed venerable Ananda: ßAnanda, you may go now." 
Venerable Ananda, consenting got up from his seat, worshipped and 
circumambulated The Blessed One and sat under a tree not far away from there. 
Soon after venerable Ananda had gone death the evil one said to The Blessed 
One:</P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, Blessed One, now pass into final extinction! Well Gone One, 
now pass into final extinction! Venerable sir, The Blessed One has said these 
words: </P>
<P>`Evil One, I will not pass into final extinction until my bhikkhus become my 
disciples, who are learned, trained, confident and have ended unpleasantness. 
Until they have heard much, bearing what they have heard lead a life of mutual 
understanding according to the Teaching. Until they have learned from their 
teacher to explain, to establish, to uncover, to classify and to make manifest, 
by teaching with wonders to turn out arisen wrong views. Venerable sir, there 
are disciples of The Blessed One at present who are learned, trained, confident, 
have ended unpleasantness. They have heard much, bear what they have heard, lead 
a life of mutual understanding living according to the Teaching. Learning from 
their teacher to explain, establish, uncover, classify and make manifest, they 
teach with wonders to turn out arisen wrong views. </P>
<P>Venerable sir, Blessed One, now pass into final extinction! Well Gone One, 
now pass into final extinction! Venerable sir, The Blessed One has said these 
words: </P>
<P>`Evil One, I will not pass into final extinction until my 
bhikkhunis,....re..üy male lay disciples, ....re... my female lay disciples are 
learned, trained, confident and have ended unpleasantness. Until they have heard 
much, bear what they have heard lead a life of mutual understanding according to 
the Teaching. Until they have learned from their teacher to explain, to 
establish, to uncover, to classify and to make manifest, by teaching with 
wonders to turn out arisen wrong views. Venerable sir, there are female lay 
disciples of The Blessed One at present who are learned, trained, confident, 
have ended unpleasantness. They have heard much, bear what they have heard, lead 
a life of mutual understanding, living according to the Teaching. Learning from 
their teacher to explain, establish, uncover, classify and make manifest, they 
teach with wonders to turn out arisen wrong views. </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, Blessed One, now pass into final extinction! Well Gone One, 
now pass into final extinction! Venerable sir, The Blessed One has said these 
words: </P>
<P>`Evil One, I will not pass into final extinction until the holy life becomes 
oppulent and wide spread gone to the general populace until it is well 
established among gods and men. Venerable sir, at present the holy life has 
become oppulent, wide spread, gone to the general populace and has got well 
established among gods and men. </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, Blessed One, now pass into final extinction! Well Gone One, 
now pass into final extinction!"</P>
<P>ßEvil One, do not worry!. Before long the final extinction of The Blessed One 
will take place. At the end of another three months the Thus Gone One will pass 
into final extinction." </P>
<P>Then The Blessed One with mindful awareness gave up the intention to live at 
the Capala monument. When The Blessed One gave up the intention to live, there 
was an awe inspiring earthquake, with thunder and it made the hairs to stand on 
end. The Blessed One knowing its meaning uttered this solemn utterance that 
moment. </P>
<P>The sage gave up the intentions small and large,</P>
<P>Internally concentrated he broke up the need `to be'.</P>
<P>As though breaking the armour. </P>
<P>Then it occured to venerable Ananda, what is the reason for that awe 
inspiring earthquake?</P>
<P>Venerable Ananda, approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on side and 
said: </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, there was a great earthquake with thunder and it made the 
hairs to stand on end. Venerable sir, what is the reason for that awe inspiring 
earthquake?"</P>
<P>ßAnanda, on account of these eight reasons awe inspiring earthquakes take 
place. What eight? </P>
<P>Ananda, the great earth is settled in water, water is settled in air and air 
is settled in space. There is a time when a great wind blows and agitates the 
water. The agitated water agitates the earth Ananda, this is the first reason 
for the occurance of a great earthquake. </P>
<P>Again, Ananda, a recluse, a Brahmin or a very powerful god who has power over 
his mind develops a little of the perception of earth and immeasurable 
perception of water and causes this earth to quake, tremble and shiver. Ananda, 
this is the second reason for the occurance of a great earthquake. </P>
<P>Again, Ananda, when the one seeking enlightenment disappears from the gods of 
pleasantness and mindful and aware enters the mother's womb, then this earth 
quakes, trembles and shivers. Ananda, this is the third reason for the occurance 
of a great earthquake. </P>
<P>Again, Ananda, when the one seeking enlightenment mindful and aware leaves 
the mother's womb, this earth quakes, trembles and shivers. Ananda, this is the 
fourth reason for the occurance of a great earthquake.</P>
<P>Again, Ananda, when the Thus Gone One realizes rightful enlightenment, this 
earth quakes, trembles and shivers. Ananda, this is the fifth reason for the 
occurance of a great earthquake. </P>
<P>Again, Ananda, when the Thus Gone One, sets rolling the wheel of the 
Teaching, this earth quakes, trembles and shivers. Ananda, this is the sixth 
reason for the occurance of a great earthquake. </P>
<P>Again, Ananda, when the Thus Gone One, mindful and aware gives up the 
intentions of living, this earth quakes, trembles and shivers. Ananda, this is 
the seventh reason for the occurance of a great earthquake.</P>
<P>Again, Ananda, when the Thus Gone One extinguishes in the element of 
extinction this earth quakes, trembles and shivers. Ananda, this is the eighth 
reason for the occurance of a great earthquake.</P>
<P>Ananda, on account of these eight reasons awe inspiring earthquakes take 
place.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
