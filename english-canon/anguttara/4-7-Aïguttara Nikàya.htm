<P>Householder, these four things, pleasing and agreeable for worldly pleasure 
and charm are rare in the world. What four?</P>
<P>May wealth arise to me rightfully. This is the first thing rare in the world, 
pleasing and agreeable for worldly pleasure and charm. When wealth is obtained 
rightfully may my fame spread together with my relatives and Master. This is the 
second thing rare in the world, pleasing and agreeable for worldly pleasure and 
charm. Wealth is obtained rightfully, my fame has spread together with my 
relatives and Master. May I live long protected. This is the third thing rare in

and Master. At the end of a long protected life, securing a place in heaven, may 
I be born there. This is the fourth thing rare in the world, pleasing and 
agreeable for worldly pleasure and charm.</P>
<P>Householder, these four rare things in the world, are pleasing and agreeable 
for worldly pleasure and charm. .</P>
<P>Householder, these four rare things in the world, pleasing and agreeable for 
worldly pleasure and charm, conduce to the gain of four things. What four?</P>
<P>The attainment of faith, virtues, generosity and wisdom.</P>
<P>Householder, what is the attainment of faith?</P>

of the Thus Gone One:-The Blessed One is worthy, rightfully enlightened, is 
endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, is the incomparable tamer of 
those to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened and Blessed. 
Householder, to this is called the attainment of faith.</P>
<P>Householder, what is the attainment of virtues?</P>
<P>Here, householder, the noble disciple abstains from destroying living things, 
taking the not given, misbehaving in sexual desires, telling lies, taking 
intoxicant and brewd drinks,</P>
<P>Householder, to this is called the attainment of virtues.</P>

miserliness and its stains, his mind released through benevolence, is open 
handed attached to giving to those in need, he abides making arrangements to 
give gifts.</P>
<P>Householder, to this is called the attainment of generosity.</P>
<P>Householder, what is the attainment of wisdom?</P>
<P>Householder, the mind of one abiding, overcome by covetousness and greed, 
does what should not be done and fails to do what should be done and whatever 
obtainable pleasantness flees from him. Householder, the mind of one abiding, 
overcome by hatefulness, does what should not be done and fails to do what

whatever obtainable pleasantness flees from him. Householder, the mind of one 
abiding, overcome by doubts, does what should not be done and fails to do what

minor defilement of the mind dispels it. Knowing that hatefulness is a minor 
defilement of the mind dispels it. Knowing that sloth and torpor is a minor 
defilement of the mind dispels it. Knowing that restlessness and worry is a

and doubts are minor defilements of the mind and dispel them it is said that the 
noble disciple has attained great spread out wisdom which sees the respective 
field of conscioussness. This is the attainment of wisdom.</P>

worldly pleasure and charm, conduce to the gain of these four things.</P>

with his own hands, while sweat was dripping, the noble disciple, pleases 
himself lives enjoying pleasure, pleases wife, children, slaves and workmen and 
makes them enjoy life. Pleases friends and co-associates. This is his first 
achievement and restoration of actions within his sphere.</P>

toiling with his own hands, while sweat was dripping, the noble disciple, makes 
himself safe by investing for a misfortune from fire, water, the king, from 
robbers, from unwelcome inheriters, or such like disaster. This is his second

taming themselves, and others extinguished. This is his fourth achievement and 
restoration of actions within his sphere.</P>
<P>Householder, with the rightfully amassed wealth, by arousing effort toiling 
with his own hands while sweat was dripping, the noble disciple does these four 
achievements and restorations of actions within his sphere. Householder, 
whosever wealth gets exhausted other than in these four achievements and 
restorations it is said to be put below the ground, thrown away and not enjoyed 
through the senses. Householder, if wealth gets exhausted in these four 
achievements and restorations, it is said to be put to good use not thrown away 
and enjoyed through the senses.</P>
<P>I have amassed wealth, partaken it, sustained others and left for 
misfortune,</P>
<P>Have given gifts to the highest and made the five offerings.</P>
<P>I have attended on the restrained, virtuous leading a holy life.</P>
<P>For whatever reason wise householders earn wealth,</P>
<P>That I have attained, there is no remorse</P>
<P>Humans aware of death, established in the noble teaching</P>
