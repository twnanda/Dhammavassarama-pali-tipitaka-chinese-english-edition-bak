said:-</P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, why do quarrels, taking sides and disputes arise to the 
bhikkhu which take away the pleasant abiding of the bhikkhu? </P>
<P>ßHere, Upali, the bhikkhu shows the non-Teaching as the Teaching and the 
Teaching as the non-Teaching. The non-discipline as the discipline and the 
discipline as the non discipline. The not told and not declared by the Thus Gone 
One as told and declared by the Thus Gone One. The told and declared by the Thus 
Gone One as the not told and not declared by the Thus Gone One. The not

Upali, on account of these reasons, quarrels, taking sides and disputes arise to

<P>44. At one time The Blessed One was living in the Baliharana forest stretch 
in Kusinara. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from there:- </P>
<P>ßBhikkhus, a bhikkhu intending to accuse another bhikkhu should internally 
reflect five things in himself, and be internally established in five things and 
then accuse. What five things should he internally reflect in himself ? </P>
<P>The accusing bhikkhu should reflect thus:-Am I with pure bodily behaviour, 
endowed with matchlessly unfishered bodily behaviour. Are these things evident 
in me or not? If the bhikkhu be without pure bodily behaviour, without 
matchlessly unfishered bodily behaviour, there may be someone who tells- Come on 
bhikkhu! You first train in bodily good conduct. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the accusing bhikkhu should reflect thus:-Am I with pure 
verbal behaviour, endowed with matchlessly unfishered verbal behaviour. Are 
these things evident in me or not? If the bhikkhu be without pure verbal 
behaviour, without matchlessly unfishered verbal behaviour, there may be someone 
who tells- Come on bhikkhu! You first train in verbal good conduct.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the accusing bhikkhu should reflect thus:-Am I established 
in loving kindness towards the co-associates in the holy life, without aversion 
Are these things evident in me or not? If the bhikkhu be without established 
loving kindness towards co-associates in the holy life without aversion, there 
may be someone who tells- Come on bhikkhu! You first establish yourself in 
thoughts of loving kindness towards co-associates in the holy life</P>
<P>Again, the accusing bhikkhu should reflect thus:-Am I learned do I bear and 
accumulate the Teaching which is good at the beginning, middle and end, full of 
meanings even in the letters and declaring the complete and pure holy life. Am I 
learned in that Teaching, to recite by words, to experience it with the mind and 
penetrating it and have I come to right view? Are these things evident in me or 
not? If the bhikkhu is not learned, does not bear and accumulate the teaching 
which is good at the beginning, middle and end full of meanings even in the 
letters, declaring the pure and complete holy life. Could not recite by words, 
experience it in the mind and penetrating it come to right view, there may be 
someone who says:- Come on bhikkhu! You first learn the Teaching. </P>
<P>Again, the accusing bhikkhu should reflect thus:-Is the higher code of rules 
ingrained in me in detail and well gone home, to explain, to uphold, to judge, 
by way of discourses and by way of words in them.. Are these things evident in 
me or not? If the higher code of rules be not ingrained in the bhikkhu with 
details and well gone home, to explain, to uphold, to judge, by way of 
discourses and by way of words, there may be someone who tells- Come on bhikkhu! 
You first train in the discipline.. </P>
<P>In what five things should he be internally established? </P>
<P>I will talk at the right time, never out of time. I will talk the truth, 
never the untruthful. I will talk gently, never roughly. I will talk desiring 
the good and not desiring evil. And I will talk with loving kindness without 
aversion. These five things should be internally established. Bhikkhus, a 
bhikkhu intending to accuse another bhikkhu should internally reflect five 
things in himself, and be internally established in five things and then accuse.

<P>45. `Bhikkhus, these ten are the dangers of entering the inner chamber of the 
palace. What ten?</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, here the king sits with the queen. The bhikkhu enters the inner 
chamber. Either the queen smiles seeing the bhikkhu or the bhikkhu smiles seeing 
the queen. Then it occurs to the king:-'Indeed, these two are friendly or will 
be friendly.' Bhikkhus, this is the first danger in entering the inner chamber 
of the palace. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the king has much work to do, a lot of duties. He does not 
recall of a certain woman's coming. She conceives on account of him Then it 
occurs to the king:-'None other than the bhikkhu enter the inner chamber. It is 
the work of the bhikkhu' Bhikkhus, this is the second danger in entering the 
inner chamber of the palace. </P>
<P>Again bhikkhus, the king loses a certain gem Then it occurs to the 
king:-'None other than the bhikkhu enters this, it is the work of the bhikkhu' 
Bhikkhus, this is the third danger in entering the inner chamber of the palace. 
</P>
<P>Again bhikkhus, a secret talk in the inner chamber of the palace goes to 
external ears Then it occurs to the king:-'None other than the bhikkhu enters 
this, it is the work of the bhikkhu' Bhikkhus, this is the fourth danger in 
entering the inner chamber of the palace. </P>
<P>Again bhikkhus, the king and the royal prince have a secret talk in the inner 
chamber Then it occurs to them:-'None other than the bhikkhu enters this, it is 
the work of the bhikkhu' Bhikkhus, this is the fifth danger in entering the 
inner chamber of the palace.</P>
<P>Again bhikkhus, the king raises the status of a certain one to a upper level 
Then it occurs to those displeased about it: -'The king is friendly with the 
bhikkhu, this, is the work of the bhikkhu' Bhikkhus, this is the sixth danger in 
entering the inner chamber of the palace. </P>
<P>Again bhikkhus, the king lowers the status of a certain one to a lower level 
Then it occurs to those displeased about it: -'The king is friendly with the 
bhikkhu, this, is the work of the bhikkhu' Bhikkhus, this is the seventh danger 
in entering the inner chamber of the palace. </P>
<P>Again bhikkhus, the king dismisses the army at some unsuitable monment. Then 
it occurs to those displeased about it: -'The king is friendly with the bhikkhu, 
this is the work of the bhikkhu' Bhikkhus, this is the eighth danger in entering 
the inner chamber of the palace. </P>
<P>Again bhikkhus, the king dismisses the army at the suitable time and when 
going away stops itòhen it occurs to those displeased about it: -'The king is 
friendly with the bhikkhu, this, is the work of the bhikkhu' Bhikkhus, this is 
the nineth danger in entering the inner chamber of the palace. </P>
<P>Again bhikkhus, the king assembles an elephant show, a horse show, a chariot 
show, and an exhibition of forms, sounds, scents, tastes and touches which is 
not suitable for the bhikkhu' Bhikkhus, this is the tenth danger in entering the 
inner chamber of the palace. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these ten are the dangers of entering the inner chamber of the 
palace.</P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>

Kapilavatthu in the country of the Sakyas. On that full moon day many Sakyas

thus to the Sakya disciples seated on a side:-</P>

<P>ßYes, venerable sir. </P>
<P>Sakyas, if this man earned a hundred coins, a thousand coins every day and 
accumulated whatever he earned for a period of hundred years, living a hundred 
years would he have a great mass of wealth? </P>
<P>ßYes, venerable sir. </P>
<P>ßSakyas, do you think that this man, owing his treasured great wealth, would 
experience only pleasantness for one night, one day, for half the night, for 
half the day? </P>
<P>ßNo, venerable sir. </P>
<P>ßWhat is the reason? </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, sensual pleasures are impermanent, low, false and deluding 
things. </P>
<P>ßHere, Sakyas. my disciples abiding diligently, zealous to dispel for ten

<P>Someone gone forth should constantly reflect, `I agreeably chose to be one 
without a caste.' Should constantly reflect, `I rely on others for my 
livelihood.' Should constantly reflect, `my appearance should be made 
different.' Should constantly reflect, `does myself blame me about my virtues.' 
Should constantly reflect `don't wise co-associates in the holy life blame me 
for my virtues.' Should constantly reflect, `all my near and dear ones change 
and turn otherwise.' Should constantly reflect, `I am the owner of actions, the 
inheritor, the origin, the relation and refuge of actions. Whatever actions I 
do, good or evil I will be their inheritor.' Should constantly reflect, `how do 
my night and day wear out.' Should constantly reflect, `do I delight in an empty 
house.' Should constantly reflect, `do I have some noble knowledge and vision

<P>50. At one time The Blessed One was abiding in the monastery offered by 
Anathapindika in Jeta's grove in savatthi. At that time many bhikkhus after the 
meal was over returning from the alms round were assembled in the attendance 
hall. Gathered and seated, they were quarrelling and disputing and were showing 
the weapon in their mouth to each other. </P>
<P>In the evening The Blessed One getting up from his seclusion approached the 
attendance hall and sat on the prepared seat. Then The Blessed One addressed the 
bhikkhus:-</P>
<P>ßBhikkhus, with what talk were you gathered and seated now and what was the 
other conversation? </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, after the meal was over and returning from the alms round, we 
were assembled and seated in the attendance hall with a quarrel, disputing. We 
were showing the weapon in our mouths to each other and disputing. </P>
<P>ßBhikkhus, it is not suitable for clansmen like you who have gone forth out 
of faith to abide with a dispute and quarrel and show the weapon in your mouth 
to each other. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these ten things are conducive to friendliness, for reverence, to 
bring together to give up disputes and for unity. What ten? </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is virtuous restrained in the higher code of 
rules, abides seeing fear in the slightest fault. Bhikkhus, this is a thing 
conducive to friendliness, to be loved, to be revered, to give up disputes, to 
bring together and for unity.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu becomes learned, bears and accumulates the 
Teaching which is good at the beginning, middle and end, full of meanings even 
in the letters and stating the complete and pure holy life. That Teaching he 
recites and practises by words, and experiences it with the mind and 
penetratingly sees it to straighten his view. Bhikkhus, this is a thing 
conducive to friendliness, to be loved, to be revered, to give up disputes, to 
bring together and for unity</P>
<P>Again bhikkhus, the bhikkhu becomes a spiritual friend, a good associate with 
good friendship. Bhikkhus, this is a thing conducive to friendliness, to be 
loved, to be revered, to give up disputes, to bring together and for unity</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is suave, with gentle manners, accepting advice 
patiently. Bhikkhus, this is a thing, conducive to friendliness, to be loved, to 
be revered, to give up disputes, to bring together and for unity.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus the bhikkhu is with aroused effort, clever and discriminative 
in doing or getting done whatever things small or large that have to be done for 
the co-associates in the holy life. Bhikkhus, this is a thing, conducive to 
friendliness, to be loved, to be revered, to give up disputes, to bring together 
and for unity</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu attached to the Teaching, talks delightedly 
about the higher aspects of the Teaching and discipline. Bhikkhus, this is a 
thing, conducive to friendliness, to be loved, to be revered, to give up 
disputes, to bring together and for unity</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu abides with aroused effort to dispel 
demeritorious things, to accumulate meritorious things, firm not giving up the 
main aim in meritorious things. Bhikkhus, this too is a thing, conducive to 
friendliness, to be loved, to be revered, to give up disputes, to bring together 
and for unity</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is satisfied with whatever gain of robes, morsel 
food, dwellings and requisites when ill. Bhikkhus, this too is a thing, 
conducive to friendliness, to be loved, to be revered, to give up disputes, to 
bring together and for unity.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is with the highest prudent mindfulness, calling 
and recalling things told and heard long ago. Bhikkhus, this too is a thing, 
conducive to friendliness, to be loved, to be revered, to give up disputes, to 
bring together and for unity. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is endowed with wisdom, about the rising and 
fading of the five holding masses, for the noble ones' penetration to rightfully 
end unpleasantness. Bhikkhus, this too is a thing, conducive to friendliness, to 
be loved, to be revered, to give up disputes, to bring together and for unity. 
Bhikkhus, these ten things are conducive to friendliness, for reverence, to 
bring together to give up disputes and for unity.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
