<hr>
"Wise &amp; mindful, you should develop immeasurable concentration [i.e., concentration based on immeasurable good will, compassion, appreciation, or equanimity]. When, wise &amp; mindful, one has developed immeasurable concentration, five realizations arise right within oneself. Which five?
<p>
"The realization arises right within oneself that 'This concentration is blissful in the present and will result in bliss in the future.'
<p>
"The realization arises right within oneself that 'This concentration is noble &amp; not connected with the baits of the flesh.'
<p>
"The realization arises right within oneself that 'This concentration is not obtained by base people.'
<p>
"The realization arises right within oneself that 'This concentration is peaceful, exquisite, the acquiring of serenity, the attainment of unity, not kept in place by the fabrications of forceful restraint.'
<p>
"The realization arises right within oneself that 'I enter into this concentration mindfully, and mindfully I emerge from it.'
<p>
"Wise &amp; mindful, you should develop immeasurable concentration. When, wise &amp; mindful, one has developed immeasurable concentration, these five realizations arise right within oneself."
