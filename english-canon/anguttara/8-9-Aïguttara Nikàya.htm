<P>009.02. Then venerable Punniya approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on 
a side and said:</P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, what is the reason that on a certain day the teachings of The 
Blessed One becomes evident to me and on another day it does not become evident 
to me?"</P>
<P>ßPunniya, the bhikkhu has faith, does not approach the Thus Gone One and the 
Teachings do not become evident to him. Punniya, when the bhikkhu has faith and 
approaches the Thus Gone One, the Teachings become evident to him. Punniya, when 
the bhikkhu has faith and approaches does not associate, ....re....associates,

questions him, listens attentively, learns the Teaching, bears it in mind, 
searches meanings in the Teaching he has heard, learning the meanings in the 
Teaching he lives according to the Teaching. In this manner the Teachings of the

sects?"</P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, The Blessed One is our leader, The Blessed One is our refuge. 
It is suitable that the meaning is evident to The Blessed One, hearing it from 
The Blessed One the bhikkhus will bear it in mind."</P>
<P>ßThen bhikkhus, I will tell, attend carefully and listen. Bhikkhus, if 
wandering ascetics of other sects ask you-'Friends, what is the origin, the

authority, ennobled in what and finding what as the essence are all things. You 
should reply the wandering ascetics thus: Friends, the origin of all things is 
interest, its beginning is attention, all things arise with a contact, they move 
with feelings, the foremost for all things is concentration, the authority for 
all things is mindfulness, all things are ennobled in wisdom and the essence for 
all things is release. Bhikkhus, you should reply the wandering ascetics of 
other sects thus." </P>

<P>009.06. At one time The Blessed One was touring the country of Kosala with a 
large Community of bhikkhus and entered the Brahmin hamlet Icchanagala and lived 
in the forest stretch of Icchanagala. The Brahmin householders of Icchanagtala 
heard that the good recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyas gone forth from the 
Sakya clan has come to Icchanagala and lives in the forest stretch there. The 
good name, spread about that good Gotama- That Blessed One is worthy, rightfully 
enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, the incomparable 
tamer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened and Blessed. He 
teaches to this world together with its gods, Mara, Brahma and the community of 
recluses and Brahmins, the Teaching he had known and realized, good at the 
beginning, in the middle and the end, purely and completely explaining the holy 
life. It is good to see such worthy ones. Then the Brahmin householders of 
Icchanagala at the end of that night carrying a lot of eatables and nourishments 
approached the forest stretch of Icchangala, and they stood outside the entrance 
making a lot of noise. . </P>
<P>At that time venerable Nagita attended on The Blessed One and The Blessed One 
addressed venerable Nagita: Nagita, who makes such great noise, like hauling a 
catch of fish. Venerable sir, they are the Brahmin householders of Icchanagala 
standing outside, come with a lot of eatables and nourishments for The Blessed 
One and the Community of bhikkhus Nagita, I do not tolerate that eminent fame, 
the enjoyment of gain, honour and fameýay it not come to me. It is vile and 
sluggish pleasure in comparison to this emancipation from worldliness, the 
pleasures of seclusion, appeasement, enlightenment, non sensual pleasure gained 
for nothing and gained quickly. </P>
<P>Venerable sir, may The Blessed One tolerate. Well Gone One, it is the right 
time to give consent. Wherever The Blessed One inclines now, whether hamlet or 
state, the Brahmin householders too would bend, to that hamlet or state. Like 
huge drops of rain that fall would turn towards the inclines. In the same 
manner, wherever The Blessed One inclines now, whether hamlet or state, the 
Brahmin householders too would bend, to that hamlet or state. What is the 
reason? It is on account of the virtues and wisdom of The Blessed One. </P>
<P>Nagita, I do not tolerate that eminent fame, the enjoyment of gain, honour 
and fameýay it not come to me. It is vile and sluggish pleasure in comparison to 
this emancipation from worldliness, the pleasures of seclusion, appeasement, 
enlightenment, non sensual pleasure gained for nothing and gained quickly. The 
enjoyment of gain, honour and fame is a vile and sluggish pleasure. </P>
<P>Nagita, certain gods too do not enjoy this emanciption from worldliness, the 
pleasure of seclusion, appeasement, enlightenment, this non-sensual pleasure 
gained for nothing and gained quickly. Nagita, to you living with a crowd, 
living in a company, it occurs: `If this venerable one was not a gainer of this 
emancipation from worldliness, the pleasure of seclusion, appeasement, 
enlightenment, this non-sensual pleasure gained for nothing and gained quickly, 
he would have lived with the crowd, enjoying the company. </P>
<P>Here, Nagita, I see bhikkhus pointing fingers at each other joking and 
playing then it occurs to me: Since these venerable ones are not the gainers of 
this emancipation from worldliness, the pleasure of seclusion, appeasement, 
enlightenment, this non-sensual pleasure gained for nothing and gained quickly, 
which I now enjoy, they point fingers at each other, joke and play. </P>
<P>Nagita, I see bhikkhus, who eat as much as they like and abide enjoying the 
pleasure of sleep and sluggishness- Nagita, then it occurs to me:'Since these 
venerable ones are not the gainers of this emancipation from worldliness, the 
pleasure of seclusion, appeasement, enlightenment, this non-sensual pleasure 
gained for nothing and gained quickly, which I now enjoy, that they eat as much 
as they like and abide enjoying the pleasure of sleep and sluggishness </P>
<P>Nagita, I see bhikkhus, living in the out skirts of the village, seated 
distracted, then it occurs to me: These venerable ones either offend forest 
bhikkhus or novices, therefore they fall from their concentration. Nagita, then 
I am not pleased with their living in the out skirts of the village </P>
<P>Nagita, I see bhikkhus, living in the forest dozing away seated, then it 
occurs to me: These venerable ones dispelling their sleepiness should develop 
the perception of forest, attending to the perception of solidarity Nagita, then 
I am pleased with their living in the forest. </P>
<P>Nagita, I see bhikkhus, living in the forest seated distracted, then it 
occurs to me: These venerable ones either should concentrate their minds or 
should protect their concentrated minds Nagita, then I am not pleased with their 
living in the forest.</P>
<P>Nagita, I see bhikkhus, living in the forest, seated and concentrated, then 
it occurs to me: These venerable ones should either release their unreleased 
minds or protect their released mindsöagita, then I am not pleased with their 
living in the forest. </P>
<P>Nagita, I see bhikkhus, living in the out skirts of the village, the gainers 
of robes, morsel food, dwellings and requisites when ill òhey desiring that gain 
honour and fame give up forest dwellings and jungle paths and come to hamlets, 
villages and states and make their dwellings. Nagita, then I am not pleased with 
their living in the out skirts of the village </P>
<P>Nagita, I see bhikkhus, living in the forest, the gainers of robes, morsel

paths. Nagita, then I am pleased with their living in the forest. </P>
<P>Nagita, when I come to the highway, if I do not see anyone in front or 
behind, at that time I find it pleasant, at least for the purpose of urinating
