Thus Gone One is and is not after death is a speculation. The Thus Gone One 
neither is, nor is not after death is a speculation. Bhikkhu, the not learned 
ordinary man, does not know views, the arising of views, the cessation of views

is not released from birth, decay, death, grief, lament unpleasantness

noble disciple who knows and sees thus, does not announce the Thus Gone One is, 
after death. The Thus Gone One is not, after death. The Thus Gone One is and is 
not after death. The Thus Gone One neither is, nor is not after death. Thus the 
noble disciple knows and sees, that the not announced things are not announced.

<P>006.03. I heard thus. At one time The Blessed One was living among the Gijja 
peaks in Rajagahs. When the night was waning two gods illuminating the whole of 
the Gijja peaks with a resplendent light approached The Blessed One, worshipped 
and stood on a side. Standing one of the gods said thus to The Blessed One: 
ßVenerable sir, these bhikkhunis are released" The other one said: ßVenerable 
sir, these bhikkhunis are well released without substratum remaining." Saying 
it, they stood for the approval of the Teacher. Knowing that the Teacher 
approves, worshipped and circumambulated The Blessed One and disappeared from 
there. </P>
<P>The Blessed One at the end of that night addressed the bhikkhus:Bhikkhus, 
when last night was waning two gods illuminating the whole of the Gijja peaks 
with a resplendent light approached me, worshipped and stood on a side. Standing 
one of the gods said thus - ßVenerable sir, these bhikkhunis are released" The 
other one said: ßVenerable sir, these bhikkhunis are well released without 
substratum remaining." Saying it they stood for my approval. Knowing that I 
approve, worshipped, circumambulated me and disappeared from there. . </P>
<P>At that time venerable Mahamoggallana was seated close to The Blessed One, 
and it occured to venerable Mahamoggallana-"To which kind of gods does this 
knowledge be -when with substratum, is with substratum and when without 
substratum, is without substratum? At that time a bhikkhu named Tissa had passed 
away recently and was born in a certain Brahma world. He is very powerful and 
should know this."</P>
<P>Then venerable Mahamoggallana as a strong man would bend his stretched arm or 
stretch his bent arm disappeared from the Gijja peaks and appeared in the world 
of Brahma. Brahma Tissa seeing venerable Mahamoggallana approaching in the 
distance, said :Welome! Sir Moggallana! It is after a long time that you got 
this chance to come here. Sir, the seat is ready, take a seat. Venerable 
Mahamoggallana sat on the prepared seat and Brahma Tissa too worshipped 
venerable Mahamoggallana and sat on a side. Then venerable Mahamoggallana said 
to Brahma Tissa: "To which kind of gods does this knowledge be -when with 
substratum, is with substratum and when without substratum, is without 
substratum?" Sir, to gods born in the world of Brahma this knowledge arises. 
-when with substratum, is with substratum and when without substratum, is 
without substratum. </P>
<P>Tissa, does this knowledge -'when with substratum, is with substratum and 
when without substratum, is without substratum' arise to all gods in the world 
of Brahma? No, venerable sir, this knowledge -'when with substratum, is with 
substratum and when without substratum, is without substratum' does not arise to 
all gods in the world of Brahma.'</P>
<P>Venerable sir, those gods satisfied with the life span, beauty happiness, 
fame and authority of the world of Brahma, do not know of some escape more noble 
than that, as it really is. To them this knowledge -'when with substratum, is 
with substratum and when without substratum, is without substratum' does not 
arise. Venerable sir, those gods dissatisfied with the life span, beauty 
happiness, fame and authority of the world of Brahma, know of some escape more 
noble than that, as it really is. To them this knowledge -'when with substratum, 
is with substratum and when without substratum, is without substratum' arises. 
</P>
<P>Here, sir, Moggallana, there is a bhikkhu released bothwise. Those gods know 
him thus: `This venerable one is released bothwise. As long as his body will 
stand, they will show him to gods and men. After the break up of the body, they 
will not show him to gods and men. Thus sir, Moggallana, to those gods there is 
the knowledge 'when with substratum, is with substratum and when without 
substratum, is without substratum' </P>
<P>Here, sir, Moggallana, there is a bhikkhu released through wisdom. Those gods 
know him thus: `This venerable one is released through wisdom. As long as his 
body will stand, they will show him to gods and men. After the break up of the 
body, they will not show him to gods and men. Thus sir, Moggallana, to those 
gods there is the knowledge 'when with substratum, is with substratum and when 
without substratum, is without substratum' </P>
<P>Here, sir, Moggallana, there is a bhikkhu, a body witness. Those gods know 
him thus: `This venerable one is a body witness. If this venerable one partakes 
suitable dwellings, associates spiritual friends and conducts properly in the 
mental faculties for whatever reason sons of clansmen rightfully leave the 
household and become homeless that noble end of the holy life, he will 
undoubtedly attain here and now and realizing abide. Sir, Moggallana, in this 
manner too, to those gods there is the knowledge 'when with substratum, is with 
substratum and when without substratum, is without substratum' </P>
<P>Here, sir, Moggallana, there is a bhikkhu, one come to right view, .re.one 
released through faith, .re.one going the path of the Teaching, .reòhose gods 
know him thus: `This venerable one goes in the path of the Teaching. If this

Moggallana, in this manner too, to those gods there is the knowledge 'when with

<P>Then venerable Mahamoggallana as a strong man would bend his stretched arm or 
stretch his bent arm, disappeared from the world of Brahma, appeared among the 
Gijja peaks, approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and related 
the whole conversation that took place between him and the Brahma Tissa </P>
<P>ßMoggallana, didn't Brahma Tissa tell you about the seventh person, who 
abides without a sign?." Venerable sir, this is the time to teach about the 
person who abides without a sisgn The bhikkhus hearing it from The Blessed One 
will bear it. Then Moggallana, listen and attend carefully I will tell. 
Venerable Mahamoggallana conscnted and The Blessed One said: </P>
<P>Here, Moggallana, the bhikkhu not attending to any signs, abides in the 
concentration of no-sign. Those gods know him thus: `This venerable one not 
attending to any signs, abides in the concentration of no-sign. If this 
venerable one partakes suitable dwellings, associates spiritual friends and 
conducts properly in the mental faculties for whatever reason sons of clansmen 
rightfully leave the household and become homeless that noble end of the holy

<P>ßCould The Blessed One appoint the here and now results of giving gifts?" 
</P>
<P>ßSiha, I will cross question you on this and you may reply as it pleases you. 
Siha, there are two people of them one is without faith, selfish, greedy and 
abusive. The other has faith, is benevolent, is attached to administering and 
giving gifts. Noble ones showing compassion, to which one would they first show 
compassion is it to the one without faith, selfish, greedy and abusive or to the 
one who has faith, is benevolent, is attached to administering and giving 
gifts?</P>
<P>Venerable sir, why should the Noble ones showing compassion, first show 
compassion to the one without faith, selfish, greedy and abusive they will first 
show compassion to the one who has faith, is benevolent, is attached to 
administering and giving gifts. </P>
<P>Siha, from whom would the Noble Ones accepting gifts, first accept gifts, is 
it from the one who is without faith, selfish, greedy and abusive, or from the 
one who has faith, is benevolent, is attached to administering and giving gifts? 
Venerable sir why should the noble ones, accepting gifts first accept from the 
one without faith, selfish, greedy and abusive, they would first accept from the

<P>Siha, to whom would the Noble Ones first give the Teaching is to the one, 
without faith, selfish, greedy and abusive, or to the one who has faith, is 
benevolent, is attached to administering and giving gifts? </P>
<P>Venerable sir, why should the Noble ones giving the Teaching first give to 
the one without faith, selfish, greedy and abusive they will first give it to 
the one who has faith, is benevolent, is attached to administering and giving 
gifts. </P>
<P>Siha, whose fame would spread is it of the one without faith, selfish, greedy 
and abusive or of the one who has faith, is benevolent, is attached to 
administering and giving gifts?</P>
<P>Venerable sir, how should the fame of the one without faith, selfish, greedy 
and abusive spread, the fame of the one who has faith, is benevolent, is 
attached to administering and giving gifts would spread. </P>
<P>Siha, of these two persons the one who is without faith, selfish, greedy and 
abusive or the one who has faith, is benevolent, attached to administering and 
giving gifts would approach a gathering of warriors, Brahmins, householders or 
recluses with confidence? </P>
<P>Venerable sir, how could the one without faith, selfish, greedy and abusive 
approach a gathering of warriors, Brahmins, householders or recluses with 
confidence, he would approach confused. The one with faith, is benevolent, is 
attached to administering and giving gifts would approach a gathering of 
warriors, Brahmins, householders or recluses with confidence without confusion. 
</P>
<P>Siha, of these two persons, the one without faith, selfish, greedy and 
abusive and the one with faith, benevolent, attached to administering and giving 
gifts would go to increase, to heaven after death? Venerable sir, how could the 
one without faith, selfish, greedy and abusive, go to increase to heaven after 
death. Venerable sir, the one with faith, benevolent, attached to administering 
and giving gifts would go to increase to heaven. Venerable sir, of the here and 
now benefits of benevolence declared by The Blessed One I do not develop so much 
faith in The Blessed One. I myself know these benefits Venerable sir, I know 
that I am a giver of gifts, a benefactor. Noble Ones who show compassion, show 
compassion to me first. Noble Ones who approach for gifts approach me first. 
Noble Ones who accept gifts, accept gifts from me first. Those Noble Ones 
teaching, teach me first. As one with faith, a benevolent giver of gifts, my 
fame spreads- `General Siha is a benefactor who attends on the Community. 
Venerable sir, whatever gathering I approach whether of warriors, Brahmins, 
householders or recluses I approach with confidence without confusion. When The 
Blessed One said, Siha, the benefactor, the giver of gifts after death goes to 
increase goes to heaven. I did not know that. On account of that I take faith in 
The Blessed One. Siha, that is so, the benefactor, the giver of gifts after 
death goes to increase is born in heaven. </P>

<P>006.08. I heard thus. At one time The Blessed One was living in the dear park 
in the Bhesakala forest among the Sunsumara peaks in the Bhagga country. At that 
time venerable Mahamoggallana was dozing seated in the Kallavalaputta village in 
Magadha. The Blessed One saw with his purified heavenly eye beyond human 
venerable Mahamoggallana dozing seated in the Kallavalaputta village. Then as a 
strong man would stretch his bent arm or bend his stretched arm The Blessed One 
disappeared from the dear park in the Bhesakala forest among the Sunsumara peaks 
in the Bhagga country and appeared before venerable Mahamoggallana in the 
Kallavalaputta village in Magadha. The Blessed One sat on the prepared seat and 
said: </P>
<P>ßMoggallana, were you dozing?"</P>
<P>ßYes, venerable sir." </P>
<P>ßMoggallana, you should not abide in that perception, abiding in which you 
were overcome by that sluggishness. You should not attend and abide in that 
perception much. There is a possiblilty for that sluggishness to disappear if 
you abide thus. </P>
<P>Abiding in this manner if that sluggishness does not disappear, you should 
think and discriminatingly think about the Teaching as you have heard and 
experience it with the mind. There is a possiblilty for that sluggishness to 
disappear if you abide thus. </P>
<P>Abiding in this manner if that sluggishness does not disappear, you should 
recite in detail the Teaching as you have heard and experience it. There is a 
possiblilty for that sluggishness to disappear if you abide thus. </P>
<P>Abiding in this manner if that sluggishness does not disappear, you should 
pull both ears and rub the body with both hands. There is a possiblilty for that 
sluggishness to disappear if you abide thus. </P>
<P>Abiding in this manner if that sluggishness does not disappear, you should 
get up from the seat, wash your eyes, look in the directions and should look at 
the constellation of stars. There is a possiblilty for that sluggishness to 
disappear if you abide thus. </P>
<P>Abiding in this manner if that sluggishness does not disappear, you should 
attend to the sign of light - attend to the perception of day- as the day, so 
the night -as the night so the day. Thus open and uncoverd the mind should be 
developed. There is a possiblilty for that sluggishness to disappear if you 
abide thus. </P>
<P>Abiding in this manner if that sluggishness does not disappear, you should 
determine a walk perceiving the start and the end with the mental faculties 
turned inwards and the mind not allowed to wander. There is a possiblilty for 
that sluggishness to disappear if you abide thus. </P>
<P>Abiding in this manner if that sluggishness does not disappear, you should 
turn to the right side and making the lion's posture, go to sleep keeping one 
foot over the other and mindful of the time of rising. When awake quickly get 
out of bed thinking I will not enjoy the sluggish pleasure </P>
<P>Moggallana, you should train in this manner. I will not enter families `with 
the glory of a bhikkhu.' In families there are various kinds of work to be done. 
When people come, the bhikkhu is not attended. Then it occurs to the bhikkhu: 
Who has disrupted my friendship in this family, now these people are not 
amiable. Thus with that loss is confused. To the confused is agitation. The 
agitated are not restrained. The mind of one not restrained is far from 
concentration. </P>
<P>Moggallana, you should train in this manner. I will not enter into disputes. 
When it is a dispute, there is much talk. When there is much talk there is 
agitation. The agitated are not restrained. The mind of one not restrained is 
far from concentration. </P>
<P>Moggallana, I do not praise all associations neither do I depreciate all 
associations. I do not approve the association between householders and those 
gone forth. I appreciate the abounding of dwellings which are noiseless, free 
from humans, suitable for solitude and seclusion. </P>
<P>When this was said venerable Mahamoggallana said thus to The Blessed One: 
</P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, saying it in short, how is the bhikkhu released with the 
destruction of craving reaching the highest, ending the holy life and become the 
topmost among gods and men?" </P>
<P>Here, Moggallana the bhikkhu becomes learned, all things are not suitable to 
settle in. Moggallana, of that mind that all things are not suitable to settle 
in, the bhikkhu becomes learned. He learns all things and thoroughly learns 
them. Thoroughly knowing all things feels whatever feelings, pleasant, 
unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant. He abides seeing impermanence, 
disenchantment, cessation and giving up those feelings. When abiding seeing 
impermanence, disenchantment, cessation and giving up of those feelings he 
abides not holding to anything in the world. Not holding does not worry and 
without worries is by himself extinguished. He knows, birth is destroyed, the 
holy life is lived, what should be done is done, there is nothing more to wish. 
Moggallana, saying it in short, the bhikkhu, released with the destruction of 
craving reach the highest, end the holy life and become the topmost among gods 
and men in this manner. </P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>

<P>006.09. Bhikkhus, do not fear to do good. Pleasantness is a synonym for good. 
Bhikkhus, I know of enjoying the results of pleasing and agreeable good, done 
long ago. I developed the thought of loving kindness for seven years and did not 
come to this world for seven forward and backward world cycles. During the 
forward world cycles I was a god of radiance and during the backward world 
cycles I was born in an empty paradise of Brahma</P>
<P>There, I was Brahma, Brahma the great, the unconquered lord and master with 
sure insight, holding authority for seven times. Thirty six times I was Sakka 
the kng of gods. Innumerable hundreds of times I was the righteous universal 
monarch, winning the four directions and establishing states. Bhikkhus, I was 
endowed with these seven jewels, such as the jewel of the wheel, the elephant, 
the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder and the advisor. Bhikkhus, I 
had over a thousand courageous sons with valiant figures, for crushing foreign 
armies. They lived ruling over the earth righteously, without weapons as far as 
the limit of the ocean.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Look at the results of good, how merits bring pleasantness. </P>
<P>Developing the thought of loving kindness for seven years</P>
<P>I did not come to this world for seven forward and backward world cycles </P>
<P>During the forward world cycles I was a radiant god</P>
<P>And during the backward world cycles was born in an empty paradise of 
Brahma</P>
<P>There I was Great Brahma for seven times, wielding authority.</P>
<P>Thirty six times I was king of gods, ruling over the gods. </P>
<P>Innumerable hundreds of times I became universal monarch in Jambudipa</P>
<P>Head anointed warriors were the leaders of the people</P>
<P>They ruled without punishments and weapons. I advised them,</P>
<P>To rule this earth without force and impartially. </P>
<P>Thus I earned for the clan much wealth and resources.</P>
<P>I was endowed with the five strands of sense pleasures and the seven 
jewels</P>
<P>By the enlightened ones showing compassion for the world</P>
<P>It was told was the cause for my greatness and success in the world.</P>
<P>With much resources and means I became a powerful, famous king in India.</P>
<P>Who would not be pleased to hear this other than those born in darkness</P>
<P>Therefore desiring your own good, honour the Teaching recollecting the 
dispensation. </P>

<P>006.10. The Blessed One putting on robes in the morning, taking bowl and 
robes approached the household of Anathapindika and sat on the prepared seat. At 
that time in the householder Anathapindika's home there was great commotion. The 
householder Anathapindika approached The Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a 
side. The Blessed One said:</P>
<P>ßWhat is the reason for such a commotion in your house, it is like fishermen 
hauling a catch of fish?</P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, Sujatha Gharusunha is brought back from an oppulent family, 
she does not heed to mother-in law, father-in-law or to the husband, and does 
not even honour, revere esteem and worship The Blessed One."</P>
<P>Then The Blessed One addressed Sujatha Gharusunha. ßCome! Sujatha!"</P>
<P>Sujatha Gharusunha replying ßYes, venerable sir." Approached The Blessed One, 
worshipped and sat on a side. The Blessed One said: </P>
<P>ßSujatha, there are seven kinds of wives to a man. What seven? </P>
<P>A wife comparable to a murderer, to a robber, to a lady, to a mother, to a 
sister, to a friend and to a slave woman. These are the seven wives to a man. Of 
these which one, are you? </P>
<P>Venerable sir, I do not understand this short exposition of The Blessed One. 
Good! If it is explained to me, so that I may know the detailed meaning. Then 
Sujatha, listen, attend carefully I will tell. The Blessed One said.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Without compassion the mind defiled, attached to another man she belittles 
her husband.</P>
<P>Bought for money, intent on slaying this is the murderer wife for a man. </P>
<P>A woman enjoying the wealth of her husband, skills, merchandise and 
agricultural things</P>
<P>If intent on stealing, even a little, this is the robber wife for a man. </P>
<P>Not active, lazy, greedy, rough and talking rough cutting words,</P>
<P>She overrides the powers of her husband, this is the lady wife for a man. 
</P>
<P>Always compassionately, one protects her husband, like a mother her son. </P>
<P>So also protects his wealth and everything. She is a mother wife to a 
man.</P>
<P>Like an elder sister honouring her younger brother, she lives with him,</P>
<P>With a shameful mind. She is the sister wife for a man. </P>
<P>She who delights seeing her husband, like meeting a friend after a long time, 
</P>
<P>She is well-bred, with chastity and virtues. She is the friendly wife for a 
man. </P>
<P>Molested with a stick is appeased, bears with the husband </P>
<P>With an undefiled mind, she is the wife comparable to a slave. </P>
<P>The murderous, the robbing and the ladylike wives,</P>
<P>Are unvirtuous, rough and without love, after death are born in hell.</P>
<P>The wives comparable to a mother, a sister, a friend and a slave </P>
<P>Are virtuous, with well developed self, after death are born in heaven. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Sujatha these are the seven wives to a man. Of them what are you? </P>
<P>Venerable sir, from today remember me as a slave wife to my husband.

<P>006.11. Bhikkhus, these seven things cause hostility in co-wives arousing 
hatred in a woman or man. What seven? </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a co-wife desires for her opponent: `O! she should be ugly!' 
What is the reason? Bhikkhus, a co-wife is not delighted in the beauty of 
another co-wife </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, a hateful man overcome by hate and overwhelmed by it, however well 
bathed, anionted, has shaved head and beard and is dressed in white, yet he is 
ugly overcome with hate. Bhikkhus, this is the first thing that causes hostility 
on account of co-wives arousing hatred in a woman or man. </P>
<P>Again, hikkhus, a co-wife desires for her opponent: `O! she should sleep 
badly!' What is the reason? Bhikkhus, a co-wife is not delighted in another 
co-wife's pleasant sleep </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, a hateful man overcome by hate and overwhelmed by it, however well 
he sleeps on a sofa, covered with long woollen fleece, with woollen coverlets 
with carpets made of deer hide for the ground, with overhead cannopies and two 
red cushions on either side, yet he sleeps badly, overcome with hate. Bhikkhus, 
this is the second thing that causes hostility on account of co-wives arousing 
hatred in a woman or man. </P>
<P>Again, hikkhus, a co-wife desires for her opponent: `O! she should not have 
in abundance!' What is the reason? Bhikkhus, a co-wife is not delighted in 
another co-wife's abundance!"</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, a hateful man overcome by hate and overwhelmed by it, seizes the 
useless and thinks I have taken hold of the useful, seizing the useful thinks I 
have taken hold of the useless. To him grasping these things wrongly it conduces 
to unwelcome unpleasantness for a long time. Bhikkhus, this is the third thing 
that causes hostility on account of co-wives arousing hatred in a woman or man. 
</P>
<P>Again, hikkhus, a co-wife desires for her opponent: `O! she should not have 
wealth!' What is the reason? `Bhikkhus, a co-wife is not delighted in another 
co-wife's wealth.'</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, a hateful man overcome by hate and overwhelmed by it, whatever 
wealth he has amassed with aroused effort and toiling with his hands when sweat 
dripped, so rightfully earned, that too the king takes away and puts in the 
treasury. Bhikkhus, this is the fourth thing that causes hostility on account of 
co-wives arousing hatred in a woman or man. </P>
<P>Again, hikkhus, a co-wife desires for her opponent: `O! she should not be 
famous!' What is the reason? Bhikkhus, a co-wife is not delighted in another 
co-wife's fame.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, a hateful man overcome by hate and overwhelmed by it, whatever fame 
he has earned through diligence perishes. Bhikkhus, this is the fifth thing that 
causes hostility on account of co-wives arousing hatred in a woman or man. </P>
<P>Again, hikkhus, a co-wife desires for her opponent: `O! she should not have 
friends!' What is the reason? Bhikkhus, a co-wife is not delighted in another 
co-wife's friendships </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, a hateful man overcome by hate and overwhelmed by it, whoever 
friends, co-associates blood relations be they avoid him from a distance. 
Bhikkhus, this is the sixth thing that causes hostility on account of co-wives 
arousing hatred in a woman or man. </P>
<P>Again, hikkhus, a co-wife desires for her opponent: `O! she should go to 
loss, to decrease to hell after death!' What is the reason? Bhikkhus, a co-wife 
is not delighted in another co-wife's going to heaven </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, a hateful man overcome by hate and overwhelmed by it, misbehaves by 
body, by speech and mind and after death goes to loss, to decrease is born in 
hell. Bhikkhus, this is the seventh thing that causes hostility on account of 
co-wives arousing hatred in a woman or man. </P>
<P></P>
<P>The hateful one is ugly, sleeps badly, leaving aside the useful does the 
useless,</P>
<P>Doing destruction with body and words, overwhelmed with hate,</P>
<P>He comes to destruction of wealth, and is disgraced as a hateful. </P>
<P>Relations, friends, and well wishers avoid the hateful as he arouses bad 
feelings.</P>
<P>Fear arises with it and people do not know about it.</P>
<P>They do not know the least good thing and the least good in the Teaching,</P>
<P>When angry, man is in pitch darkness, he destroys easily, something difficult 
to correct </P>
<P>When anger abates, he has remorse as burnt with fire</P>
<P>He exhibits his evil mind, like dust evident in the air.</P>
<P>The human when angry is not shameful, has no remorse and gentle words. </P>
<P>One overcome with hate does not see any light, </P>
<P>Actions to be put aside, in the Teaching are far removed from him </P>
<P>Therefore I inform, consider it carefully. The hateful kill father, </P>
<P>His own mother, the noble one and the ordinary man </P>
<P>The hateful one kills his mother who fed, reared, showed him the world </P>
<P>And gave him life, he also kills ordinary folk</P>
<P>Those beings should be compared to oneself, the self is extremely dear</P>
<P>The hateful infatuated one kills in various ways </P>
<P>They kill the self with the sword, eat poison, tie themselves with bonds,</P>
<P>Or die in mountain grottos, doing actions that destroy beings and 
themselves.</P>
<P>The hateful do not know that hate is decrease </P>
<P>Thus with hate they house in Death's snare.</P>
<P>Cut it up, with taming with wisdom, effort and right view</P>
<P>The wise should cut up demerit and train the evil mind,</P>
<P>Dispelling hate, troubles and greed, tame the self and extinguish without 
desires. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
