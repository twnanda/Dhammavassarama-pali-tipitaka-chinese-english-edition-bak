and become annoyed and dissatisfied over this and other robes, morsel food, 
dwellings and requisites for the ill, we will not arouse evil desires and wish 
for wrongful gains and strive and exert to gain them. Considering we will not 
approach families, considering we will not sit down, to teach, thoughtfully

<P>016.08. Venerable Sariputta addressed the bhikkhus:- Friends, bhikkhus, 
whoever bhikkhu or bhikkhuni sees in herself these four things should conclude 
am decreasing in meritorious things told by The Blessed One. What four?</P>
<P>An abundance of greed, an abundance of anger, an abundance of delusion, and 
the eye of wisdom not succeeding at the right moment.</P>

<P>Friends, bhikkhus, whoever bhikkhu or bhikkhuni sees in herself these four

<P align=center>9. Bhikkhunisuttaü - To a bhikkhuni.</P></B></FONT><FONT 
face=Times_CSX+>
<P>016.09. At one time venerable Ananda was abiding in Ghosita's monastery in 
Kosambi. A certain bhikkhuni addressed a certain man:- Good one, approach 
venerable Ananda and in my words, worship venerable Ananda with your head at his 
feet and tell him:- Venerable sir, the bhikkhuni of this name is gravely ill, is 
in unpleasantness. She worships the feet of venerable Ananda. It is good if 
venerable Ananda could approach the monastery of the bhikkhunis, and approach 
her out of compassion.</P>
<P>He agreed, to do the words of that bhikkhuni, approached venerable Ananda, 
worshipped, sat on a side and said to venerable Ananda:- Venerable sir, the 
bhikkhuni of this name is gravely ill, is in unpleasantness. She worships the 
feet of venerable Ananda. It is good if venerable Ananda could approach the 
monastery of the bhikkhunis, and approach her out of compassion. Venerable 
Ananda, accepted the message in silence.</P>
<P>Venerable Ananda, put on robes and taking bowl and robes approached the 
monastery of the bhikkhunis. That bhikkhuni seeing venerable Ananda coming in 
the distance, covering herself together with the head, lay on her bed. Venerable 
Ananda approached that bhikkhuni, sat on the prepared seat and said :-</P>
<P>Sister, this body is produced from food and relying on food, food should be 
dispelled. Sister, this body is produced from craving and relying on craving, 
craving should be dispelled. Sister, this body is produced from measuring and 
relying on measuring, measuring should be dispelled. Sister, this body is 
produced from sexual intercourse, the bridge for sexual inter-course should be 
broken down. Said The Blessed One.</P>
<P>Sister, it was said, this body is produced from food and relying on food, 
food should be dispelled. Why was it said so? Here, sister, food should be taken 
wisely thinking. It is not for play, intoxication, decoration or to look 
beautiful. It is taken to uphold the body, without greed for soups, as a help to 
lead the holy life. Thus I destroy the earlier feelings and do not arouse any 
new. May there be no faults, for my comfortable abiding In the meantime relying 
on food he dispels food. If it was said this body is produced from food, relying 
on food, food should be dispelled it was said on account of this.</P>
<P>Sister, it was said, this body is produced from craving and relying on 
craving, craving should be dispelled. Why was it said so? Here, sister, the 
bhikkhu hears, the bhikkhu of this name has destroyed desires, has released the 
mind from desires and released through wisdom here and now abides having 
realized by himself. Then it occurs to him:- When will I destroy desires, 
release my mind from desires and released through wisdom here and now abide 
having realized by myself. In the meantime relying on craving he dispels 
craving. If it was said this body is produced from craving and relying on 
craving, craving should be dispelled, it was said on account of this.</P>
<P>Sister, it was said this body is produced from measuring and relying on 
measuring, measuring should be dispelled. Why was it said so? Here, sister the 
bhikkhu hears the bhikkhu of this name has destroyed desires,. . . re. . . . 
abides having realized by himself. It occurs to him, the venerable one of this 
name has destroyed desires . . . re. . . and abides here and now by himself 
having realized. Why should not I? In the meantime he dispels measuring relying 
on measuring. If it was said this body is produced from measuring and relying on 
measuring, measuring should be dispelled, it was said on account of this.</P>
<P>Sister, this body is produced from sexual intercourse, the bridge for sexual 
inter-course should be broken down. Said The Blessed One.</P>
<P>Then that bhikkhuni got down from her bed worshipped the feet of venerable 
Ananda and said:-</P>
<P>Venerable sir, pardon me I have done an offence owing to foolishness, 
delusion and demerit. Venerable sir, pardon me, it is for future restraint.</P>
<P>Sister, there, it is an offence owing to foolishness, delusion and demerit. 
As you see your offence and ask pardon according to the Teaching, we accept and 
grant you pardon. It is growth in the discipline of the noble ones to see the 
offence and ask for pardon according to the Teaching for future restraint.

<P align=center>10. Sugatavinayosuttaü - The discipline of the Well Gone 
One.</P></B></FONT><FONT face=Times_CSX+>
<P>016.10. Bhikkhus, so long as the Well Gone One abides in the world, or the 
Well Gone One's discipline is present it is for the welfare and pleasantness of 
many, for the compassion and pleasantness of gods and men. Bhikkhus, who is the 
Well Gone One?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the Thus Gone One is born in the world, worthy, rightfully 
enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, Well Gone, knower of the 
worlds, the incomparable trainer of those to be trained, teacher of gods and 
men, enlightened and blessed. Bhikkhus, that is the Well Gone One.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the discipline of the Well Gone One?</P>
<P>He preaches the Teaching good at the beginning, middle and end, explaining 
the complete and pure holy life. Bhikkhus, this is the discipline of the Well 
Gone One.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, so long as the Well Gone One abides in the world, or the Well Gone 
One's discipline is present it is for the welfare and pleasantness of many, for 
the compassion and pleasantness of gods and men.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these four things conduce to the confusion and disappearance of the 
good Teaching. What four?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhus learn the discourses grasped wrongly, on account 
of misplaced words and letters. On account of the misplaced words and letters 
the meaning too is miscarried.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, this is the first thing that conduces to the confusion and 
disappearance of the good Teaching.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhus become unruly endowed with stubborn ways, not 
patient, and not good at grasping instructions.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, this is the second thing that conduces to the confusion and 
disappearance of the good Teaching.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the learned bhikkhus to whom the Canon had been handed down, 
they who bear the Teaching and the Discipline with the headings, do not recite 
the discourses completely to others. At their demise the roots cut, the Teaching 
would be without refuge. Bhikkhus, this is the third thing that conduces to the 
confusion and disappearance of the good Teaching.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the elder bhikkhus, live in abundance given to lethargy, not 
giving the first place to seclusion, and not making effort to attain the not yet 
attained and for the realization of the not yet realized. Bhikkhus, this is the 
fourth thing that conduces to the confusion and disappearance of the good 
Teaching.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these four things conduce to the confusion and disappearance of the 
good Teaching.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these four things conduce to the non-confusion and 
non-disappearance of the good Teaching. What four?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhus learn the discourses rightly grasped, the words 
and letters correctly placed. On account of the correctly placed words and 
letters the meaning too is rightly carried</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, this is the first thing that conduces to the non-confusion and 
non-disappearance of the good Teaching.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhus become ruly endowed with suave ways, patient, 
and good at grasping instructions</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, this is the second thing that conduces to the non-confusion and 
non-disappearance of the good Teaching.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the learned bhikkhus to whom the Canon had been handed down, 
they who bear the Teaching and the Discipline with the headings, recite the

would be with refuge. Bhikkhus, this is the third thing that conduces to the 
non-confusion and non-disappearance of the good Teaching.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the elder bhikkhus, do not live in abundance given to 
lethargy, they give the first place to seclusion, and make effort to attain the 
not yet attained and for the realization of the not yet realized. Bhikkhus, this 
is the fourth thing that conduces to the non-confusion and non-disappearance of 
the good Teaching.</P>
