"There are these <A NAME="trainings">three trainings</A>. Which three? The training in heightened virtue, the training in heightened mind, the training in heightened discernment.
<p>
"And what is the training in heightened virtue? There is the case where a monk is virtuous. He dwells restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha, consummate in his behavior &amp; sphere of activity. He trains himself, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in the slightest fault. This is called the training in heightened virtue.
<p>
"And what is the training in heightened mind? There is the case where a monk -- quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful [mental] qualities -- enters &amp; remains in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. With the stilling of directed thought &amp; evaluation, he enters &amp; remains in the second jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation -- internal assurance. With the fading of rapture he remains in equanimity, mindful &amp; alert, and physically sensitive of pleasure. He enters &amp; remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasurable abiding.' With the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain -- as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress -- he enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. This is called the training in heightened mind.
<p>
"And what is the training in heightened discernment? There is the case where a monk, through the ending of the mental fermentations, enters &amp; remains in the fermentation-free release of awareness &amp; release of discernment, having known &amp; made them manifest for himself right in the here &amp; now. This is called the training in heightened discernment.
<p>
"These are the three trainings."

<blockquote>
Heightened virtue,<br>
heightened mind,<br>
heightened discernment:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; persistent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; firm,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; steadfast,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; absorbed in jhana,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mindful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with guarded faculties<br>
you should practice them -- 
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as in front,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so behind;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as behind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so in front;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as below,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so above;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as above,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so below;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as by day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so by night;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as by night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so by day;
<p>
conquering all the directions<br>
with limitless concentration.
<p>
This is called <br>
the practice of training,<br>
as well as the pure way of life.<br>
[Following it,] you're called <br>
self-awakened in the world,<br>
enlightened,<br>
one who's taken the path<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to its end.
<p>
With the cessation of sensory consciousness<br>
of one released in the stopping of craving,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the liberation of awareness<br>
of one released in the stopping of craving,<br>
is like the unbinding <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of a flame.[<a HREF="#n1" NAME="1">1</a>]
