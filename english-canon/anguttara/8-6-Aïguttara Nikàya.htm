<P>006.01. At one time The Blessed One was living in Nigrodha's monastery in 
Kapilavatthu with the Sakyas. Then Mahapajapati Gotami approached The Blessed 
One, worshipped, stood on a side and said to The Blessed One: </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, it is suitable that women gain the leaving home and becoming 
homeless in the dispensation declared by the Thus Gone One."</P>
<P>ßGotami, it is not suitable, that women gain the leaving home and becoming 
homeless in the dispensation declared by the Thus Gone One,óo not pursue it"</P>
<P>For the second time Mahapajapati Gotami said: ßVenerable sir, it is suitable 
that women gain the leaving home and becoming homeless in the dispensation 
declared by the Thus Gone One."</P>
<P>For the second time The Blessed One said: ßGotami, it is not suitable, that 
women gain the leaving home and becoming homeless in the dispensation declared 
by the Thus Gone One,óo not pursue it"</P>
<P>For the third time Mahapajapati Gotami said: ßVenerable sir, it is suitable 
that women gain the leaving home and becoming homeless in the dispensation 
declared by the Thus Gone One."</P>
<P>For the third time The Blessed One said: ßGotami, it is not suitable, that 
women gain the leaving home and becoming homeless in the dispensation declared 
by the Thus Gone One,óo not pursue it"</P>
<P>Then Mahapajapati Gotami thinking The Blessed One does not give permission 
for women to gain the leaving home and becoming homeless in the dispensation 
declared by the Thus Gone One was displeased and crying, worshipped and 
circumambulated The Blessed One went away. </P>
<P>The Blessed One living as long as he desired in Kapilavatthu went touring to 
Vesali and in stages arrived there. In Vesali The Blessed One lived in the 
gabled hall in the Great forest. </P>
<P>Then Mahapajapati Gotami shaving her head and putting on yellow clothes with 
many daughters of the Sakyas went to Vesali and in stages arrived at the gabled 
hall in the Great forest. When arriving there she was with injured feet, dusty 
and dirty body displeased and crying. </P>
<P>Venerable Ananda, saw her with injured feet, dusty and dirty body displeased 
and crying. </P>
<P>standing outside and asked her: ßGotami why are you with injured feet, dusty 
and dirty body, displeased, crying.and standing outside?"</P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, The Blessed One does not give permission for women to gain 
the leaving home and becoming homeless in the dispensation declared by the Thus 
Gone One."</P>
<P>ßThen, Gotami, wait here a moment I will beg permission for women, to gain 
the leaving home and becoming homeless in the dispensation declared by the Thus 
Gone One."</P>
<P>Venerable Ananda, approached The Blessed One worshipped, sat on a side and 
said: ßVenerable sir, Mahapajapati Gotami with injured feet, dusty and dirty 
body, displeased, crying.is standing outside saying- The Blessed One does not 
give permission for women to gain the leaving home and becoming homeless in the 
dispensation declared by the Thus Gone One. It is suitable venerable sir, that 
women gain the leaving home and becoming homeless in the dispensation declared 
by the Thus Gone One."</P>
<P>ßAnanda, it is not suitable, that women gain the leaving home and becoming 
homeless in the dispensation declared by the Thus Gone One,óo not pursue 
it."</P>
<P>For the second time venerable Ananda, ...re.... for the third time venerable 
Ananda said: ßIt is suitable venerable sir, that women gain the leaving home and 
becoming homeless in the dispensation declared by the Thus Gone One."</P>
<P>For the third time The Blessed One said:ßAnanda, it is not suitable, that 
women gain the leaving home and becoming homeless in the dispensation declared 
by the Thus Gone One,óo not pursue it." </P>
<P>Then it occured to venerable Ananda:'The Blessed One does not give permission 
for the women's going forth and becoming homeless in the dispensation declared 
by the Thus Gone One. What if I try some other method to beg the going forth for 
women in the dispensatlion declared by the Thus Gone One.' Venerable Ananda, 
said thus to The Blessed One: ßVenerable sir, is it possible for women gone 
forth and become homeless in the dispensation declared by the Thus Gone One to 
realize the fruits of entry into the stream of the Teaching or the fruits of 
returning once or the fruits of not returning , or the fruits of 
worthiness?"</P>
<P>ßAnanda, it possible for women gone forth and become homeless in the 
dispensation declared by the Thus Gone One to realize the fruits of entry into 
the stream of the Teaching, the fruits of returning once, the fruits of not 
returning and the fruits of worthiness." </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, if it is possible for women gone forth and become homeless in 
the dispensation declared by the Thus Gone One to realize the fruits of entry 
into the stream of the Teaching, the fruits of returning once, the fruits of not 
returning and the fruits of worthiness. It is suitable venerable sir that women 
gain the leaving home and becoming homeless in the dispensation declared by the 
Thus Gone One. For Mahapajapati Gotami has done much, she is the mother's 
sister, fed milk, showed the world when small and breast fed The Blessed 
One."</P>
<P>ßAnanda, if Mahapajapati Gotami accepts these eight strong rules, that will 
be her higher ordination: </P>
<P>ßA bhikkhuni with one hundred rains should worship, attend willingly, revere 
with clasped hands and exchange friendly greetings with a bhikkhu who has just 
attained higher ordination. This rule should be honoured, revered, esteemed and 
should not be thrown out until life lasts. </P>
<P>A bhikkhuni should not observe the rains in a monastery where there are no 
bhikkhus. This rule should be honoured, revered, esteemed and should not be 
thrown out until life lasts. </P>
<P>Every fortnight the bhikkhuni should approach the Community of bhikkhus to 
beg for two things. To know the day of recital of the full moon observances for 
confession and for advice. This rule should be honoured, revered, esteemed and 
should not be thrown out until life lasts. </P>
<P>A bhikkhuni should emerge from the rains observances, by seeing or hearing or 
clearing suspicions in the presence of both Communities, bhikkhus and 
bhikkhunis. This rule should be honoured, revered, esteemed and should not be 
thrown out until life lasts. </P>
<P>A bhikkhuni guilty of transgressing the strong rules should atone it, in the 
presence of both Communities, bhikkhus and bhikkhunis. This rule should be 
honoured, revered, esteemed and should not be thrown out until life lasts. </P>
<P>A trainee bhikkhuni should spend two rains observing the six precepts and be 
accomplished for the higher ordination, in the presence of both Communities, 
bhikkhus and bhikkhunis. This rule should be honoured, revered, esteemed and 
should not be thrown out until life lasts. </P>
<P>A bhikkhuni should not abuse a bhikkhu for any reason. This rule should be 
honoured, revered, esteemed and should not be thrown out until life lasts. </P>
<P>From today the words of the bhikkhunis are obstructed to the bhikkhus. The 
words of the bhikkhus are not obstructed to the bhikkhunis </P>
<P>This rule should be honoured, revered, esteemed and should not be thrown out 
until life lasts. </P>
<P>Ananda, if Mahapajapati Gotami accepts these eight strong rules, that will be 
her higher ordination:"</P>
<P>Venerable Ananda, learning these eight strong rules in the presence of The 
Blessed One approached Mahapajapati Gotami and said:</P>
<P>ßGotami, if you accept these eight strong rules, that will be your higher 
ordination: </P>

ordination:"</P>
<P>ß Venerable sir, Ananda, just as a young man, woman, or child who has washed 
his head was to receive a garland of flowers of blue lotuses, jasmines or a very 
attractive garland of flowers would accept it, with both hands and would place 
it on his head. In that same manner I accept the eight strong rules, not to 
throw out until life lasts. </P>
<P>Then venerable Ananda approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side 
and said: Venerable sir, Mahapajapati Gotami has accepted the eight strong 
rules, not to throw out until life lasts."</P>
<P>ßAnanda, if women did not obtain the going forth from the household as 
homeless, in the dispensation of the Thus Gone One, the dispensation would have 
lasted longer a thousand years Ananda, as women have obtined the going forth 
from the household to become homeless, it will not last long, the good Teaching 
will last only five hundred years </P>
<P>Ananda, just as families which have more women and few men are attacked by 
robbers and cheaters in the same manner in a dispensation in which there is the 
going forth for women, the holy life does not last long </P>
<P>Ananda, just as in an accomplished rice field, there falls an illness named 
white seeds and it does not last long. In the same manner in a dispensation in 
which there is the going forth for women, the holy life does not last long. </P>
<P>Ananda, just as in an accomplished cane field, there comes an illness named 
turning red and it does not last long. In the same manner in a dispensation in 
which there is the going forth for women, the holy life does not last long. </P>
<P>Ananda, just as a man was to build an embankment as a future protection for a 
huge reservoir, so that water would not reach over the boundary these eight 
strong rules are declared to the bhikkhunis not to be thrown out until life 
lasts, as future protection. </P>

advice, inciting and making the hearts light. Is loved by the bhikkhunis and is

the Koliyas and Dighajanu a son of the Koliyas approached The Blessed One, 
worshipped, sat on a side and said to The Blessed One: </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, we live a household life enjoying sensual pleasures troubled 
by wife and children, wearing Kashmire clothes, bearing flowers, scents, 
ointments and earning gold and silver. Venerable sir, may The Blessed One teach 
me for my welfare and pleasantness here and now and here after. </P>
<P>ßByagghapajja, these four things conduce to the welfare and pleasantness of 
sons of clansmen here and now. What four? </P>
<P>The achievement of, manly vigour, means of protection, good friendship and a 
balanced living</P>
<P>Byagghapajja, what is the achievement of manly vigour? </P>
<P>Here, Byagghapajja, in whatever trade the clansman makes a living -whether 
farming, trading, cattle rearing, rulership, serving the king or any other 
skill, he becomes clever not lazy and discriminative of what, has to be done and 
what has to be completed. Byagghapajja, this is the achievement of manly vigour. 
</P>
<P>Byagghapajja, what is the achievement of protection? </P>
<P>Here, Byagghapajja, whatever wealth be to the clansman achieved through manly 
vigour, righteously gained when toiling with his hands while sweat dripped, he 
protects. This my wealth should be protected so that it would not be carried 
away by the king, by robbers.or water or burnt by fire. It should not be carried 
away by unwanted inheritors. Byaggapajja this is the achievement of protection. 
</P>

balances his budget In this manner my income is above my expenses and not my 
expenses are above my income. Like one holding the balance would know, this side 
is more by this much and this side is less by this much. In this manner the 
clansman's son knowing his income and expenses balances his budget In this 
manner my income is above my expenses and not my expenses are above my income. 
Byagghapajja, if the clansman's son with low income was to live spending much. 
It is said that the clansman's son lives as though eating figs. If the 
clansman's son with high income was to live spending little. It is said that the 
clansman's son lives as though dying a junior death. Byagghapajja, when the

outlets. Rain too does not fall abundantly. If this happens disaster could be 
expected to the reservoir, not growth. In the same manner to arisen wealth there
