"Monks, a statement endowed with five factors is well-spoken, not ill-spoken. It is blameless &amp; unfaulted by knowledgeable people. Which five?
<p>
"It is spoken at the right time. It is spoken in truth. It is spoken affectionately. It is spoken beneficially. It is spoken with a mind of good-will.
<p>
"A statement endowed with these five factors is well-spoken, not ill-spoken. It is blameless &amp; unfaulted by knowledgeable people."
