<P>004.02. ßBhikkhus, I will tell these nine successive abidings in ascending 
order, listen and attend carefully. What are the successive abidings in 
ascending order? </P>
<P>When sensuality ceases and when the bhikkhu abides in the cessation of 
sensuality, I say. `Indeed that venerable one is without craving, cooled, 
crossed over and gone to the other shore by that factor.' `If someone was to 
say, how does sensuality cease and who abides in the cessation of sensuality. I 
do not know or see this.' This is the reply to him.-' Here, when the venerable 
bhikkhu, secluding the mind from sensual desires and demeritorious thoughts, 
abides in the first higher state of the mind, with thoughts and discursive 
thoughts. Then sensuality ceases and he abides in the cessation of sensuality'. 
Bhikkhus, indeed someone who is not crafty, not deceitful, should readily accept 
it, delight in it and should associate it with clasped hands. </P>
<P>When thoughts and discursive thoughts cease and when the bhikkhu abides in 
the cessation of thoughts and discursive thoughts, I say. `Indeed that venerable 
one is without craving, cooled, crossed over and gone to the other shore by that 
factor.' `If someone was to say, how do thoughts and discursive thoughts cease 
and who abides in the cessation of thoughts and discursive thoughts. I do not 
know or see this.' This is the reply to him.-' Here, when the venerable bhikkhu, 
overcoming thoughts and discursive thoughts...re.... abides in the second higher 
state of the mind, then thoughts and discursive thoughts cease and he abides in 
the cessation of thoughts and discursive thoughts.'. Bhikkhus, indeed someone

<P>When joy ceases and when the bhikkhu abides in the cessation of joy, I say.

the other shore by that factor.' `If someone was to say, how does joy cease and 
who abides in the cessation of joy. I do not know or see this.' This is the 
reply to him.-' Here, when the venerable bhikkhu, with equanimity to joy and 
disenchantment...re... abides in the third higher state of the mind, then joy 
ceases and he abides in the cessation of joy.'. Bhikkhus, indeed someone who is 
not crafty, not deceitful, should readily accept it, delight in it and should

<P>When the pleasantness of equanimity ceases and when the bhikkhu abides in the 
cessation of the pleasantness of equanimity, I say. `Indeed that venerable one 
is without craving, cooled, crossed over and gone to the other shore by that 
factor.' `If someone was to say, how does the pleasantness of equanimity cease 
and who abides in the cessation of the pleasantness of equanimity. I do not know 
or see this.' This is the reply to him.-' Here, when the venerable bhikkhu, 
dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness abides in the fourth higher state of 
the mind, then the pleasantness of equanimity ceases and he abides in the 
cessation of the pleasantness of equanimity'. Bhikkhus, indeed someone who is 
not crafty, not deceitful, should readily accept it, delight in it and should 
associate it with clasped hands. </P>
<P>When perceptions of matter cease and when the bhikkhu abides in the cessation 
of perceptions of matter, I say. `Indeed that venerable one is without craving, 
cooled, crossed over and gone to the other shore by that factor.' `If someone 
was to say, how do the perceptions of matter cease and who abides in the 
cessation of perceptions of matter. I do not know or see this.' This is the 
reply to him.-' Here, when the venerable bhikkhu, overcoming all perceptions of 
matter, all perceptions of aversion, and not attending to various perceptions, 
with space is boundless abides in the sphere of space, then perceptions of 
matter cease and he abides in the cessation of perceptions of matter.' Bhikkhus, 
indeed someone who is not crafty, not deceitful, should readily accept it, 
delight in it and should associate it with clasped hands. </P>
<P>When perceptions of the sphere of space cease and when the bhikkhu abides in 
the cessation of the perceptions of space, I say. `Indeed that venerable one is 
without craving, cooled, crossed over and gone to the other shore by that 
factor.' `If someone was to say, how do the perceptions of space cease and who

abides in the cessation of perceptions of the sphere of consciousness, I say.

it and should associate it with clasped hands. </P>

<P>004.03. At one time venerable Sariputta was abiding in the squirrels' 
sanctuary in the bamboo grove in Rajagaha. Venerable Sariputta addressed the 
bhikkhus from there: </P>
<P>ßFriends, extinction is pleasant! It is indeed pleasant! When this was said 
venerable Udayi said to venerable Sariputta:"Friend, what is pleasant in it, 
when there is nothing felt?"</P>
<P>ßFriend, that is the pleasantness, when nothing is felt. Friend, there are 
these five strands of sensual pleasures. What five? Agreeable and pleasant 
forms, arousing fondness and sensual desires cognizable by eye consciousness 
Agreeable and pleasant sounds,...re.... smells, ....re..ñastes, ....re..... and 
touches, arousing fondness and sensual desires cognizable by body consciousness. 
Friend, these are the five strands of sense pleasures. Whatever pleasure and 
pleasantness arises on account of these five strands of sense pleasures is 
called sensual pleasantness. </P>
<P>Here, friend, the bhikkhu secluded from sensual thoughts,....re.... abides in 
the first higher state of the mind. To the bhikkhu abiding in the first higher 
state of mind, sensual perceptions attended with thoughts behaving, becomes an 
oppression. Friend, to pleasantness, the arising of unpleasantness, is for 
oppression. In like manner sensual perceptions attended with thoughts behaving, 
becomes an oppression. Friend, The Blessed One has said, whatever oppression is 
unpleasant. By this method too it should be known how extinction is pleasant. 
</P>
<P>Again, friend, the bhikkhu appeasing thoughts and discursive 
thoughts,....re.... abides in the second higher state of the mind. To the 
bhikkhu abiding in the second higher state of the mind, perceptions attended 
with discursive thoughts behaving, becomes an oppression. Friend, to 
pleasantness, the arising of unpleasantness, is for oppression. In like manner 
perceptions attended with discursive thoughts behaving, becomes an oppression. 
Friend, The Blessed One has said, whatever oppression is unpleasant. By this 
method too it should be known how extinction is pleasant.</P>
<P>Again, friend, the bhikkhu with equanimity to joy and 
disenchantment,....re.... abides in the third higher state of the mind. To the 
bhikkhu abiding in the third higher state of mind, perceptions attended with joy 
behaving, becomes an oppression. Friend, to pleasantness, the arising of

behaving, becomes an oppression. Friend, The Blessed One has said, whatever 
oppression is unpleasant. By this method too it should be known how extinction

<P>Again, friend, the bhikkhu dispelling pleasantness and 
unpleasantness,....re.... abides in the fourth higher state of the mind. To the 
bhikkhu abiding in the fourth higher state of the mind, perceptions attended 
with equanimity behaving, becomes an oppression. Friend, to pleasantness, the 
arising of unpleasantness, is for oppression. In like manner perceptions

has said, whatever oppression is unpleasant. By this method too it should be

<P>Again, friend, the bhikkhu overcoming all the sphere of space and with 
consciousness is boundless, abides in the sphere of consciousness. To the 
bhikkhu abiding in the sphere of consciousness perceptions attended with space 
behaving, becomes an oppression. Friend, to pleasantness, the arising of 
unpleasantness, is for oppression. In like manner perceptions attended with 
space behaving, becomes an oppression. Friend, The Blessed One has said, 
whatever oppression is unpleasant. By this method too it should be known how 
extinction is pleasant.</P>
<P>Again, friend, the bhikkhu overcoming all the sphere of consciousness, with 
there is nothing abides in the sphere of no-thingness. To the bhikkhu abiding in

reflection desires get destroyed. By this method too it should be known how

<P>004.04. "Bhikkhus, to a foolish cow on a rock who does not know the right 
field to pasture, not clever to wander on uneven rocks, it occurs: `What if I go 
where I have not gone earlier, eat grass I have not eaten earlier, drink water I 
have not drunk earlier. Without establishing her forefeet well, she raises her 
hind feet. She does not go, where she has not gone earlier, does not eat grass

<P>Bhikkhus, in the same manner a certain foolish bhikkhu who does not know the

<P>It occurs to him: `What if I overcome thoughts and discursive thoughts,

<P>`Bhikkhus, an archer or an archer's apprentice making the form of a man out

boundless abides in the sphere of consciousness. In that state of mind, whatever

<P>004.06. At one time venerable Ananda was abiding in Ghosita's monastery in 
Kosambi. Venerable Ananda addressed the bhikkhus from there: </P>
<P>ßFriends, it is wonderful and surprising that The Blessed One who knows and 
sees, is worthy and rightfully enlightened does not leave any obstructions, for 
the purity and enlightenment of sentient beings, for overcoming grief and lament 
for realizing extinction for overcoming unpleasantness and displeasure. -The eye 
will be such, that there will be no feelings for forms seen. The ear will be 
such, that there will be no feelings for sounds heard.òhe nose will be such, 
that there will be no feelings for smells scented. The tongue will be such, that 
there will be no feelings for tastes tasted. The body will be such that there 
will be no feelings for bodily contacts. </P>
<P>When this was said venerable Udayi said: ßFriend, Ananda, is it when 
perceptive in that mental sphere that feelings are not present or when not 
perceptive in that mental sphere?" ßFriend, its when perceptive in the 
respective mental sphere not when not perceptive in the respective mental 
sphere."</P>
<P>ßFriend, not perceptive of what, in the respective mental sphere are there no 
feelings?" "Here, friend, the bhikkhu overcoming all perceptions of matter and 
perceptions of anger, not attending to various perceptions, with space is 
boundless abides in the sphere of space. When thus perceptive there are no 
feelings in the respective mental spheres. </P>
<P>Again, friend, the bhikkhu overcoming all perceptions of space, with 
consciouness is boundless abides in the sphere of consciousness. When thus 
perceptive there are no feelings in the respective mental spheres. </P>
<P>Again, friend, the bhikkhu overcoming all perceptions of consciousness, with 
there is nothing abides in the sphere of no-thingness. When thus perceptive 
there are no feelings in the respective mental spheres.</P>
<P>Friend, at one time I was abiding in the deer park in the Anjana forest in 
Saketa. Then a bhikkhuni of the knotted hair sect approached me, worshipped and 
standing on a side said: Venerable sir, Ananda, that concentration which is not 
strained, nor turned aside, not with determinations that act as self denials, 
when abiding in it, is for release and pleasàntness and is without remorse; for 
what fruit is that concentration, as told by The Blessed One?"</P>
<P>Friend, I replied to the bhikkhuni of the knotted hair sect thus `Sister, 
that concentration which is not strained, nor turned aside, not with 
determinations that act as self denials, when abiding in it, is for release and 
pleasantness and is without remorse; as told by The Blessed One is for the 
fruits of worthiness. When thus perceptive there are no feelings in the

<P>004.07. Two Brahmins who had the ordinary view of the world approached The 
Blessed One, exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side and said to The Blessed 
One: </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, Purana Kassapa acknowledges having extensive knowledge and 
knowing everything, so also knowledge and vision that is complere-'whether 
walking, standing, lying or awake, constantly and incessantly my knowledge and

<P>Venerable sir, this Nigantha Nathaputta too acknowledges having extensive 
knowledge and knowing everything, so also knowledge and vision that is complete- 
'whether walking, standing, lying or awake, constantly and incessantly my 
knowledge and vision is established.' He said.- `I abide with boundless 
knowledge, knowing and seeing, boundless worlds' - Venerable sir, of these two 
who talk of knowledge and whose words are hostile to each other, whose words is 
the truth, and whose the lie?"</P>
<P>ßUseless! Brahmins, leave it alone of these two who talk of knowledge and 
whose words are hostile to each other, whose words is the truth, and whose the 
lie. I will teach you attend carefully and listen. The Blessed One then said: 
thus-</P>
<P>Brahmins, there are four people standing in the four directions endowed with 
the highest speed and the longest span. Their speed is such, a well trained 
archer who is dextrous would quickly and lightly shoot through a palm and bring 
it down in an instant. Their span was such they placed one foot in the eastern 
ocean and the other in the western ocean. The man in the east would say, `I will 
make a journey to the end of the world. Stopping only for tasting, eating, 
drinking, urinating, excreting and to dispel sleepiness and weariness, with a 
life span of one hundred years, he goes for one hundred years and dies on the 
way, without reaching the end of the world. The man in the west,...re....in the

goes for one hundred years and dies on the way, without reaching the end of the 
world. What is the reason? Brahmin, there is no running, of this nature to know 
and understand the end of the world. I also don't declare the ending of 
unpleasantness without coming to the end of the world. </P>
<P>Brahmins, in the noble one's discipline, these five strands of sensual 
pleasures are known as the world. What five? Agreeable and pleasant forms 
arousing fondness and sensual desires cognizable by eye consciousness. Agreeable 
and pleasant sounds cognizable by ear consciousness, ....re...scents cognizable 
by nose consciousness, ....re...ñastes cognizable by tongue conscioussness, 
...re....and touches arousing fondness and sensual desires cognizable by body 
consciousness. Brahmins, in the noble one's discipline, these five strands of 
sensual pleasures are known as the world.</P>
<P>Here, Brahmins, the bhikkhu secluding the mind from sensual desires and

<P>Ananda, until I could attain to, and rise from, the nine successive abidings 
in the ascending and descending order I did not declare to the world, together 
with its gods and men, maras and brahmas and the Community of recluses and 
Brahmins and gods and men, that I have realized noble rightful enlightenment. 
When I could attain to, and rise from, the nine successive abidings in the 
ascending and descending order I declare to the world, together with its gods 
and men, maras and brahmas and the Community of recluses and Brahmins and gods 
and men, that I have realized noble rightful enlightenment. Knowledge and vision 
arose to me, my release is immovable. This is my last birth, there is no more 
birth. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
