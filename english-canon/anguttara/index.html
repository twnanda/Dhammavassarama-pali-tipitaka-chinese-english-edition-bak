<h1>The Anguttara Nikaya</h1>
<h3>The "Further-factored" Discourses</h3>
</center>
<hr>
The Anguttara Nikaya, the fourth division of the <A HREF="../sutta.html">Sutta Pitaka</a>, consists of suttas arranged in eleven sections <i>(nipatas)</i> according to numerical content. For example, the first <i>nipata</i> -- the "Book of the Ones" -- contains suttas concerning a single topic; the second <i>nipata</i> -- the "Book of the Twos" -- contains suttas concerning pairs of things (e.g., a sutta about tranquillity and insight; another about the two people one can never adequately repay (one's parents); another about two kinds of happiness; etc.); the third <i>nipata</i> contains suttas concerning three things (e.g., a sutta on the three kinds of praiseworthy acts; another about three kinds of offense), and so on.
<p>
At first this may seem to be a rather fussy and pedantic classification scheme, but in fact it often proves quite useful. For example, if you dimly recall having once heard someone say something about the <A HREF="an5-57.html">five subjects worthy of daily contemplation</a>, and you'd like to track down the original passage in the Canon, you might begin your search in the "Book of the Fives" in the Anguttara. (The <A HREF="../../index-number.html">Index by Number</A> can be helpful, too, in tracking down passages from the Anguttara Nikaya.)
