<P>1. Titthàyatanàdisuttaü -Fording places</P>
<P>62. Bhikkhus, these three are the fording places, at which cross questioned, 
asked for reasons and discussed together by the wise, those of other sects cross 
over and become steady in non action. What three? There are some recluses and 
brahmins of the view, whatever this person experiences, whether pleasant, 
unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant, all that is, on account of 
actions done in the past. There are some recluses and brahmins of the view, 
whatever this person experiences, whether pleasant, unpleasant or neither 
unpleasant nor pleasant, all that is, on account of a supreme creator. There are 
some recluses and brahmins of the view, whatever this person experiences, 
whether pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant, all that is, on 
account of no reason or cause. </P>
<P>Here bhikkhus, I approach those recluses and brahmins of the view, whatever 
this person experiences, whether pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor 
pleasant, all that is, on account of actions done in the past. I ask them. 
Venerable ones, is it true that you are of the view whatever this person 
experiences, whether pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant, 
all that is, on account of actions done in the past? When asked, they admit 
it.</P>
<P>Then I tell them:- Venerable ones, do you destroy life, take what is not 
given, lead a life devoid of chastity, tell lies, slander, talk roughly, talk 
frivolously, covet, bear anger in the mind, hold wrong views on account of 
actions done in the past? Bhikkhus, they who fall back on the criterion it is on 
account of actions done in the past, do not arouse interest and effort, for what 
should and should not be done. They that are confused and do not know what 
should and should not be done, in reality are not protected and have no internal 
recluseship. Bhikkhus, this is the first rebuke to those recluses and brahmins 
with that view. . </P>

with that view. Bhikkhus, these three are the fording places, at which cross

sects cross over and become steady in non action.Bhikkhus, these three are the

<P>Bhikkhus, my teaching is not rebuked, not soiled and not blamed by the wise. 
Bhikkhus, how is my teaching not rebuked, not soiled and not blamed by the wise. 
</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, I teach these are the six elements and it is not rebuked, not 
soiled and not blamed by the wise. I teach these are the six spheres of contact 
and it is not rebuked, not soiled and not blamed by the wise. I teach these are 
the eighteen dwellings of the mind and it is not rebuked, not soiled and not 
blamed by the wise. I teach these are the four noble truths and it is not 
rebuked, not soiled and not blamed by the wise.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it was said, these are the six elements that are not rebuked, not 
soiled and not blamed by the wise. Why was it said so? </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the six elements, I say, are earth, water, fire, air, space and 
consciousness </P>
<P>and it is not rebuked, not soiled and not blamed by the wise.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it was said, these are the six spheres of contact that are not 
rebuked, not soiled and not blamed by the wise. Why was it said so?</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the six spheres of contact, I say are the sphere of eye contact, 
the sphere of ear contact, the sphere of nose contact, the sphere of tongue 
contact, the sphere of body contact and the sphere of mind contact and it is not 
rebuked, not soiled and not blamed by the wise. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it was said, these are the eighteen mental dwellings that are not 
rebuked, not soiled and not blamed by the wise. Why was it said so? Seeing a 
form, the mind dwells in pleasure, dwells in displeasure and dwells in 
equanimity. Hearing a sound,...re...Scenting a smell...re.... Tasting 
something,...re.... Cognizing a touch,...re.... Cognizing an idea dwells in 
pleasure, dwells in displeasure and dwells in equanimity these are the eighteen 
mental dwellings that are not rebuked, not soiled and not blamed by the 
wise.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it was said, these are the four noble truths that are not rebuked, 
not soiled and not blamed by the wise. Why was it said so? Bhikkhus, on account 
of the six elements, there is a descent into the womb. To the entered there is 
name and matter. On account of name and matter, there are the six spheres. On 
account of the six spheres there is contact. On account of contact, there are 
feelings. Bhikkhus, to one who feels, I say this is unpleasant, this is the 
arising of unpleasantness, this the cessation of unpleasantness and this is the 
path leading to the cessation of unpleasantness</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the noble truth of unpleasantness? </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, birth, decay, illness, death, grief, lament, displeasure, 
distress and not to get one desires are unpleasant,. In short the five the 
holding masses are unpleasant. Bhikkhus, this is the noble truth of 
unpleasantness. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the noble truth of the arising of unpleasantness?</P>
<P>On account of ignorance arise determinations. On account of determinations 
arise consciousness. On account of consciousness arise name and matter. On 
account of name and matter arise the six spheres. On account of the six spheres 
arise contact. On account of contact arise feelings. On account of feelings 
arise craving. On account of craving arise holding. On account of holding is 
being. On account of being is birth. On account of birth, is decay, death, 
grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress. Thus the arising of the 
whole mass of unpleasantness. Bhikkhus, this is the noble truth of the arising 
of unpleasantness. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the noble truth of the cessation of unpleasantness?</P>
<P>With the complete cessation of ignorance cease determinations. With the 
cessation of determinations cease consciousness. With the cessation of 
consciousness cease name and matter. With the cessation of name and matter cease 
the six spheres. With the cessation of the six spheres cease contact. With the 
cessation of contact cease feelings. With the cessation of feelings cease 
craving. With the cessation of craving cease holding. With the cessation of 
holding cease being. With the cessation of being ceases birth. With the 
cessation of birth, cease decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness, 
displeasure and distress. Thus is the cessation of the whole mass of 
unpleasantness. Bhikkhus, this is the noble truth of the cessation of 
unpleasantness.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the path leading to the cessation of unpleasantness? </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it is this same noble eightfold path, such as right view, right 
thoughts, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right endeavour, right 
mindfulness and right concntration. Bhikkhus, this is the path leading to the 
cessation of unpleasantness.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, I say, these are the four noble truths that are not rebuked, not 
soiled and not blamed by the wise. If it was said, it was said on account of 
this. </P>
<P>&nbsp;2. Amataputtikàni</P>
<P>63. Bhikkhus, the ordinary folk say, these three fears do not know mother or 
son. What three? </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, there is a time, when a great fire arises, it burns villages, 
hamlets and towns. When it burns, villages, hamlets and towns, the mother does 
not gain the son and the son does not gain the mother. The ordinary folk say 
this is the first fear, in which the mother does not know the son. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, there is a time when a great storm arises bringing a lot of rain to 
villages, hamlets and towns. When it submerges villages, hamlets and towns the 
mother does not gain the son and the son does not gain the mother. The ordinary 
folk say this is the second fear, in which the mother does not know the son.</P>
<P>.Again, bhikkhus, there is a time when the forest tribes mount chariots and 
go round the villages, hamlets and towns. When they go through the villages, 
hamlets and the towns the mother does not gain the son and the son does not gain 
the mother. The ordinary folk say this is the third fear, in which the mother 
does not know the son. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the ordinary folk say, in these three fears the mother does not 
gain the son and the son does not gain the mother.. </P>

hamlets and the towns the mother gains the son and the son gains the mother. The 
ordinary folk say this is the third fear, in which the mother gains or does not 
gain the son. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the ordinary folk say, in these three fears the mother does not 
gain and gains the son.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these three are the fears which do not know the mother or the son. 
What three? The fears of decay, illness and death. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, a mother cannot gain this for a decaying son- I decay. May my son 
not decay. Even a son cannot gain this for his decaying mother- I decay. May my 
mother not decay. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, a mother cannot gain this for an ailing son- I ail. May my son not 
ail. Even a son cannot gain this for his ailing mother- I ail. May my mother not 
ail</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, a mother cannot gain this for a dying son- I die. May my son not 
die. Even a son cannot gain this for his dying mother- I die. May my mother not 
die.. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these three are the fears which do not know the mother or the 
son.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, there is a path and method to dispel and overcome these fears which 
do not know mother or son. Bhikkhus, what is the path and method which conduces 
to dispel and overcome these three fears which do not know mother or son and 
which know mother or son?</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it is this same noble eightfold path, such as right view, right 
thoughts, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right endeavour, right 
mindfulness and right concntration. Bhikkhus, this is the path and method which 
conduces to dispel and overcome these three fears which do not know mother or 
son and which know mother or son </P>
<P>3. Venàgapurasuttaü - In Venaga</P>
<P>64. At one time the Blessed One was touring the country of Kosala with a 
large Community of bhikkhus and entered the brahmin township of Venaga. Then the 
brahmin householders of Venaga heard that the good recluse Gotama, who had gone 
forth from the Sakya clan and become homeless has entered Venaga. And such good 
praise spread about that blessed Gotama. That Blessed One is worthy, rightfully 
enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, knower of the 
worlds, the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, 
enlightened and blessed. He having realized by himself teaches in this world 
together with gods and men, Mara, Brahma and the community of recluses and 
brahmins. The Teaching which is good in the beginning, middle and end, full of 
meaning in words and letters and it clearly points out the complete and pure 
holy life. It is good to see such worthy ones. </P>
<P>Then the brahmin householdersof Venaga approached the Blessed One, some 
worshipped and sat on a side. Some exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a 
side. Some extended their clasped hands towards the Blessed One and sat on a 
side. Some announced their name and clan and sat on a side and some others 
silently sat on a side and said thus to the Blessed One:-</P>
<P>It is wonderful good Gotama, your mental faculties are bright, skin colour is 
pure and clear, like a yellow jujube fruit in Autumn Or is pure and clear like a 
palm flower just released from the case. Or is like a creation done out of pure 
gold is placed in an orange blanket by a clever goldsmith. Good Gotama, your 
mental faculties are bright, skin colour is pure and clear. How good would it 
be, if there were high and lofty seats such as decked chairs cusioned out of 
wild bull hide, decorated with white woollen cloth, with layers of embroidered 
woollen blankets, made of only wool, made with a mixture of wool and covered 
with silken embroidered coverlets. The floor covered with woven woollen carpets, 
elephant spreads, horse spreads chariot spreads made of antelope and deer hide. 
With overhead canopies, and red cushions on either side. Good Gotama should be a 
quick gainer without difficulty, a gainer for nothing of these high and lofty 
seats. </P>
<P>Brahmin, these high and lofty seats such as decked chairs cusioned out of 
wild bull hide, decorated with white woollen cloth, with layers of embroidered 
woollen blankets, made of only wool, made with a mixture of wool and covered 
with silken embroidered coverlets. The floor covered with woven woollen carpets, 
elephant spreads, horse spreads chariot spreads made of antelope and deer hide. 
With overhead canopies, and red cushions on either side, are not easily gained 
by those gone forth. Even if gained, are not suitable for the homeless. </P>
<P>Brahmin, these three are the high and lofty seats for which I am a quick 
gainer without difficulty, a gainer for nothing. What three?</P>
<P>They are the high and lofty seats of divinity, of brahma and the noble ones. 
</P>
<P>Good Gotama, what are the high and lofty seats of divinity for which good 
gotama is a quick gainer without difficulty, a gainer for nothing now?</P>
<P>Here, brahmin, in the morning I put on robes and taking bowl and robes go for 
alms to the village or hamlet relying on which I abide. After the meal is over 
and returning from the alms round, I roam in that forest stretch. Finding a heap 
of grass or leaves, I collect them and sit on them making a cross legged 
position, keeping the body straight and establishing mindfulness in front. Then 
I seclude my mind from sensual and evil thoughts, with thoughts and thought 
processes and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion I attain to the first 
jhana. Allaying thoughts and thought processes and the mind internally appeased 
and brought to one point, without thoughts and thought processes and with joy 
and pleasantness born of concentration I attain to the second jhana. With 
detachment to joy I abide in equanimity. Mindful and aware I experience 
pleasantness too with the body. This is the third jhana, to this the noble ones 
say mindfully abiding in pleasantness with equanimity. Giving up pleasantness 
and unpleasantness and earlier gone beyond pleasure and displeasure and 
experiencing neither the pleasant nor the unpleasant by purifying mindfulness 
with equanimity I attain to the forth jhana. </P>
<P>Brahmin, in that abiding I walk, then my walking is divine. In that abiding I 
stand, then my standing is divine. In that abiding I sit, then my sitting is 
divine. In that abiding I lie, then my lying is divine on a high and lofty bed. 
Brahmin, these are the high and lofty seats of divinity for which I am a quick 
gainer without difficulty, a gainer for nothing now</P>
<P>It is wonderful good Gotama, who else could be the quick gainer without 
difficulty, a gainer for nothing now of high and lofty beds, other than good 
Gotama. </P>
<P>Good Gotama, what are the high and lofty seats of Brahma for which good 
gotama is a quick gainer without difficulty, a gainer for nothing now?</P>
<P>Here, brahmin, in the morning I put on robes and taking bowl and robes go for 
alms to the village or hamlet relying on which I abide. After the meal is over 
and returning from the alms round, I roam in that forest stretch. Finding a heap 
of grass or leaves, I collect them and sit on them making a cross legged 
position, keeping the body straight and establishing mindfulness in front. Then 
I abide pervading one direction with loving kindness, so too the second, the 
third, the fourth, above, below and across, in every respect, on the whole, 
entirely grown great, immeasurable and without anger. </P>
<P>Then I abide pervading one direction with compassion, so too the second, 
...re...with intrinsic joy, ....re.... the third, the fourth, above, below and 
across, in every respect, on the whole, entirely grown great, immeasurable and 
without anger. Then I abide pervading one direction with equanimity, so too the 
second, the third, the fourth, above, below and across, in every respect, on the 
whole, entirely grown great, immeasurable and without anger</P>
<P>Brahmin, in that abiding I walk, then my walking is of Brahma. In that 
abiding I stand, then my standing is of Brahma. In that abiding I sit, then my 
sitting is of Brahma. In that abiding I lie, then my lying is of Brahma on a 
high and lofty bed. Brahmin, these are the high and lofty seats of Brahma for 
which I am a quick gainer without difficulty, a gainer for nothing now</P>
<P>It is wonderful good Gotama, who else could be the quick gainer without 
difficulty, a gainer for nothing now, of high and lofty beds of Brahma, other 
than good Gotama. </P>
<P>Good Gotama, what are the high and lofty seats of the Noble Ones for which 
good gotama is a quick gainer without difficulty, a gainer for nothing now?</P>
<P>Here, brahmin, in the morning I put on robes and taking bowl and robes go for 
alms to the village or hamlet relying on which I abide. After the meal is over 
and returning from the alms round, I roam in that forest stretch. Finding a heap 
of grass or leaves, I collect them and sit on them making a cross legged 
position, keeping the body straight and establishing mindfulness in front. Then 
I know my greed is dispelled, pulled out with the roots, made like a palm stump, 
made a thing that would not grow again. My hate is dispelled, pulled out with 
the roots, made like a palm stump, made a thing that would not grow again. My 
delusion is dispelled, pulled out with the roots, made like a palm stump, made a 
thing that would not grow again.</P>
<P>Brahmin, in that abiding I walk, then my walking is of the noble ones. In 
that abiding I stand, then my standing is of the Noble Ones. In that abiding I 
sit, then my sitting is of the Noble Ones. In that abiding I lie, then my lying 
is of the Noble Ones on a high and lofty bed. Brahmin, these are the high and 
lofty seats of the Noble Ones for which I am a quick gainer without difficulty, 
a gainer for nothing now.</P>
<P>It is wonderful good Gotama, who else could be the quick gainer without 
difficulty, a gainer for nothing now of high and lofty beds of the Noble Ones, 
other than good Gotama. </P>
<P>Good Gotama, I understand. It is like something overturned is reinstated. 
Some thing covered is made manifest. It is as though the path is told to someone 
who has lost his way and it is as though an oil lamp is lighted for the darkness 
so that those who have their sight could see forms. Thus Good Gotama has 
explained the Teaching in various ways. Now I take refuge in good Gotama, in the 
Teaching and the Community of bhikikhus. I am a lay disciple who has taken 
refuge until life lasts. </P>
<P>4. Sarabhasuttaü- To the wandering ascetic Sarabha.</P>
<P>65. At one time the Blessed One was living among the Gijja peaks in Rajagaha 
and a wandering ascetic Sarabha by name who had recently left the dispensaton, 
was going about in Rajagaha saying these words:- I know the teaching of the 
recluse, the son of the sakyas and so left the dispensation.</P>
<P>Then many bhikkhus put on robes in the morning and taking bowls and robes 
entered Rajagaha for alms and heard the ascetic Sarabha saying these words to 
the people of Rajagaha:- I know the teaching of the recluse, the son of the 
Sakyas and so left the dispensation.</P>
<P>Those bhikkhus having gone the alms round and when the meal was over, 
returning from the alms round approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on 
side and said:-Venerable sir, a wandering ascetic Sarabha by name who had 
recently left the dispensaton, is going about in Rajagaha saying these words:- I 
know the teaching of the recluse, the son of the Sakyas and so left the 
dispensation. It is good if the Blessed One would go to the monastery of the 
wandering ascetics on the bank of river Sappinie and see the wandering ascetic 
Sarabha. The Blessed One accepted in silence.</P>
<P>In the evening getting up from his seclusion the Blessed One approached the 
wandering ascetic sarabha in the monastery of the wandering ascetics on the bank 
of river Sappinie. The Blessed One sat on the prepared seat and said:- Sarabha, 
is it true, that you have said these words I know the teaching of the recluse, 
the son of the Sakyas and so left the dispensation. When this was said the 
wandering ascetic Sarabha became silent. </P>
<P>For the second time the Blessed One said: to the ascetic Sarabha:- Sarabha 
tell what you know of the Teaching of the son of the Sakyas. If you be 
incomplete, I will complete. If you are complete, I will appreciate. For the 
second time the wandering ascetic Sarabha became silent. </P>
<P>For the third time the Blessed One said: to the ascetic Sarabha:- Sarabha I 
appoint the Teaching of the son of the Sakyas, tell what you know of the 
Teaching of the son of the Sakyas. If you be incomplete, I will complete. If you 
are complete, I will appreciate. For the third time the wandering ascetic 
Sarabha became silent. </P>
<P>Then the wandering ascetics of Rajagaha said to Sarabha:- Friend, whatever 
you have to confess to the recluse Gotama do it and he will complete. Sarabha, 
tell what you know of the Teaching of the son of the Sakyas. If you be 
incomplete, he will complete. If you are complete, he will appreciate. </P>
<P>When this was said the wandering ascetic Sarabha became silent, confused, 
crestfallen, the face turned downwards, overcome with grief, sat unable to 
reply. </P>
<P>Then the Blessed One knowing that the wandering ascetic Sarabha was sitting 
unable to defend himself addressed the other wandering ascetics:- Wandering 
ascetics, whoever was to tell me, to him who has acknowledged rightful 
enlightenment, these things are not enlightened.- Then I will rightfully cross 
question, ask for reasons and converse together. When cross questioned, asked 
for reasons and conversed together, it is impossible that he should not come to 
one of these three states not another. He would evade the question and change 
the topic. Or show displeasure anger and dislike. Or sit silent confused, 
crestfallen, face turned downwards and overcome with grief like this wandering 
ascetic Sarabha. - </P>
<P>Wandering ascetics, whoever was to tell me, to him who has acknowledged the 
destruction of desires, these desires are not destroyed- Then I will rightfully 
cross question, ask for reasons and converse together. When cross questioned, 
asked for reasons and conversed together, it is impossible that he should not 
come to one of these three states not another. He would evade the question and 
change the topic. Or show displeasure anger and dislike. Or sit silent confused, 
crestfallen, face turned downwards and overcome with grief like this wandering 
ascetic Sarabha. </P>
<P>Wandering ascetics, whoever was to tell me, for whatever purpose the Teaching 
was preached, when logically concluded it does not lead to the rightful 
destruction of unpleasantness.- Then I will rightfully cross question, ask for 
reasons and converse together. When cross questioned, asked for reasons and 
conversed together, it is impossible that he should not come to one of these 
three states not another. He would evade the question and change the topic. Or 
show displeasure anger and dislike. Or sit silent confused, crestfallen, face 
turned downwards and overcome with grief like this wandering ascetic Sarabha. . 
</P>
<P>The Blessed One, roaring the lion's roar three times to the wandering 
ascetics at the </P>
<P>monastery of the wandering ascetics, entered space</P>
<P>Soon after the Blessed One had gone the other wandering ascetics surrounded 
the wandering ascetic Sarabha and began to jeer and tease him. Sarabha, in the 
vast woodland thinking I will roar the lion's roar, you cried like a jackal. 
Sarabha, you tired to roar like a lion to out do the recluse Gotama. Yet cried 
like a jackal. Like a parrot who wanted to sing the cuckoo's song only shrieked 
like a parrot. Sarabha you wanted to out do the recluse Gotama. Sarabha, you 
yelled like a bull in an empty cattle shed, thus and thus you wanted to out do 
the recluse Gotama. </P>
<P>Thus the other wandering ascetics jeered and teased the wandering ascetic 
sarabha. </P>
<P>5. Kesamuttisuttaü</P>
<P>66.I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was touring the country of 
Kosala with a large Community of bhikkhus and entered the hamlet Kesamutta of 
the Kalamas. Then the Kalamas of Kesamutta heard that the good recluse Gotama, 
who had gone forth from the Sakya clan and become homeless has entered 
Kesamutta. And such good praise spread about that blessed Gotama. That Blessed 
One is worthy, rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well 
gone, knower of the worlds, the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, teacher 
of gods and men, enlightened and blessed. He having realized by himself teaches 
in this world together with gods and men, Mara, Brahma and the community of 
recluses and brahmins. The Teaching which is good in the beginning, middle and 
end, full of meaning in words and letters and it clearly points out the complete 
and pure holy life. It is good to see such worthy ones. </P>
<P>Then the Kalamas of Kesamutta approached the Blessed One, some worshipped and 
sat on a side. Some exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side. Some 
extended their clasped hands towards the Blessed One and sat on a side. Some 
announced their name and clan and sat on a side and some others silently sat on 
a side and said thus to the Blessed One:- </P>
<P>Venerable sir, some recluses and brahmins who come to Kesamutta, explain 
their own view, they curse, scold and have spite for other's views and make them 
useless. Then other recluses and brahmins come to Kesamutta, they too explain 
their own view and curse, scold and have spite for other's views and make them 
useless. Venerable sir, we hesitate and doubt, as to which good recluse says the 
truth and which one says the untruth. </P>

not for welfare, they conduce to unpleasantness- Kalamas, then you should dispel 
them. </P>

<P>Kalamas, the noble disciple is thus free from covetousness, free from anger, 
free from delusion, aware and with established mindfulness, then he pervades one 
direction with lovingkindness, so too the second, third, fourth, above, below 
and across, in every respect, on the whole, entirely. Then he pervades one 
direction with compassion, ...re.... with intrinsic joy,...re.... with 
equanimity, so too the second, third, fourth, above, below and across, in every

</P>
<P>If there is another world, if there are the results of good and evil actions, 
there is a possibility that I after death will be born in a good state in 
heaven. This is his first consolation. If there is not another world, if there 
are no results for good and evil actions, here and now I abide without enmity, 
without covetousness, I abide pure and pleasant. This is his second consolation. 
The evil doer does evil, I do not think any evil, I have not done any evil, so I 
will not experience any results of evil. This is his third consolation. If it is 
that the doer does no evil, bothwise I see myself pure. This is his fourth 
consolation </P>

<P>&nbsp;6. Sàlhasuttaü</P>
<P>67.I heard thus. At one time venerable Nandaka was abiding in the Pubba 
monastery, the mansion of Migara's mother in Savatthi. </P>
<P>Then Salha a grandson of Migara and Rohana a grandson of Pekhuniya approached 
venerable Nandaka, worshipped, sat on a side and Veneràble Nandaka said:- </P>

not for welfare, they conduce to unpleasantness- Sàlha, then you should dispel 
them. </P>

long time? Yes, venerable sir. </P>

Udertaken and accomplished do they conduce to evil and unpleasantness or what is 
it? Venerable sir, undertaken and accomplished they conduce to evil and 
unpleasantness. It occurs to me thus. </P>
<P>Sàlha, as you yourself say, do not follow the leader, do not go by the 
examination of reasons, do not stick to wrong views, don't go by this has to be 
so, don't go by the words of your teacher, the recluse. Sàlha, you, yourself

thoughts are not blamed by the wise, these thoughts undertaken and accomplished 
are for welfare, they conduce to pleasantness- Sàlha, then you should grow them. 
</P>
<P>Sàlha, is there non greed? Yes, venerable sir.</P>
<P>I give its meaning as not coveting. A not greedy person with a mind not 
obsessed with greed, does not destroy living things, does not take the not 
given, does not go to other's wives, does not tell lies, and does not arouse 
others to do the same. Does this conduce to pleasantness for a long time. Yes, 
venerable sir. </P>

<P>I give its meaning as not injuring. A not angry person with a mind not 
obsessed with anger, does not destroy living things, does not take the not

Venerable sir. Are they faulty or not faulty? Not faulty. Venerable sir. Are 
they blamed or praised by the wise? Venerable sir, they are praised by the wise.

is it? Venerable sir, undertaken and accomplished they conduce to pleasantness, 
it occurs to me thus. </P>
<P>Sàlha, as you yourself say, do not follow the leader, do not go by the 
examination of reasons, do not stick to wrong views, don't go by this has to be 
so, don't go by the words of your teacher, the recluse. Sàlha, you, yourself

thoughts are praised by the wise, these thoughts undertaken and accomplished are 
for the welfare, they conduce to pleasantness- Sàlha, then you should grow them. 
If it was said, it was said on account of this. </P>
<P>Sàlha, the noble disciple is thus free from covetousness, free from anger, 
free from delusion, aware and with established mindfulness, then he pervades one 
direction with lovingkindness, so too the second, third, fourth, above, below 
and across, in every respect, on the whole, entirely. Then he pervades one 
direction with compassion, ...re.... with intrinsic joy,...re.... with 
equanimity, so too the second, third, fourth, above, below and across, in every 
respect, on the whole, entirely. Then he knows, there is this unexalted and 
exalted. There is an escape beyond this perceptivity. When he knows and sees 
thus, his mind is released, from sensual desires, from desires `to be' and 
ignorant desires, then knowledge arises birth is destroyed, the holy life is 
lived, what should be done is done, there is nothing to wish. Earlier there was 
greed, it was demerit, now it is no more and it is merit Earlier there was 
anger, it was demerit, now it is no more and it is merit Earlier there was 
delusion, it was demerit, now it is no more and it is merit. Thus he is here and 
now satisfied, extinguished, cooled, and abides with feelings like Brahma. </P>
<P>&nbsp;7 Kathàvatthusuttaü.-Conversation</P>
<P>68.Bhikkhus, these three are the topics of conversation. What three? Either 
it is a conversation about the past- such as, it was so in the past. Or it is a 
conversation about the future-such as, it will be so in the future. Or it is a 
conversation of the present- such as, it is this at present. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, by the way a person converses, it should be known whether he is 
capable to converse or not capable to converse. Bhikkhus, this person asked a 
question that needs a direct answer if he fails to give the direct answer. Asked 
a question that needs an explanatory answer, if he fails to give the explanatory 
answer.Asked a question that needs a counter question, fails to counter question 
and if asked a question which should be put aside, fails to put it aside. It 
should be known this person is incapable for conversation. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, this person asked a question that needs a direct answer, if he 
gives the direct answer. Asked a question that needs an explanatory answer, if 
he gives the explanatory answer. Asked a question that needs a counter question, 
if he counter questions and if asked a question which should be put aside, he 
puts it aside. It should be known this person is capable for conversation. . 
</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, by the way a person converses, it should be known whether he is 
capable to converse or not capable to converse.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, if this person being asked a question does not adhere to 
possibilities and impossibilities, does not adhere to assumptions, does not 
allow other views and has no method, it should be known that this person is not 
capable to converse. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, if this person being asked a question adheres to possibilities and 
impossibilities, adheres to assumptions, allows other views and has a method, it 
should be known that this person is capable to converse </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, by the way a person converses, it should be known whether he is 
capable to converse or not capable to converse.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, this person being asked a question, if he evades the question and 
leads the conversation aside, or shows ill temper, malice and mistrust, it 
should be known, this person is not capable to converse. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, this person being asked a question, if he does not evade the 
question and does not lead the conversation aside, nor shows ill temper, malice

mock or disturb it, this should be known, the person is capable to converse.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, by the way a person converses, it should be known whether he has a 
foundation or whether he hasn't a foundation. </P>
<P>Without attentive listening, there is no foundation, with attentive 
listening, there is a foundation. The one who has a foundation knows it 
thoroughly, knowing certain things accurately, he dispels certain things and 
realizes certain things. He that knows thoroughly, accurately knows to dispel 
certain things and to realize certain things and to touch rightful release. 
Bhikkhus, it is for this, there is conversation, there is consultation, there is 
a foundation and lending ear for the complete release of the mind. . </P>
<P>If the opposing sides talk to turn out one side and be elated, </P>
<P>It is not noble, it opens the opposing side</P>
<P>The wrong words disturb and delude the defeated.</P>
<P>The noble should talk to please each other.</P>
<P>The wise one waits for the right moment to talk</P>
<P>Talk on the Teaching or the lives of the noble ones</P>
<P>By that they make no enemies and do not become elated</P>
<P>With not seizing minds, they become merciful and harmless</P>
<P>Without jealousy and knowing rightfully, talk good words,</P>
<P>To satisfy the good end. Does not train for reproach </P>
<P>Does no wrong, with words that curse or crush. Speaks little.</P>
<P>For giving knowledge and appeasement</P>
<P>This is how the Noble Ones speak, it's not for elation. </P>
<P>8 A¤¤atitthiyasuttaü </P>
<P>69. Bhikkhus, if wandering ascetics of another faith ask you: Friends, these 
are three things. What three? Greed, hatred and delusion. Friends, what is the 
difference between these three things? When this is asked, how are you going to 
explain yourself to the wandering ascetics of other sects?</P>
<P>The Blessed One is the leader, we rely on the Blessed One for the teaching. 
It is good that the Blessed One himself explain the meaning of these words. </P>
<P>Then bhikkhus, listen carefully and attend to it. The Blessed One said:- 
Bhikkhus, if wandering ascetics of another faith ask you: Friends, these are 
three things. What three? Greed, hatred and delusion. Friends, what is the 
difference between these three things? When this is asked, you should reply 
thus:- Friends, greed is a fault of lesser weight but takes a long time to fade. 
Hate is a fault of greater weight and it fades quickly. Delusion is a fault of 
greater weight, and it takes a long time to fade. </P>
<P>Friends, what is the reason for not arisen greed to arise and arisen greed to 
develop? Friends, the reply is an agreeable sign. An agreeable sign attended 
unwisely arouses not arisen greed and develops arisen greed. Friends, this is 
the reason for non arisen greed to arise and arisen greed to develop. </P>
<P>Friends, what is the reason for not arisen hate to arise and arisen hate to 
develop? Friends, the reply is a sign of aversion. A sign of aversion attended 
unwisely arouses not arisen hate and develops arisen hate. Friends, this is the 
reason for non arisen hate to arise and arisen hate to develop. </P>
<P>Friends, what is the reason for non arisen delusion to arise and arisen 
delusion to develop? Friends, the reply is unwise attention. One thinking 
unwisely arouses not arisen delusion and develops arisen delusion. Friends, this 
is the reason for non arisen delusion to arise and arisen delusion to develop. 
</P>
<P>Friends, what is the reason for non arisen greed to not arise and arisen 
greed to fade? Friends, the reply is a disagreeable sign. When wise attention is 
given to a disagreeable sign not arisen greed does not arise and arisen greed 
fades. Friends, this is the reason for non arisen greed to not arise and arisen 
greed to fade.. </P>
<P>Friends, what is the reason for not arisen hate to not arise and arisen hate 
to fade? Friends, the reply ia the release of mind in loving kindness. When the 
mind is released in loving kindness, not arisen hate does not arise and arisen 
hate fades. Friends, this is the reason for non arisen hate to not arise and 
arisen hate to fade.. </P>
<P>Friends, what is the reason for non arisen delusion not to arise and arisen 
delusion to fade? Friends, the reply is wise attention. To one thinking wisely 
not arisen delusion does not arise and arisen delusion fades. Friends, this is 
the reason for non arisen delusion to not arise and arisen delusion to fade. 
</P>
<P>9. Akusalamålàni-Roots of demerit.</P>
<P>70. Bhikkhus, these three are the origins of demeãt? What three? </P>
<P>Greed is an origin of demerit. Hate is an origin of demerit and delusion is 
an origin of demerit. </P>
<P>When one greeds, it's demerit. With greed become cruel, if one cooks up, by 
body, speech and mind,[1] that is demerit. If one overcome with cruel greed, the 
mind exhausted, furnish others with disagreeableness and unpleasantness, by 
binding, killing, debasing and banishing, thinking I am powerful, that is 
demerit. Thus born from greed, originating from greed, for the reason of greed, 
evil demeritorious thoughts accure. When one is inflamed, it's demerit. With 
anger if one cooks up, by body, speech and mind,[1] that is demerit. If one 
overcome with anger, the mind exhausted, furnish others with disagreeableness 
and unpleasantness, by binding, killing, debasing and banishing, thinking I am 
powerful, that is demerit. Thus born from anger, originating from anger, for the 
reason of anger, evil demeritorious thoughts accure. </P>
<P>When one is deluded, it's demerit. With delusion if one cooks up, by body, 
speech and mind,[1] that is demerit. If one overcome with delusion, the mind 
exhausted, furnish others with disagreeableness and unpleasantness, by binding, 
killing, debasing and banishing, thinking I am powerful, that is demerit. Thus 
born from delusion, originating from delusion, for the reason of delusion, evil 
demeritorious thoughts accure. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it is said, this kind of person does not speak at the proper time, 
does not tell the truth, the essential, does not talk according to the Teaching 
and the Discipline. Why is it said, this kind of person does not speak at the 
proper time, does not tell the truth, the essential, does not talk according to 
the Teaching and the Discipline? Bhikkhus, this person furnishes others with 
disagreeableness and unpleasantness, by binding, killing, debasing and 
banishing, thinking I am powerful. Talking of what has happend, it should be 
despised not acknowledged. About telling lies, he does not arouse thought to get 
rid of the blemish. Thus it is not real and not the truth. Therefore such 
persons do not speak at the proper time, speak the truth, speak the essential, 
speak according to the Teaching and the Discipline. Bhikkhus, such a person with 
a mind obsessed with demeritorious thoughts born of greed, here and now abides 
in unpleasantness with worries, troubles and wailings and after death a 
decrease, a bad state should be expected. Bhikkhus, such a person with a mind 
obsessed with demeritorious thoughts born of anger, ....re.... born of delusion 
here and now abides in unpleasantness with worries, troubles and wailings and 
after death a decrease, a bad state should be expected. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, like a Sala tree or a Dava tree or an aspen was entwined and 
smothered by three Maluva creepers that caused its destruction. In the same 
manner bhikkhus, such a person with a mind obsessed with demeritorious thoughts 
born of greed, here and now abides in unpleasantness with worries, troubles and 
wailings and after death a decrease, a bad state should be expected. Bhikkhus, 
such a person with a mind obsessed with demeritorious thoughts born of anger, 
....re.... born of delusion here and now abides in unpleasantness with worries,

<P>Bhikkhus, these three are the origins of demerit. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these three are the origins of meãt? What three? </P>
<P>Non-greed is an origin of merit. Non-hate is an origin of demerit and 
Non-delusion is an origin of demerit. </P>
<P>When one does not greed, it's merit. With non-greed one cooks up, by body, 
speech and mind,[1] that is merit. If one not overcome with greed, the mind not 
exhausted, does not furnish others with disagreeableness and unpleasantness, by 
binding, killing, debasing and banishing, thinking I am powerful, that is merit. 
Thus born from non greed, originating from non-greed, for the reason of non- 
greed, meritorious thoughts accure.When one is not inflamed, it's merit. With 
non -anger if one cooks up, with body, speech and mind,[1] that is merit. If one 
overcome with non-anger, the mind not exhausted, does not furnish others with 
disagreeableness and unpleasantness, by binding, killing, debasing and 
banishing, thinking I am powerful, that is merit. Thus born from non-anger, 
originating from non-anger, for the reason of non-anger, meritorious thoughts 
accure. </P>
<P>When one is not deluded, it's merit. With non-delusion if one cooks up, with 
body, speech and mind,[1] that is merit. If one overcome with non-delusion, the 
mind not exhausted, does not furnish others with disagreeableness and 
unpleasantness, by binding, killing, debasing and banishing, thinking I am 
powerful, that is merit. Thus born from non-delusion, originating from 
non-delusion, for the reason of non-delusion, meritorious thoughts accure. </P>

the truth, the essential, talks according to the Teaching and the Discipline.

<P>Bhikkhus, like a Sala tree or a Dava tree or an aspen was entwined and 
smothered by three Maluva creepers that caused its destruction. Then a man came 
with a hoe and basket and cut the the roots of the Maluva creepers and dug out 
all the fine roots. Then he axed the maluva creepers into small bits and dried 
them in the wind and air burned them and turned them into ashes and blew them 
with the air or put them into a fast flowing river. In the same manner bhikkhus, 
such a person with a mind obsessed with meritorious thoughts born of non-greed, 
here and now abides in pleasantness without worries, troubles and wailings and 
after death an increase, a good state should be expected. Bhikkhus, such a 
person with a mind obsessed with meritorious thoughts born of non-anger, 
....re.... born of non-delusion here and now abides in pleasantness without 
worries, troubles and wailings and after death an increase, a good state should 
be expected. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these three are the origins of merit. </P>
<P>10 Uposathasuttaü- Observance for the full moon day.</P>
<P>71. I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was living in the Pubba 
monastery, the palace of Migara's mother in Savatthi. The mother of Migara on 
that full moon day approached the Blessed One worshipped and sat on a side. The 
Blessed One said thus to her:-Visakha, why have you come during day time?</P>
<P>Venerable sir, today is the full moon day and I observe the eight 
precepts.</P>
<P>Visakha, these three are the full moon observances. What three?</P>
<P>The observance of the cattleherd, the observance of the Niganñas and the 
observance of the Noble Ones.</P>
<P>Visakha, what is the observance of the cattleherd? Visakha, just like the 
cattleherd that returns the cattle to their owner in the evening and reflects, 
today the cattle grazed in these and these places and drank water in these and 
these places and tomorrow the cattle will graze in these places and drink water 
in these places. Visakha in the same manner a certain one having observed the 
eight precepts reflects:- Today I ate these and these eatables and drank these 
and these nourishing drinks. Tomorrow I will eat these and these eatables and 
drink these and these nourishing drinks. Thus he spends the day with a mind 
overcome with greed and covetousness. Visakha this is the observance of the 
cattleherd, it is not of great fruit, good results great splendour and a vast 
spread out. . </P>
<P>Visakha, what is the observance of the Niganñas? Visakha, there are a kind of 
recluses called Niganñas, they instruct their disciples thus- Come! Good man, do 
not punish living things in the eastern direction close up to, seven hundred 
miles do not punish living things in the western direction close up to, seven 
hundred miles do not punish living things in the northern direction close up to, 
seven hundred miles and do not punish living things in the southern direction 
close up to, seven hundred miles. Thus the observance is with kindness and 
compassion to some and without kindness and compassion to some. A certain one on 
the full moon day gives his disciples this observance:- Come! Good man. Pull out 
all your clothes and tell. By this I have no desires for any place or anything 
and I have no clingings to any place or thing. His mother and father know this 
is our son and he too knows, this is my mother and father. His wife and children 
know, this is my husband and this is our father and he too knows, this is my 
wife and children. His slaves and workmen know, this is our master and he too 
knows, these are my slaves and workmen. Thus at the time he observes all 
precepts he observes the refrain from telling lies. This is his refrain from 
lies. At the end of that night he partakes his wealth even before it is offered 
to him. This is the refrain not to take the not given.Visakha this is the 
observance of the Niganñas, it is not of great fruit, good results great 
splendour and a vast spread out. </P>
