lives.What three? The first is the place where the bhikkhu cut his hair, wore 
yellow robes and became homeless. The second is the place where the bhikkhu 
understood, as it really is, this is unpleasant, this is the arising of

lodgings, and lighting with difficulty. Then he hears, a certain person of 
warrior clan is made the head anointed warrior king. Hearing this it does not 
occur to him -O! when will I be the head anointed warrior king. Bhikkhus, this 
is the person who has no desires for it. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, who is the person who hopes to attain it? Here the eldest son of

three persons are evident among the bhikkhus. What three? The one who has no 
desires to attain it, the one who hopes to attain it, and the one who has 
fulfilled his desires. </P>

person is unvirtuous, with very low thoughts, secret activity and evil conduct, 
having promised to lead the holy life, he abides doing the evil activities born

his mind from desires, released through wisdom, abides here and now having 
realized it. It does not occur to him: O! When shall I destroy desires, attain 
the release of mind, the release through wisdom by myself realizing, abide here 
and now? Bhikkhus, this person has no desires to attain it. </P>

When shall I destroy desires, attain the release of mind, the release through 
wisdom and by myself realizing, abide here and now? Bhikkhus, this person has 
hopes to attain it. </P>

is a worthy one. He has destroyed his desires. He hears:- The bhikkhu of this 
name having destroyed desires, released his mind from desires, released through 
wisdom, abides here and now having realized it. It does not occur to him: O! 
When shall I destroy desires, attain the release of mind, the release through 
wisdom by myself realizing, abide here and now? What is the reason? Earlier he 
was not released, now he is released and his desires are fulfilled. Bhikkhus,

without a king. Then a certain bhikkhu asked the Blessed One:- Venerable sir, 
how is the righteous universal monarch the ruler of righteousness? </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhu, the righteous universal monarch who values righteousness and 
pays homage to the Teaching, making the Teaching his flag and sign, righteously 
protects the Teaching and makes arrangements to protect himself together with 
the populace. </P>

</P>
<P>5. Pacetano.-King Pacetana</P>
<P>15 At one time the Blessed One was living in the deer park in Isipatana in 
Benares and addressed the bhikkhus. Bhikkhus, in the past, there was a king by 
the name Pacetana. One day he called the chariot maker and asked him:- Friend, 
chariot maker, in another six months, there will be a battle, could you make a 
pair of new wheels? The chariot maker replied:- Possible my'lord . </P>
<P>The chariot maker made one wheel, six days before the completion of the six 
months. The king addressed the chariot maker again and told him, Friend, chariot 
maker in another six days, there will be a battle. Are the pair of wheels made? 
</P>
<P>My lord, six days before the completion of the six months, I have made one 
wheel.</P>
<P>Friend, chariot maker, is it possible to make the other wheel in the 
remaining six days. Possible. Lord. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the chariot maker completed the other wheel in the remaining six 
days and approached king Pacetàna and said My lord, here are the new pair of 
wheels.</P>
<P>Friend chariot maker, what is the difference in the wheel you made, in six 
months short of six days and the wheel you made in six days, I see no difference 
in them. </P>
<P>My lord, there is a difference, now you will see the difference. </P>
<P>Then the chariot maker taking the wheel done in six days, set it rolling. It 
rolled on as long as the intended activity prevailed, circled and fell on the 
ground. Then he rolled the wheel made in six months short of six days. It rolled 
on as long as the intended activity prevailed, and stood as though saying the 
work is done.</P>
<P>My lord, of the wheel made in six days, the outer circumference, the spokes, 
and the nave are crooked, faulty and with blemishes. It rolled on as long as the 
intended activity prevailed, then circled and fell on the ground. My lord, of 
the wheel made in six months short of six days, the outer circumference, the 
spokes, and the nave are not crooked, not faulty and without blemishes. It 
rolled on as long as the intended activity prevailed and then stood upright as 
though to say the work is done.. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, did it occur to you, that the chariot maker was someone else. 
Bhikkhus, it should be known that I was that chariot maker at that time. Then I 
was clever in the crookedness, faults and blemishes of wood. Now I'm worthy, 
rightfully enlightened and clever in bodily crookednesses, faults and blemishes. 
I am clever in verbal crookednesses, faults and blemishes and mental 
crookednesses, faults and blemishes. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, whoever bhikkhu or bhikkhuni, who has not dispelled bodily, verbal 
and mental crookednesses, faults and blemishes in this dispensation, will have a 
fall like the wheel done in six days.Bhikkhus, whoever bhikkhu or bhikkhuni, who 
has dispelled bodily, verbal and mental crookednesses, faults and blemishes, 
will stand firm in this dispensation like the wheel done in six months less by 
six days.</P>
<P>Therefore, bhikkhus, your training should be, we will dispel bodily, verbal 
and mental crookednesses, faults and blemishes. </P>
<P>6. Apaõõakasuttaü - A sure method.</P>
<P>16.Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu endowed with three things follows the sure method 
from the beginning with aroused effort, for the destruction of desires. What 
three? Here the bhikkhu is controlled in his mental faculties, knows the right 
amount to partake and is wakeful. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, how is the bhikkhu controlled in his mental faculties? Here the 
bhikkhu seeing a form does not take the sign or the detailsòo someone abiding 
with the mental faculty of the eye uncontrolled may arise thoughts of greed and 
displeasure, so he controls the mental faculty of the eye. Hearing a 
sound,...re...Smelling a scent,...re..òasting food,..re..... Sensing a touch 
...re.... Cognising an idea does not take the sign or the details. To someone 
abiding with the mental faculty of the mind uncontrolled may arise thoughts of 
greed and displeasure, so he controls the mental faculty of the mind. Thus the 
bhikkhu is controlled in his mental faculties. </P>
<P>How does the bhikkhu know the right amount to partake? Here the bhikkhu 
wisely considering partakes food, not for, fun, intoxication or to look 
beautiful. He partakes food thinking I partake this, for maintaining the body 
without attachment to tastes, as a help to lead the holy life Partaking this 
food I get rid of earlier feelings, do not arouse new feelings. It should be 
faultless, and for a pleasant abiding. In this manner the bhikkhu knows the 
right amount to partake.. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, how is the bhikkhu wakeful? Here the bhikkhu cleans the mind of 
obstructing things during the day time, seated some where. During the first 
watch of the night too he cleans the mind of obstructing things. In the middle 
watch of the night he lies down turning to his right side, taking the posture in 
which the lion sleeps. Putting one foot over the other he becomes aware of the 
perception of waking. Getting up in the last watch of the night he cleans the 
mind of obstructing things. Thus the bhikkhu becomes wakeful. Bhikkhus, the 
bhikkhu endowed with these three things from the beginning with aroused effort, 
follows the sure method for the destruction of desires.</P>
<P>7. Attabyàbàdhsutta. - Causing trouble to oneself</P>

<P>others and bring trouble on both parties. What three? </P>

<P>others and does not bring trouble on both parties. What three? </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, bodily, verbal and mental good behaviour is not troublesome to 
oneself, not troublesome to others and does not bring trouble to both parties. 
</P>
<P>8. Devalokasuttam.-Heaven</P>
<P>18.Bhikkhus, if ascetics of another faith ask you:- Friends, do you lead the 
holy life in the dispensation of the recluse Gotama, to be born in heaven? 
Wouldn't you be worried, wouldn't you loathe it? Yes, venerable sir. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, wouldn't you be worried and wouldn't you loathe that heavenly, life 
span, beauty, pleasantness, fame and authority. Isn't it better that you be 
worried and loathe bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct and mental misconduct.

and selling articles of trade. Thus the shopkeeper becomes sharp. </P>

children. We too should give him presents from time to time. Thus the shopkeeper 
becomes resourceful. Bhikkhus, endowed with these three things the shopkeeper

effort to dispel demeritorious thoughts and becomes firm with aroused effort to 
develop meritorious thoughts. Thus the bhikkhu becomes sharp. </P>
