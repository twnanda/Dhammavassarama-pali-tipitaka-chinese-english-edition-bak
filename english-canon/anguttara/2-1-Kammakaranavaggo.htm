<P>1. Vajjasuttaü -The blameable</P>
<P>I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered 
by Anatapindika in Jeta’s grove in Savatthi and the Blessed One addressed the 
bhikkhus: ßBhikkhus, there are two blameables such as the blameable here and now 
and the blameable here after. What is the blameable here and now? Bhikkhus, a 
certain person sees a robber or an evil doer, caught and brought before the king 
and the king meting him punishment. He causes to whip him, with the whip, jungle 
rope or the soiled stick. Causes to cut his major and minor limbs. Causes to put 
him in the gruel pot, clip his hair, to put him in darkness, to garland him with 
blazing garlands, to burn his hands with a torch, to punish with the bark dress, 
to make him like the antelope, to put fish hooks in his body, to pull out pieces 
of flesh from the body the size of coins, or chase him to alkaline water. Or 
with a spike driven from one ear to the other he is fixed to the ground to spin. 
Or to beat him until his body is as soft as straw, or to throw into boiling oil, 
or to give him to the dogs to be eaten alive, or he is raised on a spike until 
life lasts or the neck is cut with a sword. </P>
<P>Then it occurs to him, as this robber, this evil doer is punished, so I too 
will be punished by whipping...re... or cutting off the neck with a sword. He 
frightened of the blameable here and now does no robbery or evil actions. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is blameable here after? A certain one reflects, one 
misconducting bodily will have evil results here after, one misconducting 
verbally will have evil results here after and one misconducting mentally will 
have evil results here after and if I misconduct myself by body, speech and 
mind, I will indeed be born in loss, in decrease, in hell after death </P>
<P>He frightened of the blameable here after gives up bodily misconduct, pursues 
bodily good conduct gives up verbal misconduct, pursues verbal good conduct 
gives up mental misconduct, pursues mental good conduct Bhikkhus, this is the 
blameable here after. These two are the blameables and you should train. We 
should be frightened of the blameable here and now and the blameable here after, 
we will be free from all blames. This is the first. </P>
<P>2. Padhànasuttaü Striving.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, there are two kinds of striving, which are attained with 
difficulty. What are they? Striving of a lay person living in a household to 
supply robes, morsel food, medicinal requisites and dwellings and a homeless one 
striving to give up all endearments. Bhikkhus, of these two a homeless one 
striving to give up all endearments is more noble. Therefore bhikkhus, you 
should strive to give up all endearments </P>
<P>3. Tapanãyasuttam Remorse</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these two things are remorseful. What two? It is bodily misconduct 
and not developing the correct bodily conduct, verbal misconduct and not 
developing the correct verbal conduct, mental misconduct and not developing the 
correct mental conduct. Then someone repents I have misconducted bodily, have 
not developed the correct bodily conduct. I have misconducted verbally, have not 
developed the correct verbal conduct.I have misconducted mentally, have not 
developed the correct mental conduct. Bhikkhus, these two are remorseful. This 
is the third.</P>
<P>4. Atapanãyasuttaü Not remorseful</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these two things are not remorseful. What two? A certain one 
develops good bodily conduct and abstains from incorrect bodily conduct, 
develops good verbal conduct and abstains from incorrect verbal conduct, 
develops good mental conduct and abstains from incorrect mental conduct. He does 
not repent, I have misconducted bodily, have not developed the correct bodily 
conduct. He does not repent I have misconducted verbally, have not developed the 
correct verbal conduct.He does not repent I have misconducted mentally, have not 
developed the correct mental conduct. Bhikkhus, these two are not remorseful. 
This is the fourth. </P>
<P>5. Upa¤¤àtasuttaü -Needs acquiring knowledge.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, you should acquire knowledge in these two things. Such as 
dissatisfaction in meritorious thoughts and the non hindering exertion in 
meritorious thoughts. Bhikkhus, such was my exertion in meritorious thoughts. If 
it is so, may my skin, veins and bones remain. May the whole body dry up with 
flesh and blood. Without attaining what has to be attained with manly strength, 
effort and vigour I will not give up effort. Bhikkhus, then I quickly attained 
enlightenment and the end of unpleasantness. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, you too should exert in meritorious thoughts. If it is so, may my 
skin, veins and bones remain. May the whole body dry up with flesh and blood. 
Without attaining what has to be attained with manly strength, effort and vigour 
I will not give up effort. Bhikkhus, if you do so, you too before long will 
attain the noble end of the holy life, for which sons of clansmen rightfully 
leave the household and become homeless. You will realize it here and now and 
abide in it. </P>
<P>Therefore bhikkhus, you should train. If it is so, may my skin, veins and 
bones remain. May the whole body dry up with flesh and blood. Without attaining 
what has to be attained with manly strength, effort and vigour I will not give 
up effort. This is the fifth.</P>
<P>6. Samyojanasuttaü Bonds.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, there are two thoughts. What two? Taking pleasure in binding 
thoughts and penetratingly seeing binding thoughts. Bhikkhus, those who enjoy 
binding thoughts do not dispel greed, do not dispel anger and do not dispel 
delusion. They are not released from birth, decay, death, grief, lament and 
displeasure. I say they are not released from unpleasantness. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, those who see binding thoughts penetratingly dispel greed, dispel 
anger and dispel delusion. They are released from birth, decay, death, grief, 
lament and displeasure. I say they are released from unpleasantness. Bhikkhus, 
these are the two thoughts. This is the sixth.</P>
<P>7. Kaõõasuttaü -Vile things</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, there are two vile things. What two? They are no shame and no 
regret. Bhikkhus these two things are vile </P>
<P>8.Sukkasuttaü - Morally good things </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, there are two morally good things. What two? They are shame and 
regret. Bhikkhus these two things are morally good </P>
<P>&nbsp;9. Cariyasuttam.-Good manners.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these two morally good things protect the world. What two? Shame 
and regret. Bhikkhus, if these two morally good things did not protect the 
world, people would not know the mother or the step mother or the aunt, or the 
teacher’s wife, as the teacher’s wife. There is a difference in the world unlike 
among goats, fowl, pigs, dogs, and foxes. Since these two morally good things 
protect the world, people know the mother, the step mother, the aunt, or the 
teacher’s wife as the teacher’s wife. This is the nineth. </P>
<P>10. Vassåpanàyikasuttaü - Observing the rains </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, there are two ways of observing the rains. Observing the rains at 
the right time and observing it later on. These are the two ways of observing 
the rains. This is the tenth.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
