<P>005.01. At one time The Blessed One was abiding in the monastery offered by 
Anathapindika in Jeta's grove in Savatthi. The Blessed One put on robes in the 
morning and taking bowl and robes entered Savatthi for the alms round. After the 
meal was over and returning from the alms round The Blessed One addressed 
venerable Ananda: Ananda, let us approach the Pubba monastery, the palace of 
Migara's motherño spend the day. Venerable Ananda agreed and The Blessed One 
approached the Pubba monastery with venerable Ananda. The Blessed One getting up 
from his evening seclusion addressed venerable Ananda: Ananda, let us go to the 
eastern pond to wash the body. The Blessed One approached the eastern pond with 
venerable Ananda. Having washed the body in the eastern pond, ascending from the 
pond stood in one robe to dry the body.</P>
<P>At that time king Pasenadi Kosala's great elephant named Seta with much 
musical sounds and dancing ascended from the eastern pond and the people there 
seeing it said: Friends, the king's elephant is beautiful! It is attractive! It 
is pleasing! It has a beautiful body! Indeed, the king's elephant is an elephant 
of elephants. Then venerable Udayi said to The Blessed One. Venerable sir, is it 
only for an elephant that is huge, well built and beautiful that people seeing 
it say:: It is an elephant of elephants? Udayi, they say. It is an elephant of 
elephants to an elphant,...re..... to a horse, ....re...ño a bull, ...re...ño a 
snake,...re... to a tree and....re.... even to a human. Udayi, seeing humans 
well built and attractive people say he is an elephant of elephants. Yet Udayi, 
I call him that does no evil in the world together with its gods, men, Mara, 
Brahma, recluses and Brahmins by body, word or mind an elephant. These are 
excellent words of The Blessed One. I eulogize The Blessed One with these 
verses.</P>
<P>A human, enlightened, tamed and concentrated, </P>
<P>Abides in the path of Brahma attached to appeasing the mind.</P>
<P>He has gone beyond all things, humans and gods worship that arahant </P>
<P>Destroying all bonds he has attained extinction</P>
<P>Not attached to sensuality, is released like a rock of gold </P>
<P>The elephant has climbed to the top of the Himalaya mountains</P>
<P>Of all names of the elephant incomparable is the best.</P>
<P>Elephant, I eulogize you. You do no evil. </P>
<P>Gentleness and not doing harm are your two feet</P>
<P>The other two are austerities and the holy life</P>
<P>Faith is the trunk, and equanimity the white tusks</P>
<P>Mindfulness is the neck and wisdom, investigation, </P>
<P>And righteous thinking are the top </P>
<P>The Teaching is the stomach and seclusion and dispelling is the tail</P>
<P>Concentrates attached to in breaths, goes, stands, lies and sits concentrated 
</P>
<P>The elephant is restrained in every way, these are his attainments</P>
<P>He does not partake food, with a fault, </P>
<P>Gaining food and clothes does not accumulate</P>
<P>Giving up bonds large and small, he goes without wishes</P>
<P>Like the scent of the lotus born in the water is not soiled by water </P>
<P>Likewise the well born Blessed One is not soiled in the world. </P>
<P>Like a great fire that extinguishes in want of fuel </P>
<P>When determinations are appeased, is extinguished </P>
<P>To explain this a comparison is said</P>
<P>A great man describes a Great Man </P>
<P>Free from greed, hate and delusion I dispel the body </P>
<P>And extinguish without desires</P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>

<P>005.02. Venerable Ananda putting on robes in the morning, taking bowl and 
robes approached the house of the female lay disciple Migasala and sat on the 
prepared seat. The lay female disciple Migasala approached venerable Ananda, 
worshipped, sat on a side and said:</P>
<P>Venerable sir, Ananda, knowing in what manner does The Blessed One declare 
the one who led the holy life and the one who lived the lay life gone to the 
same destiny after death? Venerable sir, my father Purana, led the holy life, 
abstaining from low sexual intercourse, after he died The Blessed One declared 
he is born in the world of happiness and is a once returner. My father's brother 
Isidatta led a happy lay life contented with his wife and children, after he 
died The Blessed One declared he is born in the world of happiness and is a once 
returner.Venerable sir, Ananda, knowing in what manner does The Blessed One 
declare the one who led the holy life and the one who lived the lay life gone to 
the same destiny after death? Sister, The Blessed One has declared this in this 
manner. </P>
<P>Venerable Ananda, partaking the meal at the lay female disciple Migasala's 
house, getting up from his seat, went away. After the meal venerable Ananda 
approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said:</P>
<P>Here, venerable sir, I put on robes in the morning, taking bowl and robes 
approached the house of the female lay disciple Migasala and sat on the prepared 
seat. The lay female disciple Migasala approached me worshipped, sat on a side

declare the one who led the holy life and the one who lived the lay life gone to 
the same destiny after death? Venerable sir, then I said. Sister, The Blessed 
One has declared this in this manner. </P>
<P>Ananda, who is this foolish lay female disciple with low wisdom? What does 
she know about the human character and everything that comes into the range of 
the mental faculties? Ananda, six beings are evident in the world. What six? 
</P>
<P>Here, Ananda, a certain person is gentle, co-exists happily, if living the 
holy life enjoys living alone. He has not heard something fruitful, has not 
learnt something, has not straightened his view and he personally has not gained 
any release. After death he goes to loss does not gain any distinction. </P>
<P>Here, Ananda, a certain person is gentle co-exists happily, if living the 
holy life, enjoys living alone. He has heard something fruitful, has learnt 
something, has straightened his view and he personally has gained some release. 
After death he does not go to loss gains some distinction. There Ananda, those 
who measure say. The same things were evident in this one and the other. Why did 
one go to decrease and the other go to increase. Ananda, it is for their 
unpleasantness for a long time. There, Ananda, that person who is gentle 
co-exists happily, if living the holy life enjoys living alone. Has heard 
something fruitful, has learnt something, has straightened his view and he 
personally has gained some release. This one is superior and exalted than the 
previous said person. What is the reason? This one has entered the stream of the 
Teaching Who would know this difference other than the Thus Gone One? Therefore 
Ananda, do not measure persons. They that measure people do it, lop sidedly. 
Either I should measure people or one like me should do it.</P>
<P>Here, Ananda, a certain person is overwhelmed with hate and from time to time 
greed arises to him. He has not heard something fruitful, has not learnt 
something, has not straightened his view and he personally has not gained any 
release. After death he goes to loss does not gain any distinction. </P>
<P>Here, Ananda, a certain person is overwhelmed with hate and from time to time

<P>There Ananda, those who measure say. The same things were evident in this one 
and the other. Why did one go to decrease and the other go to increase. Ananda, 
it is for their unpleasantness for a long time. There, Ananda, that person 
overwhelmed with hate and has verbal determinations rising to him from time to 
time, has heard something fruitful, has learnt something, has straightened his 
view and he personally has gained some release. This one is superior and exalted 
than the previous said person. What is the reason? This one has entered the

<P>Ananda, who is this foolish lay female disciple with low wisdom? What does 
she know about the human character and everything that comes into the range of 
the mental faculties? Ananda, these six beings are evident in the world.</P>
<P>Ananda, whatever virtues Purna had developed, those virtues were evident in 
Isidatta too. Whatever wisdom Purna had developed, that wisdom was evident in 
Isidatta too. There is no other birth for Purana other than, that of Isisdatta. 
Therefore, Ananda, both these persons are in the same category.

<P>005.03. Bhikkhus, is poverty unpleasant to worldlings enjoying sensual 
pleasures? Yes, venerable sir. Bhikkhus, the poor, incapable, miserable take a 
loan to pay the interest. Is paying the interest unpleasant to worldlings 
enjoying sensual pleasures? Yes, venerable sir. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the poor, incapable, miserable take a loan to pay the interest, and 
not paying the interest is pursued Is pursuit for the interest, unpleasant to 
worldlings enjoying sensual pleasures? Yes, venerable sir. Bhikkhus, the poor, 
incapable, miserable take a loan to pay the interest, and pursued for the 
interest evade. Is evasion from pursuit unpleasant to worldlings enjoying 
sensual pleasures? Yes, venerable sir. Bhikkhus, the poor, incapable, miserable 
take a loan to pay the interest, when evading to pay the interest, is caught. Is 
that round up, unpleasant to worldlings enjoying sensual pleasures? Yes, 
venerable sir. Thus bhikkhus, poverty is unpleasant to worldlings enjoying 
sensual pleasures. ...re....a debt,....re.... paying an interest, 
....re....pursuit,....re.... evasion, .....re...and the round up is unpleasant 
to worldlings enjoying sensual pleassures. </P>
<P>In the same manner bhikkhus to whomever there is no faith in meritorious 
things, no shame in meritorious things, no remorse for meritorius things, no 
effort for meritorious things, no wisdom for meritorious things. Bhikkhus, this 
is poverty, incapacity misery in the dispensation of the noble ones. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the poor, incapable, miserable one, without faith in meritorious 
things, ...re..shame...re...remorse,....re... effort and without wisdom in 
meritorious things misbehaves by body, words and mind I say, this is the loan 
that he takes. To conceal his bodily misbehaviour, he wishes evil, thinks may I 
be not known and makes effort with the body. I say, this is the interest he 
pays. Then well behaved co-associates tell him. Venerable one this is the right 
behaviour. I say, this is the pursuit. Then gone to the forest, the root of a 
tree or an empty house remorseful evil thoughts pursue him. I say, this is the 
evasion.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, that poor, incapable, miserable one, misbehaving by body, words and 
mind, after death is rounded up in hell or is bound in animal birth, I do not 
see any other bond so dangerous and evil as the bond of hell or the animal birth 
for the ending of unpleasantness. </P>
<P>Poverty and indebtedness are unpleasant, the poor eating on a loan worry.</P>
<P>They evade repaying and get rounded up. It is unpleasant for those seeking 
pleasure. </P>
<P>This same happens to those who have no faith in the noble one's 
dispensation.</P>
<P>The shameless ones, without remorse judged on their evil actions </P>
<P>Having done evil by body, words and mind, wish may I, be not known</P>
<P>Those thoughts develop activity by body, words and mind </P>
<P>Creeping low by body, words or mind they grow evil actions there and 
there</P>
<P>By his actions, the fool knows, I have done evil </P>
<P>It is like the poor taking a loan and worrying</P>
<P>Remorseful evil thoughts pursue him to village or forest</P>
<P>By his actions the fool knows, I have done evil. </P>
<P>He goes to some womb, or even to hell.</P>
<P>This bond is unpleasant, the wise are released from it. </P>
<P>They give out of their righteously earned wealth and are pleased</P>
<P>Both throws of those householders with faith are lucky.</P>
<P>Here and now and here after </P>
<P>The benevolence of those householders develop merit.</P>
<P>Likewise placing faith in the noble dispensation, </P>
<P>The shameful, remorseful, virtuous wise ones,</P>
<P>Live happily in the noble dispensation,</P>
<P>Gaining immaterial pleasantness get established in equanimity</P>
<P>Dispelling the five obstructions are constantly with aroused effort </P>
<P>Attaining to higher states of the mind, are clever and mindful</P>
<P>Knowing as it really is, has destroyed all bonds</P>
<P>Without holding to anything the mind is rightfully released </P>
<P>My release is unshakeable, the bond to be, is destroyed</P>
<P>This is the highest knowledge, the incomparable pleasàntness</P>
<P>It is the non-grieving unstained appeasement the noble freedom from debts.

<P>005.04. I heard thus. At one time venerable Mahacunda was living in Ceti, in 
his native place and venerable Mahacunda addressed the bhikkhus: </P>
<P>Friends, the bhikkhus, who study the Teaching depreciate the bhikkhus who 
develop the mind to higher states. `These say, we raise the mind to a higher 
state. They concentrate, what do they concentrate and how do they concentrate?' 
By that the bhikkhus studying the Teaching are displeased and the bhikkhus 
raising the mind to a higher state are displeased. It is not for the good and 
pleasantness of many, not for the welfare and happiness of gods and men </P>
<P>Friends, the bhikkhus, who raise the mind to a higher state depreciate the 
bhikkhus who study the Teaching `These say, we study the Teaching, they are 
unbalanced, haughty, wavering, talkative, with loose talk, without mindful 
awareness, not concentrating scatter brained and with uncontrolled mental 
faculties. What Teaching do they study and how do they study?' By that the 
bhikkhus raising their minds to higher states are displeased and the bhikkhus 
studying the Teaching are displeased. It is not for the good and pleasantness of 
many, not for the welfare and happiness of gods and men </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhus studying the Teaching praise the bhikkhus 
studying the Teaching and does not praise the bhikkhus raising the mind to a

<P>Therefore, friends, you should train in this manner.:</P>
<P>We who study the Teaching will praise the bhikkhus that raise the mind to a 
higher degree. What is the reason? </P>
<P>Friends, it is surprising and rare to find persons in the world, who abide 
experiencing the deathless element with the body. Therefore you should train 
thus:</P>
<P>We who raise the mind to a higher degree should praise the bhikkhus studying

<P>005.10. Then the Brahmin Jànussoõi approached The Blessed One, exchangd 
friendly greetings, sat on a side and said:</P>
<P>Good Gotama, what is the intention of the warriors, ...re... discrimination, 
....re.... resolution,..re...inclination....re.... and conclusion of the 
warriors? </P>
<P>Brahmin, the intention of the warriors is wealth. They discriminate wisely. 
Their resolve is power. Their inclination is for lands and they conclude with 
rulership. </P>
<P>Good Gotama, what is the intention of the Brahmins, ...re... discrimination, 
....re.... resolution, ..re...inclination....re.... and conclusion of the 
Brahmins? </P>
<P>Brahmin, the intention of the Brahmins is wealth. They discriminate wisely. 
Their resolve is the mantras. Their inclination is sacrifices and they conclude 
with birth in the world of Brahma. . </P>
<P>Good Gotama, what is the intention of the householders, ...re... 
discrimination, ....re.... resolution, ..re...inclination....re.... and 
conclusion of the householders? </P>
<P>Brahmin, the intention of the householders is wealth. They discriminate 
wisely. Their resolve is a skill. Their inclination is an activity and they 
conclude completing that activity.</P>
<P>Good Gotama, what is the intention of the woman, ...re... discrimination, 
....re.... resolution, ..re...inclination....re.... and conclusion of the woman? 
</P>
<P>Brahmin, the intention of the woman is a man. Her discrimination is 
adornment. Her resolve is for sons. Her inclination is to be without a rival and 
her conclusion is to be overpowering.</P>
<P>Good Gotama, what is the intention of robbers, ...re... discrimination, 
....re.... resolution, ..re...inclination....re.... and conclusion of the 
robbers? </P>
<P>Brahmin, the intention of robbers is snatching. They discriminate seizing. 
Their resolve is with weaponsòheir inclination is darkness and their conclusion 
is not to be seen. . </P>
<P>Good Gotama, what is the intention of recluses, ...re... discrimination, 
....re.... resolution, ..re...inclination....re.... and conclusion of the 
recluses? </P>
<P>Brahmin, the intention of recluses is patience and gentleness They 
discriminate wisely. Their resolve is virtues. Their inclination is the sphere 
of nothingness and they conclude extinguishing. </P>
<P>Good Gotama, it is wonderful and surprising. Good Gotama knows the 
intentions, discriminations, resolutions, inclinations and conclusions of the 
warriors, Brahmins, householders, women, robbers and recluses. </P>
<P>I understand good Gotama, I take refuge as a lay disciple of good Gotama, 
from today until life lasts.</P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>

<P>005.11. A certain Brahmin approached The Blessed One, exchanged friendly 
greetings, sat on a side and said:</P>
<P>Good Gotama, is there a single thing developed and made much, would reach up 
to both the good, of here and now and here after? </P>
<P>Brahmin, there is a thing which developed and made much reaches up to both 
the good, here and now and here after.</P>
<P>Good Gotama, what is that one thing which developed and made much reaches up 
to both the good, here and now and here after?</P>
<P>Brahmin, diligence is the one thing, developed and made much reaches up to 
both the good, here and now and here after. Brahmin, just as all other foot 
prints of moving animals get included in the foot print of the elephant and of 
themñhe foot print of the elephant is the biggest, in the same manner diligence 
developed and made much reaches up to both the good, here and now and here 
after. Brahmin, just as of a peaked roof the beam supporting the framework of 
the roof is the most important. All other beams meet there and lie low in the 
same manner diligence developed and made much reaches up to both the good, here 
and now and here after. Brahmin, like a grass cutter would cut the grass and 
holding from the top would shake and throw away the others in the same manner 
diligence developed and made much reaches up to both the good, here and now and 
here after. Brahmin, like a bunch of mangoes stand together on account of the 
stem, in the same manner diligence developed and made much reaches up to both 
the good, here and now and here after. Brahmin, like all other kings are under 
the universal monarch and of them the universal monarch is the most prominent, 
in the same manner diligence developed and made much reaches up to both the 
good, here and now and here after. Brahmin, like the radiance of all stars is 
not worth one sixteenth the radiance of the moon in the same manner diligence 
developed and made much reaches up to both the good, here and now and here 
after. Brahmin, this is the one thing developed and made much reaches up to both 
the good here and now and here after. </P>

<P>005.12. At one time The Blessed One lived among the Gijja peaks in Rajagaha. 
At that time venerable Dhammika lived in seven monasteries of his native land. 
At that time venerable Dhammika rebuked and scolded visiting bhikkhus, hurt them 
and aroused them. They too rebuked, scolded, hurt and aroused him and went away. 
It occured to the lay disciples of that village: We attend on the community of 
bhikkhus with robes, morsel food, dwellings and requisites when ill. Yet the 
visiting bhikkhus do not stay, they go away, they desert the monastery. What is 
the reason for these bhikkhus to go away? Then it occured to the lay disciples 
of the village: Venerable Dhammika rebukes and scolds visiting bhikkhus, hurts 
them and arouses them. They too rebuke, scold, hurt and arouse him and go away. 
What if we send away venerable Dhammika. They approached venerable Dhammika and 
said: Venerable one go away from this monastery, it is of no use your staying 
here.</P>
<P>Then venerable Dhammika went to another monastery of his native land. There 
too venerable Dhammika rebuked and scolded visiting bhikkhus, hurt them and 
aroused them. They too rebuked, scolded, hurt and aroused him and went away. It 
occured to the lay disciples of that village: We attend on the community of 
bhikkhus with robes, morsel food, dwellings and requisites when ill. Yet the 
visiting bhikkhus do not stay, they go away, they desert the monastery. What is 
the reason for these bhikkhus to go away? Then it occured to the lay disciples 
of the village: Venerable Dhammika rebukes and scolds visiting bhikkhus, hurts 
them and arouses them. They too rebuke, scold, hurt and arouse him and go away. 
What if we send away venerable Dhammika. They approached venerable Dhammika and 
said: Venerable one go away from this monastery, it is of no use your staying 
here. . </P>

too venerable Dhammika rebuked and scolded visiting bhikkhus, hurt them and

said: Venerable one go away from this monastery, it is of no use your staying 
here.</P>
<P>Then it occured to venerable Dhammika: I am dismissed from all seven 
monasteries of my native land, where shall I go now? Then it occured to 
venerable Dhammika. What if I go to The Blessed One: Then venerable Dhimmika 
taking his bowl and robes went to Rajagaha and gradually going to the Gijja 
peaks approached The Blessed One, worshipped sat on a side and said to The 
Blessed One: I am dismissed by the lay disciples from all seven monasteries of 
my native land</P>
<P>Truly, Brahmin, what has happened to you? When you were dismissed from there 
and there, you came to my presence. </P>
<P>Dhammnika, in the past when traders were going in the sea, they took birds 
with them. When a beach is not visible they release a bird. The bird goes to the 
east, to the west, to the north and south, up and the inter directions. If it 
sees the coast some where it flies there, if it does not see the coast any 
where, it returns to the ship. Dhammika in the same manner, when you were 
dismissed from there and there, you came to my presence. </P>
<P>Brahmin Dhammika, in the past to king Koravya there was a banian tree named 
Suppatitthita it supported an area of about eighty four miles. It had roots 
running down to a depth of thrity five miles. Suppatitthita had fruits as large 
as huge vessels and fruits that are small, sweet and fresh. One of the shoots of 
Suppatitthita supported the king and the women in the palace. One shoot 
supported the forces. another shoot supported the people in the hamlets, 
villages and the state. Recluses and Brahmins partook from one branch and 
animals and birds ate from another shoot. They did not disturb each others 
fruits. A certain man ate fruits from Suppatitthatita as much as he liked, broke 
down the branches and went away. Then it occured to the goddess living in the 
banian tree, Suppatitthita: It is surprising this evil man eating as many fruits 
as he liked, has broken the branches and gone away. What if the banian tree 
Suppatitthita should not produce any more fruits in the future. Then Brahmin 
Dhammika, the banian tree, Suppatitthita did not bear fruit any more. Then 
Dhammika, king Koravya approached Sakka the king of gods. `Sir, know this, the 
banian tree Suppatitthita does not bear fruits any more. Then Sakka, the king of 
gods performed a supernormal fete, where a forceful great wind blew and the 
banian tree Suppatitthita fell on the ground, completely uprooted. Then the 
goddess living in the banian tree displeased, crying with tears in the eyes 
stood on a side. The king of gods approched the goddess living in the banian 
tree Suppatitthita and asked her `Goddess, why are you displeased crying with 
tears in the eyes and standing on a side? Sir, a forceful great wind blew and 
the banian tree Suppatitthita in which I live fell on the ground completely 
uprooted. Goddess, did a forceful great wind blow and fell the banian tree 
Suppatitthita, your dwelling when you were observing the rules of trees? Sir, 
what are the rules of trees to be observed? Here, goddess, those who need take 
away the roots of a tree, the bark of the tree, the leaves and flowers. On 
account of that the goddess should not be displeased or undesirable. Goddess, in 
this manner the tree observes the rules of trees. Sir, when I did not observe 
the rules of trees a forceful great wind blew and the banian tree Suppatitthita 
fell on the ground completely uprooted. Goddess, if you observe the rules of 
trees your dwelling will be as it was before. Sir, I observe the rules of trees 
and my dwelling should be as it was before. Then Sakka, the king of gods 
performed a supernormal fete, which caused a forceful great wind to blow and 
caused the banian tree Suppatitthita to be established again fixing the roots 
back, on to earth. In the same manner Brahmin Dhammika, were you observing the 
rules of recluses when the lay disciples of your native country dismissed you? 
Venerable sir, how does the recluse observe the rules of recluses? Here, 
Dhammika the recluse when scolded does not scold, when aroused does not arouse 
in return, when quarrelling does not quarrel Venerable sir, even if I had 
considered the rules of a recluse the lay disciples of my native land would 
dismiss me from all the seven monasteries. . </P>
<P>Brahmin, Dhammika, in the past there was a Teacher a ford maker named Sunetta 
he was free of sensual greed. He had innumerable thousands of disciples. He 
taught his disciples to be born with Brahma. Dhammika, those who were not 
pleased with the Teaching of Sunetta, to be born in the Brahma world, after 
death went to loss, were born in hell. Those who were pleased with the Teaching 
of Sunetta, to be born in the Brahma world, after death went to gain, were born 
in heaven. </P>
<P>Brahmin, Dhammika, in the past there was a Teacher a ford maker named 
Mugapakkha..re... Aranemi,...re.... Kuddalada,...re...Hatthipala ...re.... 
Jotipala he was free of sensual greed. He had innumerable thousands of 
disciples. He taught his disciples to be born with Brahma. Dhammika, those who 
were not pleased with the Teachings of Jotipala to be born in the Brahma world, 
after death went to loss, were born in hell. Those who were pleased with the 
Teachings of Jotipala to be born in the Brahma world, after death went to gain, 
were born in heaven. </P>
<P>Brahmin Dhammika, these six teachers, ford makers, free of sensual greed, who 
had an innumerable following, with a community of bhikkhus if someone with a 
defiled mind was to scold and abuse would he accure much demerit? Yes, venerable 
sir. </P>
<P>Brahmin Dhammika, these six teachers, ford makers, free of sensual greed, had 
an innumerable following, with a community of bhikkhus if someone with a defiled 
mind was to scold and abuse them, they would accure much demerit. It would be 
worse if a single one who has attained right view is scolded and abused, he 
would accure much more demerit. What is the reason? I do not see this patience 
outside, other than among the co-associates in this holy life. Therefore 
Brahmin, you should train:</P>
<P>We will not defile our minds towards co-associates in the holy life. </P>
<P></P>
<P>The Brahmins Sunetta, Mugapakka, Aranemi, Kuddalaka, the teacher</P>
<P>Hatthipala the young man and Jotipala and Govinda the seventh advisor, </P>
<P>The famous non hurting six teachers in the past </P>
<P>Free of the smell of raw flesh, released in compassion.</P>
<P>Detached from sensual lust, are born in the world of Brahma</P>
<P>They had innumerable hundreds of disciples released in compassion </P>
<P>Detached from sensual lust, born in the world of Brahma</P>
<P>They are sages outside this dispensation, free of lust and concentrated</P>
<P>If someone with a defiled mind abuses them, he accures much demerit.</P>
<P>If a noble disciple of The Blessed One is abused with a defiled mind, </P>
<P>He accures much more demerit, so never hurt a respectable one,</P>
<P>Aspiring right view, he holds the seventh place in the Community of bhikkhus 
. </P>
<P>Free from sensual lust, but mental faculties are immature </P>
<P>Has faith, mindfulness, effort, is appeased and introspective </P>
<P>Having hurt such a bhikkhu you have hurt your self and now hurt others.</P>
<P>If someone protects himself, by that he protects others </P>
<P>Therefore the wise firmly say protect yourself. </P>
