<P>001.01. I heard thus. At one time The Blessed One was living in the monastery 
offered by Anathapindika in Jeta's grove in Savatthi. The Blessed One addressed 
the bhikkhus: </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu frequently developing, making it a habit, a foundation 
and undertaking it thoroughly, the release of the mind in loving kindness could 
expect eight benefits. What eight? </P>
<P>Sleeps pleasantly, rises pleasantly, does not see evil dreams, becomes 
loveable to humans, and non-humans, the gods protect him, and fire, poison or 
weapons do not have an effect on him. If he does not penetrate further, is born 
in the world of Brahma. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu frequently developing, making it a habit, a foundation 
and undertaking it thoroughly, the release of the mind in loving kindness could 
expect these eight benefits. </P>
<P>He that develops the thought of loving kindness limitlessly and 
thoughtfully</P>
<P>Sees his bonds diminish with the destruction of endearments</P>
<P>If one person is pervaded with loving kindness without anger, it is merit 
</P>
<P>The noble ones do much merit pervading all beings with compassion. . </P>
<P>They that win over the earth teeming with beings,</P>
<P>Go round quarrelling to do offerings and sacrifices of horses and men </P>
<P>It is not worth one fourth, not even one sixteenth of a developed mind </P>
<P>In loving kindness, its like the moon's rays and the stars</P>
<P>He that does not strike, kill overthrow or make produce</P>
<P>Develops loving kindness to all beings without any anger. </P>

<P>001.02. Bhikkhus, on account of these eight reasons, wisdom grows of the 
fundamentals of a moral life, for those who do not have it and the wisdom of the 
fundamentals of a moral life develops, grows and gets completed, for those who 
have gained it. What eight? </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu lives depending on the Teacher or depending on a 
certain eminent co-associate, in such a manner that his shame and remorse is 
well established together with love and reverence. Bhikkhus, this is the first 
reason on account of which wisdom grows, of the fundamentals of a moral life, 
for those who do not have it, and for the fundamentals of a moral life, to 
develop, grow and get completed for those who have already gained it. </P>
<P>The bhikkhu while living depending on the Teacher or on a certain eminent 
co-associate, in such a manner that his shame and remorse is well established 
together with love and reverence, from time to time approaches to ask.- 
`Venerable sir, what is the meaning of this.' That venerable one makes manifest 
to him the not manifest and dispels various kinds of doubts in the Teaching. 
Bhikkhus, this is the second reason on account of which wisdom grows, of the 
fundamentals of a moral life, for those who do not have it, and for the 
fundamentals of a moral life, to develop, grow and get completed, for those who 
have already gained it. </P>
<P>The bhikkhu hearing the Teaching procures his aim by way of two seclusions, 
bodily seclusion and mental seclusion. Bhikkhus, this is the third reason on 
account of which wisdom grows, of the fundamentals of a moral life, for those 
who do not have it, and for the fundamentals of a moral life, to develop, grow 
and get completed for those who have already gained it. </P>
<P>He abides virtuous, restrained in the higher code of rules, conducting 
himself, seeing fear in the slightest fault. Bhikkhus, this is the fourth reason 
on account of which wisdom grows, of the fundamentals of a moral life, for those 
who do not have it, and for the fundamentals of a moral life, to develop, grow 
and get completed for those who have already gained it. </P>
<P>He becomes learned bearing the Teaching that is good at the beginning, middle 
and end, full of meaning in all letters and completely declaring the pure and 
complete holy life. Of such a Teaching he becomes learned bearing it, reciting 
it in word order, and penetratingly seeing it. Bhikkhus, this is the fifth 
reason on account of which wisdom grows, of the fundamentals of a moral life, 
for those who do not have it, and for the fundamentals of a moral life, to 
develop, grow and get completed for those who have already gained it. </P>
<P>He abides with aroused effort, to dispel demeritorious things and to amass 
meritorious things, with firm endeavour without losing the aim in meritorious 
things. Bhikkhus, this is the sixth reason on account of which wisdom grows, of 
the fundamentals of a moral life, for those who do not have it, and for the 
fundamentals of a moral life, to develop, grow and get completed for those who 
have already gained it. </P>
<P>With the Community of bhikkhus he does not talk various things that are low. 
Either he himself teaches or requests others to do so, neither does he belittle 
noble silence. Bhikkhus, this is the seveth reason on account of which wisdom 
grows, of the fundamentals of a moral life, for those who do not have it, and 
for the fundamentals of a moral life, to develop, grow and get completed for 
those who have already gained it. </P>
<P>He abides seeing the rising and falling of the five holding masses -'This is 
matter, this its rising and this its fading. These are feelings, this its rising 
and this its fading. These are perceptions, ...re..ñhese are 
determinations,....re..òhis is conscioussness, this its rising and this its 
fading. Bhikkhus, this is the eighth reason on account of which wisdom grows, of 
the fundamentals of a moral life, for those who do not have it, and for the 
fundamentals of a moral life, to develop, grow and get completed for those who 
have already gained it. </P>
<P>His co-associates esteem him thus-: This venerable one lives depending on the 
Teacher or depending on a certain eminent co-associate, in such a manner that 
his shame and remorse is well established together with love and reverence. 
Indeed the venerable one knows what he aught to know and sees what he aught to 
see. This thing too conduces to pleasantness, for high esteem, for development 
equality and unity in the Community. </P>

<P>Gain and loss, fame and defame, blame and praise, pleasantness and

<P>Bhikkhus, these eight worldly things roll the world, and the world rolls on

<P>Bhikkhus, gain, loss, fame, defame, blame, praise, pleasantness and 
unpleasàntness arise to the not learned ordinary man. They arise to the learned 
noble disciple too. There, what is the difference between the noble disciple and 
the not learned ordinary man? Venerable sir, The Blessed One is the origin, and 
leader of the Teaching, we seek The Blessed One's refuge. Good! Its meaning 
occurs to The Blessed One, hearing it from The Blessed One the bhikkhus will 
bear it. </P>
<P>Then, bhikkhus listen attentively I will tell: Bhikkhus, gain, loss, fame,

unpleasant, a changing thing. He does not know it, as it really is. This loss, 
....re..òhis fame, ...re..òhis defame, ...re..òhis blame,...re... This praise,

<P>That gain takes hold of his mind, completely and stays. So too the loss, the 
fame, the defame, the blame, the praise, the pleasantness and the 
unpleasantness. He is not averse to arisen gain, averse to arisen loss. He is 
not averse to arisen fame, averse to arisen defame. He is not averse to arisen 
praise, averse to arisen blame. He is not averse to arisen pleasantness, averse 
to arisen unpleasantness. Thus entering non-aversion and aversion he is not 
releaed from birth, decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and 
distress. I say he is not released from unpleasantness. .. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, gain, loss, fame, defame, blame, praise, pleasantness and

right amount of food. </P>
<P>This is how Nanda was wakeful. Here, Nanda purified his mind from obstructing 
things during the day seated somewhere. Nanda purified his mind from obstructing 
things during the first watch of the night seated somewhere. During the middle 
watch of the night, turning to his right he takes the lion's posture keeping one 
foot over the other and mindful of the time of rising. Having got up in the last 
watch of the night he purifies the mind from obstructing things. Bhikkhus, this 
is how Nanda was wakeful. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, this is Nanda's mindfull awareness. Here, bhikkhus, to Nanda, 
feelings, arise, persist and fade with his knowledge. Bhikkhus, to Nanda, 
perceptions, arise, persist and fade with his knowledge. Bhikkhus, to Nanda, 
thoughts, arise, persist and fade with his knowledge. This is Nanda's mindful 
awareness. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, other than with protected mental faculties, knowing the right 
amount to eat, becoming wakeful, becoming aware and mindful, how could he have 
lived the holy life complete and pure. </P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+

<P>001.10. At one time The Blessed One was living on the bank of the pond 
Gaggara. At that time the bhikkhus were accusing a bhikkhu. The accused bhikkhu 
was evading the matter drawing the conversation aside and showing anger and 
displeasure. </P>
<P>Then the Bblessed One addressed the bhikkhus: </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, throw him out! He is led astray. What is the use of cleaning this 
son of another! To any person it might occur in his approaching, receding, 
looking on, looking back stretching and bending, bearing the three robes, taking 
bowl and robes, he is the same as any other good bhikkhu - as long as his fault 
is not seen. When his fault is seen, he will be known as a highway robber 
recluse, a prattling recluse, a recluse of rubbish. He should be known thus and 
others should not be atoned for it. What is the reason? May other good bhikkhus 
not be spoilt. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, like in the preparation of corn, there is the spoiler of corn, a 
pseudo corn, a corn of rubbish. It has that same root, the same stalk, the same 
leaves, as the other good corn. Its head does not appear as the other good corn. 
Then it is known as a spoiler of corn, a pseudo corn, a corn of rubbish and 
being pulled out from the root is thrown away. What is the reason? May it not 
spoil the other good corn. In the same mannerño any person it might occur in his 
approaching, receding, looking on, looking back stretching and bending, bearing 
the three robes, taking bowl and robes, he is the same as any other good bhikkhu 
- as long as his fault is not seen. When his fault is seen, he will be known as 
a highway robber recluse, a prattling recluse, a recluse of rubbish. He should 
be known thus and others should not be atoned.for it. What is the reason? May 
other good bhikkhus not be spoilt. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, just as to one measuring a mass of grains, there is the grain that 
is well ripen in one heap, then there is the grain that is weakly ripen the 
rubbish heap, thrown out by the wind. The farmer takes a broom and sweeps it out 
far away. What is the reason? May the good grain be not spoilt. In the same 
mannerño any person it might occur in his approaching, receding, looking on, 
looking back stretching and bending, bearing the three robes, taking bowl and 
robes, he is the same as any other good bhikkhu - as long as his fault is not 
seen. When his fault is seen, he will be known as a highway robber recluse, a 
prattling recluse, a recluse of rubbish. He should be known thus and others 
should not be atoned.for it. What is the reason? May other good bhikkhus not be 
spoilt. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, like a man in want of tubes to carry drinking water, taking a sharp 
axe would enter the forest. Of the trees that he knocks with the sharp axe, the 
strong well developed tress resound roughly. The trees that are internally 
decayed and ooze filth, when knocked with the axe resound with a crashing noise. 
He cuts its root and the top and cleans the inside and applies it to take water. 
In the same mannerño any person it might occur in his approaching, receding, 
looking on, looking back stretching and bending, bearing the three robes, taking 
bowl and robes, he is the same as any other good bhikkhu - as long as his fault 
is not seen. When his fault is seen, he will be known as a highway robber 
recluse, a prattling recluse, a recluse of rubbish. He should be known thus and 
others should not be atoned.for it. What is the reason? May other good bhikkhus 
not be spoilt. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Living together know them as with evil desires, anger</P>
<P>Merciless, obdurate, spiteful, selfish, envious and crafty</P>
<P>Talking kindly arousing emotion, talks like a recluse.</P>
<P>He has secret activity, evil view and aversion </P>
<P>Has low activity, tells lies, know them as they really are.</P>
<P>All should get together and turn him out </P>
<P>Turn out the rubbish and clean the dispensation.</P>
<P>Thus turn out the prattling non-recluse in the guise of a recluse. </P>
<P>Turning out the one with evil desires and evil conduct</P>
<P>Live united with the pure and thoughtful and end unpleasantness
