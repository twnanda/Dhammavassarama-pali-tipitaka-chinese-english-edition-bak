on the Community of bhikkhus with robes, morsel food, dwellings and requisites 
when ill. You should train to think why shouldn't I abide in joy, secluded from

<P>When this was said, venerable Sariputta said to The Blessed One:-It is 
wonderful and surprising venerable sir, these are good words of The Blessed One-

sensual desires do not arise to him. At that time, pleasantness and pleasure 
accompanied by sensual desires do not arise to him. At that time, unpleasantness 
and displeasure accompanied by demerit do not arise to him. At that time,

<P align=center>9. Gihisuttaü- The laity.</P></B></FONT><FONT face=Times_CSX+>
<P>018.09. òhe householder Anathapindika with about five hundred lay disciples 
approached The Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side. Then The Blessed One 
addressed venerable Sariputta:- The laity wearing white clothes, if they abide 
self controlled guarding their activities controlled in the five precepts and 
gain for nothing, quickly and easily the four higher states of the mind, the 
pleasant abidings here and now, could themselves predict:- I will not be born in 
hell, in the animal kingdom, in the sphere of ghosts. I will not go to loss, I 
have entered the stream of the Teaching, I'm sure of enlightenment. </P>
<P>Controlled in which five precepts is there a guarding of activities?</P>
<P>Here, Sariputta, the noble disciple abstains from, destroying living things, 
taking the not given, misbehaving in sexual desires, telling lies and taking 
intoxicating and brewed drinks. </P>
<P>Controlled in these five precepts there is a guarding of activities. </P>
<P>What are the four higher states of the mind, the pleasant abidings here and 
now gained for nothing, quickly and easily?</P>
<P>Here, Sariputta, the noble disciple is endowed with unwavering faith in The 
Blessed One:- That Blessed One is worthy, rightfully enlightened, endowed with 
knowledge and conduct well gone, knower of the worlds, the incomparable tamer of 
those to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed. This is the 
first higher state of mind, the pleasant abiding here and now, for the purity 
and cleanliness of the impure defiled mind </P>
<P>Again, Sariputta, the noble disciple is endowed with unwavering faith in the 
Teaching:- The Teaching of The Blessed One is well declared, here and now, it is 
not a matter of time, inviting to inspection, leading inwards, to be realized by 
the wise by themselves. This is the second higher state of mind, the pleasant 
abiding here and now, for the purity and cleanliness of the impure, defiled mind 
</P>
<P>Again, Sariputta, the noble disciple is endowed with unwavering faith in the 
Community of bhikkhus:- The disciples of The Blessed One have come to the good 
path, straight path, the wise path and the path of mutual understanding. They 
are the four pairs of eight Great Men, who are venerable, suitable for 
hospitality and gifts and to be revered with clasped hands, the incomparable 
field of merit for the world. This is the third higher state of mind, the 
pleasant abiding here and now, for the purity and cleanliness of the impure 
defiled mind </P>
<P>Again, Sariputta, the noble disciple is endowed with virtues desired by the 
noble ones. Virtues, that are not broken, not defective, not spotted, 
consistent, praised by the wise as leading to freedom, not to corruption and 
conducive to concentration. This is the fourth higher state of mind, the 
pleasant abiding here and now, for the purity and cleanliness of the impure 
defiled mind He becomes a quick and easy gainer a gainer for nothing of the four 
higher states of the mind, the pleasant abidings here and now. </P>
<P>Sariputta:- The laity wearing white clothes, if they abide self controlled 
guarding their activities, controlled in the five precepts, gaining for nothing, 
quickly and easily the four higher states of the mind, the pleasant abidings 
here and now, could predict:- I will not be born in hell, in the animal kingdom, 
in the sphere of ghosts. I will not go to loss, I have entered the stream of the 
Teaching, I'm sure of enlightenment. </P>
<P>Knowing the noble teaching and fearing hell,</P>
<P>The wise avoid demerit, not hurting living things knowingly, </P>
<P>Not telling lies, nor touching others' belongings </P>
<P>Happy with one's wife not delighting in others' wives</P>
<P>Avoiding intoxicants that delude the mind,</P>
<P>Recalling the good Teaching, they think discursively about it. </P>
<P>With a non angry mind they develop heavenly bliss </P>
<P>Giving gifts with careful attention, they acquire merit. </P>
<P>The first gifts given to the appeased bring good results. </P>
<P>Sariputta, I will tell about the appeased. Listen!</P>
<P>Of the dark and white things carried away by Rohinie,</P>
<P>There are cattle that are spotted, beautiful and dove coloured. </P>
<P>Of them the young tamed ones are the best. </P>
<P>They are powerful, can bear the load and have speed. </P>
<P>Their colour does not matter, the load is given to them. </P>
<P>In the same manner those born human, wherever they are born</P>
<P>As warriors, Brahmins, ordinary or outcastes</P>
<P>Of them the tamed, gentle are the best</P>
<P>Righteous, virtuous, truthful and shameful,</P>
<P>Having dispelled birth and death and done the duties of the holy life </P>
<P>Unyoked from the load are without desires. </P>
<P>Gone beyond all things are extinguished without desires. </P>
<P>Gifts given in that field are full of results. </P>
<P>The foolish not learned attend outside this field. </P>
<P>They that attend on the appeased, wise,</P>
<P>Get their roots of faith well established in the well gone one. </P>
<P>They are either born in heaven, or in a high clan here</P>
<P>And those wise gradually reach extinction. </P></FONT><B><FONT

<P align=center>10. Gavesãsuttaü- Gavesi the lay disciple.</P></B></FONT><FONT 
face=Times_CSX+>
<P>018.10. At one time The Blessed One was touring the country of Kosala with a 
large Community of bhikkhus. On the way seeing a certain Sala forest the Blessd 
One deviating from the path entered that Sala forest and reaching a certain 
place smiled. </P>
<P>It occurred to venerable Ananda:- What is the reason that The Blessed One 
should smile? </P>
<P>Without a reason Thus gone Ones do not smile. Then venerable Ananda said to 
The Blessed One; - Venerable sir, what is the reason for The Blessed One to 
smile. Thus Gone Ones do not smile without a reason? </P>
<P>Ananda, in the past, in this place there was a prosperous and populated city. 
The Blessed One Kassapa, worthy and rightfully enlightened abode relying on that 
city. There was a lay disciple named, Gavesi incomplete in virtues, to The 
Blessed One Kassapa, worthy and rightfully enlightened. The lay disciple Gavesi 
was advising about five hundred other lay disciples, who were also incomplete in 
virtues. Then it occurred to Gavesi the lay disciple:- I have been of much help 
to these five hundred lay disciples. Of them I am the foremost. I am incomplete 
in my virtues, so also these five hundred lay disciples. We are on equal 
grounds, there is no super quality in me; how could I be superior. </P>
<P>Ananda, then the lay disciple Gavesi approached the five hundred lay 
disciples and said:- Friends, from today know me as complete in my virtues. </P>
<P>Then it occurred to those five hundred lay disciples:- Our master Gavesi has 
been of great help to us, advising us. He is going to be complete in virtues. 
Why shouldn't we. Then the five hundred lay disciples approached the lay 
disciple Gavesi and said:- Master Gavesi, from today these five hundred lay 
disciples will be complete in virtues. Then it occurred to Gavesi the lay 
disciple:- I have been of much help to these five hundred lay disciples. Of them 
I am the foremost. I am complete in my virtues, so also these five hundred lay 
disciples. We are on equal grounds, there is no super quality in me; how could I 
be superior. </P>
<P>Ananda, then the lay disciple Gavesi approached the five hundred lay 
disciples and said:- Friends, from today I will give up low behaviour and sexual 
intercourse </P>
<P>Then it occurred to those five hundred lay disciples:- Our master Gavesi has 
been of great help to us, advising us. He will give up low behaviour and sexual 
intercourse. Why shouldn't we. Then the five hundred lay disciples approached 
the lay disciple Gavesi and said:- Master Gavesi, from today these five hundred 
lay disciples will give up low behaviour and sexual intercourse. Then it 
occurred to Gavesi the lay disciple:- I have been of much help to these five 
hundred lay disciples. Of them I am the foremost. I am complete in my virtues, 
so also these five hundred lay disciples. I lead a holy life away from low 
sexual intercourse. These five hundred lay disciples too lead a holy life away 
from low sexual intercourse. We are on equal grounds, there is no super quality 
in me; how could I be superior. </P>
<P>Ananda, then the lay disciple Gavesi approached the five hundred lay 
disciples and said:- Friends, from today I will abide on one meal, refraining 
from food at night and untimely hours. </P>
<P>Then it occurred to those five hundred lay disciples:- Our master Gavesi has 
been of great help to us, advising us. He is going to abide on one meal per day 
refraining from food at night and untimely hours. Why shouldn't we. Then the 
five hundred lay disciples approached the lay disciple Gavesi and said:- Master 
Gavesi, from today these five hundred lay disciples will abide on one meal per 
day refraining from food at night and untimely hours. Then it occurred to Gavesi 
the lay disciple:- I have been of much help to these five hundred lay disciples. 
Of them I am the foremost. I am complete in my virtues, so also these five 
hundred lay disciples. I lead a holy life away from low sexual intercourse, so 
too these five hundred lay disciples. I abide on one meal per day refraining 
from food at night and untimely hours. We are on equal grounds, there is no 
super quality in me; how could I be superior. </P>
<P>Ananda, then the lay disciple Gavesi approached The Blessed One Kassapa, 
worthy and rightfully enlightened and said:- Venerable sir, may I gain the going 
forth and the higher ordination in the presence of The Blessed One. Then Ananda, 
the lay disciple Gavesi gained the going forth and the higher ordination in the 
presence of The Blessed One Kassapa, worthy and rightfully enlightened. Soon 
after his higher ordination, withdrawn from the crowd and secluded abiding with 
aroused effort to dispel, he attained the noble aim for which sons of clansmen 
rightfully leave the household and become homeless </P>
<P>He here and now knowing realized the end of the holy life and abode. He 
thoroughly knew birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived to the end, what 
should be done is done, there is nothing to wish. Ananda, Gavesi became one of 
the arahants. </P>
<P>Then, Ananda, to those five hundred lay disciples it occurred:- Our master 
Gavesi has been of great help to us, advising us. He has shaved head and beard, 
wearing yellow robes has gone forth and become homeless Why shouldn't we. Then 
the five hundred lay disciples approached The Blessed One Kassapa, worthy and 
rightfully enlightened and said:- Venerable sir, may we gain the going forth and 
the higher ordination in the presence of The Blessed One. Then Ananda, the five 
hundred lay disciples gained the going forth and the higher ordination in the 
presence of The Blessed One Kassapa, worthy and rightfully enlightened. </P>
<P>Then, Ananda, to the bhikkhu Gavesi it occurred:- I am a gainer for nothing, 
a quick and easy gainer of the pleasantness of release. Oh! these five hundred 
bhikkhus too should be gainers for nothing, quick and easy gainers of the 
pleasantness of release. Then Ananda, those five hundred bhikkhus, withdrawn 
from the crowd and secluded, abiding with aroused effort to dispel, attained the 
noble aim for which sons of clansmen rightfully leave the household and become 
homeless </P>
<P>They here and now knowing realized the end of the holy life and abode. They 
thoroughly knew birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived to the end, what 
should be done is done, there is nothing to wish. </P>
<P>Thus Ananda, those five hundred bhikkhus headed by the bhikkhu Gavesi 
realized the noble release by putting forth effort. Ananda, you should train 
thus:- We should realize noble release, by putting forth more and more exalted 
effort </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
