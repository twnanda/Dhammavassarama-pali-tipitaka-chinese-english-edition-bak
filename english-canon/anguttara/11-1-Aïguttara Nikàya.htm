virtues?</P></B></FONT><FONT face=Times_CSX+>
<P>1. I heard thus. At one time The Blessed One was abiding in the monastery 
offered by Anathapindika in Jeta's grove in Savatthi. Venerable Ananda 
approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said:- </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, for what reason and benefits are clever virtues?" </P>
<P>ßAnanda, clever virtues are for the reason and benefit of non-remorse. </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, for what reason and benefits is non-remorse ?" </P>
<P>ßAnanda, non-remorse is for the reason and benefit of delight. </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, for what reason and benefits is delight?" </P>
<P>ßAnanda, delight is for the reason and benefit of joy" </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, for what reason and benefits is joy?" </P>
<P>ßAnanda, joy is for the reason and benefit of tranquillity. </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, for what reason and benefits is tranquillity?" </P>
<P>ßAnanda, tranquillity is for the reason and benefit of pleasantness. </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, for what reason and benefits is pleasantness?" </P>
<P>ßAnanda, pleasantness is for the reason and benefit of concentration. </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, for what reason and benefits is concentration?" </P>
<P>ßAnanda, concentration is for the reason and benefit of the vision of things 
as they really are" </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, for what reason and benefits is the vision of things as they 
really are?" </P>
<P>ßAnanda, the vision of things as they really are, is for the reason and 
benefit of turning away" </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, for what reason and benefits is turning away ?" </P>
<P>ßAnanda, turning away is for the reason and benefit of disenchantment" </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, for what reason and benefits is disenchantment?" </P>
<P>ßAnanda, turning away is for the reason and benefit of knowledge and vision 
of release" </P>
<P>Thus Ananda, clever virtues are for the reason and benefit of non-remorse. 
Non-remorse is for the reason and benefit of delight. Delight is for the reason 
and benefit of joy. Joy is for the reason and benefit of tranquillity. 
Tranquillity is for the reason and benefit of pleasantness. Pleasantness is for 
the reason and benefit of concentration. Concentration is for the reason and 
benefit of knowledge and vision of seeing things as they really are. Knowledge 
and vision of seeing things as they really are, is for the reason and benefit of 
turning away Turning away is for the reason and benefit of disenchantment 
Disenchantment is for the reason and benefit of knowledge and vision of releae. 
Thus, Ananda, clever virtues lead to the highest. </P></FONT><B><FONT

<P align=center>2. Cetanàkaranãyasuttaü- Intending.</P></B></FONT><FONT 
face=Times_CSX+>
<P>2. ßBhikkhus, someone who has clever virtues, need not intend. `May 
non-remorse come to me. ` It is the general rule for non-remorse to arise to a 
virtuous person. Someone who has no remorse, need not intend. `May delight come 
to me. ` It is the general rule for delight to arise to one without remorse. 
Someone who is delighted, need not intend. `May joy come to me. ` It is the 
general rule for joy to arise to a delighted one. Someone who is joyful need not 
intend. `May my body be appeased' It is the general rule for the joyful to 
experience appeasement of the body. Someone with an appeased body need not 
intend. `May I feel pleasant. `It is the general rule for one with an appeased 
body to feel pleasant. A pleasant one, need not intend. `May my mind be 
concentrated. ` It is the general rule for the pleasant one to be concentrated. 
Bhikkhus, someone with a concentrated mind need not intend. `May I know and see 
it, as it really is. It is the general rule for the concentrated to know and see 
as it really is. Bhikkhus, someone who knows and sees, as it really is, need not 
intend. `May I turn away. ` It is the general rule for one who knows and sees to 
turn away. Bhikkhus, the one who has turned away need not intend. `May I be 
disenchanted' It is the general rule for one who has turned away to be 
disenchanted. Bhikkhus, the one who is disenchanted need not intend. `May I 
realize knowledge and vision of release. `It is the general rule for one 
disenchanted to realize the knowledge and vision of release. . </P>
<P>Thus bhikkhus disenchantment is for knowledge and vision of release and its 
benefits. Turning away is for disenchantment and its beneifts. Knowledge and 
vision of seeing things as they really are, is for turning away and its 
benefits. Concentration is for knowledge and vision of seeing things as they 
really are, and their benefits. Pleasantness is for concentration and its 
benefits. Tranquillity is for pleasantness and its benefits. Joy is for 
tranquillity and its benefits. Delight is for joy and its benefits. Non-remorse 
is for delight and its benefits. Clever virtues are for non-remorse and its 
benefits. Thus bhikkhus, thoughts overflow from thoughts and get completed by 
thoughts, while they flow up and down. </P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+

<P>ßSaddha, concentrate like a thoroughbred horse not like an inferior horse. 
Saddha, when the mouth piece is given to the inferior horse, it keeps on 
thinking, fodder! fodder! Saddha, in the same manner, a certain inferior man 
gone to the forest, to the root of a tree, or to an empty house abides with a 
mind overcome by sensual greed. He does not know the escape from arisen sensual 
greed as it really is. He thinks only within sensual greed. He thinks, consumed 
by those thoughts, is wasted and is destroyed by those thoughts. He abides with 
a mind overwhelmed with anger..re...overwhelmed with sloth and torpor, ..re... 
overwhelmed with restlessness and worry,..re... abides with a mind overcome with 
doubts, not knowing the escape from them. Entangled in his doubts, he thinks, is 
consumed, wasted and destroyed by them. He thinks leaning on earth, water, fire 
and air. He thinks leaning on the sphere of space, on the sphere of 
consciousness, on the sphere of nothingness and on the sphere of neither 
perception nor non-perception. He leans on this world and thinks, on the other 
world and thinks. Whatever seen, heard, experienced, cognized and sought with 
the mind, leaning on that too he thinks, he is consumed by those thoughts, is 
wasted and is destroyed by that. Saddha, these are the thoughts of an infrior 
man. </P>
<P>Saddha, what are the thoughts of a thoroughbred horse? When the mouth piece 
is given to the throughbred horse, it does not think fodder, fodder! What is the 
reason? Saddha, when the mouth piece is given to the throughbred horse it occurs 
to him:- `What training would the horse trainer give me today? How will I 
respond to it today? Thus the throughbred when given the mouth piece does not 
think fodder, fodder. The thoroughbred horse reflects it as a debt, a tie, an 
ill treatment, as a piece of bad luck to be beaten in the same manner, the 
thoroughbred man gone to the forest, to the root of a tree, or to an empty house 
abides with a mind not overcome by sensual greed. He knows the escape from
