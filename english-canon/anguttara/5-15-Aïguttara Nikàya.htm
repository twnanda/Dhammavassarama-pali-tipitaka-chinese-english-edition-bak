<P>015.03. At one time The Blessed One was abiding in the gabled hall in the 
Great Forest in Vesali. The Blessed One putting on robes in the morning and 
taking bowl and robes entered Vesali for alms. At that time about five hundred 
Licchavis were assembled and seated at the Sarandada monument and this talk 
arose among them:- The arising of five jewels are rare in the world. What five? 
</P>
<P>The jewel of an elephant, the jewel of a horse, the jewel of a jewel, the 
jewel of a woman and the jewel of a householder. The arising of these five 
jewels are rare in the world. </P>
<P>Then they placed a man on the path and told him:- Good man, if you see The 
Blessed One, inform us. That man saw The Blessed One coming in the distance and 
approached the Licchavis and said:- Sirs, that Blessed One, worthy and 
rightfully enlightened is coming, and it is time to do the fitting. </P>
<P>The Licchavis approached The Blessed One, worshipped, and standing on a side 
said to The Blessed One:-</P>
<P>Venerable sir, it is good if you approach the Sarandada monument out of 
compassion. The Blessed One consented in silence and approached the Sarandada 
monument and sat on the prepared seat and asked:-Liccahvis with what talk were 
you seated here and what was the other conversation? Venerable sir, we were 
assembled and seated here and this talk arose among us:- The arising of five 
jewels are rare in the world. What five? </P>
<P>The jewel of an elephant, the jewel of a horse, the jewel of a jewel, the 
jewel of a woman and the jewel of a householder. The arising of these five

conversation. Licchavis, the arising of five things are rare in the world. What 
five?</P>

in the world. Persons teaching the doctrine and discipline taught by the Thus 
Gone One are rare in the world. Persons that understand the doctrine and

<P>015.04. At one time The Blessed One lived in the Tikandaki forest in Saketa. 
From there The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:-Bhikkhus, it is good, if you 
live from time to time with the perception of loathsomeness in the not loathing. 
It is good, if you live from time to time with the perception of 
non-loathsomeness in the not loathing. It is good, if you live from time to time 
with the perception of loathsomeness in the not loathing and the loathing. It is 
good, if you live from time to time, with the perception of non-loathsomeness in 
the not loathing and the loathing. It is good, if you live from time to time, 
getting rid of both the loathing and the not loathing, abide with equanimity 
mindful and aware. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, seeing what good should the bhikkhu abide with the perception of 
loathsomeness in the not loathing? May greed not arise to me on account of 
greedy things. Bhikkhus, seeing this benefit the bhikkhu should abide with the 
perception of loathsomeness in the not loathing. </P>

should abide with the perception of loathsomeness in the not loathing and the 
loathing. </P>

of things that arouse greed. Bhikkhus, seeing this benefit the bhikkhu should

loathing</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, seeing what good should the bhikkhu abide in equanimity giving up 
both the loathing and the not loathing become mindful and aware? For no reason, 
cause or place should greed arise to me on account of things that arouse greed, 
anger arise to me on account of things that arouse anger and delusion arise to 
me on account of things that arouse delusion. Bhikkhus, seeing this benefit the 
bhikkhu should abide in equanimity giving up both the loathing and the not 
loathing become mindful and aware. </P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>
