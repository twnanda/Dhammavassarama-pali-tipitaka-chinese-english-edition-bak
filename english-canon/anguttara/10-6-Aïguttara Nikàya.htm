<P>51. At that time The Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by 
Anathapindika in Jeta's grove in Savatthi and The Blessed One addressed the 
bhikkhus from there:-</P>
<P>ßBhikkhus, do not become clever in penetrating and understanding others' 
minds, be clever in penetrating and understanding your mind. This is the right 
practise </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, how should you be clever in penetrating and understanding, your

<P>Bhikkhus, just like a woman, man or young one, fond of adornment would take a 
clean mirror, or water in a vessel and would see the reflection of his face in 
it. If he sees some dirt or some blemish in it, would try hard to dispel that 
dirt or blemish. If he sees no dirt or blemish in it, he would be completely 
satisfied on account of it.- `It is gain for me, my face is clean.' In the same 
manner bhikkhus, reflection in meritorious things does much to the bhikkhu.- `Do 
I abide coveting for most of the time or do I abide, not coveting for most of 
the time. Do I abide angry for most of the time or do I abide without anger for 
most of the time. Do I abide overcome by sloth and torpor for most of the time 
or do I abide free from sloth and torpor for most of the time. Do I abide 
restless, worrying for most of the time or do I abide without restlessness and 
worry for most of the time. Do I abide doubting for most of the time or do I 
abide doubts dispelled for most of the time. Do I abide with hatred for most of 
the time or do I abide without hatred for most of the time. Do I abide with a

abide with an angry mind, abide with sloth and torpor, abide restlessly 
worrying, abide with doubts, abide with hatred, abide with a defiled mind, abide 
with a violent angry body, abide lazy and distracted, he should arouse a lot of 
interest, effort, zeal, unhindered action and mindful awareness to dispel those 
demeritorious things. Bhikkhus, someone whose clothes or head is on fire would 
arouse a lot of interest, effort, zeal, unhindered action and mindful awareness 
to put out that fire.In the same manner the bhikkhu should arouse a lot of

perceptions are impermanent, determinations are impermanent and consciousness is 
impermanent. Thus he sees impermànence in these five holding masses. Ananda, to

<P>Ananda, what is the perception of lacking a self?</P>
<P>Here, Ananda, the bhikkhu gone to the forest, to the root of a tree or to an 
empty house reflects:- `The eye and forms lack a self. Ear and sounds lack a 
self. Nose and scents lack a self. The tongue and tastes lack a self. Body and 
touches lack a self. The mind and ideas lack a self.' Thus he sees the lack of a 
self in these six internal and external spheres. Ananda, to this is said the
