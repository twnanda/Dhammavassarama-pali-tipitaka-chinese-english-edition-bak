<P>003.01. At one time The Blessed One was living in Vesali in a gabled hall in 
the Great forest. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from there:</P>
<P>ßBhikkhus, bear that the householder Ugga of Vesali is endowed with eight 
wonderful and surprising things." Saying this the Well Gone One went into the 
monastery. </P>
<P>Then a certain bhikkhu putting on robes in the morning, taking bowl and robes 
approached the home of the householder Ugga of Vesali and sat on the prepared 
seat. The householder Ugga of Vesali approached that bhikkhu, worshipped and sat 
on a side. Then that bhikkhu said to Ugga, the householder of Vesali:</P>
<P>ßHouseholder, The Blessed One has declared, that you are endowed with eight 
wonderful and surprising things. Householder, what are those eight wonderful and 
surprising things with which you are endowed, as told by The Blessed One?" 
ßVenerable sir, I do not know of the wonderful and surprising things that The 
Blessed One has declared. Yet there are eight wonderful and surprising things 
evident in me. Listen and attend carefully, I will tellñhem. That bhikkhu 
consented and the householder Ugga of Vesali said: </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, on the first day I saw The Blessed One approaching in the 
distance, together with that sight, my mind got established in faith. This is 
the first wonderful and surprising thing, evident in me</P>
<P>Venerable sir, with that delighted mind I attended on The Blessed One. The 
Blessed One gave me a graduated sermon. Such as the benefits, of giving gifts, 
being virtuous, about heavenly bliss, the dangers of sensuality, the defiling 
nature of vile and low things and the benefits of giving up. When The Blessed 
One knew that my mind was ready, tender, free from obstructions, exalted and 
pleased, he gave me the special message of the enlightened ones such as 
unpleasantness, the arising of unpleasantness, the cessation of unpleasàntness 
and the path leading to the cessation of unpleasantness. </P>
<P>Just as a pure cloth free of any impurity would take the dye evenly, in the 
same manner the pure stainless eye of the Teaching appeared to me, seated there 
itself- ßWhatever arisen thing has the nature of ceasing". . </P>
<P>Then and there I mastered the Teaching, knew the teaching, penetrated it, 
dispelled doubts and becoming confident did not want another teacher in the 
dispensation. There itself, I took refuge in The Blessed One, in the Teaching 
and the Community of bhikkhus and observed these five precepts of the holy life. 
This is the second wonderful and surprising thing, evident in me</P>
<P>Venerable sir, I had four wives, virgines. I approached them and told them 
-'Sisters I have observed the five precepts of the holy life. If you desire, 
partake this wealth and also do merit. Or else go to your relations. Or else if 
you desire any man, I will give you to him. When this was said the most senior 
of them said -'Noble son give me to the man of this name.' I sent for that man 
with my left hand taking the hand of my wife and with the right hand taking the 
cerimonial water jar I sprinkled water and gave away the maiden to him. When 
giving up my wife I did not know of any change in my mind. This is the third 
wonderful and surprising thing, evident in me</P>
<P>Venerable sir, there is wealth in my clan, that too not divided among 
virtuous ones with good conduct. This is the fourth wonderful and surprising 
thing, evident in me</P>
<P>Venerable sir, if I associate bhikkhus, I do so carefully. This is the fifth 
wonderful and surprising thing, evident in me. </P>
<P>Venerable sir, if venerable ones preach me, I listen carefully. If they do 
not preach, I preach them. This is the sixth wonderful and surprising thing, 
evident in me</P>
<P>Venerable sir, it is not surprising the gods approach me and tell- 
`Householder, the Teaching of The Blessed One is well declared'- Then I tell 
them-'Whether you tell it or not tell it, the Teaching of The Blessed One is 
well declared.' On account of this I do not feel any elation, about the gods 
approaching me or of my talking with the gods. This is the seventh wonderful and 
surprising thing, evident in me</P>
<P>Venerable sir, the bonds that The Blessed One says binds one to the sensual 
world, I do not see any of them not dispelled in me. This is the eighth 
wonderful and surprising thing, evident in me. Venerable sir these eight 
wonderful and surprising things, are evident in me. I do not know of the eight 
wonderful and surprising things declared by The Blessed One.</P>
<P>That bhikkhu accepting morsel food at the home of the householder Ugga of 
Vesali, went away. After the meal was over, he approached The Blessed One, 
worshipped, sat on a side and related all the conversation between him and the 
householder Ugga of Vesali. </P>
<P>ßBhikkhu, the householder Ugga of Vesali has declared it well. These are the 
eight wonderful and surprising things with which the householder Ugga is 
endowed. Bear in mind that the householder Ugga is endowed with these eight 
wonderful and surprising things. </P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>

approach me and tell- `Householder, this bhikkhu is released bothwise. This one 
is released through faith, this one is a body witness, this one has attined 
right view, this one is released through faith, this one walks in the Teaching. 
this one lives with faith, is virtuous, this one is unvirtuous with evil things. 
Venerable sir, when I attend on the Community it does not occur to me, -this one 
should be given a little, this one should be given more. I give with the same

Alavi. Then Hatthaka of Alavi approached The Blessed One attended by about five 
hundred lay disciples, worshipped The Blessed One and sat on a side. Then The 
Blessed One said to him: ßHatthaka, your gathering is huge. Hatthaka, how did 
you get together this huge gathering?" </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, it is by practising these four factors, with feelings for 
common good, declared by The Blessed One. Venerable sir, when I know these 
should be won over with liberality, I win them over with liberality. When I know 
these should be won over with kind words, I win them over with kind words. When 
I know these should be won over by showing a useful living, I win them over 
showing an useful living. When I know these should be won over with sagacity, I 
win them over with sagacity. Venerable sir, there is wealth in my clan. I think, 
this should not be heard by the poor."</P>
<P>ßHatthaka, it is good! You have wisely got together this huge gathering. In

factors, feeling for the common good. In the future if anyone would gather a 
huge gathering they would do so through these four factors, feeling for the

Teaching leading to quietness and extinction, taught by the Well Gone One, is 
preached. This person is born to someone in the central states wise, without 
saliva dripping, able to discriminate between good and evil words to know the 
meanings. Bhikkhus, this is the only instance to lead the holy life."</P>
<P>Having gained humanity, when the good Teaching is proclaimed </P>
<P>Those who do not miss the moment, should not miss that moment. </P>
<P>Many instances are told, that bring danger to the path </P>
<P>The birth of the Thus Gone One is rare in the world</P>
<P>Coming face to face with him is even more rare.</P>
<P>Birth as a human is rare, the Teaching is rare </P>
<P>It is suitable that people seeking their own good should make effort </P>
<P>In whatever way you know the Teaching do not miss the moment, </P>
<P>Those who miss the moment grieve in hell.</P>
<P>They go wrong in the good Teaching's definiteness</P>
<P>Like the merchant coming to the wrong ford, grieved long.. </P>
<P>The man shrouded in ignorance goes wrong in the Teaching</P>
<P>And goes in existences going from birth to death long. </P>
<P>Those who achieved humanity and the well preached Teaching </P>
<P>Practised, will practise or practise those words </P>
<P>They lead the holy life and penetrate at the right moment </P>
<P>And come to the path declared by the Thus Gone Ones</P>
<P>They are the restrained wise, it was said by the kinsman of the sun. </P>
<P>They are protected, always mindful, abide without tricklings </P>
<P>Cutting up all latent tendencies they go beyond the sphere of Death </P>
<P>They have attained the destruction of desires. </P>

<P align=center>10. Anuruddhamahàvitakkasuttaü- Great thoughts of ven. 
Anuruddha.</P></B></FONT><FONT face=Times_CSX+>
<P>003.10. At one time The Blessed One was living in the dear park in the 
Bhesakala forest, among the Sunsumara peaks in the Bhagga country. At that time 
venerable Anuruddha lived in the western bamboo forest. When venerable Anuruddha 
was in his seclusion this discursive thought arose to him: ßThis Teaching is for 
one with few desires, not for one with many desires. This Teaching is for one 
satisfied, not for one dissatisfied. This Teaching is for the secluded, not for 
one attached to company. This Teaching is for one with aroused effort, not for 
the lazy. This Teaching is for one with established mindfulness, not for one 
without mindfulness This Teaching is for the concentrated, not for the 
distracted. This Teaching is for the wise, not for those lacking in wisdom. </P>
<P>The Blessed One knowing the discursive thought in venerable Anuruddha's mind, 
as a strong man would stretch his bent arm or bend his stretched arm 
disappearing from the dear park in the Bhesakala forest, among the Sunsumara 
peaks in the Bhagga country.appeared before venerable Anuruddha in the western 
bamboo forest. The Blessed One sat on the prepared seat and venerable Anuruddha 
too sat on a side. The Blessed One said to venerable Anuruddha: . .... </P>
<P>Anuruddha, your discursive thoughts are the thoughts of a Great Man! -This 
Teaching is for one with few desires, not for one with many desires. This 
Teaching is for one satisfied, not for one dissatisfied. This Teaching is for 
the secluded, not for one attached to company. This Teaching is for one with 
aroused effort, not for the lazy. This Teaching is for one with established 
mindfulness, not for one without mindfulness This Teaching is for the 
concentrated, not for the distracted. This Teaching is for the wise, not for 
those lacking in wisdom. Anuruddha, think of this eighth thought of a Great Man. 
-This Teaching is for the non-worldly, for those not attached to 
worldliness"</P>
<P>Anuruddha, when you think of these eight thoughts of a Great Man, if you 
desire secluding the mind from sensual desires and demeritorious things, with 
thoughts and thought processes and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion 
you will abide in the first higher state of mind. </P>
<P>Anuruddha, when you think of these eight thoughts of a Great Man, if you 
desire, overcoming thoughts and discursive thoughts, the mind internally 
appeased and brought to one point, you will abide in the second higher state of 
mind without thoughts and discursive thoughts with joy and pleasantness born of 
concentration. </P>
<P>Anuruddha, when you think of these eight thoughts of a Great Man, if you 
desire, with equanimity to joy and disenchantment will abide mindful and aware 
and experience pleasantness with the body too. You will abide in the third 
higher state of the mind, to which the noble ones say, `mindfully abiding in 
pleasantness with equanimity.' . </P>
<P>Anuruddha, when you think of these eight thoughts of a Great Man, if you 
desire, dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness, earlier having dispelled 
pleasure and displeasure, you abide in the fourth higher state of the mind. </P>
<P>Anuruddha, when you think of these eight thoughts of a Great Man and abide in 
the four higher states of the mind, the pleasant abidings here and now gained 
for nothing, easily and quickly, your rag robe will be, for satisfaction, 
attachment without excitement, for a pleasant abiding and for extinction It 
would be like a robe taken out of a wardrobe of a householder or the son of a 
householder full of garments of various colours. </P>
<P>Anuruddha, when you think of these eight thoughts of a Great Man and abide in 
the four higher states of the mind, the pleasant abidings here and now gained 
for nothing, easily and quickly, your meal of morsel food will be, for 
satisfaction, attachment without excitement, for a pleasant abiding and for 
extinction It would be like a meal prepared for a householder or the son of a 
householder with fine rice, the dark seeds picked, with various soups and 
curries. </P>
<P>Anuruddha, when you think of these eight thoughts of a Great Man and abide in 
the four higher states of the mind, the pleasant abidings here and now gained 
for nothing, easily and quickly, your dwelling at the root of a tree will be, 
for satisfaction, attachment without excitement, for a pleasant abiding and for 
extinction It would be like a gabled house of a householder or the son of a 
householder, well painted with doors and windows, to shut out the wind</P>
<P>Anuruddha, when you think of these eight thoughts of a Great Man and abide in 
the four higher states of the mind, the pleasant abidings here and now gained 
for nothing, easily and quickly, your spread of grass for bed and seat will be, 
for satisfaction, attachment without excitement, for a pleasant abiding and for 
extinction It would be like a cushion in a carpeted room with deer skin hide 
with red cushions on either side, of a householder or the son of a 
householder.</P>
<P>Anuruddha, when you think of these eight thoughts of a Great Man and abide in 
the four higher states of the mind, the pleasant abidings here and now gained 
for nothing, easily and quickly, your medicine of putrid urine will be, for 
satisfaction, attachment without excitement, for a pleasant abiding and for 
extinction It would be like various medicine such as ghee, butter, oil and 
molasses of a householder or the son of a householder.</P>
<P>Anuruddha, even after the rains you abide in Ceti in the western bamboo 
forest. Venerable Anuruddha consented and The Blessed One advising venerable 
Anuruddha disappeared from the western bamboo forest and appeared in deer the 
park in the Bhesakala forest in the Bhagga country. The Blessed One sat on the 
prepared seat and addressed the bhikkhus : </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, there are eight thoughts of a Great Man, listen to them and attend 
carefully. What eight? </P>
<P>ßThis Teaching is for one with few desires, not for one with many desires. 
This Teaching is for one satisfied, not for one dissatisfied. This Teaching is 
for the secluded, not for one attached to company. This Teaching is for one with 
aroused effort, not for the lazy. This Teaching is for one with established 
mindfulness, not for one without mindfulness This Teaching is for the 
concentrated, not for the distracted. This Teaching is for the wise, not for 
those lacking in wisdom. This Teaching is for the non-worldly, for those not 
attached to worldliness.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it was said this Teaching is for one with few desires, not for one 
with many desires. Why was it said so? Here, the bhikkhu with few desires, 
thinks may others not know that am with few desires. The bhikkhu satisfied, 
thinks may others not know that am satisfied. The bhikkhu secluded, thinks may 
others not know that am secluded. The bhikkhu with aroused effort, thinks may 
others not know that am with aroused effort. The bhikkhu with established 
mindfulness, thinks may others not know that am with established mindfulness. 
The bhikkhu concentrated, thinks may others not know that am concentrated. The 
wise bhikkhu thinks may others not know that am wise. The bhikkhu not attached 
to worldliness, thinks may others not know that am not attached to 
worldliness.Bhikkhus, if it was said, this Teaching is for one with few desires, 
not for one with many desires, it was said on account of this. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it was said this Teaching is for the satisfied, not for the 
dissatisfied. Why was it said so? Here, the bhikkhu is satisfied with whatever 
gain of robes, morsel food, dwellings and requisites when ill. If it was said 
this Teaching is for the satisfied and not for the dissatisfied, it was said on 
account of this. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it was said this Teaching is for the secluded, not for those 
attached to company . Why was it said so? Here, the secluded bhikkhu may be 
approached by bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, lay disciples male and female, kings and 
kings' ministers, those of other sects and their disciples. When they come the 
bhikkhu is bent, inclined and turned to seclusion, enjoying loneliness and 
speaks to them with the one intention of dismissing them, sending them away. If 
it was said this Teaching is for the secluded and not for those attached to 
company, it was said on account of this.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it was said this Teaching is for those with aroused, not for the 
lazy. Why was it said so? Here, the bhikkhu abides with aroused effort to dispel 
demerit and to amass merit, firmly determined not to give up the main aim of 
meritorious things. If it was said this Teaching is for those with aroused 
effort and not for the lazy, it was said on account of this.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it was said this Teaching is for those with established 
mindfulness, not for the forgetful. Why was it said so? Here, the bhikkhu is 
endowed with the highest discrimination of mindfulness, recalling things heard 
and said long ago. If it was said this Teaching is for the satisfied and not for 
the dissatisfied, it was said on account of this. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it was said this Teaching is for the concentrated, not for the 
distracted. Why was it said so? Here, the bhikkhu secluded from sense desires 
...re.... abides in the fourth higher state of the mind. If it was said this 
Teaching is for the concentrated and not for the distracted, it was said on 
account of this. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it was said this Teaching is for the wise, not for those lacking in 
wisdom. Why was it said so? Here, the bhikkhu becomes wise, endowed with the 
rising and fading nature of the five holding masses, to penetrate and see the 
destruction of unpleasantnes. If it was said this Teaching is for the wise and 
not for those lacking in wisdom, it was said on account of this.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it was said this Teaching is for those not attached to worldliness, 
not for those attached to worldliness. Why was it said so? Here, the bhikkhu's 
mind settles, delights and is released in the cessation of worldliness. If it 
was said this Teaching is for those not attached to worldliness and not for 
those attached to worldliness, it was said on account of this.</P>
<P>Venerable Anuruddha even after the rains abode in the western bamboo forest. 
Venerable Anuruddha abiding alone, withdrawn from the crowd, diligent to dispel 
before long attained that noble end of the holy life, for which the sons of 
clansmen rightfully leave the household and become homeless. He here and now, 
realizing it abode and knew birth is destroyed the holy life is lived, what 
should be done is done, there is nothing more to wish. Venerable Anuruddha 
became one of the noble ones and uttered this solemn utterance that moment: . 
</P>
<P></P>
<P>The noble Teacher in the world, knowing my thoughts </P>
<P>Approached me mentally by his psychic powers.</P>
<P>The enlightened one attached to non-worldliness,</P>
<P>Taught me non-worldliness and I got attached to the dispensation .</P>
<P>Realizing the threefold knowledge I did my duty in the dispensation.
