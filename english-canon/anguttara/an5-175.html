"Endowed with these five qualities, a lay follower is an outcaste of a lay follower, a stain of a lay follower, a dregs of a lay follower. Which five? He/she does not have conviction [in the Buddha's Awakening]; is unvirtuous; is eager for protective charms &amp; ceremonies; trusts protective charms &amp; ceremonies, not kamma; and searches for recipients of his/her offerings outside (of the Sangha), and gives offerings there first. Endowed with these five qualities, a lay follower is an outcaste of a lay follower, a stain of a lay follower, a dregs of a lay follower.

"Endowed with these five qualities, a lay follower is a jewel of a lay follower, a lotus of a lay follower, a fine flower of a lay follower. Which five? He/she has conviction; is virtuous; is not eager for protective charms &amp; ceremonies; trusts kamma, not protective charms &amp; ceremonies; does not search for recipients of his/her offerings outside (of the Sangha), and gives offerings here first.
