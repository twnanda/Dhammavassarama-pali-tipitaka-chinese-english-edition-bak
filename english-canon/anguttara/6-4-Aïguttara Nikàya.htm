<P align=center>4. Mahamoggallànasuttaü- Venerable 
Mahamoggallana.</P></B></FONT><FONT face=Times_CSX+>
<P>004.04. At one time The Blessed One was abiding in the monastery offered by 
Anathapindika in Jeta's grove in Savatthi. At that time to venerable 
Mahamoggallana this thought arose, when he was in seclusion: `To which gods does 
the knowledge arise, I have entered the stream of the Teaching, I do not fall 
from it. I am directly intent on extinction.? At that time a bhikkhu named Tissa 
who had passed away recently had appeared in a certain Brahma world. That Brahma 
Tissa is very powerful, he should know it. </P>
<P>Then venerable Mahamoggallana disappeared from Jeta's grove and appeared in 
the world of Brahma as a strong man would stretch his bent arm or bend his 
stretched arm. Brahma Tissa saw venerable Mahamoggallana approaching in the 
distance and said: Welcome! Sir, Mahamoggallana, it's after a long time that 
venerable Mahamoggallana found a chance to come here. Sir, Mahamoggallana take a 
seat. Venerable Mahamoggallana sat on the prepared seat and Brahma Tissa 
worshipped venerable Mahamoggallana and sat on a side. Venerable Mahamoggallana 
said: Tissa, to which gods does the knowledge arise, `I have entered the stream 
of the Teaching, I do not fall from it. I am directly intent on extinction'? 
Venerable sir, to the four guardian gods such knowledge arises. Tissa, does this 
knowledge, `I have entered the stream of the Teaching, I do not fall from it. I 
am directly intent on extinction,' arise to all four guardian gods? Venerable 
sir, Mahamoggallana, it does not occur to the four guardian gods, who are not 
endowed with, unwavering faith in The Blessed One, in the Teaching, in the 
Community of bhikkhus and virtues desired by the noble ones. Venerable sir, 
Mahamoggallana, it occurs to the four guardian gods, who are endowed with, 
unwavering faith in The Blessed One, in the Teaching, in the Community of 
bhikkhus and virtues desired by the noble ones. Tissa, is it only to the four 
guardian gods, that this knowledge arise? `I have entered the stream of the 
Teaching, I do not fall from it. I am directly intent on extinction' does it not 
arise to the gods of the thirty-three ...re.... the Titanic gods, ....re....gods 
of happiness, ...re... gods attached to creation, ...re.... gods attached to the 
creation of others. Venerable sir, Moggallana, it occurs to gods attached to 
creation of others also. Tissa, does it occur to all gods attached to the 
creation of others? Venerable sir, Moggallana, it does not occur to all gods 
attached to the creation of others. Of the gods attached to the creation of 
others, it occurs to those endowed with, unwavering faith in The Blessed One, in 
the Teaching, in the Community of bhikkhus and virtues desired by the noble 
ones. </P>
<P>Then venerable Mahamoggallana, delighting in the words of Brahma Tissa, like 
a strong man would stretch his bent arm or bend his stretched arm disappeared 
from the world of Brahma and appeared in Jeta's grove. </P>

<P>004.05. Bhikkhus, these six are conducive to wisdom. What six? </P>
<P>Perception of impermanence, unpleasantness in impermanence, lack of a self in 
unpleasantness, the perception of dispelling, the perception of disenchantment

<P>004.06. Bhikkhus, these six are causes of disputes. What six?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is angry and grudging. When the bhikkhu is angry 
and grudging, not mindful and does not revere the Teacher, the Teaching, and the 
Community of bhikkhus and is incomplete in virtues, he arouses a dispute in the 
Community. That dispute is for the bad luck and unpleasantness of many. It is 
for the bad luck and unpleasantness of many gods and men. Bhikkhus, if you see 
such a cause for disputes internally or externally you should arouse effort to 
dispel that evil cause for disputes Bhikkhus, if you do not see such a cause for 
disputes internally or externally you should fall to the method, that the causes 
for disputes do not come down again. In this manner the evil cause of disputes 
does not come down again, is dispelled. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is merciless and spiteful, ...re... selfish and 
envious, ...re...crafty and deceitful, ...re...with evil view and wrong 
view,...re...holding on to his view and giving it up with difficulty . When the 
bhikkhu is holding on to his view and giving it up with difficulty he is not 
mindful and does not revere the Teacher, the Teaching, and the Community of 
bhikkhus and is incomplete in virtues, he arouses a dispute in the Community. 
That dispute is for the bad luck and unpleasantness of many. It is for the bad 
luck and unpleasantness of many gods and men. Bhikkhus, if you see such a cause 
for disputes internally or externally you should arouse effort to dispel that 
evil cause for disputes Bhikkhus, if you do not see such a cause for disputes 
internally or externally you should fall to the method, that the causes for 
disputes do not come down again. In this manner the evil cause of disputes does 
not come down again, is dispelled. Bhikkhus, these six are causes of 
disputes.</P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>
<P align=center>7. Chalangadànasuttaü- Gifts endowed with six 
factors.</P></B></FONT><FONT face=Times_CSX+>
<P>004.07. At one time The Blessed One was abiding in the monastery offered by 
Anathapindika in Jeta's grove in Savatthi. At that time Velukandaki Nandamata 
was offering gifts endowed with six factors to the Community of bhikkhus headed 
by Sariputta and Maggallana. The Blessed One with his purified heavenly eye, 
which is beyond human saw Velukandaki Nandamata offering gifts endowed with six 
factors to the Community of bhikkhus headed by Sariputta and Moggallana and 
addressed the bhikkhus.- Here, bhikkhus, Velukandaki Nandamata is offering gifts 
endowed with six factors to the Community of bhikkhus headed by Sariputta and 
Moggallana. Bhikkhus, what are gifts endowed with six factors? </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, there are three factors to the giver and three factors to the 
acceptor. Bhikkhus, what are the three fators of the giver? Even before giving 
the giver has a pleasant mind, while giving the mind is pleased and having given 
the mind is pleased. These are the three fators of the giver. What are the three 
factors of the acceptor? Here bhikkhus the acceptor is free of greed, free of 
anger and free of delusion. Bhikkhus, these are the three factors of the 
acceptor. Bhikkhus, thus it becomes a gift endowed with six factors. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it is not easy to account for the merits of a gift endowed with 
these six factors as, it is a yield of merit, a yield of good, a bringer of 
pleasantness and heavenly bliss that is conducive to agreeability and 
pleasantness of such a measure. It becomes a mass of pleasantness that is 
immeasurable. As the water in the great ocean cannot be measured as it is a 
hundred vessels full of water, or a thousand vessels full of water or a hundred 
thousand vessels full of water, yet it becomes a mass of water that is 
immeasurable. In the same manner bhikkhus, it is not easy to account for the 
merits of a gift endowed with these six factors as, it is a yield of merit, a 
yield of good, a bringer of pleasantness and heavenly bliss that is conducive to 
agreeability and pleasantness of such a measure. It becomes a mass of 
pleasantness that is immeasurable. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Even before giving the mind is pleased, while giving is pleased,</P>
<P>Having given is pleased, this is the accomplishment in giving a gift.</P>
<P>The restrained, leading a holy life, free of greed, hate and delusion</P>
<P>Are the field for offering gifts. </P>
<P>By oneself cooked and offering with one's own hands </P>
<P>One's belongings offered to others is of great fruit.</P>
<P>The wise offering with faith and released mind </P>
<P>Are reborn in a world of pleasantness without troubles </P></FONT><B><FONT

non-delusion does not arise from delusion, delusion itself arises from delusion. 
Bhikkhus, a god, a human or any other good state would not be evident from

<P>004.12 I heard thus. At one time The Blessed One was touring the country of 
Kosala with a large Community of bhikkhus and entered the Brahmin hamlet 
Icchanagala and lived in the forest stretch of Icchanagala. The Brahmin 
householders of Icchanagtala heard that the good recluse Gotama, the son of the 
Sakyas gone forth from the Sakya clan has come to Icchanagala and lives in the 
forest stretch there. The good name, spread about that good Gotama- That Blessed 
One is worthy, rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well 
gone, the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, 
enlightened and Blessed. He teaches to this world together with its gods, Mara, 
Brahma and the community of recluses and Brahmins, the Teaching he had known and 
realized, good at the beginning, in the middle and the end, purely and 
completely explaining the holy life. It is good to see such worthy ones. Then 
the Brahmin householders of Icchanagala at the end of that night carrying a lot 
of eatables and nourishments approached the forest stretch of Icchangala, and 
they stood outside the entrance making a lot of noise. . </P>
<P>At that time venerable Nagita attended on The Blessed One and The Blessed One 
addressed venerable Nagita: Nagita, who makes such great noise, like hauling a 
catch of fish. Venerable sir, they are the Brahmin householders of Icchanagala 
standing outside, come with a lot of eatables and nourishments for The Blessed 
One and the Community of bhikkhus Nagita, I do not tolerate that eminent fame, 
the enjoyment of gain, honour and fameýay it not come to me. It is vile and 
sluggish pleasure in comparison to this emancipation from worldliness, the 
pleasures of seclusion, appeasement, enlightenment, non sensual pleasure gained 
for nothing and gained quickly. </P>
<P>Venerable sir, may The Blessed One tolerate. Well Gone One, it is the right 
time to give consent. Wherever The Blessed One inclines now, whether hamlet or 
state, the Brahmin householders too would bend, to that hamlet or state. Like 
huge drops of rain that fall would turn towards the inclines. In the same 
manner, wherever The Blessed One inclines now, whether hamlet or state, the 
Brahmin householders too would bend, to that hamlet or state. What is the 
reason? It is on account of the virtues and wisdom of The Blessed One. </P>
<P>Nagita, I do not tolerate that eminent fame, the enjoyment of gain, honour 
and fameýay it not come to me. It is vile and sluggish pleasure in comparison to 
this emancipation from worldliness, the pleasures of seclusion, appeasement, 
enlightenment, non sensual pleasure gained for nothing and gained quickly. The 
enjoyment of gain, honour and fame is a vile and sluggish pleasure. </P>
