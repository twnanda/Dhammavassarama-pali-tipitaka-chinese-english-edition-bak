<P>27. At one time The Blessed One was abiding in the monastery offered by 
Anathapindika in Jeta's grove in Savatthi. Many bhikkhus putting on robes in the 
morning and taking bowls and robes entered Savatthi for alms. Then it occured to 
those bhikkhus:- It is too early yet to go for alms in Savatthi. What if we 
approached the monastery of the wandering ascetics of other sects. </P>
<P>Then those bhikkhus approached the wandering ascetics of other secetics in 
their monastery, exchanged friendly greetings with them and sat on a side. When 
those bhikkhus were seated the wandering ascetics of other sects said to them 
</P>
<P>ßFriends, the recluse Gotama, teaches his disciples thus:-'Come! Bhikkhus, 
thoroughly learn all things, and abide having learnt everything. Friends, we too 
teach our disciples thus:-'Come! friends, thoroughly learn all things, and abide 
having learnt everything. Friends, so then what is the difference between us, in 
the intention, in advising and the advice given ?" </P>
<P>Those bhikkhus neither delighted with the words of the wandering ascetics of 
other sects nor scorning them, got up from their seats and went away thinking. 
`We will know the meaning of these words in the presence of The Blessed One.' 
</P>
<P>Then those bhikkhus, going the alms round in Savatthi, returning from the 
alms round and after the meal was over, approached The Blessed One, worshipped, 
sat on a side and said:-</P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, we put on robes in the morning and taking bowls and robes 
entered Savatthi for alms. Then it occured to us:- It is too early yet to go for 
alms in Savatthi. What if we approached the monastery of the wandering ascetics 
of other sects. </P>
<P>Then we approached the wandering ascetics of other secetics in their 
monastery, exchanged friendly greetings with them and sat on a side. When we 
were seated the wandering ascetics of other sects said to us:- </P>
<P>`Friends, the recluse Gotama, teaches his disciples thus:. Come! Bhikkhus, 
thoroughly learn all things, and abide having learnt everything. Friends, we too 
teach our disciples thus:Come! friends, thoroughly learn all things, and abide 
having learnt everything.' Friends, so then what is the difference between us,

statements and ten explanations? Bhikkhus, when questioned thus, the ascetics of 
other sects find it impossible to reply and fall into trouble. What is the 
reason? Bhikkhus, it is beyond them. Bhikkhus, in this world, together with its 
gods, Maras, Brahmas the Community of recluses and Brahmins and gods and men I

<P>29. ßBhikkhus, in the whole of Kashmire and the country of Kosala, in the 
kingdom of king Pasenadi of Kosala, king Pasenadi is the chief. Bhikkhus, king 
Pasenadi of Kosala too has a change a disappontment. The noble disciple seeing 
this is disenchanted. Someone who turns away from that, turns away from the 
highest. </P>
<P>As long as the moon and sun illuminate the directions, so long the

guardian gods, a thousand set of thirty three gods, a thousand set of Titans, a 
thousand of the states of happiness, a thousand of the states of creations, a 
thousand sets of those creating others and a thousand of the worlds of Brahma. 
Bhikkhus, out of the ten thousand world systems the chief is Mahabrahma 
Mahabrahma too has a change a disappointment. The noble disciple seeing this is 
disenchanted. Someone who turns away from that, turns away from the highest.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, there is a time when there is a forward cycling of the world, at 
that time many become radiant gods. These mental beings, enjoy life, emanate 
light, move in space and enjoy that state for a long time. During the forward 
world cycle, the radiant gods are the foremost. They too have a change, a 
disappointment. The noble disciple seeing this is disenchanted. Someone who 
turns away from that, turns away from the highest. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these ten are mystic spheres. What ten? One is the mystic sign of 
the earth, perceived above, below, across without another immeasurable. The 
mystic sign of water, ...re...fire, ....re... air, ...re.... blue,...re.... 
yellow, ....re... red, ....re.... white, ...re.... of the sphere of space, 
...re..... and the sphere of consciousness, perceived above, below, across 
without another immeasurable. Bhikkhus, these ten are the mystic spheres.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, of these ten mystic spheresñhe sphere of consciousness, perceived 
above, below, across without another immeasurable, is the foremost. To beings of 
this perception too, there is a change, a disappointment. The nobe disciple 
seeing this is disenchanted. Someone who turns away from that, turns away from 
the highest. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these eight are the masteries. What eight? A certain one with 
internal material perceptions sees a few beautiful and ugly external forms, 
mastering it says I know and I see, this is the first mastery. </P>
<P>A certain one with internal material perceptions sees innumerable beautiful 
and ugly external forms, mastering it says I know and I see, this is the second 
mastery.</P>
<P>A certain one with internal immaterial perceptions sees a few beautiful and 
ugly external forms, mastering it says I know and I see, this is the third 
mastery.</P>
<P>A certain one with internal immaterial perceptions sees innumerable beautiful 
and ugly external forms, mastering them says I know and I see, this is the 
fourth mastery. </P>
<P>A certain one with internal immaterial perceptions sees blue external forms 
with blue characters and blue lustre. Like the blue azure flower, or like the 
Kashmire cloth, which has the colour, characters and lustre beaten into it in 
blue, mastering it says, I know and I see, this is the fifth mastery.</P>
<P>A certain one with internal immaterial perceptions sees yellow external forms 
with yellow characters and yellow lustre. Like the yellow kanikara flower, or 
like the Kashmire cloth, which has the colour, characters and lustre beaten into 
it in yellow, mastering it says, I know and I see, this is the sixth mastery. 
</P>
<P>A certain one with internal immaterial perceptions sees red external forms 
with red characters and red lustre. Like the red bandhujiva flower, or like the 
Kashmire cloth, which has the colour, characters and lustre beaten into it, in 
blue, mastering it says, I know and I see, this is the seventh mastery.</P>
<P>A certain one with internal immaterial perceptions sees white external forms 
with white characters and white lustre. Like the colour of the morning star, or 
like the Kashmire cloth, which has the colour, characters and lustre beaten into 
it in white, mastering it says, I know and I see, this is the eighth mastery. 
</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, of these eight masteries, the one with internal immaterial 
perceptions seeing white external forms with white characters and white lustre, 
mastering it says, I know and I see. This mastery is the foremost. Beings of 
this perception too have a change, a disappointment. The noble disciple seeing 
this is disenchanted. Someone who turns away from that, turns away from the 
highest.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these four are the methods. What four? The unpleasant method with 
slow realization, the unpleasant method with quick realization, the pleasant 
method with slow realization and the pleasant method with quick realization. 
</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, of these methods the foremost is the pleasant method with quick 
realization. Beings fallen to this method too have a change, a disappointment. 
The noble disciple seeing this is disenchanted. Someone who turns away from 
that, turns away from the highest. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these four are the perceptions. What four? A certain one perceives 
a little, a certain one perceives grown great, a certain one perceives 
immeasurably and a certain one perceives `there is nothing.' Bhikkhus, of these 
four perceptions the perception, `there is nothing' and abiding in the sphere of 
nothingness is the foremost. Beings of this perception too have a change, a 
disappointment. The noble disciple seeing this is disenchanted. Someone who 
turns away from that, turns away from the highest.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, views external to this, such as `I am not, there is nothing of 
mine, I will not be, there will be nothing of mine' Those of this view should 
expect this:- As long as there is loathing `to be' it will be not to him. As 
long as there is agreement with the cessation `to be', it will not be to him. 
Bhikkhus, there are beings of this view too Beings of this view too have a 
change, a disappointment. The noble disciple seeing this is disenchanted. 
Someone who turns away from that, turns away from the highest. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, there are recluses and Brahmins who appoint the highest purity. Of 
all highest purities, this is the foremost, such as overcoming all the sphere of 
nothingness and abiding in the sphere of neither perceptions nor 
non-perceptions. They who know this sphere realize it and declare it to others. 
Bhikkhus there are beings of this view. Beings of this view too have a change, a 
disappointment. The noble disciple seeing this is disenchanted. Someone who 
turns away from that, turns away from the highest. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, there are beings who appoint the highest extinction in this very 
life. Such as knowing as it really is, the arising, fading, enjoyment, dangers 
and escape from the six spheres of mental contact and non-holding release from 
them. Bhikkhus, when I say this, certain recluses and Brahmins abuse me saying 
unreal and not truthful things.-'The recluse Gotama does not appoint the 
thorough knowledge of sensuality, the thorough knowledge of matter, and the 
thorough knowledge of feelings. Bhikkhus, I appoint the thorough knowledge of 
sensuality, matter and the thorough knowledge of feelings. Here and now the 
hunger appeased, extinguished, become cool without a hold I appoint final 
extinction. </P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>

<P>30. At one time The Blessed One was abiding in the monastery offered by 
Anathapindika in Jeta's grove in Savatthi. At that time king Pasenadi of Kosala 
with his intentions fulfilled was celebrating his victories and went to the 
monastery. Going as far as he could go on a vehicle, ascended and approached the 
monastery on foot. At that time many bhikkhus were walking to and fro mindfully 
in open space. King Pasenadi of Kosala approached them and asked - ßVenerable 
sirs, where does The Blessed One, worthy and rightfully enlightened abide now? 
We want to see him. </P>
<P>ßGreat king in this monastery, its door is closed. Approach it, without 
making a noise, step to the verandah, clear the throat, and knock on the closed 
door, The Blessed One will open the door. </P>
<P>Then king Pasenadi of Kosala approached the monastery, the door of which was 
closed, without making a noise, stepped on the verandah, cleared his throat and 
knocked on the closed door. The Blessed One opened the door and king Pasenadi of 
Kosala entered the room, worshipped the feet of The Blessed One with his head at 
the feet of The Blessed One and also kissed his feet and stroked his feet and 
announced his name saying: -" Venerable sir, am king Pasenadi of Kosala" </P>
<P>ßGreat king, seeing what good reason do you show this manifestation of loving 
kindness lying so low to this body?" </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, I show my gratitude and gratefulness with this highest 
manifestation of lovingkindness.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, The Blessed One has fallen to the method of welfare and 
pleasantness of many, establishing many in the noble norm, in the good Teaching 
and meritorious things. Venerable sir, seeing this good reason, I, lying 
low.show my gratitude and gratefulness with the highest manifestations of 
lovingkindness to The Blessed One. </P>
<P>Again, venerable sir, The Blessed One is virtuous, developed in the noble 
ones' virtues that are clever. Venerable sir, seeing this good reason, I, lying

abiding in forests and jungle paths. Venerable sir, seeing this good reason, I

<P>Again, venerable sir, The Blessed One has those topics of talk, such as 
topics for few desires, for satisfaction, for seclusion, for withdrawing from 
the company, for arousing effort, for virtues, for concentration, for wisdom, 
for release, and for knowledge and vision of release. Venerable sir, seeing this 
good reason, I lying low.show my gratitude and gratefulness with the highest

Such as one birth, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a 
hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand, innumerable forward cycles of births, 
innumerable backward cycles of births and innumerable forward and backward 
cycles of births. There I was of such name, clan, disposition, supports, 
experiencing such pleasant and unpleasant feelings and with such a life span.

<P>Again, venerable sir, The Blessed One with the heavenly eye purified beyond 
human sees beings disappearing and appearing unexalted and exalted, beautiful 
and ugly, in good and evil states, knows beings according to their 
actions-'These good beings, endowed with bodily, verbal and mental misbehaviour, 
blaming noble ones, with wrong view and with the wrong view of actions, after 
death go to loss, to decrease, to an evil state, to hell. As for these good 
beings endowed with good behaviour by body, words and mind, not blaming noble 
ones, with right view and with the right view of actions, after death go to 
increase, to a good state, to heaven. Thus with the heavenly eye purified beyond 
human sees beings disappearing and appearing according their actions. Venerable

abides. Venerable sir, seeing this good reason, I lying low.show my gratitude 
and gratefulness with the highest manifestations of lovingkindness to The 
Blessed One.</P>
