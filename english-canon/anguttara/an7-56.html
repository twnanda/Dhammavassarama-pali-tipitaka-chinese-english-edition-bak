<hr>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Kimila, in the Bamboo Grove. Then Ven. Kimila went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "What is the cause, lord, what is the reason why, when a Tathagata has become totally unbound (has entered total Nibbana), the true Dhamma does not last a long time?"
<p>
"Kimila, there is the case where, when a Tathagata has become totally unbound, the monks, nuns, male lay followers, &amp; female lay followers live without respect, without deference, for the Teacher; live without respect, without deference, for the Dhamma...the Sangha...the Training...concentration...heedfulness; live without respect, without deference, for hospitality. This is the cause, this is the reason why, when a Tathagata has become totally unbound, the true Dhamma does not last a long time."
<p>
"And what is the cause, what is the reason why, when a Tathagata has become totally unbound, the true Dhamma does last a long time?"
<p>
"Kimila, there is the case where, when a Tathagata has become totally unbound, the monks, nuns, male lay followers, &amp; female lay followers live with respect, with deference, for the Teacher; live with respect, with deference, for the Dhamma...the Sangha...the Training...concentration...heedfulness; live with respect, with deference, for hospitality. This is the cause, this is the reason why, when a Tathagata has become totally unbound, the true Dhamma does last a long time."
