<P align=center>Buddhism in Translations</P></H1>
<P>This book was translated and edited by Henry Clarke Warren (1854-1899), and 
published in 1896 as Volume III of the <I>Harvard Oriental Series</I>. As such, 
it (like <I>The Sacred Books of the East</I>) suffers from some of the 
deficiencies of Victorian-era translations, mainly: intentionally archaic 
phrasing (although not as much as is found in many books), versification that 
today strikes us as stilted (if not downright bad), and translations of some 
Buddhist technical terms that may show a lack of understanding for the 
subtleties of Buddhist thought (very notably, the use of the word 'priest' 
instead of 'monk' to translate 'bhikku', which is not at all a subtle 
distinction) and have been superceded in more modern translations. Also, it is 
an anthology of excerpts from various P&acirc;li sources, and as such, it subjects us 
to Warren's judgment as to what is important to read.</P>
<P>All that being said, however, it is still a quite worthwhile book, and a fine 
introduction to the vast range of P&acirc;li Buddhist literature. The translations are 
of a high quality given their time period, and many of the excerpts are of good 
size, including a number of complete texts. While it may not be suitable for use 
as devotional text or scholarly reference, it does have value in its own right. 
Some of the material included (especially the excerpts from the Visudddhi Magga) 
is not available in any other public domain sources, and at a mere 496 pp. it is 
concise introduction to the major ideas of Theravada Buddhism. A second table of 
contents for the book has also been provided, reorganizing the material 
according to the original sources.</P>
