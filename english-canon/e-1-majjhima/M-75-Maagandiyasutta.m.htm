<BR>&nbsp; 
<P class=MsoBodyText>I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One lived in the 
country of the Kurus in a hamlet named Kammassadhamma. The Blessed One, slept on 
a spread of dried grass in the fire hut of a brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan. In 
the morning, the Blessed One, putting on robes, taking bowl and robes went the 
alms round, in the hamlet Kammassadhamma. Returning from the alms round and 
after the meal was over the Blessed One entered a certain forest stretch, and 
sat at the root of a certain tree, to spend the day. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The wandering 
ascetic Magandiya wandering and walking for exercise entered the fire hut of the 
brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan. Seeing the spread of dried grass in the fire hut 
he said. ‘Good Bharadvaja, for whom, is this spread of dried grass prepared, I 
think it’s the bed of a recluse.’ ‘Good Magandiya, it is the recluse Gotama’s, 
the son of the Sakyas. He has gone forth from the clan of the Sakyas. His fame 
is such, the Blessed One is perfect, rightly enlightened, endowed with knowledge 
and conduct. Well gone, knows the worlds, is the incomparable tamer of those to 
be tamed, is Teacher of gods and men, enlightened and Blessed’ ‘Good Bharadvaja, 
we saw something we should not have seen, it’s the bed of that good Gotama, the 
destroyer of humanity.’ ‘Magandiya, be careful of what you say, good Gotama has 
many wise warriors, brahmins, householders and recluses, pleased and tamed in 
the noble Teaching and established in merit.’’Bharadvaja, I will meet that good 
Gotama, and tell these words myself, that the recluse Gotama is a destroyer of 
humanity. What is the reason? It is by examining his bed, that we do so.’ ‘If it 
does not matter to good Magandiya, I will inform this to the recluse Gotama.’’Be 
unconcerned, good Bharadvaja, tell it if he asks.’ 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The Blessed One 
heard this conversation between the wandering ascetic Magandiya and the brahmin 
of the Bharadvaja clan, with his purified heavenly ear element above human. The 
Blessed One got up from his seclusion in the evening, and approached the fire 
hut of the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan. Entering the fire hut, he sat on the 
prepared seat. Then the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan approached the Blessed 
One worshipped, exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side. Then the Blessed 
One said, to the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan.’Was there any conversation 
between Bharadvaja and the wandering ascetic Magandiya concerning this spread of 
grass?’ When this was asked the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan shivered and his 
hairs stood on end, and said.’This we wanted to tell good Gotama, and even 
before that good Gotama tells it.’ Even when this conversation was taking place 
the wandering ascetic Magandiya wandering and walking for exercise entered the 
fire hut of the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan, and approached the Blessed 
One.Exchanged friendly greetings with the Blessed One and sat on a side. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then the Blessed One 
addressed the wandering ascetic Magandiya. ‘Magandiya, the eye is fond of forms, 
intent on forms and delight in forms, the eye of the Thus Gone One is tamed and 
protected. He teaches to protect and to restrain the eye.Is it on account of 
this, that Magandiya said<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>the recluse 
Gotama is a destroyer of humanity?’ ‘I said the recluse Gotama is a destroyer of 
humanity, by examining, his bed.’ . .’Magandiya, the ear is fond of sounds, the 
nose is fond of smells, the tongue is fond of tastes, intent on tastes, and 
delight in tastes. The tongue of the Thus Gone One is tamed and protected. He 
teaches to protect and to restrain the tongue. Is it on account of this, that 
Magandiya said the recluse Gotama is a destroyer of humanity?’ ‘I said the 
recluse Gotama, is a destroyer of humanity, examining his bedstead.’ ‘Magandiya, 
the body, is fond of touches, …re …The mind is fond of ideas, intent on ideas 
and delight with ideas. The mind of the Thus Gone One is tamed and protected. He 
teaches to protect and to restrain the mind. Is it on account of this, that 
Magandiya said, the recluse Gotama is a destroyer of humanity?’’I said the 
recluse Gotama is a destroyer of humanity, examining his bedstead.’ 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Magandiya, one is 
well provided with pleasing, agreeable, forms cognizable by eye consciousness, 
arousing fondness and sensual desires.In the mean time he knows the arising, 
fading, the satisfaction, the danger and the escape from forms, as it really is. 
He dispels and destroys the burning and thirst for forms and internally appeases 
the mind and abides. What has Magandiya to say to that?’ ‘Good Gotama, I have 
nothing to say.’ Magandiya, one is well provided with pleasing, agreeable sounds 
cognizable by ear consciousness,<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>re…. 
smells, cognizable by nose consciousness,…re… tastes cognizable by tongue 
consciousness, touches,…re… cognizable by body consciousness<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>arousing fondness and sensual desires. In the 
mean time he knows the arising, fading, satisfaction, danger and the escape from 
touches, as it really is He dispels and destroys the burning and thirst for 
touches and internally appeases the mind and abides. What has Magandiya to say 
to that?’ ‘Good Gotama, I have nothing to say.’<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Magandiya, when I 
was a householder, I was well provided with the five strands of sensual 
pleasures. Such as pleasing agreeable forms cognizable by eye consciousness 
arousing fondness and sensual desires. Pleasing agreeable sounds, --pleasing 
agreeable smells, --pleasing agreeable tastes, and pleasing agreeable touches 
cognizable by body consciousness, arousing fondness and sensual desires. I was 
provided with three palaces, for the three seasons, one for the rainy season, 
one for the cold season and another for the hot season. Magandiya, I spent four 
months in the palace for the rainy season, without males and provided with 
music. Not coming down to the lower storey, for any reason. In the mean time I 
knew, the arising, fading, the satisfaction, the danger and the escape from 
sensual desires. I dispelled and destroyed the craving, burning and thirst, for 
sensual desires and internally appeased the mind and abode. I see other beings 
not satiated with sensuality, while partaknig it being eaten by it and burnt by 
it. I do not envy them, and do not take pleasure in it. Magandiya, I abide in 
that attachment away from sensuality, away from thoughts of demerit, and even 
beyond heavenly pleasantness and do not envy or delight in something lower than 
that. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Magandiya, like a 
housholder, or a householder’s son, quite wealthy and with many resources, well 
provided with the five strands of sensual pleasures. Such as pleasing agreeable 
forms cognizable by eye consciousness, arousing fondness and sensual desires. 
Pleasing agreeable sounds, --pleasing agreeable smells, --pleasing agreeable 
tastes, and pleasing agreeable touches cognizable by body consciousness, 
arousing fondness and sensual desires. He behaves himself correctly by body, 
speech and mind. After death, he goes to increase, is born with the retinue of 
the thirtythree gods and partakes of the five strands of heavenly sensual 
pleasures attended by nymphs in the Nandana forest. Then he sees a householder 
partake the five strands of sensual pleasures provided and well attended. 
Magandiya, do you think, this son of the gods, partaking the five strands of 
heavenly bliss, attended by those nymphs would envy that householder or the son 
of the householder and would come back for the five strands of sensual 
pleasures?’ ‘No, good Gotama. Heavenly sensual pleasures are superior and more 
exalted than human sensual pleasures.’ ‘In the same manner, Magandiya, when I 
was a householder I was well provided with the five strands of sensual 
pleasures. Such as pleasing agreeable forms cognizable by eye consciousness 
arousing fondness and sensual desires. Pleasing agreeable sounds, --pleasing 
agreeable smells, --pleasing agreeable tastes, and pleasing agreeable touches 
cognizable by body consciousness, arousing fondness and sensual desires. Then in 
the mean time I knew, the arising, fading, the satisfaction, the danger and the 
escape from sensuality as it really is. Then I dispelled and destroyed the 
craving, burning and thirst for senssuality and internally appeased the mind and 
abode. I see other beings not satiated with sensuality, while partaking it being 
eaten and burnt by it. I do not envy them, and do not take pleasure in it. 
Magandiya, I abide in that attachment away from sensuality, away from thoughts 
of demerit, and even beyond heavenly pleasantness and do not envy or delight in 
something lower than that. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Magandiya, a lepor 
with a diseased, decayed skin, with worms attacking it, would scratch the skin 
with his nails and would have open bruises and wounds. Then he would burn those 
wounds in a pit of embers and his friends, co-associates and blood relations 
would call a doctor to attend on him. After that treatment he would get over his 
leprosy, and getting well would be able to go where he wished. Then he would see 
another lepor with a diseased, decayed skin, with worms eating the skin, and he 
scratching it for relief and burning the wounds and bruises in a pit of embers. 
Would he envy that lepor, or the pit of embers, or the treatment given?’ ‘No, 
good Gotama, when he was diseased, the treatment was necessary. When he got over 
the illness, no more medicine is necessary.’ ‘In the same manner, Magandiya, 
when I was a householder I was well provided with the five strands of sensual 
pleasures. Pleasing agreeable forms cognizable by eye consciousness arousing 
fondness and sensual desires. Pleasing agreeable sounds, --pleasing agreeable 
smells, --pleasing agreeable tastes, and pleasing agreeable touches cognizable 
by body consciousness, arousing fondness and sensual desires. In the mean time I 
knew the arising, fading, the satisfaction, the danger and the escape from 
sensuality as it really is I dispelled and destroyed the craving, burning and 
the thirst for sensuality, appeasing the mind internally abode. I see other 
beings partaking sensuality not satiated with it, being eaten by it and burnt by 
it. I do not envy them, and do not take pleasure in it. Magandiya, I abide in 
that attachment away from sensuality, away from thoughts of demerit, and even 
beyond heavenly pleasantness and do not envy or delight in something lower than 
that. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Magandiya, a lepor 
with a diseased, decayed skin, worms attacking it, would scratch the skin with 
his nails and would have open bruises and wounds, would burn those wounds in a 
pit of embers. His friends, co-associates and blood relations would call a 
doctor to attend on him. Then treated by the doctor would get over his leprosy, 
and getting well would be able to go where he wished. Then two strong men would 
come along and pull this man along to the burning pit of embers. Magandiya, 
wouldn’t his body writhe to get away from it?’ ‘Yes, good Gotama, his body would 
writhe to get away from it. What is the reason? Good Gotama fire is unpleasant 
to contact, the great heat causes much burning.’ ‘Magandiya, fire is unpleasant 
to contact, produces heat and causes burning to him, only now, or was it 
unpleasant to contact, produced heat and caused burning earlier too?’ ’Good 
Gotama, now and earlier too fire is unpleasant to contact, produced heat and 
caused burning. The lepor with a diseased, decayed skin, worms attacking it, 
scratched the skin with the nails and had open wounds. With a distorted mental 
faculty, he experienced pleasantness in fire. It is the result of a distorted 
perception.’ ‘Magandiya, in the same manner, even in the past sensual contact 
was unpleasant, produced much heat and burning, in the future too sensual 
contact will be unpleasant, will produce much heat and burning, and sensual 
contact at present too is unpleasant, produces much heat and burning. Magandiya, 
these beings not free of greed for sensuality, destroyed by the greed for 
sensuality, worried by sensual worries, have distorted mental faculties and 
perceive the unpleasant contact of sensuality is pleasant feeling.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Magandiya, however 
much the lepor would scratch the diseased, decayed skin,<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>eaten by worms and make, open<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>bruises and wounds and would burn the wounds in 
a pit of embers.Those wounds would not get better but worse and worse. The decay 
and the ill smell would get worse, and worse. Whatever satisfaction he gets, is 
through scratching the open wounds and scorching them.. In the same manner 
Magandiya, beings not free of greed for sensuality, destroyed with greed for 
sensuality, worried by sensual worries, partake of sensuality, and in this and 
other way they grow their sensual greed and grow their sensual worries. Whatever 
little satisfaction they gain is through the five strands of sense 
pleasures.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Magandiya, have you 
seen or heard of a king or the chief minister of a king, provided and 
accomplished with the five strands of sensual pleasures. Have you seen such a 
one internally appeased, without giving up that sensual, greed, burning and 
thirst. Or do you see such a one, or will you see such a one in the future?’ 
‘No, good Gotama.’ ’Good! Magandiya, you have understood it. I too have not seen 
or heard of such a one. Nor will hear of such a one. Magandiya, who ever 
recluses or brahmins abode in the past or abide now or will abide in the future, 
gave up, give up and will give up the thirst and burning for sensuality and 
internally appease themselves. By knowing, sensuality, the arising of 
sensuality, fading of sensuality, the satisfaction of sensuality, its dangers, 
and the escape from it, as it really is.’<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>At that time the 
Blessed One utterred this solemn utterance. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Health is the 
highest gain, extinction is the highest bliss, 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The eightfold path 
is the path to peace and deathlessness.’ 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>When this was said, 
the wandering ascetic Magandiya said to the Blessed One. ‘These words of good 
Gotama are excellent, such as Health is the highest gain, and extinction, is the 
highest bliss.I too have heard these words said, by the teachers of teachers of 
wandering ascetics.’ 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Health is the 
highest gain, extinction is the highest bliss. Magandiya, what is that health 
and what is that extinction?’ When this was asked, Magandiya stroked his own 
body and hands, saying, ‘That health and extinction is here. Good Gotama, I’m 
now healthy and without ailments.’ 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Magandiya, like a 
man born blind, would not see impure and pure forms, would not see, blue, 
yellow, red or brown forms, would not see even and uneven forms, would not see 
the constellation, the moon and the sun. He would hear a man with sight say. 
Wonderful is a white garment, pure and stainless. Then he goes in search of 
white.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>A certain man cheats him, giving an 
oil sprayed coarse garment, saying: Good man this is a white pure stainless 
garment. He accepts it puts it on and pleased says delighted words- Wonderful is 
a white garment, pure and stainless.Magandiya, would that blind man, knowing, 
seeing, accept, wear and utter words of delight?’‘Good Gotama that man, born 
blind would accept, wear and utter words of delight not knowing and not seeing 
that oil sprayed coarse garment. He would utter those words of delight, 
wonderful is a white garment, pure and stainless, placing faith in the man who 
has sight.’ ‘Magandiya, in the same manner, wandering ascetics of other sects 
are blind, not knowing and not seeing health and extinction, would say this 
verse. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Health is the 
highest gain, extinction is the highest bliss. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Magandiya, this 
verse was said, by rightfully enlightened perfect ones.of the past. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Health is the 
highest gain, extinction is the highest bliss.*1) 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The eightfold path 
is the peaceful path to deathlessness.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText>Now this has become the ordinary one’s verse. Magandiya, 
this body is the birth place of ill health, abscesses, troubles and ailments, 
and you say it is good health and extinction.You should have the noble one’s eye 
to know the health<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>and see extinction.*1) 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>I’m pleased with 
good Gotama’s Teaching: Could good Gotama teach me so that I may know that 
health and see that extinction. Magandiya, like a man born blind, would not see 
impure and pure forms. Would not see, blue, yellow, red or brown forms. Would 
not see even and uneven forms and would not see the constellation,<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>the moon and the sun. His friends, 
co-associates and blood relations, would get a surgeon to attend to his eyes. He 
being treated and taking that medicine does not regain his sight. Magandiya, 
wouldn’t that surgeon reap fatigue only?’ ‘Yes, good Gotama.’’Magandiya, in the 
same manner I taught you showing the healthy state and showing extinction, yet 
you do not know it and see it, and it is only fatigue for me.’ 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘I’m pleased with 
good Gotama’s Teaching: Could good Gotama teach me so that I may know that 
health and see that extinction.’ ‘Magandiya, like a man born blind, would not 
see impure and pure forms. Would not see, blue, yellow, red or brown forms, nor 
even and uneven forms. Would not see the constellation, the moon and the sun. 
Would hear a man with sight saying, wonderful is a white garment, pure and 
stainless. He goes in search of white. Then a certain man cheats giving him an 
oil sprayed coarse garment Saying: good man this is a white pure stainless 
garment. He accepts it, puts it on and pleased says delighted words. Wonderful 
is a white garment, pure and stainless His friends, co-associates and blood 
relations, would get a surgeon to attend to his eyes. That surgeon attends to 
him, giving him purgatives for the head and stomach, and nasal treatment. Then 
he regains his sight. Soon after, he regains his sight, he dispels the interest 
and greed for the oil sprayed coarse garment, and considers the man who gave it 
as an enemy and even thinks to kill him: Indeed since long I have been cheated 
by this man, with this oil sprayed coarse garment. Saying good man this is a 
wonderful white garment pure and stainess. Magandiya, in the same manner manner 
I taught you showing the healthy state and showing extinction You<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>know it and see it, and<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>together with the arising of that sight,<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>you dispel that interest and greed for the five 
holding masses. Indeed, since a long time I have been cheated by this mind. I 
have been upholding matter. I have been upholding feelings. I have been 
upholding perceptions. I have been upholding determinations and I have been 
upholding consciousness. On account of that holding there is being, on account 
of being, there is birth. On account of birth, decay, death, grief, wailing, 
unpleasantness, and distress-Thus is the arising of the whole mass of 
unpleasantness.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>I’m pleased with 
good Gotama’s Teaching, could I be taught so that I get up delighted from this 
seat Then Magandiya associate good friends, when you associate good friends, you 
hear the good Teaching. When you hear the good Teaching, you fall to the method 
of living according to the teaching. When you fall to the method of living 
according to the Teaching, you yourself realize the ill health, the absces, the 
arrow and the dart. It is here itself that the ill health, the abscess, the 
arrow and the dart should be completely removed. With the cessation of holding, 
there comes the cessation of being, with the cessation of being comes the 
cessation of birth. With the cessation of birth, cease decay, death, grief, 
wailing, unpleasantness and distress. Thus, ceases the complete mass of 
unpleasaantness.’ 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then the wandering 
ascetic Magandiya, said to the Blessed One. ‘Now I understand venerable sir, it 
is as though something over turned was reinstalled. As something covered, is 
made manifest. As though the path was told to one who had lost his way. As 
though an oil lamp was lighted for the dark for those with sight to see forms 
The Blessed One has explained the Teaching in various ways. Now I take refuge in 
the Blessed One in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. May I gain the 
going forth and the higher ordination in the dispensation of the Blessed One.’ 
‘Magandiya, whoever is of another sect seeking the going forth and the higher 
ordination in this dispensation should be on probation for four months, after 
the four months, if the bhikkhus are satisfied, they would give the going forth 
and the higher ordination. It is to see the improvement in the person. Venerable 
sir if one of another sect, would have to be on probation for four months, I 
would be on probation for four years. May the bhikkhus, when satisfied give me 
the going forth and the higher ordination Magandiya gained the going forth and 
the higher ordination and soon after the higher ordination, venerable Magandiya 
abode withdrawn from the crowd diligent for dispelling. He here and now, 
realized and attained that highest end of the yoke, for which sons of clansmen 
rightfully leave the household and become homeless.He knew, birth is destroyed, 
the holy life is lived, what should be done is done, there is nothing more to 
wish. Venerable Magandiya became a perfect one.
