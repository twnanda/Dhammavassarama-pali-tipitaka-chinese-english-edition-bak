<P class=MsoBodyText>I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One was living in a 
forest in Nalakapaana in the kingdom of Kosala. At that time many, well known 
sons of clansmen had gone forth as homeless ones, through faith for the Blessed 
One. Well known ones such venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, Kimbila, Bhagu, 
Kundadaana, Revata, Aananda, and other sons of clansmen. At that time the 
Blessed One was seated in the open attended by the Community of bhikkhus. The 
Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus on account of those sons of clansmen. The 
bhikkhus, the sons of clansmen who have gone forth, on account of faith in me, 
do you lead the holy life with attachment? When this was said the bhikkhus, were 
silent. For the second time, and up to the third time the Blessed One said, The 
bhikkhus, the sons of clansmen who have gone forth, on account of faith in me, 
do you lead the holy life with an attachment? Even for the third time the 
bhikkhus were silent. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then it occurred to 
the Blessed One, what if I question one of the sons of those clansmen, then the 
Blessed One addressed venerable Anuruddha: Anuruddha, are you attached to the 
holy life? Venerable sir, I’m attached to the holy life. Good! Anurudddha, lead 
the holy life with attachment! Sons of clansmen, gone forth out of faith in me, 
should do so. Anurudddha, you are in the prime of youth, in the first stage of 
life, even with black hair. When you should enjoy the five strands of sense 
pleasure, you have gone forth and become homeless. Anuruddha, you were not 
thrown to recluseship out of fear for the king or robbers. Nor out of fear of a 
debt, not because you have no means to live. It is because you thought, I’m 
overcome by birth, decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and 
distress, and that few could declare the complete ending of unpleasantness. 
Anuruddha, didn’t you go forth with that faith? Yes, venerable sir I did. 
Anuruddha, to the son of a clansman who has gone forth thus, what’s there to be 
done in this dispensation? Anuruddha, if you do not seclude the mind from 
sensual desires and things of demerit, or attain something more exalted than 
that, covetousness takes hold of your mind and stays*1). Anger takes hold of 
your mind and stays. Sloth and torpor takes hold of your mind and stays. 
Restlessness and worry takes hold of your mind and stays and doubts take hold of 
your mind and stay. Therefore, Anuruddha, seclude the mind from sensual desires 
and things of demerit, or attain something more exalted than that.So that 
covetoutness may not take hold of your mind and stay. Anger may not take hold of 
your mind and stay, sloth and torpor may not take hold of your mind and stay, 
restlessness and worry may not take hold of your mind and stay and doubts may 
not take hold of your mind stay. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Anuruddha, do you 
think that these defiling desires, full of unplessant results of a future birth, 
decay and death, are not dispelled to the Thus Gone One. Therefore the Thus Gone 
One carefully pursues one, endures one, dispels one and destroys another. 
Venerable sir, we do not think in that manner. We think it should be like this. 
Defiling desires, full of unpleasant results, of a future birth, decay and 
death, are dispelled to the Thus Gone One. Therefore the Thus Gone One carefully 
pursues one, endures one, dispels one and destroys another. Good, Anuruddha, you 
have understood it. To the Thus Gone One these defiling desires, full of 
unpleasant results of a future birth, decay and death, are dispelled. They are 
pulled out from the roots, made palm stumps, made things that would not grow 
again. Anuruddha, it is like a palm of which the top is cut and is not able to 
grow again. In the same manner, these defiling desires, full of unplessant 
results, of a future birth, decay and death, are dispelled to the Thus Gone One. 
Therefore the Thus Gone One, carefully pursues one, endures one, dispels one and 
destroys another. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Anuruddha, for what 
purpose does the Thus Gone One tell the disciples, without wasting time, before 
you die, be born in something higher. Stating one is born there, another 
there.*2) The Teaching’s origin is the Blessed One, its lead is from the Blessed 
One, and its refuge is the Blessed One. Good that the meaning occurs to the 
Blessed One.We, bhikkhus, hearing it from the Blessed One, will bear it in mind. 
Anuruddha, the Thus Gone One tells the disciples, without wasting time before 
you die, be born in something higher. Telling them one is born there, another 
there. Not to deceive people, not for prattling, and not for gain honour or fame 
and not thinking may the people know me thus. Yet, Anuruddha, there are sons of 
clansmen who are born in faith and are pleased, to hear it. Hearing it they 
would arouse interest and direct their minds to that and it would be for their 
good for a long time. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Here, Anuruddha, a 
bhikkhu hears, the venerable bhikkhu of this name has passed away, and the 
Blessed One has declared that he is enlightened. Now this venerable bhikkhu 
happens to be a person seen by that bhikkhu, or not seen by him. He hears, these 
were the virtues of the venerable bhikkhu, these, his thoughts, such his wisdom, 
he developed these abidings and was released. So this bhikkhu recollects that

mind to it. Anuruddha, in this manner too there is a pleasant abiding to a
