<P><B>(20) The Discursively Thinking Mind.</B></CENTER>
<P>I heard thus. 
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapinddika 
in Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from 
there."Bhikkhus, by the bhikkhu developing the mind five things should be 
attended to from time to time. What five:The bhikkhu attending to a certain sign 
if evil demeritorious thoughts arise conductive to interest, anger and delusion, 
he should change that sign and attend to some other sign conductive to merit, 
then those signs conductive to interest, anger and delusion fade, and the mind 
settles and comes to a single point. Like a clever carpenter or his apprentice 
would get rid of a coarse peg with the help of a fine peg. In the same manner 
the bhikkhu attending to a certain sign, if evil demeritorious thoughts arise 
conductive to interest, anger and delusion, he should change that sign and 
attend to some other sign conductive to merit, then those signs conductive to 
interest, anger and delusion fade, the mind settles and comes to a single 
point.. . 
<P>Even when the bhikkhu has changed the sign and attended some other sign, if 
evil demeritorious thoughts arise conductive to interest, anger and delusion, 
the bhikkhu should examine the dangers of those thoughts.These thoughts of mine 
are evil, faulty and bring unpleasant results. When the dangers of those 
thoughts are examined those evil demeritorious thoughts conductive to interest, 
anger and delusion fade. With their fading the mind settles and comes to a sigle 
point. Like a woman, a man, a child or youth fond of adornment would loathe and 
would be disgusted when the carcase of a snake, dog or a human corpse was 
wrapped round the neck. In the same manner when the bhikkhu has changed the sign 
and attended some other sign, if evil demeritorious thoughts arise conductive to 
interest, anger and delusion, the bhikkhu should examine the dangers of those 
thoughts. These thoughts of mine are evil, loathesome, faulty and bring 
unpleasant results. When the dangers of those thoughts are examined, those evil 
demeritorious thoughts conductive to interest, anger and delusion fade. With 
their fading the mind settles and comes to a single point. 
<P>Even when the bhikkhu has examined the dangers of those evil demeritorious 
thoughts conductive to interest, anger and delusion, if those evil demeritorious 
thoughts conducive to interest, anger and delusion arise, he should not attend 
to them. When those evil demeritorious thoughts conductive to interest, anger 
and delusion are not attended, they fade. With their fading the mind settles and 
comes to a single point. Like a man who would not like to see forms, that come 
to the purview would either close his eyes or look away. In the same manner when 
the bhikkhu has examined the dangers of those evil demeritorious thoughts 
conductive to interest, anger and delusion, if evil demeritorious thoughts 
conductive to interest, anger and delusion arise, he should not attend to them. 
When those evil demeritorious thoughts conductive to interest, anger and 
delusion are not attended, they fade. With their fading the mind settles and 
comes to a single point. 
<P>Even when the bhikkhu did not attend to those evil demeritorious thoughts 
conductive to interest, anger and delusion, if these evil demeritorious thoughts 
conductive to interest, anger and delusion arise, he should attend to appeasing 
the whole intentional thought process. When attending to appeassing the whole 
intentional thought process, those evil demeritorious thoughts conductive to 
interest, anger and delusion fade. With their fading the mind settles and comes 
to a single point. Like it would occur to a man walking fast: why should I walk 
fast, what if I stand. Then he would stand. Standing it would occur to him: Why 
should I stand, what if I sit. Then he would sit. Sitting it would occur to him: 
Why should I sit, what if I lie.Thus abandoning the more coarse posture, would 
maintain the finer posture. In the same manner when attending to appeasing the 
whole intentional thought process, those evil demeritorious thoughts conductive 
to interest, anger and delusion fade. With their fading the mind settles and 
comes to a single point. . 
<P>Even when attending to appeasing the whole intentional thought process, those 
evil demeritorious thoughts conductive to interest, anger and delusion arise, 
the bhikkhu should press the upper jaw on the lower jaw and pushing the tongue 
on the palate should subdue and burn out those evil demeritorious thoughts 
conductive to interest, anger and delusion. Then those evil demeritorious 
thoughts conductive to interest, anger and delusion fade. With their fading the 
mind settles and comes to a single point. Like a strong man taking a weaker one 
by the head or body would press him and trouble him. In the same manner the 
bhikkhu should press the upper jaw on the lower jaw and pushing the tongue on 
the palate should subdue and burn out those evil demeritorious thoughts 
conductive to interest, anger and delusion. Then those evil demeritorious 
thoughts conductive to interest, anger and delusion fade. With their fading the 
mind settles and comes to one point. 
<P>Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu attending to a certain sign, if evil demeritorious 
thoughts conductive to interest, anger and delusion arise, he attends to another 
sign conductive to merit, those evil demeritorious thoughts conductive to 
interest, anger and delusion fade. With their fading the mind settles and comes 
to one point . 
<P>When attending to the danger of those evil demeritorious thoughts conductive 
to interest, anger and delusion, those evil demeritorious thoughts conductive to 
interest, anger and delusion fade. With their fading the mind settles and comes 
to one point.:When not attending to those evil demeritorious thoughts conductive 
to interest, anger and delusion, those evil demeritorious thoughts conductive to 
interest, anger and delusion fade. With their fading the mind settles and comes 
to one point: When attending to appeasing the whole intentional thought process, 
these evil demeritorious thoughts conductive to interest, anger and delusion 
fade. With their fading the mind settles and comes to one point, The bhikkhu 
pressing the lower jaw with the upper jaw and pushing the tongue on the palate 
would subdue and burn out those evil demeritorious thoughts conductive to 
interest, anger and delusion. Then those evil demeritorious thoughts conductive 
to interest, anger and delusion fade. With their fading the mind settles and 
comes to one point. Bhikkhus, this is called the bhikkhu is master over thought 
processes..Whatever thought he wants to think, that he thinks, whatever thought 
he does not want to think, that he does not think He puts an end to craving , 
dispels the bonds and rightfully overcoming measuring makes an end of 
unpleasantness. . 
<P>The Blessed One said thus, and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the 
Blessed One.
