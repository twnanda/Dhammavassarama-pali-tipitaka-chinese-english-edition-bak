<P class=MsoNormal>I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One was touring the 
country of Anguttaraapa with a large community of bhikkhus, about one thousand 
two hundred and fifty and entered a hamlet named Aapana. The matted hair ascetic 
Keniya heard “The good recluse Gotama, son of the Saakyas touring the country of 
Anguttaraapa with a large community of bhikkhus, about one thousand two hundred 
and fifty bhikkhus have come to the hamlet Aapana. Of him, fame has spread, he 
is blessed, all knowing, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, knows of 
the worlds, is incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, Teacher of gods and men, 
enlightened and blessed. He preaches to the world together with its gods Maaras, 
Brahmaas, the community of recluses and brahmins and gods and men, that Teaching 
by himself known and realized. That Teaching is good at the beginning, in the 
middle and the end. Is full of meaning even in the letter and it explains the 
complete and pure holy life. It is good to see such worthy ones.” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then the matted hair 
ascetic Keniya approached the Blessed One, exchanged friendly greetings and sat 
on a side. The Blessed One addressed the matted hair ascetic instructing, 
advising inciting and making his heart light. The matted hair ascetic Keniya, 
instructed, advised, incited and made light hearted by the Blessed One said 
thus:”May the Blessed One accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the 
community of bhikkhus”. When this was said the Blessed One said: “O! Keniya, the 
community of bhikkhus is too large about one thousand two hundred and fifty, are 
the brahmins pleased about this. For the second time Keniya said: “O! Gotama, 
even if there are one thousand two hundred and fiftybhikkhus, the brahmins are 
pleased. May the Blessed One accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the 
community of bhikkhus.” For the second time the Blessed One said:”O! keniya, 
there are about one thousand two hundred and fifty bhikkhus, are the brahmins 
pleased about this?” For the third time Keniya said: “O! Gotama, whatever the 
number of bhikkhus, even if, one thousand two hundred and fifty bhikkhus, the 
brahmins are pleased, may the Blessed One accept tomorrow’s meal from me, 
together with the community of bhikkhus.” The Blessed One accepted in silence. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then Keniya the matted 
hair ascetic knew that the Blessed One had accepted, got up from his seat, went 
to his hermitage, addressed his friends and blood relations: “Good sirs, listen, 
I have invited<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>the recluse Gotama for 
tomorrow’s meal together with the community of bhikkhus, whatever work there is 
to be done, do them for me.” They accepted, Keniya the matted hair ascetic’s 
request and some of them dug furnaces, others axed wood. Some washed vessels, 
placed water vessels and some arranged seats. 
<P class=MsoNormal>The matted hair ascetic Keniya himself arranged the circular 
hall 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>At that time the 
brahmin Sela lived in Aapana perfect in the three Vedas, learned in the rites 
and rituals as officiating priest, learned in the phonology and etymology of 
words and the fivefold history in words and grammar, and learned in tracing the 
marks of a Great Man. And he taught these to three hundred young men orally. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>At that time Keniya 
the matted hair ascetic was friendly with the brahmin Sela. The brahmin Sela 
accompanied by the three hundred young men, walking and wandering for exercise 
turned towards the hermitage of the matted hair ascetic.He saw the matted hair 
ascetics at work in the hermitage of Keniya, some digging furnaces, others axing 
wood to light fire, washing vessels, placing water vessels others arranging 
seats and Keniya the matted hair ascetic himself arranging the circular hall. He 
said to Keniya. “Keniya, will there be a woman brought here, or one given away, 
or will there be a great sacrifice, or is Seniya Bimbisaara the king of Magadha 
invited for tomorrow’s meal together with his army?.” “Sela, to me there would 
not be, a woman brought nor given away, Seniya Bimbisaara the king of Magadha is 
not invited for tomorrow’s meal together with the army. Yet there is a great 
sacrifice for me the recluse Gotama son of the Saakyas, who has gone forth from 
the Saakya clan is touring Anguttaraapa with a large community of bhikkhus has 
come to Aapana. Of him such fame has spread, he is blessed, worthy, all knowing, 
endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, knows the worlds, the 
incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened 
and blessed. I have invited him for tomorrow’s meal together with the community 
of bhikkhus.” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“Does good Keniya say 
enlightened “<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“Good Sela, I say 
enlightened”. “Does, good Keniya say enlightened” “Good Sela, I say 
enlightened.” Then it occurred to the brahmin Sela. “ Even the sound 
‘Enlightened’ is rare in the world. The sacred sayings handed down state thirty 
two marks of a Great Man, endowed with which there are only two courses of 
action for the Great Man, not another. If he leads a household life he becomes a 
universal monarch, a righteous king who would rule the four quarters endowed 
with the seven jewels. They are the jewels of the, wheel, elephant, horse, gem, 
woman, householder and advisor. He has more than a thousand sons, clever heroic 
figures who would defeat foreign armies. They would rule the country surrounded 
by the ocean righteously without weapons and punishments. If he leaves the 
household and goes forth, becomes worthy, all knowing rolls the veil away from 
the world.. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“Good Keniya, where 
does the Enlightened One, worthy and all knowing live now”<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Keniya the matted hair ascetic stretched out 
his right hand and said “There! in the deep green forest”. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then the brahmin Sela 
with the three hundred young men approached the Blessed One, while going he 
addressed the young men. “Good sirs, come with little noise raising one foot 
after the other. Blessed Ones are far from noise and live alone like lions. 
While I am talking with the recluse Gotama, do not arouse conversations among 
yourselves and enter when our conversation ends.” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then the brahmin Sela 
approached the Blessed One, exchanged friendly greetings sat on a side, and 
examined the thirty two marks of a Great Man. He saw most of the marks of a 
Great Man, except two. Doubting whether the pudendum was encased and whether the 
tongue was large enough to cover the face, he was dissatisfied. Then it occurred 
to the Blessed One. The brahmin Sela sees most of the marks of a Great Man 
except two, he has doubts, as to whether the pudendum is encased and the tongue 
is large enough to cover 
<P class=MsoNormal>the face. Then the Blessed One performed a psychic exercise 
so that the brahmin Sela could see the Blessed One’s pudendum encased and the 
large tongue. The Blessed One pulled out his tongue and with it, touched both 
ear lobes, nostrils and the whole forehead, and covered up the whole face with 
it. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then it occurred to 
the brahmin Ssla, indeed the recluse Gotama is endowed with all the thirty two 
marks of a Great Man, yet we do not know whether he is enlightened. I have heard 
it said by learned aged brahmins, that Great Men when praised disclose what they 
are, whether they are worthy and enlightened What if I eulogize the recluse 
Gotama with meaningful verses and so he eulogized the Blessed One saying 
<P class=MsoNormal>these verses.

<P class=MsoNormal>548. “O! Blessed One, you are handsome, is pleasant,

<P class=MsoNormal>551. The bhikkhu with good looks is like a statue of gold 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>What is the use of 
your recluse-ship when so handsome?. 
<P class=MsoNormal>552. You should be a universal monarch, the leading

<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]><O:P></O:P>
<P class=MsoNormal>557. The Blessed One said:
