<P><B>(108) III.I.8. Gopakamoggallaanasutta.m</B> 
<P><B>To the brahmin Gopakamoggallaana.</B></CENTER>
<P>I heard thus. 
<P>At a time, soon after the demise of the Blessed One, venerable Aananda lived 
in the squirrels’ sanctury in the bamboo grove in Raajagaha. At that time king 
Ajaatasattu of Magadha the son of the Vedehas was fortifying Raajagaha, fearing 
an assault from king Pajjota. Venerable Aananda wearig robes in the morning, 
taking bowl and robes entered Raajagaha for alms. Then it occurred to venerable 
Aananda, it is too early to go for alms in Raajagaha, what if I approached the 
work place of the brahmin Gopakamoggallaana. Then he approached the work place 
of the brahmin Gopakamoggallaana and approached him. Seeing venerable Aananda 
approaching in the distance he said to venerable Aananda. ‘Come! good Aananda, 
it is after a long time we saw good Aananda. Here the seat is ready, may good 
Aananda, take a seat.’ Venerable Aananda, sat on the prepared seat, and the 
brahmin too sat on a side, taking a low seat and said. ‘Good Aananda, is there a 
single bhikkhu, who endowed with all those things is exactly like good Gotama 
perfect and rightfully enlightened?’ 
<P>‘Brahmin, there is not a single bhikkhu endowed with all those things is 
exactly like the Blessed One perfect and rightfully enlightened. The Blessed One 
is the founder the knower, the declarer of the path, not found, not known and 
not declared before. He is clever and knows the path, his disciples today follow 
that path and are later endowed with those attributes . 
<P>When this conversation was taking place between venerable Aananda and the 
brahmin Gopakamoggallaana, the chief minister of Magadha, the brahmin Vassakaara 
approached the work site and approached the brahmin Gopakamoggallaana to examine 
the work done in Raajagaha. Seeing venerable Aananda, exchanged friendly 
greetings, sat on a side and asked. ‘With what conversation were you here 
venerable sir?’ 
<P>‘Brahmin, this brahmin Gopakamoggallaana asked me is there a single bhikkhu 
who endowed with all those things is exactly like good Gotama perfect and 
rightfully enlightened, and I said. Brahmin, there is not a single bhikkhu 
endowed with all those things, is exactly like the Blessed One perfect and 
rightfully enlightened. The Blessed One is the founder the knower, the declarer 
of the path, not found, not known and not declared before. He is clever and 
knows the path, his disciples today follow that path and are later endowed with 
those attributes. Brahmin, when this conversaton was taking place, you arrived.’ 

<P>‘Good Aananda, is there a bhikkhu appointed by good Gotama, saying after my 
demise your refuge will be this one, whom you follow now?’ 
<P>‘Brahmin, there is not a single bhikkhu appointed by good Gotama, saying, 
after my demise your refuge will be this one, whom we follow now.’ 
<P>‘Good Aananda, is there a single bhikkhu appointed by a majority of elders in 
the Community of bhikkhus, saying this one will be our refuge after the demise 
of the Blessed One?’ 
<P>‘Brahmin, there is not a single bhikkhu appointed by a majority of elders in 
the Community of bhikkhus, saying this one will be our refuge after the demise 
of the Blessed One.’ 
<P>‘Good Aananda, even without a refuge, what is the reason for this unity?’ 
<P>‘Brahmin, we are not without a refuge, there is to us the refuge of the 
Teaching.’ 
<P>‘Good Aananda, when asked, is there a bhikkhu appointed by good Gotama, 
saying after my demise your refuge will be this one, you should follow him. It 
was said, 
<P>Brahmin, there is not a single bhikkhu appointed by good Gotama, saying after 
my demise your refuge will be this one, you should follow him. When asked 
<P>is there a single bhikkhu appointed by a majority of elders in the Community 
of bhikkhus, saying this one will be our refuge after the demise of the Blessed 
One, 
<P>it was said, there is not a single bhikkhu appointed by a majority of elders 
in the Community of bhikkhus, saying this one will be our refuge after the 
demise of the Blessed One. When asked even without a refuge, what is the reason 
for this unity, it was said we are not without a refuge, there is to us the 
refuge of the Teaching. How could these words of venerable Aananda be 
explained?’ 
<P>‘Brahmin, the Blessed One who knows and sees, is perfect and rightfully 
<P>enlightened has declared ten things which arouse confidence in us. Seeing 
these in the Teaching we abide revering and honouring the Teaching. What are the 
ten? 
<P>Brahmin, the bhikkhu becomes virtuous abiding restrained in the higher code 
of rules, practises the right conduct seeing fear in the slightest fault. 
Becomes learned in the Teaching, good at the beginning, in the middle and the 
end, bearing it in the mind treasures it.Sees it full of meanings even in the 
words, explaining the complete and pure holy life. Of such a Teaching he becomes 
learned in words and meanings and penetratingly sees it himself. Becomes 
contented in whatever gains of robes, morsels, dwellings and requisites for the 
ill. Becomes a quick and easy gainer of the four jhaanas, the pure states of the 
mind, enjoyed gratis here and now. Enjoys the various super normal powers such 
as,.one becomes many and many becomes one. Appears and disappears unhindered 
across walls, embankments and rocks, as though going in space. Dives and comes 
up from earth as in water. Walks unbroken on water as though on earth. Sits 
cross legged in space as birds small and large do. Touches and rubs off with the 
hand even moon and sun, so powerful as they are. Thus wields power with the body 
as far as the world of Brahmaa. With the purified heavenly ear beyond human, 
hears sounds both divine and human, far and near. 
<P>Penetratingly sees the minds of others. Knows the mind with greed and without 
greed, the angry mind and the not angry mind, the deluded mind and the not 
deluded mind. Knows the scattered mind and the not scattered mind, the lofty 
mind and the not lofty mind, the mind with a compare and the mind without a 
compare. Knows the concentrated mind and the not concentrated, the released mind 
and the not released mind. Recollects, the manifold previous births, such as one 
birth, two births, ....re ......thus recollects the manifold previous births. 
With the divine eye purified beyond human sees beings appearing and 
disappearing, in inferior and superior states, beautiful and ugly, in hell and 
heaven, knows beings born according to their actions. Destroying desires, the 
mind released and released through wisdom, here and now realizes and 
abides.Brahmin, the Blessed One who knows and sees, is perfect and rightfully 
enlightened has declared these ten things which arouse confidence in us. Seeing 
these in the Teaching we abide revering and honouring the Teaching.. 
<P>Then the chief minister of Magadha, the brahmin Vassakaara addressed the 
general Upananda.’Look general, these good sirs honour and venerate, what should 
be honoured and venerated, why shouldn’t we honour and venerate the good sirs 
and live dependent on them.’ 
<P>Then the chief minister of Magadha said, ‘Where does venerable Aananda abide 
at present?’ 
<P>‘Brahmin, at present I live in the bamboo grove.’ 
<P>‘Good Aananda, in the bamboo grove, is there a pleasant abiding, is it 
noiseless, away from human habitation and suitable for seclusion?’ 
<P>‘Indeed brahmin, in the bamboo grove there is a pleasant abiding, it is 
noiseless, away from human habitation and suitable for seclusion as long as 
those like you protect it.’ 
<P>‘Indeed good Aananda, in the bamboo grove there is a pleasant abiding, it is 
noiseless, away from human habitation and suitable for seclusion, because good 
sirs like you concentrate there. At one time good Gotama was living in the 
peaked hall in the Great forest, in Vesaali and I approached him. At that time 
good Gotama was explaining concentration in various ways. Good Gotama too was 
concentrating at that time. Does good Gotama praise all concentrations?’ 
<P>‘Brahmin, the Blessed One does not praise all concentrations, nor does he 
blame all concentrations. What kind of concentration does he not praise? 
Brahmin, a certain one abides overcome with sensual greed, not knowing the 
escape from arisen sensual greed, he concentrates with it, and wastes, decays 
and muses on account of it.Abides overcome with anger, not knowing the escape 
from arisen anger, he concentrates with it, and wastes, decays and muses on 
account of it.Abides overcome with sloth and torpor, not knowing the escape from 
arisen sloth and torpor, he concentrates with it, and wastes, decays and muses 
on account of it.Abides overcome with restlessness and worry, not knowing the 
escape from arisen restlessness and worry, he concentrates with it, and wastes, 
decays and muses on account of it.Abides overcome with doubts, not knowing the 
escape from arisen doubts, he concentrates with it, and wastes, decays and muses 
on account of it. The Blessed One did not praise such concentration. Brahmin, 
what kind of concentration did the Blessed One praise? Brahmin, the bhikkhu 
secluded from sensual desires and thoughts of demerit, with thoughts and thought 
processes, and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion abides in the first 
jhaana. Overcoming thougts and thought processes and the mind internally 
appeased and settled in one point, and with joy and pleasantness born of 
concentration abides in the second jhaana...re..... in the third 
jhaana,...re.... abides in the fourth jhaana. Brahmin, the Blessed One praises 
such concentration.’ 
<P>‘Good Aananda, good Gotama blames the blameable concentration and praises the 
praiseworthy concentration. Now we will go, there is much work to be done.’ 
<P>‘Brahmin, do so, if you think it is the time to go.’ 
<P>‘The chief minister of Magadha, the brahmin Vassakaara delighted and agreeing 
with the words of venerable Aananda got up from his seat and went away. Soon 
after he had gone away, the brahmin Gopakamoggallaana said. ‘Good Aananda, did 
not reply our question.’ 
<P>‘Yet brahmin, I told you. There is not a single bhikkhu endowed with all 
those things is exactly like the Blessed One perfect and rightfully enlightened. 
The Blessed One is the founder the knower, the declarer of the path, not found, 
not known and not declared before. He is clever and knows the path, his 
disciples today follow that path and are later endowed with those attributes.’
