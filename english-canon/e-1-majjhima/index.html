<h1>The Majjhima Nikaya</h1>
<h3>The Middle Length Discourses</h3>
</center>
<hr>
The Majjhima Nikaya, or "Middle-length Discourses" of the Buddha, is the second of the five <i>nikayas,</i> or collections, in the <A HREF="../sutta.html">Sutta Pitaka</A> of the <A HREF="../index.html">Tipitaka</a>.
<p>
This nikaya consists of 152 discourses by the Buddha and his chief disciples, which together constitute a comprehensive body of teaching concerning all aspects of the Buddha's teachings.
<p>
An excellent modern translation of the complete Majjhima Nikaya is <I>The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha: A New Translation of the Majjhima Nikaya,</I> translated by Bhikkhu &Ntilde;anamoli and Bhikkhu Bodhi (Boston: <A HREF="../../other.html#wisdom">Wisdom Publications</A>, 1995). The Introduction to that book contains an extraordinary synopsis of the Buddha's teachings in general, and of their expression in the Majjhima in particular.
<p>
The sutta summaries appearing below that are marked "[BB]" were adapted from Bhikkhu Bodhi's summaries (in <I>The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha</i>) and used with permission. Those marked "[TB]" were provided by Thanissaro Bhikkhu.

After resolving a disagreement about the classification of feelings, the Buddha enumerates the different kinds of pleasure and joy that beings can experience.

The sutta ends with a warning: anyone who claims enlightenment as license for unrestrained behavior is like someone who fails to follow the doctor's orders after surgery, who knowingly drinks a cup of poison, or who deliberately extends a hand toward a deadly snake.

<p>
<li><A HREF="mn118.html" NAME="mn118">Anapanasati Sutta (MN 118) -- Mindfulness of Breathing</a>.

<p>

<p>
<li><A HREF="mn126.html" NAME="mn126">Bhumija Sutta (MN 126) -- To Bhumija</a>. Does the desire for Awakening get in the way of Awakening? According to this discourse, the question of desiring or not desiring is irrelevant as long as one develops the appropriate qualities that constitute the path to Awakening. The discourse is also very clear on the point that there are right and wrong paths of practice: as a geographer might say, not every river flows to the sea. [TB]
<p>
<li><A HREF="mn131.html" name="mn131">Bhaddekaratta Sutta (MN 131) -- An Auspicious Day</a>. The Buddha emphasizes the urgency of putting forth effort <i>right now</i> to develop insight. Now is all we have, "for -- who knows? -- tomorrow death may come."

<p>
<li><A HREF="mn140.html" NAME="mn140">Dhatu-vibhanga Sutta (MN 140) -- An Analysis of the Properties</a>. A poignant story in which a wanderer, searching for the Buddha, actually meets the Buddha without realizing it. He recognizes his mistake only after the Buddha teaches him a profound discourse on four determinations and the six properties of experience. An excellent illustration of the Buddha's statement, "Whoever sees the Dhamma sees me." [TB]
<p>
<li><A HREF="mn148.html" NAME="mn148">Chachakka Sutta (MN 148) -- The Six Sextets</a>. How the contemplation of the six senses leads to an understanding of not-self and, ultimately, to Awakening.
