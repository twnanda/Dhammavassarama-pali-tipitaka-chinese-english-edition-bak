<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU>I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One 
was living in the squirrel’s sanctuary in the bamboo grove. At that time the 
wandering ascetic Sakuludaayi was living in the monastey of the wandering 
ascetics in the Mora sanctuary with a large gathering of wandering ascetics. 
Then the Blessed One putting on robes in the morning taking bowl and robes 
entered Rajagaha for alms. Then it occurred to the Blessed One, it is too early 
to go for alms in Rajagaha, what if I approach the monastery of the wandering 
ascetics and approach the wandering ascetic Sakuludaayi. Then the Blessed One 
approached the wandering ascetics’ monastery in the Mora sanctuary. At that 
time, the wandering ascetic Sakuludaayi was seated with a large gathering of 
wandering ascetics making much noise engaged in various kinds of childish talk, 
about kings, robbers, chief ministers, the army, fears, fights, eatables, 
drinks, dress, beds, flowers, scents, relations, conveyances, villages, hamlets, 
towns, states, women, heros, gossip at the corner of the street, at the well, 
about those dead and gone, various other talk about the origin of the world and 
ocean, of things that happened and did not happen.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The wandering ascetic Sakuludaayi saw the 
Blessed One coming in the distance and silenced the gathering. ‘Good sirs, make 
less noise, do not make such a noise. The recluse Gotama is coming. These 
venerable ones make little noise, and thinking this gathering makes little noise 
may have thought to approach.’ Then those wandering ascetics became 
silent.&nbsp;</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then the Blessed One approached the wandering 
ascetic Sakuludaayi, and the wandering ascetic Sakuludaayi said to the Blessed 
One ‘Good Gotama, come! It is after a long time that good Gotama thought of 
coming. Sit good Gotama, the seat is ready.’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The 
Blessed One, sat on the prepared seat, and the wandering ascetic too sat on a 
side taking a low seat. The Blessed One, said. ‘With what talk were you seated 
here and what was the topic of conversation?’<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-GB 
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable sir, let that topic be.with which we 
were seated now, a talk from the Blessed One is rare and this talk could be 
heard afterwards. Venerable sir, when I do not attend to this gathering, they 
engage in various childish talk. When I approach them they sit looking at my 
mouth, to hear what I have to say. Whatever the recluse Udayi says, we will 
listen to that. When the Blessed One approached, I and this gathering look at 
the Blessed One’s mouth, whatever the Blessed One says, we will listen to 
that.’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Then Udayi, tell me what I have to teach 
you’.</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable sir, a long time ago, this happened. 
I asked a question about the very beginning, from a recluse, of those 
acknowledging, knowledge and vision constantly and continually established in 
them, while walking, standing, lying or when awake. I asked a question about the 
beginning. When I asked the question, he asked me another question changed the 
topic and showed anger, aversion and displeasure. Venerable sir, then it 
occurred to me it is from the Blessed One this question should be asked, it is 
he who is clever in answering this question’.</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Udaayi, who is this recluse, that acknowledges 
knowledge and vision constantly and continually established, while walking, 
standing, lying or when awake? When asked a question about the beginning, asked 
another question, changed the topic and showed anger, aversion and 
displeasure?’&nbsp;</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable sir, it’s 
Niganthanaataputta.’.</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Udayi, it’s from me, who recollect, one birth, 
two births, --- recollect the manifold previous births with all modes and 
details, that this question about the beginning should have been asked. I could 
have convinced your mind answering a question about the beginning. Udayi, with 
the purified heavenly eye beyond human, I see beings disappearing and appearing 
in unexalted and exalted states, beautiful and ugly, in good and bad states--- I 
know beings according to their actions. The question about the beginning should 
have been asked from me. I could have convinced your mind answering that 
question. Yet Udayi, let alone the beginning and let alone the end, I will teach 
you, when this is, this comes to be: when this, arise this arises. When this is 
not present, this is not, and when this cease, this ceases.’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable sir, I do not understand even my own 
self, it is not possible for me to recollect the manifold previous births with 
all modes and details, such as one birth, two births, ----with all modes and 
details, as the Blessed One does. Venerable sir, now I do not even see a mud 
sprite, how could I see with a purified heavenly eye beyond human, beings 
disappearing and appearing in unexalted and exalted states--- and know beings 
according to their actions, as the Blessed One knows. Yet the Blessed One said 
let alone the beginning and let alone the end, I will give the Teaching – When 
this is, this comes to be, when this arise, this arises. When this is not 
present, this is not, and when this, cease this ceases. It is for my great 
pleasure, yet I do not understand.it. Venerable sir, could my teacher be 
convinced, answering his question?.<SPAN

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN

the most excellent appearance’.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>.‘Udayi, 
your teacher’s view, this is the most excellent appearance, how is that most 
excellent appearance?’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN

more noble and exalted than this most excellent appearance.’</SPAN>

other appearance more noble and exalted than that?’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN

lengthwise?’&nbsp;</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable sir, as there is no other appearance 
more noble and exalted than that, it is said to be the highest appearance, and 
it cannot be pointed out.’<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Udayi, it is something, like this..There is a 
man who says, I desire and love the most beautiful woman in this state: Then he 
is asked. Good man, the most beautiful woman you desire, is she of warrior clan, 
brahmin clan, householder clan or from an out caste clan? When asked, he would 
say No. Then he is asked. Good man, the most beautiful woman you desire and 
love, do you know, of what clan she is? Do you know whether she is tall, short 
or medium? Do you know whether she is dark, fair or brown? Do you know in which 
village, hamlet or town she lives? When asked he says, No. Then he is told, good 
man, do you desire and love someone whom you do not know and have not seen? Then 
he would say. Yes. What do you think Udayi. Doesn’t this talk turn out to be 
stupid talk?’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable sir, when that is so, that man’s 
talk turns out to be stupid talk</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>In 
the same manner Udayi, you say, venerable sir, when there is no other appearance 
more noble and exalted than that, that is the most excellent appearance, and 
that appearance you do not point out.’&nbsp;</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable sir, it is like a lepis gem of good 
birth, with eight facets, well completed and when placed in the orange coloured 
blanket, shines, emits heat and illuminates. The self would be of that 
appearance, healthy after, death.’.&nbsp;</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN

lapis gem of good birth, with eight facets, well completed and placed in the 
orange coloured blanket, and the worms and fire flies in the darkness of the 
night, which give the more excellent appearance in shining, emitting heat and 
illuminating?’.</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN

only pleasant feelings.’<SPAN

Whoever gods be born in the world of only pleasantness, with them he talks and

world, perfect, rightfully enlightened,<SPAN

the worlds the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, 
enlightened and blessed. He proclaims to this world of gods and men, together

Teaching good at the beginning, good in the middle and good in the end, full of 
meaning even in the letters declaring the complete and pure holy life.----re--- 
He having dispelled the five hindrances and making less the finer defilements of 
the mind secludes the mind from sensual desires and thoughts of demerit--- 
attains to the first jhana. Udayi, this is something noble and excellent than 
the earlier on account of which the bhikkhus lead the holy life in my 
dispensation. Again, overcoming thoughts and thought processes and the mind in 
one point internally appeased ---abides in the second jhana---<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>abides in the third jhana—abides in the fourth 
jhana Udayi, this too is something more noble and excellent than the earlier on 
account of which the bhikkhus lead the holy life in my dispensation... When the 
mind is concentrated, pure, free from minor defilements, is malleable workable 
not disturbed, he directs the mind for the knowledge of previous births.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Recollects the manifold previous births, one 
birth, two births, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a 
hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, innumerable 
forward cycles of births, innumerable backward cycles of births, innumerable 
forward and backward cycles of births. There I was of such name, clan, 
disposition, supports, feeling the pleasant and unpleasant feelings, in such a 
life span. Disappearing from there was born there with such name, clan, 
disposition, supports, feeling the pleasant and unpleasant feelings, in such a 
life span, disappearing from there, is born here. Thus with all modes and all 
details manifold previous births are recollected. Udayi, this too is more noble 
and excellent than that on accout of which the bhikkhus lead the holy life in my 
dispensation. When the mind is concentrated, pure, free from minor defilements 
malleable workable not disturbed, he directs the mind for knowledge of the 
disappearing and appearing of beings. With the purified heavenly eye beyond 
human, he sees beings disappearing and appearing unexalted and exalted, 
beautiful and ugly, arising in good and bad states according to their actions. 
These good beings misbehaving by body, speech and mind, blaming noble ones, with 
the wrong view of actions, after death are born in loss, in decrease, in hell. 
As for these good beings, well behaved in body speech and mind, not blaming 
noble ones, with the right view of actions after death are born in heaven. Thus 
with the heavenly eye purified beyond human he sees beings disappearing and 
appearing. . Udayi, this too is more noble and excellent than that on accout of 
which the bhikkhus lead the holy life in my dispensation..When the mind is 
concentrated, pure, free from minor defilements, is malleable workable not 
disturbed, he directs the mind for the destruction of desires. Knows, this is 
unpleasant, this is the arising of unpleasantness, this is the cessation of 
unpleasantness, and this is the path to the cessation of unpleasantness as it 
really is. Knows these are desires, this is the arising of desires, this is the 
cessation of desires and this is the path to the cessation of desires as it 
really is. The mind, which knows and sees thus, is released from sensual 
desires, is releasd from desires ‘to be’ and released from ignorant desires. 
When released, he knows, I’m released, birth is destroyed, the holy life is 
lived, what should be done is done, he knows, there is nothing more to wish. 
Udayi, this too is a thing more noble and excellent than the other on account of 
which the bhikkhus lead the holy life in my Dispensation.’.</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>When this was said, the wandering ascetic 
Sakuludaayi said to the Blessed One. Venerable sir, now I understand. It is as 
though something over turned is reinstalled. Something covered is made manifest. 
As though the path was told to someone who has lost his way. As though an oil 
lamp is lighted for the darkness, so that those who have sight could see forms. 
In various ways the Teaching is explained by the Blessed One. Now I take refuge 
in the Blessed One, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. May I gain 
the going forth and the higher ordination.’&nbsp;</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>When this was said the 
wandering ascetic Sakuludayi’s following said. ‘Good Udaayi do not lead the holy 
life in the dispensation of the recluse Gotama. Good Udaayi, you are a teacher, 
do not become a pupil. It’s like being a cladron and then becoming a spoon in 
it. So good Udayi do not lead the holy life in the dispensation of the recluse 
Gotama.’ Thus the wandering ascetic Sakuludayi’s following prevented him from 
leading the holy life in the dispensation of the Blessed One.<SPAN
