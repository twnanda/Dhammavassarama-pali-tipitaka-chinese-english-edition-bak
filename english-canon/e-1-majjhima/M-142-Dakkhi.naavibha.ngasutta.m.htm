<P>I heard thus. 
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived with the Sakyas in Nigrodha’s monastery in 
Kapilavatthu. Then Mahapajaapati Gotamii taking a set of new clothes approached 
the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said. ‘Venerable sir to make this 
set of clothes for the Blessed One I spun and wove the cloth. May the Blessed 
One accept this set of clothes from me, out of compassion.’ The Blessed One 
said. ’Gotamii, offer it to the Community. When offered to the Community, it 
will be offered to me as well.’ For the second time Mahapajaapati Gotamii said 
‘Venerable sir to make this set of clothes for the Blessed One, I spun and wove 
the cloth. May the Blessed One accept this set of clothes from me, out of 
compassion.’ For the second time the Blessed One said. ’Gotamii, offer it to the 
Community. When offered to the Community, it will be offered to me as well.’ For 
the third time Mahapajaapati Gotamii said ‘Venerable sir to make this set of 
clothes for the Blessed One I spun and wove the cloth. May the Blessed One 
accept this set of clothes from me, out of compassion.’ For the third time the 
Blessed One said. ’Gotamii, offer it to the Community. When offered to the 
Community, it will be offered to me as well.’ 
<P>Hearing this venerable Aananda said to the Blessed One.’Venerable sir, accept 
the set of new clothes from Mahapajaapatii Gotami. She was of much help to you, 
as stepmother, supporter, the one who fed milk, when the Blessed One’s mother 
died. The Blessed One too was of great help to Mahapajaapati Gotamii Come to the 
Blessed One she took refuge in the Enlightenment, in the Teaching and the 
Community. Come to the Blessed One she abstained from, taking the life of living 
things, taking what is not given, misbehaving sexually, telling lies and taking 
intoxicating drinks. Come to the Blessed One Mahapajaapati Gotami got 
established in unwavering faith in Enlightenment, in the Teaching and the 
Community. Come to the Blessed One Mahajaapati Gotamii dispelled doubts about 
the truth of unpleasantness, its arising, its cessation and the path and method 
leading to its cessation. Thus the Blessed One was of great help to 
Mahapajaapati Gotami’ 
<P>‘That is so. Aananda, if a person come to another person, took refuge in the 
Enlightenment, the Teaching and the Community. I say the gratitude he has to 
return to that second person, is not repaid by joining hands in veneration, 
getting up and offering a seat on arrival, exchanging pleasant conversation and 
offering robes, morsel food, dwellings and requisites when ill. Aananda, if a 
person come to another person, abstained, from taking the life of living things, 
taking what is not given, misbehaving sexually, telling lies and taking 
intoxicating drinks. I say the gratitude he has to return to that second person, 
is not repaid by joining hands in veneration, getting up and offering a seat on 
arrival, exchanging pleasant conversation and offering robes, morsel food, 
dwellings and requisites when ill. Aananda, if a person come to another person, 
is established in unwavering faith in the Enlightenment, the Teaching and the 
Community. I say the gratitude he has to return to that second person, is not 
repaid by joining hands in veneration, getting up and offering a seat on 
arrival, exchanging pleasant conversation and offering robes, morsel food, 
dwellings and requisites when ill. Aananda, if a person meeting another person, 
became virtuous. I say the gratitude he has to return to that second person, is 
not repaid by joining hands in veneration, getting up and offering a seat on 
arrival, exchanging pleasant conversation and offering robes, morsel food, 
dwellings and requisites when ill. Aananda, if a person, met another person and 
dispelled his doubts about the Enlightenment, the Teaching and the Community. I 
say the gratitude he has to return to that second person, is not repaid by 
joining hands in veneration, getting up and offering a seat on arrival, 
exchanging pleasant conversation and offering robes, morsel food, dwellings and 
requisites when ill. 
<P>Aananda, there are fourteen personal offerings that could be made. An 
offering made to the Thus Gone One, worthy and rightfully enlightened is the 
first personal offering. An offering made to the silent Enlightened One, is the 
second personal offering. An offering made to a worthy disciple,*1) is the third 
personal offering. An offering made to a person fallen to the method of 
realizing worthiness, *2) is the fourth personal offering. An offering made to a 
non-returner,*3) is the fifth personal offering. An offering made to a person 
fallen to the method of realizing the state of non-returning is the sixth 
personal offering. An offering made to one, returning once,*4) is the seventh 
personal offering. An offering made to a person fallen to the method of 
realizing the state of returning once is the eighth personal offering. An 
offering made to one who has entered the stream of the Teaching is the ninth 
personal offering. An offering made to a person fallen to the method of 
realizing the state of entry into the stream of the Teaching is the tenth 
personal offering. An offering made to one, not greedy and turned away from 
sensuality is the eleventh personal offering. An offering made to an ordinary 
virtuous person is the twelfth personal offering. An offering made to an 
ordinary not virtuous person is the thirteenth personal offering. An offering 
made to an animal is the fourteenth personal offering. . 
<P>Aananda, of an offering made to an animal the results expected are by 
hundreds. Of an offering made to an ordinary not virtuous person the results 
expected are by thousands. Of an offering made to an ordinary virtuous person 
the results expected are by hundred -thousands Of an offering made to a not 
greedy one, turned away from sensuality the results expected are by hundred 
thousand millions. Of an offering made to a person fallen to the method of 
realizing the state of entry into the stream of the Teaching, the results 
expected are innumerable and unlimited. What would be the results for offering a 
gift to a stream entrant of the Teaching? Or one fallen to the method of 
realizing the state of not returning? Or one who would not return? Or one fallen 
to the method of realizing worthiness? Or a worthy disciple of the Thus Gone 
One? Or the silent enlightened One? Or the worthy, rightfully enlightened Thus 
Gone One? 
<P>. Aananda, these seven are the offerings made to the Community. An offering 
to both bhikkhus and bhikkhunis headed by the Blessed One. This is the first 
offering made to the Community. After the demise of the Blessed One, an offering 
made to both bhikkhus and bhikkhunis. This is the second offering made to the 
Community. An offering made to the bhikkhus. This is the third offering to the 
Community. An offering made to the bhikkhunis. This is the fourth offering to 
the Community. An offering made indicating the number of bhikkhus and 
bhikkhunis. This is the fifth offering to the Community. An offering made 
indicating the number of bhikkhus. This is the sixth offering to the Community. 
An offering made indicating the number of bhikkhunis. This is the seventh 
offering to the Community. 
<P>Aananda, in the future there will be the last bhikkhus in the lineage, not 
virtuous with evil things, wearing yellow strings round their necks. I say, even 
the results of an offering made to them on account of the Community is 
innumerable and limitless. I would not tell you, how an offering made to the 
Community is more fruitful than a personal offering. 
<P>Aananda, there are four kinds of purity in an offering. An offering is pure, 
on the side of the donor, not the receiver. An offering is pure, on the side of 
the receiver, not the donor. An offering is neither pure on the side of the 
donor, nor the receiver. An offering is pure, on the side of the donor, as well 
as the receiver. 
<P>Aananda, how is the offering pure, on the side of the donor and not the 
receiver? Here the donor is virtuous with good thoughts, the receiver is not 
virtuous with evil thoughts. Thus the offering is pure, on the side of the donor 
and not the receiver. 
<P>Aananda, how is the offering pure, on the side of the receiver and not the 
donor? Here the receiver is virtuous with good thoughts, the donor is not 
virtuous with evil thoughts. Thus the offering is pure, on the side of the 
receiver and not the donor. 
<P>Aananda, how is the offering neither pure on the side of the donor nor the 
receiver? Here the donor is not virtuous with evil thoughts and the receiver is 
not virtuous with evil thoughts. Thus the offering is neither pure, on the side 
of the donor nor the receiver 
<P>Aananda, how is the offering pure on the side of the donor as well as the 
receiver? Here the donor is virtuous with good thoughts and the receiver is 
virtuous with good thoughts. Thus the offering is pure, on the side of the donor 
as well as the receiver.’ 
<P>The Blessed One said. ‘These are the four kinds of purity and further said 
<P>A virtuous donor offers to one without virtues, things obtained righteously, 
with a pleasant mind, 
<P>Believing the results of actions. That offering is purified on the side of 
the donor. 
<P>A not virtuous donor offers to the virtuous, things not obtained righteously, 
with an unpleasant mind, 
<P>Disbelieving the results of actions. That offering is purified on the side of 
the receiver 
<P>A not virtuous donor offers to the not virtuous, things not obtained 
righteously, with an unpleasant mind, 
<P>Disbelieving the results of actions. That offering is not purified on either 
side. 
<P>A virtuous donor offers to the virtuous, things obtained righteously, with a 
pleasant mind, 
<P>Believing the results of actions. I say, that offering brings great results 
<P>One not greedy offers to those not greedy, things obtained righteously, with 
a pleasant mind, 
<P>Believing the results of actions. I say, that is the highest material 
offering ‘ 
<P>Notes. 1. An offering made to a worthy disciple of the Thus Gone One. 
’Tathaagatasaavake arahante daana.m deti’ A worthy disciple of the Thus Gone One 
has attained the noble state ‘arahatta’ which he aims to attain 
<P>2. A person fallen to the method of realizing 
worthiness.’Arahattaphalasacchikiriyaaya pa.tipanne.’ Before attaining 
worthiness the bhikkhu has to make much effort to attain worthiness. 
<P>3. An offering made to a non-returner. ‘Anaagaamissa daana.m deti.’ A 
non-returner would not be born in the sensual world, to enjoy the five strands 
of sensual pleasures. 
<P>4. An offering made to one returning once. ‘Sakadaagaamissa daana.m deti.’ A 
certain one is born in this world only once, to fulfil a certain aspiration.
