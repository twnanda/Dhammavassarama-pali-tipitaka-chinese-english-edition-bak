<P><B>The five and the three</B></CENTER>
<P>I heard thus. 
<P>At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by 
Anaathapindika in Jet’s grove in Saavatthi. The Blessed One addressed the 
bhikkhus from there. 'Bhikkhus, there are certain recluses and brahmans who 
declare views about the future. Such as there will be a healthy perceptive self 
after death. There will be a healthy non- perceptive self after death. There 
will be a healthy neither perceptive nor non-perceptive self after death. Or 
else the annihilation, destruction and the non existence of the conscience. Or 
else the extinction here and now. These five are sometimes declared as three, as 
there is a healthy self after death, the annihilation, destruction and non 
existence of the conscience and extinction here and now. So these five sometimes 
become three and the three sometimes become five. This is the short exposition 
of the five and the three. 
<P>Bhikkhus, those recluses and brahmins who make known a healthy perceptive 
self after death, declare of a material self or an immaterial self, or of a self 
that is material and immaterial, or else a self that is neither material nor 
immaterial. Or they make known of a healthy self, with a single perception, or 
with various perceptions, or a limited perception, or an unlimited perception, 
healthy after death. A certain one overcoming the object, consciousness, 
declares of limitless imperturbability. The Thus Gone One knows those recluses 
and brahmins who make known a healthy perceptive self after death, declaring of, 
a material self or an immaterial self, or a self that is material and 
immaterial, or else a self that is neither material nor immaterial. Or of those 
that make known of a healthy self, with a single perception, or with various 
perceptions, or a limited perception, or an unlimited perception, healthy after 
death. The Thus Gone One also knows of these perceptions which are incomparably 
pure in the highest order, whether material or immaterial, whether a single 
perception, or various perceptions. He knows of the sphere of nothingness too, 
which is limitlessly imperturbable. Knows that these are compounded and coarse, 
there is a cessation of determinations, knowing the escape from this, the Thus 
Gone One overcame them. 
<P>Bhikkhus, those recluses and brahmins that declare of a non perceptive self 
healthy after death, declare of, a material, or an immaterial, or of a material 
and immaterial, or of a neither material nor immaterial non perceptive self 
healthy after death. Here, bhikkhus, a certain recluse or brahmin who declares a 
perceptive self healthy after death, would revile those recluses and brahmins. 
What is the reason for that? Perception, is an ailment, an abcess, an arrow, 
this non perception is peaceful and exalted. The Thus Gone One knows it. The 
recluses and brahmins who make known of a non-perceptive self healthy after 
death, declare of a material or immaterial, or a material and immaterial, or a 
neither material nor immaterial non-perceptive self healthy after death. 
Bhikkhus, if a recluse or brahmin was to say, I will make known the coming and 
going, disappearing and appearing, growth and development without matter, 
without feelings, without perceptions, without determinations and without 
consciousness, it is not a possibility. That is compounded and coarse, there is 
the cessation of determinations. The Thus Gone knowing the escape overcame it 
<P>Bhikkhus, those recluses or brahmins who make known of a neither perceptive 
nor non-perceptive self healthy after death, declare of a neither perceptive nor 
non perceptive self, of material, or of immaterial, or of material and 
immaterial, or of neither material nor immaterial. Here, bhikkhus, certain 
recluses or brahmins who declare a perceptive self healthy after death and those 
who declare a non-perceptive self healthy after death, revile those recluses and 
brahmins. What is the reason for that? Perception, is an ailment, an abcess, an 
arrow, its delusion this neither peception nor non perception is peaceful and 
exalted. The Thus Gone One knows it. 
<P>Those good recluses and brahmins who make known a neither perceptive nor 
non-perceptive self healthy after death, declare of a neither perceptive nor non 
perceptive self, of matter, or of non matter, or of matter and non matter, or of 
neither matter nor non matter. Bhikkhus, whoever recluses and brahmins make 
known the mental achievements in the spheres of seeing, hearing, smelling, 
tasting and touch with determinations, I declare these achievments as 
destruction. Bhikkhus, I declare these should not be achieved with 
determinations. but come to the end of determinations.*1) This is compounded and 
coarse, there is a cessation of determinations. The Thus Gone One seeing the 
escape, overcame it. 
<P>Bhikkhus, of those recluses and brahmins that make known, the perceptive self 
healthy after death, the non-perceptive self healthy after death and also the 
neither perceptive nor the non-perceptive self healthy after death, certain ones 
revile the recluses and brahmins who declare the annihilation, destruction and 
the non existence of the conscience. What is the reason for that? All these good 
recluses and brahmins declare their attachments hanging upside down, saying we 
will be in the future. As it would occur to a merchant gone to trade, it will be 
to me thus, and I will make gains. Thus, I will be in the future occurs to the 
recluses and brahmins as to the merchant gone to trade. The Thus Gone One knows. 
Those recluses and brahmins, who declare the annihilation, destruction and the 
non existence of the conscience, fear the self loathe it, and run round that 
same self. Like one bound to a wooden or iron post would run round and round the 
post. In the same manner those recluses and brahmins, who declare the 
annihilation, destruction and the non existence of the conscience of the person, 
fear the self, loathe it, and run round that same self. This is compounded and 
coarse, there is a cessation of determinations. The Thus Gone One seeing the 
escape, overcame it. 
<P>Whoever recluses and brahmins declared views about the future did so 
declaring one or the other of the five of these. Bhikkhus, there are recluses 
and brahmins who make known views about the past. They also get included in one 
or the other of these five. There are recluses and brahmins who declare views 
about the past such as the self and the world are eternal, this only is the 
truth, all else is false, the self and the world are not eternal, this only is 
the truth, all else is false, the self and the world are eternal and not 
eternal, this only is the truth, all else is false, the self and the world are 
neither eternal nor non eternal, this only is the truth, all else is false. The 
self and the world are limited, the self and the world are unlimited, the self 
and the world are limited and unlimited, the self and the world are neither 
limited nor unlimited, this only is the truth all else is false. The self and 
the world are of one perception, are of various perceptions, are of a limited 
perception, are of unlimited perception, this only is the truth all else is 
false. The self and the world, is completely pleasant, is completely unpleasant, 
is pleasant and unpleasant, is neither unpleasant nor pleasant, this only is the 
truth all else is false. 
<P>Bhikkhus, those recluses and brahmins who declare the view, the self and the 
world is eternal, this only is the truth, all else is false. That they should by 
themselves realize this pure view without a faith, a liking, hearsay, careful 
thinking and without a pleased view is not a possibility. When there is 
something realized by these good recluses and brahmins by themselves, there 
should be a certain amount of purity in these recluses and brahmins, yet they 
tell of a holding. This is compounded and coarse, there is a cessation of 
determinations. Knowing this the Thus Gone One seeing the escape and overcame 
it. 
<P>Bhikkhus, the recluses and brahmins who bear the view the self and world is 
not eternal, eternal and not eternal, neither eternal nor non eternal, limited, 
unlimited, limited and unlimited, neither limited nor not limited, of one 
perception, of various perceptions, of limited perception, of unlimited 
perception, only pleasant, only unpleasant, pleasant and unpleasant, neither 
unpleasant nor pleasant, this only is the truth, all else is false That they 
should by themselves realize this pure view without a faith, a liking, hearsay, 
careful thinking and without a pleased view is not a possibility. When there is 
something realized by these good recluses and brahmins by themselves, there 
should be a certain amount of purity in these recluses and brahmins, yet they 
tell of a holding. This is compounded and coarse, there is a cessation of 
determinations. Knowing this the Thus Gone One seeing the escape overcame it. 
<P>Bhikkhus, a certain recluse or brahmin gives up views about the past and 
future, not intending any sensual bonds, abides in joy secluded, thinking this 
is peaceful and exalted.This joy born of seclusion ceases and displeasure and 
unpleasantness arises to him. When the displeasure and unpleasantness ceases, 
that joy born of seclusion arises to him. It is like the shade that is dispelled 
with light and the light that is dispelled with the shade. In the same manner a 
certain recluse or brahmin gives up views about the past and future, not 
intending any sensual bonds, abides in joy secluded, thinking this is peaceful 
and exalted.This joy born of seclusion ceases and displeasure and unpleasantness 
arises to him. When the displeasure and unpleasantness ceases, that joy born of 
seclusion arises to him. The Thus Gone One knows, this good recluse or brahmin 
giving up views about the past and views about the future, not intending any 
sensual bonds, abides in joy secluded, thinking this is peaceful and 
exalted.This joy born of seclusion ceases and displeasure and unpleasantness 
arises to him. When the displeasure and unpleasantness ceases, that joy born of 
seclusion arises to him. This is compounded and coarse, there is a cessation of 
determinations. Knowing this the Thus Gone One seeing the escape overcame it 
<P>Bhikkhus, a certain recluse or brahmin gives up views about the past and 
views about the future, not intending any sensual bonds, overcomes the joy of 
seclusion,and abides, in immaterial pleasantness thinking, this abiding in 
immaterial pleasantness, is peaceful and exalted.That immaterial pleasantness 
ceases and the joy of seclusion arises to him. When the joy of seclusion ceases, 
the immaterial pleasantness arises to him. It is like the shade that is 
dispelled with light and the light that is dispelled with the shade. In the same 
manner a certain recluse or brahmin gives up views about the past and future, 
not intending any sensual bonds, overcoming the joy of seclusion, abides in 
immaterial pleasantness thinking the immaterial pleasantness, is peaceful and 
exalted.The immaterial pleasantness ceases and the joy born of seclusion arises 
to him. When the joy born of seclusion fades, immaterial pleasantness arises The 
Thus Gone One knows this good recluse or brahmin giving up views about the past 
and views about the future, not intending any sensual bonds, overcoming the joy 
of seclusion, abides in immaterial pleasantness thinking that immaterial 
pleasantness is peaceful and exalted.That immaterial pleasantness fades and the 
joy of seclusion arises to him. When the joy of seclusion fades the immaterial 
pleasantness arises to him. This is compounded and coarse, there is a cessation 
of determinations. Knowing this the Thus Gone One seeing the escape overcame it. 

<P>Bhikkhus, a certain recluse or brahmin gives up views about the past and 
views about the future, not intending any sensual bonds, overcomes the joy of 
seclusion, overcomes immaterial pleasantness, and abides in neither unpleasant 
nor pleasant feelings thinking, this abiding in neither unpleasant nor pleasant, 
is peaceful and exalted.Those neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings cease and 
the immaterial pleasant feelings arise to him. When the immaterial pleasant 
feelings cease, the neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings arise to him. It is 
like the shade that is dispelled with light and the light that is dispelled with 
the shade. In the same manner a certain recluse or brahmin gives up views about 
the past and views about the future, not intending any sensual bonds, overcoming 
the joy of seclusion, overcoming immaterial pleasant feelings abides in neither 
unpleasant nor pleasant feelings thinking the neither unpleasant nor pleasant 
feelings are peaceful and exalted.The neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings 
cease and immaterial pleasant feelings arise to him. When immaterial pleasant 
feelings fade, neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings arise to him. The Thus 
Gone One knows, this good recluse or brahmin giving up views about the past and 
views about the future, not intending any sensual bonds, overcoming the joy of 
seclusion, and overcoming immaterial pleasant feelings abides in neither 
unpleasant nor pleasant feelings thinking that neither unpleasant nor pleasant 
feelings are peaceful and exalted.Those neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings 
fade and immaterial pleasant feelings arise to him. When immaterial pleasant 
feelings fade neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings arise This is compounded 
and coarse, there is a cessation of determinations. Knowing this the Thus Gone 
One seeing the escape and overcame it 
<P>Bhikkhus, a certain recluse or brahmin gives up views about the past and 
views about the future, not intending any sensual bonds, overcomes the joy of 
seclusion, overcomes immaterial pleasant feelings, and overcomes neither 
unpleasant nor pleasant feelings and thinks I'm appeased, I'm extinguished, I do 
not hold. The Thus Gone One knows, this good recluse or brahmin, giving up views 
about the past and about the future, not intending any sensual bonds, overcoming 
the joy of seclusion, overcoming immaterial pleasant feelings and overcoming 
neither unpleasant not pleasant feelings, thinks I'm appeased, extinguished and 
do not hold. This venerable one is close to extinction, yet is holding to views 
of the past, or views of the future, or holding to the sensual bond, or to the 
joy of seclusion, or to immaterial pleasant feelings, or to neither unpleasant 
not pleasant feelings. That this venerable one says I'm appeased, extinguished 
and not holding, talks of his holdings This is compounded and coarse, there is a 
cessation of determinations. Knowing this the Thus Gone One seeing the escape 
overcame it 
<P>This is the incomparably noble appeasement realized by the Thus Gone One, as 
it really is, of the arising, fading, satisfaction, and the danger of the six 
mental spheres of contact, that is non holding release. The Thus Gone One has 
realized this incomparable noble appeasement, knowing as it really is the 
arising, fading, satisfaction, danger, and the escape from them, and is released 
without holdings. 
<P>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the 
Blessed One. 
<P>Notes. 1.Bhikkhus, whoever recluses or brahmins make known the mental 
achievements in the spheres of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and touch, 
with determinations, I declare these achievements as destruction. Bhikkhus, I 
declare that these should not be achieved with determinations, but come to the 
end of determinations.'Ye keci bhikkhave samanabrahmanaa 
di.t.thasutamutavi~n~naatabbassa sankhaaramattena etassa aayatanassa 
upasampada.m pa~n~naapenti, byasana.m hi eta.m bhikkhave akkhaayati aayatanassa 
upasampadaaya: na h' eta.m bhikkhave, aayatana.m 
sasa.nkhaarasamaapattipattabba.m akkhaayati 
sasa.mkhaaraavasesaasamaapattipattabba.m eta.m bhikkhave aayatana.m akhaayati' 
The achievements of heavenly, eye, ear, nose, taste and other forms of 
clairvoyance like going through space, the Blessed One says should not be 
attained before realizing extinction 'nibbaaana'. It leads to destruction, as it 
did to Venerable Devadatta. They should be attained after attaining extinction. 
Devadatta and some other co-associates of his became conceited about their 
attainments, and could not proceed any further.
