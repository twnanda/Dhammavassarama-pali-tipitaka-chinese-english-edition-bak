<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN-LEFT: 6pt">I heard thus.At one time the Blessed 
One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika, in Jeta’s grove in 
Saavatthi. At that time the only dearly loved son of a certain householder had 
died. On account of that, the householder would neither go for his work nor eat 
any food. He would go to the cemetery again and again crying. ‘Where is my only 
son?’ Eventually he approached the Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side. 
The Blessed One said to him. “Householder, your mental faculties are not 
established, they have undergone a change” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“Venerable sir, how 
could my mental faculties not undergo a change? My dearly loved only son died 
and on account of that I neither go for work, nor take any food. I go to 
the<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>cemetery again and again crying ‘where 
is my only son?’” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“Householder, it is 
so, dear ones bring grief, lament, unpleasantness and distress, the little 
pleasure gained is insignificant ” That householder not pleased with those 
words, and not accepting them, got up and went away. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>At that time, some 
people were gambling close to the place where the Blessed One was living. He 
approached them and said. “Sirs, I approached the Blessed One, worshipped him 
and sat on a side, then the Blessed One said. Householder, your mental faculties 
are not established, they have undergone a change. Then I said, venerable sir, 
how could my mental faculties not undergo a change. My dearly loved only son 
died and on account of that I neither go for work nor eat any food. I go to the 
cemetery again and again crying ‘where is my only son? Then the Blessed One 
said, householder, it is so, dear ones bring grief, lament, unpleasantness and 
distress, the little pleasure gained is insignificant. Sirs, how could dear ones 
bring grief, lament, unpleasantness and distress and how could the pleasure be 
insignificant? Sirs, dear ones bring much pleasantness and the displeasure is 
insignificant. I was not pleased with those words, got up and came a<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>words. ‘Dear ones bring grief, lament, 
unpleasantness and distress the little pleasure gained is insignificant.’ 
Whatever the reply the Blessed One gives, learn it thoroughly and inform me. 
Thus Gone Ones do not talk words that are not truthful. The Brahmin, agreeing to 
do so, approached the Blessed One, exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side 
and said. “Good Gotama, queen Mallika worships the feet of the Blessed One and 
asks, is the Blessed One with few ailments, few troubles and a light living. 
Further queen Mallika asks whether the Blessed One has said these words. ‘Dear 
ones bring grief, lament, unpleasantness and distress and the pleasure gained 
out of them is insignificant?” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“Brahmin, that is so, 
dear ones bring grief, lament, unpleasantness and distress, whatever the<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>pleasure gained, is insignificant.” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“Brahmin, it should be 
known in this manner how dear ones bring grief, lament, unpleasantness and 
distress and how the pleasure gained out of them is insignificant. In the past 
in this same Saavatthi there was a woman, whose mother died. On account of that 
she was deranged in mind and ran from one street to the other and from one 
junction to the next and asked. ‘Did anyone see my mother?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Again it should be 
known thus. In the past in this same Saavatthi there was a woman, whose father 
died…. re….whose<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>brother died, … re …<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>whose sister died, … re … whose son died, ..re… 
whose daughter died, whose husband died On account of that she was deranged in 
mind<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>and ran from one street to the other, 
from one junction to the next and asked. Did anyone see my husband? 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Brahmin, it should be 
known, in this manner too how dear ones bring grief, lament, unpleasantness and 
distress and how the pleasure gained out of them is insignificant. In the past 
in this same Saavatthi, there was a man whose mother died. On account of that he 
was deranged in mind and ran from one street to the other, from one junction to 
the next and asked. ‘Did anyone see my mother?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Again it should be 
known thus. In the past in this same Saavatthi there was a man, whose father 
died…. re….whose brother died, … re …<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>whose sister died, … re … whose son died, ..re… 
whose daughter died, whose wife died On account of that he was deranged in 
mind<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>and ran from one street to the other, 
from one junction to the next and asked. Did anyone see my wife? 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Brahmin, it should be 
known in this manner too how dear ones bring grief, lament, unpleasantness and 
distress and how the pleasure gained out of them is insignificant. In the past 
in this same Saavatthi a certain woman went to live with her husband. Her 
relations wanted to break her away from her husband and give her to another man. 
She told her husband, dear one, my relations want to take me away from you and 
give me to another man, I do not like it. He split that woman in two and killed 
her. Saying we will meet after death. It should be known in this manner, how 
dear ones bring grief, lament, unpleasantness and distress and how the pleasure 
gained out of them is insignificant.” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The Brahmin 
Naalijangha pleased and appreciating the words of the Blessed One getting up 
from his seat, approached queen Mallika, and informed her all the conversation 
that was exchanged. Queen Mallika approached king Pasenadi of Kosala and asked 
him.’Great king is princess Vajiri dear to you?” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“Indeed, Mallika 
princess Vajiri is dear to me.” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“If princess Vajiri 
dies, would grief, lament, unpleasantness and distress arise to you?” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“Mallika if princess 
Vajiri dies, even my life would be in danger, why should not grief, lament, 
unpleasantness and distress arise to me?” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“Great king, it was on 
account of this that it was said dear ones bring grief, lament, unpleasantness 
and distress and the pleasure here is insignificant. Great king, is the warrior 
Waasabha dear to you?” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“Indeed Mallika, the 
warrior Waasabha is dear to me.” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“If the warrior 
Waasabha dies, would grief, lament, unpleasantness and distress arise to you?” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“Mallika, if the 
warrior Waasabha dies, even my life would be in danger, why should not grief, 
lament, unpleasantness and distress arise to me.” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“Great king, it was on 
account of this that the Blessed One who knows and sees, is perfect and 
rightfully enlightened has said. Dear ones bring grief, lament, unpleasantness 
and distress and the pleasure gained from them is insignificant. Great king, is 
the general Widuudabha dear to you?” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“Indeed, Mallika, the 
general Widuudabha is dear to me.” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“If the general 
Widuudabha dies, would grief, lament, unpleasantness and distress arise to 
you?”<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“Mallika, if the 
general Waduudabha dies, even my life would be in danger, why should not grief, 
lament, unpleasantness and distress arise to me?” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“Great king, it was on 
account of this that the Blessed One who knows and sees, is perfect and 
rightfully enlightened has said. Dear ones bring grief, lament, unpleasantness 
and distress and the pleasure gained from them is insignificant. Great king, am 
I dear to you?” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“Indeed, Mallika, you 
are dear to me.” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“If I die would grief, 
lament, unpleasantness and distress arise to you?”<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“Mallika, if you die, 
even my life would be in danger, why should not grief, lament, unpleasantness 
and distress arise to me?.” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“Great king, it was on 
account of this that the Blessed One who knows and sees and is perfect and 
rightfully enlightened has said. Dear ones bring grief, lament, unpleasantness 
and distress and the pleasure gained from them is insignificant. Great king, is 
Kashmire and Kosala dear to you?” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“Indeed, Mallika they 
are dear to me. On account of the two countries Kashmire and Kosala I partake 
Kashmire scents, garlands and anointments.” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“If you lose Kashmire 
and Kosala, would grief, lament, unpleasantness and distress arise to you?” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“Mallika, if I lose 
Kashmire and Kosala, even my life would be in danger, why should not grief, 
lament, unpleasantness and distress arise to me?.” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“Great king, it was on 
account of this that the Blessed One who knows and sees is perfect and 
rightfully enlightened has said. Dear ones bring grief, lament, unpleasantness 
and distress and the pleasure gained from them is insignificant.” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>“Mallika it is 
wonderful and surprising, the Blessed One penetratingly sees. Mallika, pardon 
me.” 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>King Pasenadi of 
Kosala got up from his seat arranged the shawl on his shoulder clasping hands 
towards the direction in which the Blessed One was, uttered a solemn utterance 
three times.’I worship that Blessed One, perfect and rightfully 
enlightened.’”<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>
