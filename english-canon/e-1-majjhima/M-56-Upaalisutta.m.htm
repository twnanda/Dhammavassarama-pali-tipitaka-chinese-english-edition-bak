<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I heard thus.At one time the 
Blessed One lived in Nalanda, in the mango orchard of Pavarika. At that time 
Niganta Nataputta lived in Nalanda with a large gathering of niganthas. 
Dighatapassi the nigantha wandered for alms in Nalanda and returning from the 
alms round after the meal was over approached the Blessed One, exchanged 
friendly greetings and stood on a side. The Blessed One said, ‘Tapassi, there 
are seats, if you wish, sit.’ Then Dighatapassi taking a certain low seat sat 
and the Blessed One said to him:<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Tapassi, how many actions does 
Niganthanaataputta declare for doing demerit and its perpetration?’<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Friend Gotama, it is not the practise to say 
action, it is the practise to say punishment’.’Tapassi, how many punishments 
does Niganthanataputta declare for doing demerit and its perpetration?’ ‘Friend, 
Gotama, Niganthanataputta has declared three punishments for doing demerit and 
its perpetration. They are bodily punishment, verbal punishment and mental 
punishment’. ‘Tapassi, is bodily punishment one, verbal punishment another and 
mental punishment another?’ ‘Friend, Gotama, bodily punishment is one, verbal 
punishment is another and mental punishment is another’. ‘Tapassi these three 
punishments different and dissected, which one does Niganthanataputta declare as 
the most blameworthy? Is it bodily, verbal or mental punishment?’ ‘Friend 
Gotama, of these three punishments that are different and dissected, 
Niganthanataputta declares bodily punishment as the most blameworthy, for doing 
demerit and its perpetration not so much verbal and mental punishments’. ‘Does 
Tapassi say bodily punishment?’ ‘Friend Gotama, I say bodily punishment’. ‘Does 
Tapassi say bodily punishment?’ ‘Friend Gotama, I say bodily punishment’. ‘Does 
Tapassi say bodily punishment?’ ‘Friend Gotama, I say bodily punishment’. Thus 
the Blessed One made Dighatapassi to be established in this argument up to the 
third time. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then Dighatapasssi said to the Blessed One: 
‘Friend Gotama, how many punishments do you declare for doing demerit and its 
perpetration?’ ‘Friend, Tapassi, it is not the practise of the Thus Gone One to 
say punishment, it is the practise to say,<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>action.’‘Friend Gotama, how many actions do you 
declare for doing demerit and its perpetration?’. ‘Tapassi, I declare three 
actions for doing demerit and its perpetration. They are bodily, verbal and 
mental actions.’ ‘Friend, Gotama, is bodily action one, verbal action another 
and mental action another?’ ‘Friend, Gotama, of these three actions that are 
different and dissected, which one does good Gotama declare as most blameworthy? 
Is it bodily, verbal or mental actions?’ ‘Friend Tapassi, of these three 
actions, I declare mental action as the most blameworthy, not so much bodily or 
verbal action.’ ‘Does friend Gotama say mental action?’ ‘Tapassi, I say mental 
action.’ ‘Does friend Gotama say mental action?’ ‘Tapassi, I say, mental 
action.’ ‘Does friend Gotama say, mental action?’ ‘Tapassi, I say, mental 
action.’Thus Dighatapassi made the Blessed One to be established in this 
argument up to the third time, got up from his seat and approached 
Niganthanataputta. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>At that time Niganthanataputta was seated with 
a large gathering of lay followers headed by foolish Upali. Niganthanaataputta 
saw Dighatapassi approaching in the distance and said to him.’Tapassi, from 
where do you come at this time of the day?’ ‘Venerable sir, from the presence of 
the recluse Gotama.’ ‘Was there any dispute between you and the recluse Gotama?’ 
‘There was a dispute, between me and the recluse Gotama.’ ‘Tapassi, what was the 
dispute between you and the recluse Gotama?’ Then the nigantha Dighatapassi 
related all the conversation between himself and the recluse Gotama. When it was 
related, Niganthanataputta said to the nigantha Dighatapassi: ‘Good! Tapassi! 
You are a learned disciple of the Teacher. You have said the right thing to the 
recluse Gotama. What is the vile low mental punishment, when compared to the 
coarse bodily punishment? Bodily punishment is the most blameworthy for doing 
demerit and its perpetration, not so much verbal or mental punishment.’ 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then the householder Upali said to 
Niganthanataputta. ‘Venerable sir, your learned disciple has said the right 
thing to the recluse Gotama. What does the vile low mental punishment matter, 
when compared to the coarse bodily punishment? Bodily punishment is the most 
blameworthy for doing demerit and the perpetration of demerit not so much the 
verbal punishment or the mental punishment. Venerable sir now, I will arouse a 
dispute with the recluse Gotama. If the recluse Gotama is firm in what good sir 
Dighatapassi had made him to establish himself. Like a strong man holding a lamb 
by its furs would pull it and drag it about. Like a strong brewer of liqueur 
would rinse a huge crater in a deep pond and shake it about taking it by the 
ears. In the same manner we would pull and drag about the recluse Gotama drawing 
him to a dispute. Like an elephant of sixty cubits in a deep pond would enjoy 
the game of washing hemp. We would enjoy the game of washing hemp with the 
recluse Gotama. Venerable sir, now we will go to dispute this, with the recluse 
Gotama.’ ‘Go, householder, and arouse this dispute with the recluse Gotama, 
either I should go and dispute it, or you or good Dighatapasssi should do 
it.’&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The niganta Dighatapassi said, to 
Niganthanataputta. ‘Venerable sir, I do not like the householder Upaali going to 
dispute this with the recluse Gotama. He is crafty and knows how to entice the 
disciples of other sects’. ‘It is not possible Tapassi, that the householder 
Upali should become the disciple of the recluse Gotama. It is possible that the 
recluse Gotama should become a disciple of the householder Upali. Either I 
should go to dispute this, or the householder Upali or the nigantha 
Diighatapassi should go. The second, and up to the third time Dighatapassi said 
to Niganthanataputta. Venerable sir, I do not like the householder Upaali, going 
to dispute this with the recluse Gotama. He is crafty and knows how to entice 
the disciples of other sects.’ ‘It is not possible Tapassi, that the householder 
Upali should become the disciple of the recluse Gotama. It is possible that the 
recluse Gotama should become a disciple of the householder Upali. Either I or 
the householder Upali or Dighatapassi, you should go, to dispute this.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Upali the householder said. ’Venerable sir, I 
will go.’ Got up from his seat, worshipped and circumambulated Niganthanatapuuta 
and going to Pavarika’s mango orchard approached the Blessed One, worshipped and 
sat on a side. Then the householder Upali said to the Blessed One: ‘Venerable 
sir, did the nigantha, Dighatapassi come here?’ ‘Householder, the nigantha, 
Dighatapassi came here.’ ‘Venerable sir, was there any conversation with the 
nigantha Dighatapassi?’ ‘There was a conversation with the nigantha, 
Dighatapassi’.’Venerable sir, what was the conversation with the nigantha, 
Dighatapassi?’ The Blessed One related the whole discussion that took place 
between him and the nigantha, Dighataapassi. ‘Good, it is well said to the 
Blessed One by venerable Tapassi. He is a learned disciple of the teacher. What 
is this vile low mental punishment compared to the coarse bodily punishment? The 
bodily punishment is the most blameworthy for doing demerit and for the 
perpetration of demerit, not so much this verbal or mental punishment.’ 
‘Householder, if you establish your self on this truth and take council, there 
will be a conversation.’ ‘Venerable sir, I will be established in the truth and 
take council, there will be a discussion on this.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Householder, there is a nigantha gravely ill, 
rejecting cold water and desiring warm water, he dies not even gaining cold 
water. Where would Niganthanataputta declare he would be born?’ ‘Venerable sir, 
there are gods named mental beings, he will be born with them. What is the 
reason? Because he will die bound by the mind.’.’Householder, reflect carefully 
before you reply. What you said earlier does not agree with what you say now. 
Householder, you have said words like these, I will be established in the truth 
and take council and there will be a discussion on this.’.’Venerable sir, 
whatever the Blessed One says, bodily punishment is the most blameworthy for 
doing demerit and for the perpetration of demerit, verbal punishment and mental 
punishment is nothing in comparison.’ ‘Householder, there is a niganta observing 
all the restraints, and experiencing the results of those restraints. When 
walking to and fro he kills many instects What, are the results that 
Niganthanataputta declares to him?’ ‘When unintentional, venerable sir, 
Niganthanataputta says it is not so blameworthy.’ ‘Householder if it is 
intentional? ‘Then it is the most blameworthy.’ ‘As what does Niganthanataputta 
classify intention?’ ‘Venerable sir, it is classified as mental punishment.’ 
‘Householder, reflect carefully before you reply. What you said earlier does not 
agree with these words. Householder, you have said words like these, I will be 
established in the truth and take council and there will be a discussion on 
this.’ ‘Venerable sir, whatever the Blessed One says, bodily punishment is the 
most blameworthy for doing demerit and for the perpetration of demerit, not 
verbal and mental punishments.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Householder, is Naalandaa densely populated, 
are the people of Naalandaa rich and prosperous?’ ‘Venerable sir, Naalandaa is 
densely populated and the people are rich and prosperous.’ ‘A man with a sword 
in hand would come along saying, in a moment I will make the whole of Naalandaa 
a mass of flesh, a pile of flesh. Would he be able to do it?’ ‘Venerable sir, 
even ten, twenty, thirty, not even forty men would be able to do it, in a 
moment. What could one vile man do?’ ‘Householder, a recluse or a brahmin, 
wielding power over his mind, would come, saying, in one moment I will turn the 
whole of Naalandaa into ashes, with a single defiled intention. Householder, 
would he, wielding power over his mind be able to turn it, into ashes in a 
moment with a single defiled intention?’ ‘Venerable sir, a recluse or brahmin 
wielding power over his mind will turn to ashes ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or 
even fifty such Naalandaas with a single defiled intention. So what to speak of 
a single vile Naalandaa?’ ‘Householder, reflect carefully before you reply, your 
earlier words do not agree with the present word. Householder, you have said 
words like these, I will be established in the truth and take council and there 
will be a discussion on this.’ ‘Venerable sir, whatever the Blessed One says, 
bodily punishment is the most blameworthy for doing demerit and the perpetration 
of demerit, verbal and mental punishments are nothing in comparison.’ 
‘Householder, do you know how these forests, Dandaka, Kalinga, Mejjha and 
Mathanga, turned into forests?’ ‘Venerable sir, I know.’ ‘What have you heard 
about it?’ ‘On account of a sage’s defiled mind, these forests, Dandaka, 
Kalinga, Mejjha and Mathanga have turned into forests, I have heard this.’ 
‘Householder, reflect carefully before you reply, what you said earlier does not 
agree with what you say, now.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Householder, 
you have said words like these, I will be established in the truth and take 
council and there will be a discussion on this.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable sir, even with the first comparison 
I was satisfied, desiring to hear the various explanations of the Blessed One I 
purposely opposed the Blessed One. Now I understand venerable sir. It seems as 
though something. over turned is reinstated. As something covered is made 
manifest. It is like the path is told to someone who had lost his way. It’s as 
though an oil lamp is lighted for the darkness, for those with sight to see 
forms. The Teaching is explained in various ways. Now I take refuge in the 
Blessed One, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. May I be remembered 
as a lay disciple from today until life lasts.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Householder, think again, before you act, 
famous people like you, should think carefully before you act.’ ‘Venerable sir, 
I am very much pleased with these words of the Blessed One.’. ’Householder, 
think again before you act, famous people like you should think carefully before 
you act.’ ‘If the ascetics of another sect gained my disciple-ship, they would 
have carried me about Nalanda saying the householder Upali has come to our 
discipleship, Here the Blessed One says Householder, think again, before you 
act, famous people like you should think carefully before you act. Now I take 
the refuge in the Blessed One, the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus for 
the second time. May I be remembered as a lay disciple who has taken refuge from 
today until life lasts.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Householder since long your clan has been a 
welling spring to the nigantas. I think morsel food should be offered to those 
that come.’ ‘Venerable sir, I am very much pleased with these words of the 
Blessed One. Householder, since long your clan has been a welling spring to the 
nigantas. I think morsel food should be offered to them that come’. ‘Venerable 
sir, I have heard this said about you. Offerings should be given to me only, not 
to others. Offerings should be, to my disciples not to the disciples of other 
sects. Offerings made to my disciples are of great fruit, but not the offerings 
made to others. Here, the Blessed One advises me to make offerings to the 
nigantas. We would know the time to do it. Now I take refuge in the Blessed One, 
the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus for the third time. May I be 
remembered as a lay disciple who has taken refuge from today until life lasts.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then the Blessed One gave the householder Upali 
the gradual Teaching starting with giving gifts, becoming virtuous, about the 
heavenly states, the dangers of sensuality, the vileness of defiling things, and 
benefits of giving up. Then the Blessed One knew that the mind of the 
householder Upali was ready, malleable, free of hindrances, lofty and pleased 
and the Blessed One gave the special message of the Enlightened Ones: 
Unpleasantness, its arising, its cessation and the path to the cessation of 
unpleasantness. Like a pure, clean cloth would take a dye evenly. In that same 
manner, the dustless, stainless eye of the Teaching arose to the householder 
Upali, seated there itself. Whatever rises has the nature of ceasing. The 
householder Upaali, then and there mastered that Teaching, knew and penetrated 
it. Doubts dispelled become self confident attained that state where he did not 
want a teacher, any more, in the Dispensation of the Blessed One*1). He said. 
‘Venerable sir, we will go now, there is much work to be done.’ ‘Househoder, do 
as you think it fit.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then the householder Upali delighted and 
pleased hearing the words of the Blessed One got up from his seat, worshipped 
and ciccumambulated the Blessed One and went home. He addressed his gate- 
keeper: ‘Friend, gate -keeper, from today the door is closed to the nigantas and 
nigantis. It is open to the Blessed One, the bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, lay disciples 
male and female. If any nigantas come, you should tell them: Wait sirs, do not 
enter. From today the householder Upali has gone to the discipleship of the 
recluse Gotama. The door is closed to nigantas and nigantis. The door is open to 
the bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, lay disciples, male and female of the Blessed One. If 
sirs, you want morsel food stand here. It will be brought here.’The gate-keeper 
agreed. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The niganta Diighatapassi heard. The 
householder Upali has become a disciple of the recluse Gotama. He approached 
Niganthanataputta and said:’Venerable sir, I hear that the householder Upali has 
become a disciple of the recluse Gotama’. ‘It is not possible Tapassi, that the 
householder Upali should become the disciple of the recluse Gotama. It is 
possible that the recluse Gotama should become a disciple of the householder 
Upali’ The second time and up to the third time nigantha Dighatapassi said to 
Niganthanaataputta ‘Venerable sir, I hear that the householder Upali has become 
a disciple of the recluse Gotama.’’It is not possible Tapassi, that the 
householder Upali should become the disciple of the recluse Gotama. It is 
possible the recluse Gotama should become a disciple of the householder 
Upali’.’Venerable sir, I will go and see whether the householder Upali has 
become a disciple of the recluse Gotama or not’.’Go Tapassi, know whether the 
householder Upali is a disciple of the recluse gotama or not?’. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then the niganta Dighatapassi approached the 
householder Upali’s house. The gate-keeper saw him coming in the distance, and 
said.‘Wait sir. Do not enter. From today the householder Upali has become a 
disciple of the recluse Gotama. The door is closed to nigantas and nigantis. The 
door is open to the bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, lay disciples, male and female of the 
Blessed One. If sir, you want morsel food stand here. It will be brought here’. 
He saying, ‘friend, I’m not in need of morsel food’, approached 
Niganthanataputta, and said. ‘Venerable sir, it is the truth. The householder 
Upali is a disciple of the recluse Gotama. I told you, venerable sir, that it 
was not suitable, that the householder Upali should dispute this with the 
recluse Gotama. He is crafty and knows how to entice the disciples of other 
sects’. ‘It is not possible Tapassi, that the householder Upali should become 
the disciple of the recluse Gotama. It is possible that the recluse Gotama 
should become a disciple of the householder Upali’. The second and up to the 
third time, nigantha<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Dighatapassi said to 
Niganthanataputta. ‘Venerable sir, I did not like the householder Upali going to 
dispute this with the recluse Gotama. He is crafty and knows how to entice the 
disciples of other sects.’ ‘It is not possible Tapassi, that the householder 
Upali should become the disciple of the recluse Gotama. It is possible that the 
recluse Gotama should become a disciple of the householder Upali. I will now go 
and see whether the householder Upali has gone to the disciple-ship of the 
recluse Gotama or not.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then Niganthanataputta approached the 
householder upali’s house with a large gathering of nigantas. The gate-keeper 
saw them approaching in the distance and said. ‘Wait sirs. Do not enter. From 
today the householder Upali is a disciple of the recluse Gotama. The door is 
closed to nigantas and nigantis. The door is open to the bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, 
lay disciples, male and female of the Blessed One. If sirs, you want morsel food 
stand here. It will be brought here.’ ‘Then friend gate-keeper, approach the 
houeholder Upali and tell him. Niganthanataputta has come with a large gathering 
of nigantas and is standing outside. He likes to meet the householder Upali.’ 
The gate-keeper approached the householder Upali and told him.’Sir, 
Niganthanataputta has come with a large gathering of nigantas and desires to see 
you.’ ‘Then friend, gate-keeper, prepare seats in the middle hall’. The 
gate-keeper prepared seats in the middle hall and informed the householder 
Upali. ‘The seats are ready in the middle hall, and it is time to do as you 
think fit’. Then the householder Upali came to the middle hall and choosing the 
most excellent, seat sat there and told the gate-keeper. ‘Friend gate-keeper, 
approach Niganthanataputta and tell him. Sir, the householder Upali says, if you 
wish to enter, enter.’ Niganthanataputta entered the middle hall with a large 
gathering of nigantas. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The householder Upali in the past, seeing 
Niganthanataputta approaching in the distance would go forward receive him, 
wiping the best seat, with his over shawl would make him sit. That day he sat on 
the best seat and said, to Niganthanaataputta. ‘Sir, seats are prepared if you 
wish, sit’ ’Householder, are you mad? Are you seized? You went saying I<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>will arouse a dispute with the recluse Gotama. 
Has returned as though done a good argument. Householder, it is like a man who 
has gone to remove his testicles, having done it has returned. Like one gone to 
remove his eyes, removing them has returned. In the same manner you went saying 
I will arouse a dispute with the recluse Gotama, has returned as though done a 
good argument. Householder, you are enticed by the recluse Gotama.’

style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Sir, those enticements are good. My dear ones 
and blood relations too should be enticed by those enticements. That will be for 
their good and welfare for a long time. All warriors, all brahmins, all 
householders, all out castes should be enticed by those enticements. That will 
be for their good and welfare for a long time. In this world of gods and men 
together with its Maras, Brahmas, recluses and brahmins and gods and men, all 
should be enticed by those enticements. That will be for their good and welfare, 
for a long time. Then sir, I will give you a comparison, for some wise men 
understand when a comparison is given. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>In the past there was a brahmin, decayed and 
aged. He had a young wife, about to give birth. That young wife said to the 
brahmin: Brahmin, go to the bazaar and buy a young monkey for my son. Then that 
brahmin said wait till you give birth, if you give birth to a boy, I will bring 
him a male monkey and if you give birth to a girl, I will buy a female monkey. 
For the second and up to the third time the young wife said Brahmin, go to the 
bazaar and buy a young monkey for my son. Then that brahmin said wait till you 
give birth, if you give birth to a boy, I will bring him a male monkey and if 
you give birth to a girl, I will buy a female monkey. As the brahmin was very 
much attached to the young wife, he bought a male monkey from the bazaar and 
said. Here is a young monkey for your son. Sir, then that young wife said, to 
the brahmin: Brahmin, go to the dyer’s son Rattapaani with this monkey and get 
it dyed into the colour yellow. The colour should be beaten well, on both sides 
and should be well polished. As the brahmin was very much attached to the young 
wife, he took the monkey, approached the dyer’s son Rattapani and said. Friend 
Rattapani, I desire this monkey dyed into the colour yellow, the colour should 
be well beaten in, on both sides and well polished. Then the dyer’s son said to 
him. Sir, the young monkey, will not tolerate the dyeing, the beating in and the 
polishing. In the same manner sir, the foolish niganta’s dispute is not 
tolerable to the wise. It is not tolerant to those who know. Then sir, in the 
mean time that brahmin brought a pair of new clothes and approaching the dyer’s 
son Rattapani told him: Friend, Rattapani I desire this pair of clothes dyed 
into the colour yellow, with the colour well beaten in on both sides and 
polished. The dyer’s son said. ‘Sir, this pair of new clothes tolerate the 
dyeing, the beating on both sides and the polishing.’ In the same manner, the 
dispute of the perfect rightfully enlightened one is tolerant to the wise and 
not tolerant to the foolish, tolerant to yoking and wise examination.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Householder, all the people together with the 
king know you as a disciple of Niganthanataputta. Whose disciple are you now?’ 
When this was said the householder Upali got up from his seat, arranged his over 
shawl on one shoulder and clasping hands towards where the Blessed One was, and 
said. ‘Listen sir, how I become a disciple of the Blessed One..

for the recluse Gotama?’ ‘Sir, when there is a great heap of flowers of various

when they are suitable why not allude them.’

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">1. Whatever has the natureof 
arising, has the nature of ceasing.The householder Upaali then<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>and there<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>mastered the Teaching, knew<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>and penetrated it. Doubts dispelled became self 
confident and attained that noble state when he did not want a teacher, any more 
in the dispensation of the Blessed One.’<I>Upaalissa gahapatissa tasmi.m yeva

viditadhammo pariyogaalhadhammo tinnavicikicco vigatakatha.mkatho 
vesaa-rajjapatto aparapaccayo satthusaasane</I>’This Pali quotation gives the 
description of a disciple attaining the fruits of the stream entry. So many are 
the good results. He does not need a teacher any more, he becomes confident of 
the path, dispels doubts, penetrates the Teaching, and he loses a lot of his 
unpleasantness. He knows what he should do and what he should not do.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">2.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The non-deluded, the arrow pulled out 
victorious one. ‘dhiirassa vigatamohassa pahinnakhiilassa vijita vijayassa 
‘<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The pulling out of the arrow is the 
giving up of the self view ‘sakkaayaditthi’ It is a peculiar feature, in the 
dispensation of the Blessed One, that until one sees these good results in him, 
he does not see it in a another. When he has attained it he does not think twice 
to applaud the Blessed One. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">3. With the flag put down. 
‘pannaddhajassa‘ Putting down the flag is putting an end to all conceit, ‘maana’ 
is the word for conceit. Conceit bothers someone a lot on his path to 
enlightenment.
