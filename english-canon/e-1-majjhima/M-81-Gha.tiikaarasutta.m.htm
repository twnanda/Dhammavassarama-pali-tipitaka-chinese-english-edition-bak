<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One, was 
going on a tour in the country of Kosala, with a large community of bhikkhus. 
The Blessed One, coming to a certain region, stepped out of the path and smiled. 
Then it occurred to venerable Ananda. The Blessed One does not smile for 
nothing. Why did the Blessed One smile? Then venerable Ananda, arranging his 
robe on one shoulder, clasped his hands towards the Blessed One and said. 
‘Venerable sir, for what reason did the Blessed One smile?’ ‘Ananda, in the past 
in this region, there was a chief village named Vebhalinga. It was very 
prosperous and highly populated. The perfect rightfully enlightened one Kassapa 
abode suppoted on this village. Ananda, the perfect rightfully enlightened one 
Kassapa sat here and adivsed the community of bhikkhus.’<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Venerable Ananda folded the robe in four and 
placing it there said. ‘Then venerable sir, sit here, so that it would be 
partaken by two perfect rightfully enlightened ones.’ The Blessed One sat on it 
and addressed venerable Ananda. ‘In this chief village Vebhalinga there was a 
potter named Ghatikara the chief supporter of the Blessed One, and he had an 
apprentice named Jotipala, a young lovable man. Then the potter Ghatikara 
addressed the young man Jotipala. Friend, Jotipala, let us go and see the 
Blessed One Kassapa, perfect, and rightfully enlightened. It is good to see such 
enlightened ones. Ananda. When this was said, the young man Jotipala said thus: 
Friend, ghatikara, what use comes seeing these monkish shavellings. For the 
second time the potter Ghatikara said Friend, Jotipala, let us go and see the 
Blessed One Kassapa, perfect, and rightfully enlightened. It is good to see such 
enlightened ones.. For the third time the potter Ghatikara said Friend, 
Jotipala, let us go and see the Blessed One Kassapa, perfect, and rightfully 
enlightened. It is good to see such enlightened ones,--- For the third time the 
young man Jotipala said<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Friend, Ghatikara, 
what use comes seeing these monkish shavellings.<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then friend Jotipala, take the soap powder and 
the brush and let’s go to the river, to bathe. To that he agreed and and they 
went to the river to bathe. At the river too the potter Ghatikara addressed the 
young man. Good friend, Jotipala, the Blessed One Kassapa, perfect and 
rightfully enlightened one’s monastery is close by. Let us go and see him, it is 
good to see such enlightened ones. When this was said, again the young man said, 
Friend, Ghatikara, what use comes seeing these monkish shavellings. Ananda, for 
the second and third time the young man Jotipala said this. Then the potter 
Ghatikara took hold of the young man Jotipala by his girdle and said again, 
Friend, Jotipala, let us go to see the Blessed one Kassapa, perfect, and 
rightfully enlightened. It is good to see such enlightened ones. The young man 
released himself from that hold and said, Friend, ghatikara, what use comes 
seeing these monkish shavellings. Then the potter Ghatikara, held the young 
man’s well washed hair and said. Good friend, Jotipala, the Blessed One Kassapa, 
perfect and rightfully enlightened one’s monastery is close by. Let us go and 
see him. It is good to see such enlightened ones. Ananda, then it occurred to 
the young man Jotipala, it is wonderful, how this potter Ghatikara should think 
to touch the washed hair of one of high birth like me. He does not think it 
should not be touched. Then he said. ‘Let it be your wish.’ ‘Good friend, 
Jotipala, let it be your wish too!<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Seeing, 
these perfect rightfully enlightened ones is good.’. .<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN><O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Friend, Ghatikara loosen the hold and let us go 
now. Then Ananda, the potter Ghatikana and the young man Jotipala approached the 
monastery of the perfect, rightfully enlightened one, Kassapa. The potter 
Ghatikara worshipped the Blessed One and sat on a side, the young man Jotipala 
exchanged friendly greetings with the perfect rightfully enlightened Blessed One 
Kassapa and sat on a side. The potter Ghatikara said thus to the perfect, 
rightfully enlightened one Kassapa. ‘Venerable sir, this is my loveable friend 
and assistant, Jotipala, give him the Teaching.’. The Blessed One Kassapa 
perfect, rightfully enlightened one adviced, instructed incited and made the 
hearts light of the young man Jotipala and the potter Ghatikara. Then the two of 
them delighted and pleased got up from their seats, worshipped, circumambulated 
the Blessed One and went away.&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then the young man Jotipala said to the potter 
Ghatikara. ‘Friend, Ghatikara, you hear this Teaching, why don’t you leave the 
household and become a homeless?’<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Friend, Jotipala, don’t you know, that I 
support my mother and father, who are blind and decayed?’<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Then friend, Ghatikara I will leave the 
household and become a homeless.’<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The young man Jotipala and the potter Ghatikara 
approached the Blessed One Kassapa, perfect, rightfully enlightened, worshipped 
and sat on a side. Then the potter Ghatikara said thus to the Blessed One 
Kassapa, perfect rightfully enlightened. ‘Venerable sir, this is my loveable 
friend and assistant Jotipala, give him the going forth.’. The young man 
Jotipala received the going forth and the higher ordination from the Blessed One 
Kassapa, perfect, rightfully enlightened. Ananda, the Blessed One Kassapa, 
perfect rightfully enlightened two weeks after confering the higher ordination 
on the young man Jotipala, went on a tour to Benares, and gradually reached 
Benares.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN><O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then, Ananda, the Blessed One Kassapa, perfect 
rightfully enlightened lived in Benares in the deer park in Isipatana. The king 
of Benares Kiki Kaasiraajaa heard, the Blessed One Kassapa perfect, rightfully 
enlightened has arrived in Benares and he got good conveyances arranged for 
himself, and came to see the Blessed One Kassapa in all royal splendour. 
Covering as far as the conveyances could go, he approached the Blessed One 
Kassapa, perfect rightfully enlightened on foot. Worshipped the Blessed One 
Kassapa, perfect rightfully enlightened and sat on a side. The Blessed One 
Kassapa, perfect rightfully enlightened, advised, instructed, incited and made 
the heart light of the king of Benares, Kiki Kaasiraajaa. Then the delighted and 
pleased king invited the Blessed One Kassapa, perfect rightfully enlightened for 
the next day’s meal together with the community of bhikkhus. The Blessed One 
Kassapa, perfect rightfully enlightened, accepted the invitation in silence. 
Then king Kiki Kaasiraajaa knowing that the Blessed One Kassapa had accepted the 
invitation got up from his seat worshipped and circumambulated the Blessed One 
Kassapa, perfect rightfully enlightened and went away. King Kiki Kaasiraajaa in 
his palace made preparations of various nourishing eatables and drinks, with 
cooked rice with the fine rice of the colour pale yellow with the dark seeds 
picked and informed the Blessed One: Venerable sir, the meal is ready, and it's 
time for the meal.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN><O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then Ananda, the Blessed One Kassapa putting on 
robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes, together with the Community of 
bhikkhus approached the palace of king Kiki Kaasiraajaa and sat on the seats 
prepared. The king served and satisfied the Blessed One Kassapa perfect, 
rightfully enlightened and the community of bhikkhus with his own hands. When 
the meal was over and the bowl was put away. King<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Kiki<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Kaasiraajaa<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>took a low seat and siting said thus to the 
Blessed One: Venerable sir, may the Blessed One accept to spend the rains in 
Benares, I will attend on the Blessed One and the community in this manner. The 
Blessed One Kassapa perfect and rightfully enlightened said I have already 
accepted to spend the rains. King Kiki Kaasiraajaa entreated the Blessed One up 
to the third time and the Blessed One Kassapa said I have already accepted to 
spend the rains. Then king Kiki Kaasiraajaa was displeased and unpleasant, 
thinking, the Blessed One Kassapa perfect rightfully enlightened does not accept 
my invitation. He asked the Blessed One Kassapa.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Venerable sir, is there some other enticing 
supporter? Great king, in the chief village, Vebhalinga there is a potter named 
Ghatikara, he is my chief supporter. To you, great king there is a change in the 
mind* and displeasure thinking the Blessed One Kassapa does not accept my 
invitation to spend the rains in Benares. To the potter Ghatikara, such a thing 
does not happen, and will not happen. Great king, the potter Ghatikara has taken 
refuge in the enlightenment, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. 
Abstains from destroying life, abstains from taking what is not given, abstains 
from misbehaviour in sexuality, abstains from telling lies and abstains from 
intoxicating drinks. Great king, the potter Ghatikara has unwavering faith in 
Enlightenment, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. Is endowed with 
the virtues of the noble ones. Great king, the potter Ghatiara has overcome 
doubts about unpleasantness, about the arising of unpleasantness, about the 
cessation of unpleasantness and the path to the cessation of unpleasantness. 
Great king, the potter Ghatikara takes one meal per day, is virtuous and leads a 
holy life. Great king, he has put aside gold and gems, soverign gold and silver. 
He does not till the ground with a mammoty or with his hand. He puts rats, mice 
and dogs into a box in a friendly manner and puts the left overs of rice, green 
grams or chick peas into it and leaves them saying take away whatever you wish. 
Great king, the potter Ghatikara supports his blind decayed mother and father. 
Great king, the potter Ghatikara has destroyed the five lower bonds to the 
sensual world, is born spontaneously, will not proceed from that world and will 
extinguish in that same birth.<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Great king, at one time I lived in the chief 
village Vebhalinga, then in the morning I put on robes and taking bowl and robes 
approached the mother and father of the potter Ghatikara, and told them. ‘Now, 
where has this good one gone?’ ‘Venerable sir, your supporter has gone out. 
Venerable sir, take the cooked rice from the pot and soups and curries and 
partake of the food.’ ‘Then great king I take the cooked rice from the pot and 
soups and curries, partake of the food and go away. Then, great king, the potter 
Ghatikara would approach his mother and father and would ask: Who is it that 
came, took the rice from the pot and the soups and curries, partaking them, got 
up from the seat and has gone away?’ ‘Dear one, it is the Blessed One Kassapa, 
perfect and rightfully enlightened that took the rice from the pot and the soups 
and curries and partaking them, getting up from the seat has gone away.’ ‘Then 
it occurs to the potter Ghatikara, it is great gain for me, that the Blessed 
One, perfect and rightfully enlightened has taken me into such confidence. That 
pleasant joy would not leave him for two weeks, and for the mother and father it 
lasted one week.&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></SPAN>

village Vebhalinga, at that time my perfumed chamber was leaking, then I 
addressed the bhikkhus: Bhikkhus, do you know,<SPAN

style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>in the potter Ghatikara’s house? Go! bring 
them. Great king, when this was said, the bhikkhus said. ‘Venerable sir, there 
is no grass in the potter Ghatikara’s house. There is his thatched roof of 
grass.’<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then I said, ‘Go bhikkhus, bring 
the grass of the thatched roof of the potter Ghatikara’s house.’ Then the 
bhikkhus removed the grass from the thatched roof of the potter Ghatikara’s

‘Who is it that removes the grass from the roof?’ ‘Sister, it is the bhikkhus, 
the Blessed One perfect rightfully enlightened one’s perfumed chamber is 
leaking.’ ‘Take them! Good ones, you speak good words.’ Then great king, the 
potter Ghatikara coming home approached his mother and father and asked. ‘Who 
removed the grass from the roof?’<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘It’s 
the bhikkhus, dear one, the roof of the perfumed chamber of the Blessed One
