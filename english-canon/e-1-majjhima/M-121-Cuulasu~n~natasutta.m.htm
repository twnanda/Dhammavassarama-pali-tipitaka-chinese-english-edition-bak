and said thus. ‘Venerable sir, once when the Blessed One was living with the 
Sakyas in the hamlet Naagaraka, I heard these acknowledged words from the 
Blessed One himself: “Aananda, at present I abide much in voidity.” How could I, 
hearing it, grasp it thoroughly bear it?’&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></SPAN>
