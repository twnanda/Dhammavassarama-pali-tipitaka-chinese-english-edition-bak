<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Notes.1.Without right 
and true insight, leading the holy life with attachment, it is not possible to 
attain some distinction. ‘Aasa~n ce pi karitvaa ayoniso brahmacariya.m carati, 
abhabbo phalassa adhigamaaya.’ The complete sutta tells us that leading the holy 
life should be with right and true insight. ie The one leading the holy life 
should know for what purpose he is doing so. He should correctly understand the 
acutely unsatisfactory nature of life, and so make an effort to achieve a 
distincton above human. So then he should arouse effort to attain that 
distinction not yet attained.
