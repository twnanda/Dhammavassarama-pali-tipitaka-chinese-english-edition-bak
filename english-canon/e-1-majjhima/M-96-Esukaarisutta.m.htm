<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU>I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One 
was living in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika in Jet’s grove in 
Saavatthi. The Brahmin Esukaari approached the Blessed One, exchanged friendly 
greetings and sat on a side. The Brahmin Esukaari said to the Blessed 
One.’Good<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Gotama, the Brahmins appoint 
services to the Brahmins, warriors, the ordinary people and the low caste. Good 
Gotama the Brahmins appoint services to the Brahmins thus. A Brahmin should 
attend on a Brahmin, or a warrior should attend on a Brahmin, or an ordinary man 
should attend on a Brahmin or else one of low caste, should attend on a Brahmin. 
Brahmins appoint services to the warrior thus. A warrior should attend on a 
warrior, or an ordinary man should attend on a warrior, or else one of low caste 
should attend on a warrior. Brahmins appoint services to the ordinary man thus. 
An ordinary man should attend on an ordinary man, or else one of low caste 
should attend on him. Brahmins appoint services to one of low caste thus. One of 
low caste should attend on a person of low caste. Who else would attend on him? 
Good Gotama, the Brahmins appoint these four kinds of services. What has good 
Gotama to say about that?’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Brahmin, does all the world acknowledge, this 
appointment of services by the Brahmins?’&nbsp;</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Good Gotama, that is not so.’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Brahmin, it is like a poor miserable man 
against his wish was told, here good man, you should eat meat and you should not 
spend money on it. In a likewise manner, without the consent of recluses and 
Brahmins, have appointed these four services. Brahmin, I do not say all services 
should be done. I do not say, all services should not be done. When doing those 
services if there is evil, that service is not good. I say it should not be 
done. When doing those services, if there is no evil, that service is good. I 
say it should be done. Brahmin, the warriors, should be questioned. When serving 
if there is evil and no good, and when serving if there is good and no evil, how 
would you serve in this case? The warriors replying correctly should reply thus. 
When serving if there is evil and no good, I will not do that service. When 
serving if there is good and no evil, I will do that service. Even the Brahmins, 
…re…. the ordinary class and the low caste should be questioned. When serving if 
there is evil and no good, and when serving if there is good and no evil, how 
would you serve in this case? One of low caste replying correctly should reply 
thus. When serving if there is evil and no good, I will not do that service. 
When serving if there is good and no evil, I will do that service. Brahmin, I do 
not see excellence, in a high clan, nor do I see any evil in a high clan. 
Brahmin, I do not see excellence, in noble appearance, nor do I see evil in 
noble appearance. Brahmin, I do not see excellence in great wealth, nor do I see 
evil in great wealth.</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Brahmin, a certain one of high clan may destroy 
living things, take the not given, misbehave in sexuality, tell, lies, malicious 
things, talk roughly and frivolously, may have a coveting mind, angry mind and 
wrong view. Therefore I do not say there is excellence in high birth. A certain 
one of high clan may abstain, from destroying living things, taking, the not 
given, misbehaving in sexuality, telling, lies, malicious things, talking 
roughly and frivolously, may not, covet or bear an angry mind and would have 
right view. Therefore I do not say there is evil in high birth.&nbsp;</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN

of great wealth may destroy living things, take the not given, misbehave in 
sexuality, tell, lies, malicious things, talk roughly and frivolously, may have 
a coveting mind, an angry mind and wrong view. Therefore I do not say there is 
excellence wealth. A certain wealthy one may abstain, from destroying living 
things, taking the not given, misbehaving in sexuality, telling, lies, malicious 
things, talking roughly and frivolously, may not bear, a coveting mind, or angry 
mind and would have right view. Therefore I do not say there is evil in wealth. 
I do not say everything should be followed after, nor do I say everything should 
not be followed after. When following after something, if faith, virtues, 
learnedness, benevolence and wisdom increases, I say that, should be 
followed.’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>When this was said, the Brahmin Esukaari said. 
‘Good Gotama, the Brahmins give four wealths, one wealth for the Brahmins, 
another for the warriors, another for the ordinary and another for the low 
castes. Brahmins offer going for alms, for the Brahmins. Brahmins that belittle 
going for alms, dismiss it, and become cowherds, which is not their wealth. 
Brahmins give the wealth of the bow and arrow to the warriors. Warriors belittle 
the bow and arrow, dismiss it and become cowherds, which is not their wealth. 
Brahmins give agriculture and cattle rearing to the ordinary class. They 
belittle that, dismiss it and become cowherds, which is not their wealth. 
Brahmins give the wealth of the pingo to the low cast to carry, and dismiss 
dirt. They belittle it, dismiss it and become cowherds, which is not their 
wealth. What does good Gotama say about that?’<SPAN

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN

he is reckoned a warrior, with the Brahmins a Brahmin, with the ordinary class, 
one of that class and with the low caste, one of<SPAN

whatever, fire is burnt, on that it is reckoned. So fire that burns from twigs 
is twig fire, fire that burns with grass is grass fire, fire that burns from cow 
dung is cow dung fire. In the same manner, I offer this noble wealth to humans, 
which is beyond this world. Earlier, humans recollect the name and clan of their 
mother and father and are reckoned accordingly. If born with the warriors, he is 
reckoned a warrior, with the Brahmins a Brahmin, with the ordinary class, one of

hundreds of people born in various clans, such as warrior, Brahmin, the ordinary

sirs, it does not matter, whether you are born with the out castes, low castes, 
bamboo weavers, or chariot makers, or the cleaners. Whether born in a trough of
