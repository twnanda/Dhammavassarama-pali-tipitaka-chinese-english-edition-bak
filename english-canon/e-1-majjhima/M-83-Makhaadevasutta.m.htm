<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>I 
heard thus.At one time the Blessed One lived in Mithila in the Makhadeva mango 
orchard. Then the Blessed One when gone to a certain region 
smiled.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">Then it 
occurred to venerable Ananda—The Blessed One does not smile for nothing, why did 
the Blessed One smile. Then venerable Ananda, arranging his robe on one 
shoulder, clasped his hands towards the Blessed One and said. ‘Venerable sir, 
for what reason did the Blessed One smile?’&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN

there was a king named Makhadeva. He was a righteous king and ruled the country 
righteously. On the fourteenth, fifteenth and the eighth days of the waxing moon 
he observed the eight precepts. The brahmin householders of the hamlets, 
villages, and the state too observed the eight precepts on the fourteenth, 
fifteenth and the eighth days of the waxing moon. Then king Makhadeva after the 
lapse of hundreds of years, thousands of years, hundred thousand years addressed 
his barber and said: Good friend, barber, if you see a grey hair on my head tell 
me. The barber agreed. After a very long time, after many hundred thousand 
years, the barber noticed a grey hair on king Makhadeva’s head and said. ‘Me’ 
lord, there is a grey hair evident’. ‘Then, good friend, barber, carefully pick 
that grey hair with a forceps and place it on my palm.’ The barber agreed and 
carefully picking the grey hair with a forceps placed it in king Makhadeva’s 
palm. Then king Makhadeva offering a village as a gift to the barber, addressed 
his eldest son. ‘Dear son, the messengers have appeared to me, there are grey 
hairs on my head. I have finished enjoying human sensual pleasures, now it’s 
time to search heavenly sensual pleasures. Come! Dear prince, rule the country. 
I will shave head and beard, don yellow clothes and go forth, homeless. Dear 
prince, when you too, notice a grey hair on your head, gift a village to the 
barber, hand over the rulership of the country to your eldest son, advising him 
to rule the country righteously. Shave head and beard, don yellow clothes and go 
forth as a homeless. See that my good cycle does not get disturbed and 
disrupted. If in some way, this good cycle is disrupted, by anyone, he will be 
the last man in this age of Great men. Dear prince, because of this I say,

eight precepts was seated in the top most storey of his palace. Then Sakka the 
king of gods, as a strong man would stretch his bent arm or bend his stretched 
arm, disappeared from the gods of thirty three and appeared in front of king 
Nimi and said. ‘Great king it is gain for you that the gods of the thirty three 
should praise you like this: It is great gain to the people of Vidheha that king 
Nimi lives a righteous life and rules righteously observes the eight precepts on

evil reap their results, or the doers of merit reap their results?’ ‘Matali lead 
me along both these courses.’ Ananda, Matali the charioteer led king Nimi to the

not go forth homeless, he broke that good cycle, by that he became the last man 
of that good cycle. Ananda did it occur to you, king Makhadeva would have become 
perfect if that good cycle was broken, it should not be known in that manner. At 
that time I was king Makhadeva, I broke that good cycle, so that the later 
generation would not go on in that cycle. Ananda, that good cycle does not lead 
to turning away, detachment, cssation, appeasement, realisation, enlightenment 
and extinction. It leads up to birth in the world of brahma. Ananda, that good 
cycle is broken by me now. It conduces to, for certain, turning away, 
detachment, cessation, appeasement, realisation, enlightenment and extinction. 
Ananda, how does that good cycle broken by me conduce to, for certain turning 
away, detachment, cessation, appeasement, realisation, enlightenment and 
extinction? It is this same noble eightfold path such as: Right understanding, 
right thoughts, right speech, right actions, right livelihood, right effort, 
right mindfulness and right concentration. Ananda, now, that good cycle is 
broken by me, to conduce to, for certain turning away, detachment, cessation, 
appeasement, realisation, enlightenment and extinction.. Ananda, I tell this, as 
long as you turn this cycle undisrupted, you will not be the last persons in the 
cycle. Ananda, when this cycle of good is disrupted during any period of Great 
Men, they would become the last men in the cycle. Ananda, because of that I tell 
you, do not disrupt this cycle of good and become the last men in this 
cycle.<O:P></O:P></SPAN>
