<P class=MsoBodyText>I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One was living in the 
Aamalaki forest in Catuma. At that time about five hundred bhikkhus had come to 
Catuma headed by venerable Saariputta and venerable Moggallana to see the 
Blessed One.While exchanging friendly greetings, arranging beddings, putting 
away bowls and robes, they made much noise.The Blessed One addressed venerable 
Ananda: ‘Ananda, who are those making such a noise, like fishermen hauling a 
catch of fish’ ‘Venerable sir, about five hundred bhikkhus, headed by Sariputta 
and Moggallana have arrived in Catuma to see the Blessed One. They exchanging 
friendly greetings.with the resident bhikkhus, while arranging beddings, putting 
away bowls and robes are making much noise.Then Ananda, call those bhikkhus in 
my words’.. Venerable Ananda agreed, approached those bhikkhus and said. 
‘Venerable ones, the Teacher calls you.’. Then those bhikkhus, agreeing 
approached the Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side.The Blessed One 
addressed those bhikkhus. ‘Bhikkhus, why do you make such a big noise? It’s like 
fishermen hauling a catch of fish.’ ‘Venerable sir, about five hundred bhikkhus, 
headed by Sariputta and Moggallana have arrived in Catuma to see the Blessed 
One.Exchanging friendly greetings, with the the resident bhikkhus, arranging 
beddings, putting away bowls and robes they are making much noise’. ‘Go! 
Bhikkhus, I turn you away, you should not stay close to me’. Those bhikkhus, 
agreed, worshipped the Blessed One circumambulated the Blessed One and taking 
their bowls and robes left the presence of the Blessed One. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>At that time the 
Sakyas of Catuma had assembled in the assembly hall for some matter. The Sakyas 
of Catuma saw the bhikkhus going away in the distance, approaching them said 
thus:’Venerable Ones, why do you go away?’ ‘The Blessed One has turned out the 
Community of bhikkhus’.’Then venerable ones wait a moment, perhaps I would be 
able to win over the Blessed One’ Then those bhikkhus listened to the words of 
the Sakyas of Catuma and waited. The Sakyas of Catuma approached the Blessed One 
worshipped the Blessed One and sitting on a side said thus: ‘Let, the Blessed 
One take pleasure in the Community of bhikkhus. May, the Blessed One welcome, 
the community of bhikkhus, As the Blessed One showed compassion to the community 
in the past, let compassion be shown now too. Venerable sir, here, there are new 
bhikkhus, those gone forth recently. If they do not get a chance to see the 
Blessed One, they would change their minds. Like small plants that die in want 
of water. Venerable sir, if these bhikkhus recently come to the dispensation do 
not get a chance to see the Blessed One they would change their minds. Like the 
calf that would be disturbed not seeing the mother. Venerable sir, in the same 
manner if these bhikkhus recently come to the dispensation do not get a chance 
to see the Blessed One they would change their minds. May the Blessed One take 
pleasure in the Community of bhikkhus. May the Blessed One welcome the community 
of bhikkhus, As the Blessed One showed compassion to the community<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>in the past, let there be compassion now too.’ 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then Brahma 
Sahampati knowing the Blessed One’s thoughts, as a strong man would stretch his 
bent arm, or bend his stretched arm in that manner disappearing from the world 
of Brahma appeared before the Blessed One. Brahma Sahamapathy arranging his 
shawl on one shoulder and clasping hands towards the Blessed One said ‘Let the 
Blessed One take pleasure in the Community of bhikkhus. May the Blessed One 
welcome the community of bhikkhus, As the Blessed One showed compassion to the 
community in the past, let compassion be shown now too. Venerable sir, here, 
there are new bhikkhus, those gone forth recently. If they do not get a chance 
to see the Blessed One, they would change their minds, like small plants that 
die in want of water. Venerable sir, if these bhikkhus recently come to the 
dispensation do not get a chance to see the Blessed One they would change their 
minds. Like the calf that would be disturbed not seeing the mother. Venerable 
sir, in the same manner if these bhikkhus recently come to the dispensation do 
not get a chance to see the Blessed One they would change their minds. Let the 
Blessed One take pleasure in the Community of bhikkhus. May the Blessed One 
welcome the community of bhikkhus, As the Blessed One showed compassion to the 
community in the past, let compassion be shown now too.’ 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The Sakyas of Catuma 
and Brahma Sahampati could win over the Blessed One with the comparison of the 
plants and the calf. Then venerable Mahamoggallana addressed the bhikkhus: 
‘Friends, get up, take your bowls and robes, it was possible for the Sakyas of 
catuma and Brahma Sahampati to win over the Blessed One with the comparison of 
the plants and the calf’. Those bhikkhus agreeing got up from their seats and 
taking bowls and robes, approached the Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a 
side. Then the Blessed One spoke to venerable Sariputta. ‘Sariputta, when I 
turned away the Community of bhikkhus, what occurred to you?’ ‘Venerable sir, it 
occurred to me. The Blessed One will abide in pleasantness here and now, 
unconcerned, I too will abide in pleasantness here and now, unconcerned. Come! 
Sariputta, you should not arouse such a thought in the future’ Then the Blessed 
One addresssed venerable Mahamoggallana: ‘Moggallana, when I turned away the 
Community of bhikkhus, what occurred to you?’.’Venerable sir, it occurrd to me 
thus: The Blessed One will abide in pleasantness here and now unconcerned, I and 
venerable Sariputta will lead the Community of bhikkhus.’ ‘Good! Moggallana, 
either I or Sariputta and Moggallana should lead the Community of bhikkhus’. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then the Blessed One 
addressed the bhikkhus: ‘Bhikkhus, four fears should be expected by one 
descending to water: What four? Fear of, waves, crocodiles, whirl pools and 
alligators. Bhikkhus, these four fears should be expected by one entering<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>water. In the same manner four fears should be 
expected by a person leaving the household to become a homeless. What four?. The 
fear of waves, fear of crocodiles, fear of whirl<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>pools and fear of alligators. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhikkhus, what is 
the fear of waves? Bhikkhus, a certain son of a clansman out of faith goes forth 
from a household. He becomes a homeless thinking am overcome by birth, decay, 
death, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress.There’s only a 
few who could declare the complete ending of this unpleasantness.The 
co-associates in the holy life, advise him.You should go forward like this, turn 
and go like this, Look on, like this<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>and 
look this and other side like this. Thus you should bend your limbs and stretch 
you limbs.Thus you should bear the three robes and bowl. Then it occurs to him: 
When I was a householder, I advised others, here I have to abide by the advice 
of those who are like my sons and grand sons. Then he gives up robes and becomes 
a layman, out of fear for waves, it is said. Bhikkhus, fear of waves is a 
synonymn for anger and aversion. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhikkhus, what is 
the fear of crocodiles?.Bhikkhus, a certain son of a clansman out of faith goes 
forth from a household. He becomes a homeless thinking, I’m overcome by birth, 
decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress.There are 
only a few who could declare the complete ending of this unpleasantness.The 
co-associates in the holy life, advise him.You should eat this, should not eat 
this.You should partake thus, not partake thus, You should taste thus and not 
taste thus. You should drink thus, and not drink thus. You should drink the 
suitable and avoid the unsuitable. Eat, partake and taste the suitable and avoid 
the unsuitable. You should eat and partake at the right time, avoid eating food 
at untimely hours. Then it occurs to him. When I was a householder, I ate what I 
liked, and not what I disliked, Partook what I liked and not what I disliked. 
Drank what I liked and not what I disliked. I ate, partook, tasted and drank the 
suitable and the unsuitable.I partook, tasted and drank at timely hours and at 
untimely hours.Householders offer us nourishing food and drinks out of faith 
during the day time, when it is not the correct time. I think it is a 
restriction for the mouth. Then he gives up robes and becomes a layman. He gives 
up robes and becomes a layman, out of fear for crocodiles it is said. Crocodiles 
is a<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>synonymn for, greed for food. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhikkhus, what is 
the fear for whirl pools? Bhikkhus, a certain son of a clansman out of faith 
goes forth from a household and becomes a homeless thinking I’m overcome by 
birth, decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress. He 
thinks there’s only a few who could declare the complete ending of this 
unpleasantness. He gone forth thus, putting on robes in the morning, takes bowl 
and robes and goes the alms round, in the village or hamlet controlled in body 
and speech, mindfulness not established and mental faculties not protected. In 
the village he sees a householder or the son of a householder partaking the five 
strands of sensual pleasures, possessed and provided with them. Then it occurs 
to him, when I was a householder, I too partook these five strands of sensual 
pleasures, possessed and provided. I have wealth in my clan, to enjoy these 
sensual pleasures. I could do merit, too. Then he gives up robes and becomes a 
layman. He gives up robes and becomes a layman out of fear for whirlpools, it is 
said. Bhikkhus, fear for whirlpool is a synonymn for, the five strands of 
sensual pleasures. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhikkhus, what is 
the fear for alligaters? .Bhikkhus, a certain son of a clansman out of faith 
goes forth from a household. He becomes a homeless thinking I’m overcome by 
birth, decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress. 
There are only a few who could declare the complete ending of this 
unpleasantness. He gone forth thus, putting on robes in the morning, taking bowl 
and robes goes the alms round, in the village or hamlet controlled in body and 
speech, mindfulness not established and mental faculties not protected. In the 
village he sees a woman not well covered and dressed. Seeing her in that manner, 
greed assails his mind and with a mind assailed by greed he gives up robes and 
becomes a layman.He gives up robes and becomes a<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>layman out of fear for alligaters.Bhikkhus, 
fear for alligaters is a synonymn for women. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhikkhus, these are 
the four fears, that should be expected by a certain person who goes forth as a 
homeless, in this dispensation of the Discipline. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The Blessed One said 
thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One.
