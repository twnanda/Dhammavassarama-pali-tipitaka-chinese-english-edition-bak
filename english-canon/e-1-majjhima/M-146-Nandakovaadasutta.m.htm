<P><B>(5.4.) <I>Nandakovaadasutta.m</I></B> 
<P><B>146. Advice from Venerable Nandaka</B></CENTER>
<P>I heard thus. 
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anathapindika, 
in Jeta’s grove in Savatthi. 
<P>Then Mahapajaapati Gotami approached the Blessed One with about five hundred 
bhikkhunis. They worshipped the Blessed One and stood on a side, and 
Mahapajapati Gotami said to the Blessed One. ‘Venerable sir, advise the 
bhikkhunis, give them a talk on the Teaching.’ 
<P>At that time the elder bhikkhus were advising the bhikkhunis in turns. 
Venerable Nandaka did not like to advise the bhikkhunis when his turn came. The 
Blessed One then addressed venerable Ananda. ‘Ananda. who will advise the 
bhikkhunis today?’ ‘Venerable sir, it is venerable Nandaka’s turn and he does 
not like to advise the bhikkhunis.’ The Blessed One then addressed venerable 
Nandaka. ‘Nandaka, advise the bhikkhunis. Holy man, give the bhikkhunis a talk 
on the Teaching.*1)’ Venerable Nandaka agreed and the next moring, putting on 
robes and taking bowl and robes went the alms round in Savatthi. After 
collecting alms and when the meal was over, approached the monastery of the 
royal women. The bhikkhunis seeing venerable Nandaka approach prepared a seat 
and administered water to wash the feet. Venerable Nandaka sat on the prepared 
seat and washed his feet. The bhikkhunis too worshipped venerable Nandaka and 
sat on a side. Then venerable Nandaka said to those bhikkhunis. ‘Sisters, there 
will be a session of asking questions and replying them. Those who know should 
say, I know and those who do not know should say I do not know. When there is 
doubt or consternation, it should be asked from me, venerable sir, what is the 
meaning of this.’ 
<P>‘Even while hearing this announcement, of venerable Nandaka we are pleased 
and happy.’ 
<P>‘Sisters, is the eye permanent or impermanent?’ 
<P>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’ 
<P>‘That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant?’ 
<P>‘Unpleasant. Venerable sir.’ 
<P>‘In that unpleasant, changing thing, is it suitable to reflect, it’s mine, 
I’m in it, it’s self?’ 
<P>‘Venerable sir, it is not suitable.’ 
<P>‘Sisters, is the ear permanent or impermanent?’ 
<P>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’ 
<P>‘Sisters, is the nose permanent or impermanent?’ 
<P>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’ 
<P>‘Sisters, is the tongue permanent or impermanent?’ 
<P>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’ 
<P>‘Sisters, is the body permanent or impermanent?’ 
<P>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’ 
<P>‘Sisters, is the mind permanent or impermanent?’ 
<P>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’ 
<P>‘That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant?’ 
<P>‘Unpleasant. Venerable sir.’ 
<P>‘In that unpleasant, changing thing, is it suitable to reflect, it’s mine, 
I’m in it, it’s self?’ 
<P>‘Venerable sir, it is not suitable, because even before this, we have seen 
with right wisdom, as it really is that the six internal spheres are 
impermanent. 
<P>‘Good! Sisters, that is so. It is the noble disciple that sees this, as it 
really is with right wisdom 
<P>‘Sisters, are forms permanent or impermanent?’ 
<P>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’ 
<P>‘That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant?’ 
<P>‘Unpleasant. Venerable sir.’ 
<P>‘In that unpleasant, changing thing, is it suitable to reflect, it’s me, I’m 
in it, it’s self?’ 
<P>‘Venerable sir, it is not suitable.’ 
<P>‘Sisters, are sounds permanent or impermanent?’ 
<P>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’ 
<P>‘Sisters, are scents permanent or impermanent?’ 
<P>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’ 
<P>‘Sisters, are tastes permanent or impermanent?’ 
<P>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’ 
<P>‘Sisters, are touches permanent or impermanent?’ 
<P>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’ 
<P>‘Sisters, are thoughts permanent or impermanent?’ 
<P>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’ 
<P>‘That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant?’ 
<P>‘Unpleasant. Venerable sir.’ 
<P>‘In that unpleasant, changing thing, is it suitable to reflect, it’s me, I’m 
in it, it’s self?’ 
<P>‘Venerable sir, it is not suitable, because even before this, we have seen 
with right wisdom, as it really is that the six external spheres are 
impermanent. 
<P>‘Good! Sisters, that is so. It is the noble disciple that sees it, as it 
really is with right wisdom.’ 
<P>‘Sisters, is eye-consciousness permanent or impermanent?’ 
<P>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’ 
<P>‘That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant?’ 
<P>‘Unpleasant. Venerable sir.’ 
<P>‘In that unpleasant, changing thing, is it suitable to reflect, it’s me, I’m 
in it, it’s self?’ 
<P>‘Venerable sir, it is not suitable.’ 
<P>‘Sisters, is ear consciousness permanent or impermanent?’ 
<P>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’ 
<P>‘Sisters, is nose consciousness permanent or impermanent?’ 
<P>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’ 
<P>‘Sisters, is tongue consciousness permanent or impermanent?’ 
<P>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’ 
<P>‘Sisters, is body consciousness permanent or impermanent?’ 
<P>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’ 
<P>‘Sisters, is mind consciousness permanent or impermanent?’ 
<P>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’ 
<P>‘That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant?’ 
<P>‘Unpleasant. Venerable sir.’ 
<P>‘In that unpleasant, changing thing, is it suitable to reflect, it’s me, I’m 
in it, it’s self?’ 
<P>‘Venerable sir, it is not suitable, because even before this, we have seen 
with right wisdom, as it really is that the six bodies of consciousness are 
impermanent. 
<P>‘Good! Sisters, that is so. It is the noble disciple that sees it, as it 
really is with right wisdom.’ 
<P>‘Sisters, of a burning oil flame, the oil is impermanent, a changing thing. 
The wick is impermanent, a changing thing. The fire is impermanent, a changing 
thing. The flame is impermanent, a changing thing. Sisters, if someone were to 
say, of this burning oil flame, the oil is impermanent, a changing thing. The 
wick is impermanent, a changing thing. The fire is impermanent, a changing 
thing. As for the flame, it’s permanent, eternal a not changing thing. Is that 
said correctly? 
<P>‘Venerable sir, it is not well said, because, of this burning oil flame, the 
oil is impermanent, a changing thing. The wick is impermanent, a changing thing. 
The fire is impermanent, a changing thing. So also the flame, is impermanent, a 
changing thing.’ 
<P>‘Sisters, in the same manner, if someone was to say; my six internal spheres 
are impermanent and whatever pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor 
pleasant feelings experienced on account of the six internal spheres are 
permanent, eternal, not changing things. Is that said correctly?’ 
<P>‘Venerable sir, it is not well said, because, on account of this and other 
reason, there arises this and other feeling and when that reason subsides, the 
respective feeling fades.’ 
<P>‘Good! Sisters, that is so. It is the noble disciple that sees it, as it 
really is with right wisdom.’ 
<P>‘Sisters, of a standing huge tree full of heartwood, the root is impermanent, 
a changing thing. The trunk is impermanent, a changing thing. The branches and 
foliage are impermanent, changing things. The shadow is impermanent, a changing 
thing. Sisters, if someone were to say, of this standing huge tree full of 
heartwood the root is impermanent, a changing thing. The trunk is impermanent, a 
changing thing. The branches and foliage are impermanent, changing things. As 
for its shadow, it’s permanent, eternal a not changing thing. Is that said 
correctly?’ 
<P>‘Venerable sir, it is not well said, because, of this standing huge tree full 
of heartwood the root is impermanent, a changing thing. The trunk is 
impermanent, a changing thing. The branches and foliage are impermanent, 
changing things, so also its shadow is impermanent a changing thing.’ 
<P>‘Sisters, in the same manner, if someone was to say; my six external spheres 
are impermanent and whatever pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor 
pleasant feelings experienced on account of the six external spheres are 
permanent, eternal, not changing things. Sisters, is that said correctly?’ 
<P>‘Venerable sir, it is not well said, because, on account of this and other 
reason there arises this and other feeling and when that reason subsides, the 
respective feeling fades.’ 
<P>‘Good! Sisters, that is so. It is the noble disciple that sees it, as it 
really is with right wisdom.’ 
<P>‘Sisters, a clever butcher or his apprentice would kill a cow with a sharp 
carving knife, and would chop it into small bits without hindering the internal 
flesh or the external skin. He would chop all the internal tissues, veins and 
ligaments, into small bits, as they stand and would put the cow together in the 
outer skin as it was and would say. This is the same cow complete in that same 
skin. Sisters, is that said correctly?’ 
<P>‘Venerable sir, it is not so, because, that clever butcher or his apprentice 
would kill a cow with a sharp carving knife, and would chop it into small bits 
without hindering the internal flesh or the external skin. He would chop all the 
internal tissues, veins and ligaments, into small bits, as they stand and would 
put the cow together in the outer skin as it was and would say. This is the same 
cow complete in that same skin. Yet, that cow is unyoked from the skin.’ 
<P>‘Sisters, this is a comparison to explain the meanings. This is its meaning. 
Internal flesh, is a synonym for the six internal spheres.*2) External skin, is 
a synonym for the six external spheres.*3) Internal tissues, veins and ligaments 
is a synonym for interest and greed. A sharp carving knife is a synonym for the 
noble one’s wisdom. With that noble wisdom the internal impurities, bonds and 
bindings are cut and chopped again and again. 
<P>Sisters, these seven are the enlightenment factors, developing and making 
much of them, the bhikkhu destroying desires*4) releases the mind, releases 
through wisdom,*5) here and now abides by himself knowing and realizing.*6) What 
are the seven? Here, sisters the bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor 
mindfulness, settled in, seclusion, detachment and cessation maturing in 
surrender. Develops the enlightenment factor, examining the Teaching,*7) 
effort,*8) joy,*9) appeasement and equanimity settled in, seclusion, detachment 
and cessation maturing in surrender*10). Sisters, these are the seven 
enlightenment factors, developing and making much of which, the bhikkhu, 
destroying desires releases the mind, releases through wisdom and here and now 
abides knowing by himself and realizing.’ 
<P>Venerable Nandaka advising the bhikkhunis in this manner said. ‘Sisters, go 
now, it’s late.’ And sent them away. 
<P>‘Those bhikkhunis, delighting, hearing the words of venerable Nandaka, got up 
from their seats, worshipped him, going away respectfully with their right sides 
towards venerable Nandaka approached the Blessed One, worshipped the Blessed One 
and kept standing. The Blessed One said. ‘Sisters, go now, it’s late.’ Those 
bhikkhunis worshipped the Blessed One and went away respectfully with their 
right sides towards the Blessed One. When the bhikkhunis had gone away the 
Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus. ’Bhikkhus, Many people seeing the moon on 
the fourteenth day of waxing, do not entertain doubts such as is the moon 
incomplete or not, but that it is incomplete. In the same manner, the bhikkhunis 
are delighted hearing the Teaching, but their aims are not fulfilled. 
<P>Then the Blessed One addressed venerable Nandaka. ‘Therefore, Nandaka, advise 
the bhikkhus, on that same topic again.’ 
<P>Venerable Nandaka agreed, and at the end of that night, the next morning 
putting on robes and taking bowl and robes went the alms round in Savatthi. 
After collecting alms and when the meal was over, approached the monastery of 
the royal women. The bhikkhunis seeing venerable Nandaka approaching,, prepared 
a seat and administered water to wash the feet. Venerable Nandaka sat on the 
prepared seat and washed his feet. The bhikkhunis too worshipped venerable 
Nandaka and sat on a side. Then venerable Nandaka said to those bhikkhunis. 
‘Sisters, there will be a session of asking questions and replying them. Those 
who know should say, I know and those who do not know should say I do not know. 
When there is doubt or consternation, I should be asked, venerable sir, what is

<P>‘Sisters, of a burning oil flame, the oil is impermanent, a changing thing. 
The wick is impermanent, a changing thing. The fire is impermanent, a changing 
thing. The flame is impermanent, a changing thing. Sisters, if someone were to

wick is impermanent, a changing thing. The fire is impermanent, a changing

said correctly? 
<P>‘Venerable sir, it is not well said, because, of this burning oil flame, the 
oil is impermanent, a changing thing. The wick is impermanent, a changing thing. 
The fire is impermanent, a changing thing. So also the flame, is impermanent, a 
changing thing.’ 
<P>‘Sisters, in the same manner, if someone was to say; my six internal spheres

<P>‘Sisters, this is a comparison to explain the meanings. This is its meaning. 
Internal flesh, is a synonym for the six internal spheres.*2) External skin, is

is a synonym for interest and greed. A sharp carving knife is a synonym for the

<P>Sisters, these seven are the enlightenment factors, developing and making

are the seven? Here, sisters the bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor 
mindfulness, settled in, seclusion, detachment, cessation and maturing in 
surrender. Develops the enlightenment factor, examining the Teaching,*7) 
effort,*8) joy, *9) appeasement and the enlightenment factor equanimity settled 
in, seclusion, detachment, and cessation maturing in surrender. Sisters, these 
are the seven enlightenment factors, developing and making much of which, the 
bhikkhu, destroying desires releases the mind, releases through wisdom and here 
and now abides knowing by himself and realizing.’ 
<P>Venerable Nandaka advising the bhikkhunis in this manner said. ‘Sisters, go 
now, it’s late.’ And sent them away. 
<P>The Blessed One, soon after the bhikkhunis had gone away, addressed the 
bhikkhus. ‘Bhikkhus, many people seeing the moon on the fifteenth day of waxing, 
do not entertain doubts such as is the moon incomplete or complete. They know 
that the moon is complete. In the same manner, the bhikkhunis are delighted 
hearing Nandaka’s preaching, and their aims are fulfilled. The least of those 
five hundred bhikkhunis is a stream entrant, not falling from that, is aiming 
extinctlion. 
<P>The Blessed One said that and those bhikkhusdelighted in the words of the 
Blessed One. 
<P>Notes. 1.Holy man, give the bhikkhunis a talk on the Teaching. ‘karohi tva.m 
braahmana, bhikkhunina.m dhammikatha.m’ A holy man is one who has attained 
worthiness, one who has done the dispensation of t he Blessed One. 
<P>2. The six internal spheres ‘channeta.m ajjhattikaana.m aayatanaana.m’ Six 
internal spheres are the spheres of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind. 
<P>3. The six external spheres. ‘channeta.m baahiraana.m aayatanaana.m’ Six 
external spheres are forms, sounds, smells, tastes, touches and ideas. 
<P>4 The bhikkhu destroying desires, ‘bhikkhu aasavaana.m khayaa’ Desire is the 
root cause for a person’s transmigration from one birth to another. To stop this 
transmigration, the bhikkhu has to destroy desires. 
<P>5. Releases of the mind and releases through wisdom. ‘anaasava.m 
cetovimutti.m pa~n~naavimutti.m. The release of the mind is attained when the 
bhikkhu does not desire anything. The desiring starts with a contact at one or 
the other, of a door of mental contact, such as from a sight, sound, scent, 
taste, touch or an idea. To stop desiring the mind should be developed much. 
This is also called the release through knowing here and now. The living worthy 
ones ‘arahantaa’ enjoy this bliss of not being touched by any of the contacts at 
any of the doors of mental contact.Should be something very pleasant. Someone 
released through wisdom does not enjoy this bliss yet, he has read much or heard 
much and knows what it is and he aims to attain that bliss. 
<P>6. Here and now abides by himself knowing and realizing. ‘di.t.th’eva dhamme 
saya.m abhi~n~naa sacchikatvaa upsampajja viharati.’ Here and now means in this 
very life, the bhikkhu by himself knowing realizes that highest aim of a 
Buddhist, that is the worthy state. 
<P>7. The enlightenment factor of examining the Teaching. 
‘dhammavicayasambojjhanga.m bhaaveti,’ This is to consider the complete 
Teaching, not overlooking any minor details, to come to a grand decision, so 
that the ultimate aim could be attained. 
<P>8. The enlightenment factor effort, ‘viriyasambhojjhanga.m bhaaveti.’ This is 
nothing but a mental effort to see that non arisen demerit does not arise, 
arisen demerit is dispelled, non arisen merit is aroused and arisen merit is 
developed and completed to the highest limit. This arisen merits are the 
developed mind such as the fruition of the entry into the stream of the 
Teaching, etcetra. 
<P>9. The enlightenment factor joy. ‘piitisambojjhanga.m bhaaveti.’ This is some 
internal joy on account of complete confidence of the path, and enjoyed only by 
a disciple of the Blessed One. 
<P>10. And the enlightenment factor equanimity settled in seclusion, detachment 
and cessation maturing in surrender. ‘upekhaasambojjha.nga.m bhaaveti 
vivekanissita.m viraaganissita.m nirodhnissita.m vossaggaparinaami.m’ 
<P>Here equanimity is developed, settled in seclusion, detachment and cessation, 
until everything is given up. This amounts to extinctlion. <BR>&nbsp;
