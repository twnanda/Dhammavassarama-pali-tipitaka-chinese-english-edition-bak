<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One lived 
in Raajagaha, in the mango orchard of Jiivaka, the foster son of the prince. 
Jiivaka the foster son of the prince approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat 
on a side and said: ‘I have heard this, venerable sir, that living things are 
killed on account of the recluse Gotama, and he partakes that knowing, it was 
killed on account of him. Venerable sir, those who say, that living things are 
killed on account of the recluse Gotama, and he partakes that, knowing, it was 
killed on account of him, are they saying the rightful words of the Blessed One 
and not blaming the Teaching?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Jeevaka, those who say, that living things are 
killed on account of the recluse Gotama, and he partakes that knowing, because 
it was killed on account of him. They are not my words, and they blame me 
falsely. Jeevaka, I say that on three instances meat should not be partaken, 
when seen, heard or when there is a doubt. I say, that on these three instances 
meat should not be partaken.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>I say, that 
meat could be partaken on three instances, when not seen, not heard and when 
there is no doubt about it. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Jeevaka, the bhikkhu supported by a village or 
hamlet sits pervading one direction with thoughts of loving kindness, and also 
the second, third, fourth, above, below and across, in all circumstances, for 
all purposes, towards all. With that thought developed limitlessly and grown 
great without anger. Then a certain householder or the son of a householder 
approaches and invites him for the next day’s meal. If the bhikkhu desires he 
accepts and at the end of that night, putting on robes and taking bowl and 
robes, approaches the house of that householder or the son of the householder 
and sits on the prepared seat. That householder or his son serves him with the 
nourishing food with his own hands. It does not occur to him. This householder 
should offer me nourishing food in the future too. He partakes that morsel food, 
neither enslaved and<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>swooned, nor guilty. 
Wisely reflecting the danger. Jeevaka, does this bhikkhu think to trouble 
himself, another or both at that moment?’. ‘No, venerable sir, he does not.’ 
‘Jeevaka, isn’t this bhikkhu partaking this food without a blemish?’ ‘He is, 
venerable sir I have heard, that Brahma abides, in loving kindness. I witness it 
in the Blessed One. The Blessed One abides in loving kindness.’ ‘Jeevaka, the 
Thus Gone One has dispelled that greed, hate and delusion, pulled it out with 
the roots, made palm stumps and made them not to grow again. If you say it, on 
account of that, I allow it.’<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable 
sir, I say it, on account of that.’ ‘Jeevaka, the bhikkhu abides supported on a 
certain village or hamlet. He abides pervading one direction with thoughts of 
compassion….With thoughts of intrinsic joy…With equanimity and also the second, 
third, fourth, above, below and across, in all circumstances, for all purposes, 
towards all, equanimity grown great and developed limitlessly<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>without anger. Then a certain householder or 
the son of a householder approaches him and invites him for the next day’s meal. 
If the bhikkhu desires he accepts the invitation. At the end of that night, 
putting on robes and taking bowl and robes, he approaches the house of that 
householder or the son of the householder and sits on the prepared seat. That 
householder serves the bhikkhu with the nourishing food with his own hands. It 
doesn’t occur to him, this householder should offer me nourishing food in the 
future too. He partakes that morsel food, not enslaved, not swooned, and without 
a guilt, wisely reflecting the danger. Jeevaka, does this bhikkhu think to 
trouble himself, another, or trouble both at that moment?’. ‘No, venerable sir, 
he does not.’ ‘Jeevaka, doesn’t this bhikkhu partake this food without a 
blemish?’ ‘Venerable sir, he partakes food without a blemish. .I have heard, 
that Brahma abides in equanimity. I witness it, in the Blessed One. The Blessed 
One, abides in equanimity.’ ‘Jeevaka, the Thus Gone One is not troubled, is 
detached, and not averse to greed, hate and delusion*1), pulled it out with the 
roots, made palm stumps and made not to grow again. If it is said on account of 
that, I allow it.’ ‘Venerable sir, I say it, on account of that.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Jeevaka, who ever destroys living things on 
account of the Thus Gone One or the disciples of the Thus Gone One, accumulate 
much demerit on five instances: If he said, go bring that living thing of such 
name. In this first instance he accumulates much demerit. If that living thing 
is pulled along, tied, with pain at the throat, feeling displeased and 
unpleasant*2). In this second instance he accumulates much demerit. If it was 
said, go kill that animal. In this third instance he accumulates much 
demerit..When killing if that animal feels displeased and unpleasant*2), in this 
fourth instance he accumulates, much demerit. When the Thus Gone One or a 
disciple of the Thus Gone tastes that unsuitabale food*2). In this fifth 
instance he accumulates much demerit. Jeevaka, if anyone destroys the life of a 
living thing on account of the Thus Gone One or a disciple of the Thus Gone One, 
he accumulates much demerit on these five instances.’ When this was said Jeevaka 
the foster son of the prince said; ‘Wonderful venerable sir, the bhikkhus 
partake suitable faultless food. Now I understand venerable sir. It is as though 
something overturned was reinstated. Something covered was made manifest. As 
though the path was told to someone who had lost his way. As though an oil lamp 
was lighted, for those who have sight to see forms. In various ways the Teaching 
is explained. Now I take refuge in the Blessed One, in the Teaching and the 
Community of bhikkhus. May I be remembered as one who has taken refuge from 
today until life lasts.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Notes. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>1 The Thus Gone One is not troubled, is 
detached, and not averse to greed hate and delusion.’yena kho Jeevaka raagena 
yena dosena yena mohena vihesavaa assa,arativaa assa pa.tighavaa assa so raago 
so doso so moho tathaagatassa pahino ucchinnamuulo taalavatthukato anabhaavakato 
aayati.m anuppaadadhammo‘ When equanimity is developed, that person’s nature is 
such, that he is not troubled, is detached and not averse to greed, hate and 
delusion.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>2. The Blessed One shows five instances when it 
is demerit to offer meat to the bhikkhu. Those are when it is seen, heard, or 
known, that such and such an animal is killed. When it is ordered, kill this 
animal. When seen it, being pulled along to be killed. When seen it going along 
sad and unpleasant, and when the Thus Gone One or a disciple of the Thus Gone 
One tastes the unsuitable food. If we understand this correctly, it is feelings 
which matter.The Blessed One’s Teaching is completely based on feelings. 
Unpleasantness-‘dukkha’ is a feeling, and it is for its cessation that the 
Teaching is proclaimed.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>
