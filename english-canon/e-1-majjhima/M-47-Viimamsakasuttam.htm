<P><B>5.7 Viima.msakasutta.m-</B> 
<P><B>(47) The Examination.</B></CENTER>
<P>I heard thus. 
<P>At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by 
Anaathapindika in Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi. Then the Blessed One addressed the 
bhikkhus from there. 
<P>Bhikkhus, by a bhikkhu who could read the thought processes of another, an 
examination of the Thus Gone One should be done. Is he rightfully enlightened or 
not or only conscious of it? Venerable sir, the Blessed One is the origin of the 
Teaching, the leader and the refuge of the Teaching. Good that the meaning of 
these words occur to the Blessed One. Hearing it from the Blessed One, the 
bhikkhus will bear it in mind. Then bhikkhus, listen, I will teach. 
<P>Bhikkhus, by the bhikkhu who could examine the thought processes of another 
the Thus Gone One should be examined on two things. On things cognisable by eye 
consciousness and ear consciousness. Are defiled things cognisable by eye and 
ear consciousness evident in the Thus Gone One or are they not? When examining 
he knows. These defiled things cognisable by eye and ear consciousness*1) are 
not evident in the Thus Gone One. Then he should make a further examination: Are 
mixed things cognisable by eye and ear consciousness evident in the Thus Gone 
One or are they not? When examining he knows. These mixed things cognisable by 
eye and ear consciousness*2) are not evident in the Thus Gone One. Then he 
should make a further examination: Are pure things cognisable by eye and ear 
consciousness evident in the Thus Gone One or are they not? When examining he 
knows. The pure things cognisable by eye and ear consciousness*3) are evident in 
the Thus Gone One. 
<P>Then he should make a further examination. Has the venerable one attained to 
these things of merit since long or are they attained to recently? When 
examining he knows these things of merit were attained since long, and not 
recently. Then he should make a further examination. Is the venerable one 
internally convinced of this attainment? Is there a possible danger evident? He 
should make a thorough examination to know whether there is some danger evident. 
When examining he knows the venerable one is internally convinced of the 
attainment and there is no danger evident. 
<P>Then he should further examine. Does the venerable one not indulge in 
sensuality, through destruction of greed or through fear? When examining he 
knows. The venerable one does not indulge in sensuality through destruction of 
greed, and not through fear. 
<P>Then the others should question that bhikkhu. On what grounds did the 
venerable one say, that the venerable one did not indulge in sensuality because 
greed is destroyed and not through fear? If that bhikkhu should reply rightly, 
he should say: Whether the venerable one is in the amidst of the community, or 
living alone. Living there well or miserably, if when advising a crowd, he sees 
someone fallen for materiality, or someone not soiled by materiality, the 
venerable one does not look down on him: This I heard in the presence of the 
Blessed One, and he acknowledged it ‘I do not indulge in sensuality because my 
greed is destroyed, not out of fear.’ 
<P>Then further it may, even be questioned from the Thus Gone One himself: Are 
defiled things cognisable by eye and ear consciousness evident in the Thus Gone 
One or are they not? Then I would declare.‘Defiled things cognisable by eye and 
ear consciousness are not evident in the Thus Gone One’. Asked: Are mixed things 
cognisable by eye and ear consciousness evident in the Thus Gone One, or are 
they not? I would declare. ‘Mixed things cognisable by eye and ear consciousness 
are not evident in the Thus Gone One’.Asked: Are pure things cognisable by eye 
and ear consciousness evident in the Thus Gone One, or are they not?. I would 
declare. ‘Pure things cognisable by eye and ear consiousness are evident in the 
Thus Gone One.That is my path and pasture, but I do not make them mine’. 
Bhikkhus, a Teacher who says thus, is suitable to be approached to hear the 
Teaching. He teaches leading one to more and more exalted states, showing the 
dark and white counterparts’. When teaching leading to more and more exalted 
states, at a certain point he reaches the summit*4) and establishes faith in the 
Teacher: The Blessed One is rightfully enlightened, the Teaching is well 
proclaimed, the Community of bhikkhus have gone well. 
<P>Then the others should question that bhikkhu. On what grounds did the 
venerable one say, the Blessed One is rightfully enlightened, the Teaching is 
well proclaimed and the Community of bhikkhus have gone well? That bhikkhu 
replying rightly should say, I approached the Blessed One to listen to the 
Teaching. The Blessed One taught me leading to more and more exalted states, 
showing the dark and white counterparts. When teaching, leading me to more and 
more exalted states, at a certain point I reached the summit, and then I 
established faith in the Teacher and came to the conclusion, the Blessed One is 
rightfully enlightened, the Teaching is well proclaimed, and the Community of 
bhikkhus has gone dwell. 
<P>Bhikkhus, in whomever faith is established in the Thus Gone One in this 
manner with these phrases and words, it becomes well established, thoroughly 
rooted faith and insight. It cannot be changed by a recluse, brahmin, god, 
Maaraa Brahmaa or by anyone in the world. 
<P>Bhikkhus, that is the search in the Teaching of the Thus Gone One, and is the 
propriety of reaching the summit*2) in the Teaching of the Thus Gone One.. 
<P>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the 
Blessed One. . :. . . 
<P><FONT size=-1>Notes,</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=-1>1. Defiled things cognisable by eye and ear consciousness’<I>ye 
sankili.t.thaa cakkusota vi~n~naaneyyaa dhammaa</I>’ These are defiled 
perceptions born of eye and ear consciousness. Those are thoughts with greed, 
hate and delusion</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=-1>2Mixed things cognisable by eye and ear consciousness. ‘<I>ye 
vitimissaa cakkhusota vi~n~naaneyyaa dhammaa</I>’ This is a mixed up perception, 
when not sure whether it is seen or heard. They are thoughts with a mixture of 
greed, hate and delusion.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=-1>3. Pure things cognisable by eye and ear consciousness’<I>ye 
vodaataa cakkhusota vi~n~naaneyyaa dhammaa</I>’ These are pure perceptions and 
thoughts born of eye and ear consciousness, free of greed, hate and delusion. 
.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=-1>.4 At a certain point reaches the summit.’<I>idha ekacca.m 
dhamma.m ni.t.tha.m aagama.m’</I> Here, it is realising the Teaching of the 
Blessed One, and it is equivalent to attaining one or the other of the eight 
attainments of the Noble disciple. These attainments have to go in due order and 
the first of them is the entry into the stream of the Teaching. There is no 
progress without it.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=-1>5The search in the Teaching of the Thus Gone One and the 
propriety of reaching the summit.’<I>eva.m kho bhikkhave tathaagate 
dhammasamannesanaa hoti. Eva.m ca pana tathaagato dhammataasusamanni.t.tho 
honti’</I> It means that the understanding of the Teaching should come from 
within, and it becomes the fitness to see through.</FONT> <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;
