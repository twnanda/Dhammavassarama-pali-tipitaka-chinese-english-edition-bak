<P><B>(28) The Major Disourse on the</B> 
<P><B>Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint.</B></CENTER>
<P><BR><BR><BR>
<P>I heard thus. 
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika 
in Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi. Then, venerable Saariputta addressed the bhikkhus 
"Friends, bhikkhus, just as the foot prints of all moving things get included in 
the footprint of the elephant and it becomes the biggest. Just so all things of 
merit get included in the four noble truths. What four? The noble truth of 
unpleasantness, the noble truth of its arising, the noble truth of its 
cessation, and the noble truth of the path, to the cessation of unpleasantness. 
<P>Friends, what is the noble truth of unpleasantness. Birth is unpleasant, 
decay, death, grief, lament, displeasure and distress are also unpleasant. Not 
to get one’s desires is unpleasant, in short the five holding masses are 
unpleasant. Friends, bhikkhus, what are the five holding masses? They are the 
holding mass of matter, the holding mass of feelings, the holding mass of 
perceptions, the holding mass of determinations and the holding mass of 
consciousness? Friends, what is the holding mass of matter: The four primary 
elements and the held on body from the four primary elements is the holding mass 
of matter. What are the four primary elements: Earth, water, fire and air are 
the four primary elements. 
<P>Friends, what is the earth element: There is internal earth element and 
external earth element. What is internal earth element. Whatever hard rough 
matter internally held as mine, such as hair of head and body, nails, teeth 
skin, flesh, nerves, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver pleura, lungs 
lower intestines, bowels, belly, excreta, and any other hard, rough internally 
held matter, all that is internal matter. All this internal earth element, and 
external earth element, go as earth element..That is not mine, am not that, it 
is not my self. This should be known as it really is, with right wisdom. Seeing 
this, as it really is, with right wisdom, the mind should be detached from the 
earth element, There comes a time when the external water element is agitated, 
at that time the external earth element is closed up, in it .That shows the 
agedness and impermanence of the earth element. So why hold on to this body of 
three hundred bones as this is mine, am that, it is my self.. Again others .may 
revile, blame, arouse and distress the bhikkhu. Then he knows, these unpleasant 
feelings arise with a cause. What is the cause? Contact is the cause He reflects 
that contact is impermanent, feelings are impermanent, that perception is 
impermanent, determinations are impermanent, and that consciousness is 
impermanent. His mind springs forward with the sign and elements, is pleased, 
settled, and released..(1) Others may treat that same bhikkhu in disagreeable, 
unwelcome, unkind ways, with the contact of hands, clods, sticks, and weapons. 
Then he knows, this body should be such, that it endures the contact of hands, 
clods, sticks and weapons. 
<P>In the Simile of the saw the Blessed One said, even if robbers and bandits 
cut limb after limb with a two handled saw, if the mind is defiled on account of 
that, he has not done the duty in my dispensation. It will be, my effort will be 
aroused repeatedly, unconfused mindfulness established, the body appeased 
without anger, the mind concentrated, in one point. Let the body now endure, the 
contact of hands, clods, sticks and weapons. Thus the dispensation of the 
Enlightened Ones is done.If the mind of the bhikkhu who reflects the Enlightened 
One, the Teaching, and the Community of bhikkhus thus, does not settle in merit 
with equanimity, he should be remorseful . It is a loss for me, I have missed a 
rare chance, that my mind did not settle in merit with equanimity. Like the 
daughter –in-law who has seen the mother-in-law would be remorseful.In the same 
manner the bhikkhu reflecting the Enlightened One, the Teaching and the 
Community of bhikkhus, if the mind does not settle in merit with equanimity, he 
should be remorseful. It is loss for me, I have missed a rare chance, that my 
mind did not settle in merit with equanimity. 
<P>Friends, if the mind of the bhikkhu reflecting the Enlightened One, the 
Teaching, and the Community of bhikkhus settles in merit with equanimity, he 
should be delighted. The bhikkhu who has done this much, has done a lot. 
<P>Friends, what is the water element. There is internal water element and 
external water element. What is the internal water element. Whatever internal 
personal water, held as bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat and oil of the skin, 
tears and oil of the eye, spit and snot, synovial fluid and urine, whatever any 
other held cohesiveness is the internal water element. This internal water 
element and the external water element, all go as water element. That is not 
mine, am not that, its not my self. This should be seen with right wisdom, as it 
really is. Thus seeing it with right wisdom, as it really is, the mind should be 
detached from the water element.There’s a time when the external water element 
agitates, it overflows villages and hamlets, towns and states, and the whole 
state. There is a time when the water in the ocean recedes as far as seven 
hundred miles, one thousand four hundred miles, two thousand one hundred miles, 
two thousand eight hundred miles, three thousand five hundred miles, four 
thousand two hundred miles, and recedes four thousand nine hundred miles. 
Friends, there is a time when the water in the ocean stands up to seven palms, 
six palms, five palms, four palms, three palms, two palms, a single palm. 
There’s a time when the water in the ocean stands up to the height of seven men, 
six men, five men, four men, three men, two men, one man. It stands up to the 
height of half a man, stands only waist deep, only knee deep, only up to the 
ankle. There is a time when the water in the ocean is not enough to wet the 
toes. This, is evidence of the agedness and impermanence of the external water 
element. So why hold on to this body of three hundred bones? As this is mine, am 
that, it’s my self. Again, others .may revile, blame, arouse and distress the 
bhikkhu. Then he knows, these unpleasant feelings arise with a cause.What is the 
cause? Contact is the cause. He reflects that contact, those feelings, those 
perceptions those determinations and that consciousness is impermanent. His mind 
springs forward with the sign and elements, is pleased, settled, and 
released.(1) Others may treat that same bhikkhu in disagreeable, unwelcome, 
unkind ways, with the contact of hands, clods, sticks, and weapons. Then he 
knows, this body should be such, that it endures the contact of hands, clods, 
sticks, and weapons. In the Simile of the saw it has been said by the Blessed 
One. Even if robbers and bandits cut limb after limb with a two handled saw, if 
the mind is defiled on account of that, he has not done the duty in my 
dispensation. It will be, my effort will be aroused repeatedly, unconfused 
mindfulness established. The body appeased and without anger. The mind 
concentrated will be in one point. Let the body now endure, the contact of 
hands, clods, sticks and weapons. The dispensation of the Enlightened Ones is 
done. If the mind of the bhikkhu who reflects the Enlightened One, the Teaching, 
and the Community of bhikkhus thus, does not settle in merit with equanimity, he 
should be remorseful. It is a loss for me, I have missed a rare chance, that my 
mind did not settle in merit with equanimity. Like the daughter –in-law who has 
seen the mother-in-law would be remorseful. In the same manner if the mind of 
the bhikkhu reflecting the Enlightened One, the Teaching and the Community of 
bhikkhus does not settle in merit with equanimity, he should be remorseful. It 
is loss for me, I have missed a rare chance. That my mind did not settle in 
merit with equanimity Friends, if the mind of the bhikkhu reflecting the 
Enlightened One, the Teaching, and the Community of bhikkhus, settles in merit 
with equanimity, he should be delighted. The bhikkhu who has done this much has 
done a lot. . 
<P>Friends, what is the fire element. There is internal and external fire 
element What is internal fire element? Whatever internal personal heat, the 
burning that causes decay, the digestion of whatever is enjoyed eaten and 
tasted. The internal fire held as mine, and any other firey thing that is 
internal is internal fire element. The internal fire element and the external 
fire element go as fire element. That is not mine, I’m not that, it’s not my 
self. This should be known as it really is, with right wisdom. Thus the mind 
should be detached from the fire element. There is a time when the fire element 
agitates villages and hamlets, towns and states, and complete states. It comes 
to the end of the green, end of the forest, to the coast, to the water’s end, or 
to some pleasant stretch of land and extinguishes, owing to lack of fuel. There 
is a time when fire originates in the stem of a cock’s feather or in a lump of 
veins. 
<P>That’s evidence of the agedness and impermanence of the external fire element 
So why hold this body of three hundred bones as this is mine, I’m that, it’s my 
self? Again, others .may revile, blame, arouse and distress the bhikkhu. Then he 
knows, these unpleasant feelings have arisen to me with a cause. What’s the 
cause? Contact is the cause He reflects, contact is impermanent, feelings, 
perceptions and determinations are impermanent, and consciousness is 
impermanent. His mind springs forward with the sign and elements, is pleased, 
settled, and released.(1) Others may treat that same bhikkhu in disagreeable, 
unwelcome, unkind ways, with the contact of hands, clods, sticks, and weapons. 
Then he knows, this body should be such, that it endures the contact of hands, 
clods, sticks and weapons. In the Simile of the saw it has been said by the 
Blessed. Even when robbers and bandits cut limb after limb with a two handled 
saw, if the mind of the bhikkhu is defiled he has not done the duties in my 
dispensation. It will be my effort will be aroused repeatedly, unconfused 
mindfulness established, the body appeased without anger, the mind concentrated 
in one point. Let the body now endure, the contact of hands, clods, sticks and 
weapons. thus the dispensation of the Enlightened Ones is done. If the mind of 
the bhikkhu who reflects the Enlightened One, the Teaching, and the Community 
thus, does not settle in merit with equanimity, he should be remorseful. It is a 
loss for me, I have missed a rare chance. That my mind did not settle in merit 
with equanimity. Like the daughter –in-law who has seen the mother-in-law would 
be remorseful, in the same manner if the mind of the bhikkhu reflecting the 
Enlightened One, the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus does not settle in 
merit with equanimity, he should be remorseful. It is loss for me, I have missed 
a rare chance. That my mind did not settle in merit with equanimity. Friends, if 
the mind of the bhikkhu reflecting the Enlightened One, the Teaching, and the 
Community of bhikkhus settles in merit with equanimity, he should be delighted. 
The bhikkhu who has done this much has done a lot. 
<P>Friends, what is the air element. There is internal air element and external 
air element. What is internal air element The internal personal airiness that is 
held, as up going winds, down going winds, winds in the stomach and bowels. 
Winds going up and down limbs, in-breaths and out-breaths and any other airiness 
held as mine, is internal air element.This internal and external air element 
goes as air element. That is not mine, am not that, it’s not my self. This 
should be seen with right wisdom, as it really is and the mind should be 
detached from the air element. 
<P>Friends, there is a time when the external air element is agitated and it 
wields power over village and hamlet, town and state and over the complete 
state. In the last months of the Summer there is a time when the wind has to be 
sought by fanning. Then water does not flow and blades of grass do not move. 
That is evidence of agedness and, impermanence of the external air element. So 
why hold to this body of three hundred bones as this is mine, I’m that, it’s my 
self?. Again, others .may revile, blame, arouse and distress the bhikkhu, then 
he knows. These unpleasant feelings arise with a cause.What is the cause? 
Contact is the cause. He reflects contact is impermanent, feelings, perceptions 
and determinations are impermanent, and consciousness is impermanent. His mind 
springs forward with the sign and elements, is pleased, settled, and 
released..(1) Others may treat that same bhikkhu in disagreeable, unwelcome, 
unkind ways, with the contact of hands, clods, sticks and weapons. Then he 
knows, this body should be such, that it endures the contact of hands, clods, 
sticks and weapons.. In the Simile of the saw, the Blessed One has said, when 
robbers and bandits cut limb after limb with a two handled saw, if the mind is 
defiled on account of it, he has not done the duty in my dispensation. It should 
be, my effort will be aroused repeatedly, unconfused mindfulness established, 
the body appeased without anger and the mind concentrated in one point. Let the 
body now endure, the contact of hands, clods, sticks and weapons. Thus the 
dispensation of the Enlightened Ones is done.When the bhikkhu reflects the 
Enlightened One, the Teaching, and the Community of bhikkhus thus, if the mind 
does not settle in merit with equanimity, he should be remorseful on account of 
it. It is a loss for me, I have missed a rare chance. That my mind did not 
settle in merit with equanimity. Like the daughter –in-law who has seen the 
mother-in-law would be remorseful. In the same manner if the mind of the bhikkhu 
reflecting the Enlightened One, the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus, does 
not settle in merit with equanimity, he should be remorseful.. It is loss for 
me, I have missed a rare chance. That my mind did not settle in merit with 
equanimity. Friends, when the bhikkhu reflected the Enlightened One, the 
Teaching, and the Community of bhikkhus if the mind settled in merit with 
equanimity, he should be delighted. The bhikkhu who has done this much has done 
a lot. 
<P>Friends, an enclosure made in space with sticks, creepers, grass, and mud is 
a house likewise an enclosure made out of bones, nerves and flesh is matter. 
When the internal eye is unimpaired, external forms do not come to the purview, 
with the complementary coming together, the respective consciousness does not 
arise When the internal eye is unimpaired, external forms come to the purview, 
without the complementary coming together, the respective consciousness does not 
arise. .When the internal eye is unimpaired, external forms come to the purview, 
with the complementary coming together, the respective consciousness arises. 
Whatever matter arises there from, goes to the holding mass of matter. Feelings 
to the holding mass of feelings. Perceptions to the holding mass of perceptions. 
Determinations to the holding mass of determinations and whatever consciousness 
goes to the holding mass of consciousness. It is in this manner, that the five 
holding masses accumulate, come together and momentarily behave together). The 
Blessed One has said, he who sees dependent arising, sees the Teaching, He who 
sees the Teaching sees dependent arising*2) Indeed these five holding masses 
arise dependently. The interest, settlement, follow up and the appropriation in 
the five holding masses is the arising of unpleasantness*3) Dispelling the 
interest and greed for the five holding masses, is the cessation of 
unpleasantness*4).. When this is done, the bhikkhu has done much. When the 
internal ear is unimpaired—the nose is unimpaired, --the tongue is 
unimpaired,--the body is unimpaired, When the mind is unimpaired, external ideas 
do not come to the purview, with the complementary coming together the 
respective consciousness does not arise.When the mind is unimpaired, external 
ideas come to the purview, without the complementary coming together, the 
respective consciousness does not arise. When the mind is unimpaired, external 
ideas come to the purview, and with the complementary coming together the 
respective consciousness arises. Whatever matter produced there, goes to the 
holding mass of matter. Feelings, to the holding mass of feelings. Perceptions, 
to the holding mass of perceptions. Determinations, to the holding mass of 
determinations. Consciousness to the holding mass of consciousness. It is in 
this manner, that the five holding masses accumulate, come together and 
momentarily behave together. The Blessed One has said, he who sees dependent 
arising.sees the Teaching. He who sees the Teaching sees dependent arising. 
Indeed these five holding masses arise dependently. The interest, settlement, 
follow up and the appropriation in the five holding masses is the arising of 
unpleasantness. Dispelling the interest and greed for the five holding masses, 
is the cessation of unpleasantness, The bhikkhu who has done this much has done 
a lot. 
<P>Venerable Saariputta said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of 
venerable Saariputta, 
<P>Notes. 
<P>1. His mind springs forward with the sign and elements, is pleased settled 
and released. ‘ <I>tassa dhaataarammana.m eva citta.m pakkhandati pasiidati 
santiti,t,thati’ </I>This springing of the mind is -always for a change in the 
mind, it causes a feeling to arise. Here the bhikkhu has overcome a disagreeable 
feeling becomes pleased, gets settled and finds release of the mind, instead of 
being disagreeable and averse to that situation and feeling. This is a 
development to the bhikkhu. Several such developments and growths should come to 
the bhikkhu in his development up to arahanta.The sign is the thought, or 
attention and the elements are the things that mattered at one or the other 
sense door. ie a sight, a sound etcetra.. 
<P>2.He who sees dependent arising sees the Teaching. He who sees the Teaching 
sees dependent arising.’<I>yo paticcasamuppaada.m passati, so dhamma.m passati. 
Yo dhamma.m passati so patticcasamuppaada.m passati</I>’ This reciprocal 
statement tells us that we have to understand dependent arising to understand 
the Teaching. Dependent arising means anyone born, is subject to decay, 
ailments, death, grief, lament and unpleasantness. There are some other ways of 
explaining Dependent Arising. Here it is necessary that we remove the cause; 
birth. It is not an easy task to remove the intention ‘to be’. 
<P>3. The interest, settlement, follow up and the appropriation in the five 
holding masses is the arising of unpleasantness.’<I>yo emesu 
pancupaadaanaskandesu chando aalayo anusayo ajjhosaana.m, so dukkhasamudayo’</I> 
Thus we see that the interested following up of material things external and 
internal and thinking they are mine is the holding mass of matter, and is the 
arising of unpleasantness. The interested following up of feelings external and 
internal and thinking they are mine is the holding mass of feelings, which is 
the arising of unpleasantness. External feelings are born on account of contact 
at the six doors of mental contact, and internal feelings are born when the idea 
gets ingrained that the feeling is mine.The interested following up of 
perceptions thinking they are mine is the holding mass of perceptions, and this 
too is the arising of unpleasaantness. Perceptions are born on account of 
contacts at one or other of the doors of mental contact. Or they may be born in 
imagination.The interested following up of determinations, thinking they are 
mine is the holding mass of determinations, this is the arising of 
unpleasantness. The interested following up of consciousness through one or the 
other of the doors orf mentality is the holding mass of consciousness, this is 
also unpleasant. 
<P>4.Dispelling the interest and greed for the five holding masses is the 
cessation of unpleasantness. This is a very slow and tedious process which has 
to be done with care and attention.. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;
