<P><B>(33) The Major Discourse on the Cowherd</B>.</CENTER>
<P>I heard thus. 
<P>At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by 
Anaathapindika 
<P>in Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi. From there the Blessed One addressed the 
bhikkhus: 
<P>Bhikkhus, it is not possible for the cowherd to increase his fold endowed 
with eleven characteristics. What eleven: The cowherd does not know matter, is 
not clever in marks, is not a dispeller of nits, does not dress wounds, does not 
make smoke, does not know the ford, does not experience joy, does not know the 
path, is not clever in finding pastures, does the mistake of not leaving a 
remainder, does not pay special attention to the forefathers of the herd. 
Endowed with these eleven factors, it is not possible that the cowherd could 
care for his herd or increase his herd, --In the same manner, the bhikkhu 
endowed with these eleven characteristics would not come to growth and increase 
in this dispensation, What eleven?. The bhikkhu does not know matter, is not 
clever in marks, does not dispel nits, does not dress wounds, does not make 
smoke, does not know the ford, does not experience joy, does not know the path, 
is not clever in finding pastures, does the mistake of not leaving a remainder, 
does not pay special attention to the forefathers of the Community.Endowed with 
these eleven factors, it is not possible that the bhikkhu could come to growth 
and increase in this dispensation. 
<P>Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu not know matter. The bhikkhu does not know as 
it really is, that all matter is matter of the four great elements and the 
matter held as mine from the four great elements. Thus, the bhikkhu does not 
know matter. How is the bhikkhu not clever in marks. The bhikkhu does not know 
as it really is, the fool by his actions, and the wise one by his actions, thus 
the bhikkhu is not clever in marks. How does the bhikkhu not dispel nits. Here 
the bhikkhu endures sensual thoughts does not chase them out and make them not 
rise again,. Endures angry thoughts, does not chase them out, and make them not 
rise again. Endures hurting thoughts, does not chase them out, and make them not 
rise again. Endures arisen demerit does not chase it out, and make it not rise 
again. Thus the bhikkhu does not dispel nits. How does the bhikkhu not dress the 
wounds.The bhikkhu seeing a form with the eye takes the sign and the details. To 
one abiding uncontrolled in the faculty of the eye, evil demerit of covetousness 
and displeasure may trickle down, to its control he does not fall, does not 
protect the faculty of the eye. Hearing a sound with the ear—Cognizing a smell 
with the nose—Coignizing a taste with the tongue, --Cognizing a touch with the 
body, Cognizing an idea with the mind does not take the sign or the details. To 
one abiding uncontrolled in the faculty of the mind, evil demerit, of 
covetousness .and displeasure may trickle down. To its control he does not fall, 
does not protect the faculty of the mind. Thus the bhikkhu does not dress the 
wounds. Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu not make smoke Here the bhikkhu, does not 
explain the Teaching to others as he has learnt and experienced, Thus the 
bhikkhu does not make smoke. Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu not know the ford: 
The bhikkhu does not approach the learned bearers of the Teaching and 
Discipline, those who know the headings, from time to time, to question and 
cross question, to know the meanings. So that those venerable ones would explain 
the hidden meanings and would dispel doubts. Thus the bhikkhu does not know the 
ford. Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu not experience joy? In the Teaching and 
Discipline declared by the Thus Gone One, the bhikkhu does not experience the 
meanings in the Teaching and the joy on account of it.* Thus the bhikkhu does 
not experience joy. How does the bhikkhu not know the paths?. Here the bhikkhu 
does not know the noble eightfold path as it really is. Thus the bhikkhu does 
not know the path. How is the bhikkhu not clever in finding pastures? Here the 
bhikkhu does not know as it really the four establishments of mindfulness. Thus 
the bhikkhu is not clever in finding pastures. How does the bhikkhu make the 
mistake of not leaving a remainder. Here the bhikkhu accepts robes, morsel food, 
dwellings and requisites when ill, offered by householders out of faith, not 
knowing the amount to accept. Thus the bhikkhu makes the mistake of not leaving 
a remainder. How does the bhikkhu not pay attention to the forefathers of the 
Community. Here the bhikkhu does not attend with bodily actions of loving 
kindness, verbal actions of loving kindness, and mental actions of loving 
kindness, towards the leaders of the Community. Those with a long standing and 
need special attention. Thus the bhikkhu does not attend to the forefathers of 
the Community. It is not possible that the bhikkhu endowed with these eleven 
characteristics should come to growth and development in this Teaching and 
Discipline. . 
<P>Bhikkhus, it is possible that the cowherd could increase his fold endowed 
with eleven characteristics. What eleven: The cowherd knows matter. Is clever in 
knowing marks. Dispels nits, dresses wounds, makes smoke, knows the ford, 
experiences joy, and knows the path. Is clever in finding pastures, does no 
mistake of not leaving a remainder. Pays special attention to the forefathers of 
the herd. Endowed with these eleven factors, it is possible that the cowherd 
could care his herd and increase his herd. In the same way, the bhikkhu endowed 
with these eleven characteristics would come to growth and increase in this 
dispensation. What eleven? The bhikkhu knows matter. Is clever in marks, dispels 
nits, dresses wounds, makes smoke, knows the ford, experiences the joy, knows 
the path and is clever in finding pastures. He does no mistake of not leaving a 
remainder. Pays special attention to the forefathers of the Community.. Endowed 
with these eleven factors, it is possible that the bhikkhu could come to growth 
and increase in this Teaching and Dispensation 
<P>Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu know matter. The bhikkhu knows as it really 
is, that all matter, is matter of the four great elements and the matter that is 
held as mine. Thus, the bhikkhu knows matter. How is the bhikkhu clever in 
marks? The bhikkhu knows as it really is, the fool by his actions, and the wise 
one by his actions. Thus the bhikkhu is clever in marks. How does the bhikkhu 
dispel nits. Here the bhikkhu does not endure sensual thoughts chases them out, 
and makes them not rise again..Does not endure angry thoughts, chases them out, 
and makes them not rise again. Does not endure hurting thoughts, chases them 
out, and makes them not rise again. Does not endure arisen demerit chases it 
out, and makes it not rise again. Thus the bhikkhu dispels nits. How does the 
bhikkhu dress the wounds? Seeing a form with the eye does not take the sign and 
details. To one abiding uncontrolled in the faculty of the eye, evil demerit of 
covetousness and displeasure may trickle down, to its control he falls, protects 
the faculty of the eye. Hearing a sound with the ear—Cognizing a smell with the 
nose—Coignizing a taste with the tongue, --Cognizing a touch with the body, 
Cognizing an idea with the mind, does not take the sign or the details.To one 
abiding uncontrolled in the faculty of the mind, evil demerit, of covetousness 
.and displeasure may trickle down. To its control he falls, protects the faculty 
of the mind. Thus the bhikkhu dresses wounds. Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu 
make smoke? Here the bhikkhu, explains the Teaching to others as he has learnt 
and experienced, Thus the bhikkhu makes smoke. Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu 
know the ford: The bhikkhu approaches learned bearers of the Teaching and 
Discipline, who know the headings, from time to time, to question and cross 
question, to know the meanings. So that those venerable ones would explain the 
hidden meanings and would dispel doubts. Thus the bhikkhu knows the ford. 
Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu experience joy? In the Teaching and Discipline 
declared by the Thus Gone One the bhikkhu experiences meanings, in the Teaching 
and the resulting joy from it.* Thus the bhikkhu experiences joy. How does the 
bhikkhu know the paths. Here the bhikkhu knows the noble eightfold path as it 
really is. Thus the bhikkhu knows the path. How is the bhikkhu clever in finding 
pastures? Here the bhikkhu knows, as it really is, the four establishments of 
mindfulness. Thus the bhikkhu is clever in finding pastures. How does the 
bhikkhu make no mistake of not leaving a remainder? Here the bhikkhu accepts 
robes, morsel food, dwellings and requisites when ill, offered by householders 
out of faith, knowing the amount to accept. Thus the bhikkhu makes no mistake of 
not leaving a remainder. How does the bhikkhu not pay attention to the 
forefathers of the Community. Here the bhikkhu attends with bodily actions of 
loving kindness, verbal actions of loving kindness, and mental actions of loving 
kindness, towards the leaders of the Community. Those with a long standing and 
needing special attention. Thus the bhikkhu attends to the forefathers of the 
Community. It is possible that the bhikkhu endowed with these eleven 
characteristics should come to growth and development in this Teaching and 
Discipline. . 
<P>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the 
Blessed One. 
<P>Notes. 
<P>*In the Teaching and Discipline declared by the Thus Gone One, the bhikkhu 
experiences meanings in the Teaching and the joy on account of it.’<I>Idha 
bhikkhave bhikkhu Tathaagatappavedite dhammavinaye desiyamaane labhati 
dhammaveda.m labhati dhammuupasa.mhita.m paamujja.m</I>’- The bhikkhu that 
experiences meanings in the Teaching comes to right understanding 
(<I>sammaadi.t.thi</I>) this is equivalent to entering the stream of the 
Teaching <I>(sotaapanna</I>) which comes about by studying and understanding the 
Teaching declared by the Blessed One. The joy experienced is on account of 
dispelling a large portion of the unpleasantness inherent to any born ordinary 
person <I>(puthujjana</I>) <BR>&nbsp;<A
