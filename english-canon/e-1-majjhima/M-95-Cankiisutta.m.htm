<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU>I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One 
touring Kosala, with a large community of bhikkhus, came to the Brahmin village 
Opasaada. The Blessed One abode in the sporting Saala forest to the north of 
Opasaada. At that time the Brahmin Cankii lived in Opasaada, endowed with seven 
marks of a Great Man. He was supplied grass, firewood, water and grains, by king 
Pasenadi of Kosala as royal gifts. The Brahmin householders of Opasaada heard. 
The good recluse Gotama, gone forth homeless, from the clan of the Sakyas is 
touring the Kosala country with a large community of bhikkhus, has arrived in 
Opasaada. This fame has spread of that good Gotama. He is blessed, perfect and 
rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, gone well, knows the 
worlds, is the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, 
enlightened and blessed. He teaches this world of gods and men, together with 
its Maaras Brahmaas, recluses and Brahmins, a Teaching, by himself known and 
realized. That Teaching is good at the beginning, in the middle and in the end, 
with meanings even in the letters. That Teaching proclaims the complete and pure 
holy life. It is good to see such perfect ones.</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The 
Brahmin householders, left Opasaada, and gathering and increasing in numbers 
went towards the sporting Saala forest to the north of Opasaada. At this time 
the Brahmin Cankii, was sleeping in the day, in his chamber, on the upper storey 
of his house. Then he saw the Brahmin householders of Opasaada going north 
towards the sporting Saala forest, in large numbers. He addressed his servant. 
‘Friend, why are the Brahmin householders of Opasaada going north towards the 
sporting Saala forest?’<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Good sir Cankii, the recluse Gotama, gone 
forth homeless, from the clan of the Sakyas is touring the Kosala country with a 
large community of bhikkhus, has arrived in Opasaada. This fame has spread of 
that good Gotama. He is blessed, perfect and rightfully enlightened, endowed 
with knowledge and conduct, gone well, knows the worlds, is the incomparable 
tamer of those to be tamed, is teacher of gods and men,<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>enlightened and blessed. He teaches this world 
of gods and men, together with its Maaras Brahmaas, recluses and Brahmins, a 
Teaching, by himself known and realized. That Teaching is good at the beginning, 
in the middle and in the end, with meanings even in the letters. That Teaching 
proclaims the complete and pure holy life. It is good to see such perfect 
ones.’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Then friend, approach those Brahmin 
householders of Opasaada and tell. The Brahmin Cankii says, good sirs go, the 
Brahmin Cankii too will approach to see the Blessed One’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The 
servant agreed, approached those Brahmin householders of Opasaada and said.’The 
good Brahmin Cankii says, good sirs go. Brahmin Cankii too will approach to see 
the Blessed One.’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>At 
that time about five hundred Brahmins from various states were residing in 
Opasaada come there for some purpose. They heard, that the Brahmin Cankii was 
going to see the recluse Gotama and approached the Brahmin Cankii. They asked. 
‘Is it true that good Canakii is going to see the recluse Gotama?’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Yes, good ones, I too will approach to see the 
recluse Gotama.’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘It 
is not suitable that good Canakii should approach to see the recluse Gotama, it 
is suitable that the recluse Gotama should approach to see good Cankii. Good 
Cankii is pure of birth on both the mother’s and the father’s side. The purity, 
is without blame about birth, as far back as the seventh fore father. Therefore 
it is not suitable that good Cankii should approach the recluse Gotama, but the 
recluse Gotama should approach good Cankii. Good Cankii has great wealth, is 
learned in the three Vedas, and the rites and rituals as officiating priest. 
Knows the phonology and etymology of words. Is learned in the marks of a Great 
Man. Good Cankii is pleasant to look at, has a beautiful skin complexion, talks 
politely, has nothing inferior in his appearance. Good Cankii is virtuous and 
well developed in them. Speaks politely, distinctly, words full of meaning. Good 
Cankii is a teacher of many, teaches three hundred young men orally. King 
Pasenadi of Kosala reveres good Cankii. The Brahmin Pokkarasaati reveres good 
Cankii. The Brahmin Cankii lives in Opasaada, endowed with seven marks of a 
Great Man. He is supplied grass, firewood, water and grains, by king Pasenadi of 
Kosala as royal gifts. Therefore it is not suitable that good Canakii should 
approach to see the Blessed One, it is suitable that the recluse Gotama should 
approach to see good Cankii.</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Then good sirs, listen to what I have to say 
about good Gotama, why I should approach the recluse Gotama and not that the 
recluse Gotama should approach me. The good recluse Gotama, is pure of birth on 
both the mother’s and the father’s side. The purity, is without blame about 
birth, as far back as the seventh fore father. Therefore it is not suitable that 
the good recluse Gotama should approach me, but I should approach the good 
recluse Gotama. The recluse Gotama gave up much sterling gold, treasures hidden 
and open and went forth homeless. When young, even in the prime of youth, with 
dark black hair, when his mother and father were crying with tearing eyes, he 
shaved head and beard and went forth. The recluse Gotama is pleasant to look at, 
has a beautiful skin complexion, talks politely, there is nothing inferior in 
his appearance. The good recluse Gotama, is endowed with the noble one’s 
virtues, speaks politely, distinctly wise words full of meaning. The recluse 
Gotama is the teacher of, the teachers of many. He has destroyed greed for 
sensuality and is firm in his decision. The recluse Gotama tells of the results 
of actions, and is honoured, for not doing evil by the wise. The good recluse 
Gotama went forth from an honoured, wealthy clan with many resources. Many come 
from external countries and states to get questions answered by the good recluse 
Gotama. Thousands of deities have taken refuge in good Gotama until the end of 
their lives. This fame has spread about good Gotama. That Blessed One is 
perfect, rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, gone well, 
the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, is teacher of gods and men, 
enlightened and blessed. The recluse Gotama is complete with the two and thirty 
marks of a Great Man. The king of Magadha<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Seniya Bimbisara<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>together with his wife and children has taken 
refuge in the good recluse Gotama until life lasts. King Pasenadi of Kosala 
together with his wife and children has taken refuge in the good recluse Gotama. 
The Brahmin Pokkarasaati together with his wife and children has taken refuge in 
the good recluse Gotama. The recluse Gotama has arrived in Opasaada and abides 
in the sporting Saala forest in the north of Opasaada. Whoever comes to our 
villages and fields are our guests. We should look after our guests<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>revere and honour them. On account of these 
things it is not suitable that the recluse Gotama should approach to see me and 
it is suitable I should approach the recluse Gotama. These are not all the good 
qualities of good Gotama, there is much more untold. Taking into account even 
one of these, it is not proper that the recluse Gotama should approach me, but I 
should approach the recluse Gotama. Therefore let us all approach the recluse 
Gotama.</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The 
Brahmin Cankii, with a large gathering of Brahmins approached the Blessed One, 
exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side. At that time some elderly 
Brahmins were exchanging friendly greetings with the Blessed One. A young man 
named Kaapa.thika, about sixteen years of age, with shaven head, learned in the 
three Vedas was seated in that gathering. He had learned the phonology and 
etymology of words, was learned in the marks of a Great Man. He interrupted the 
Blessed One when exchanging friendly greetings with the elderly Brahmins. The 
Blessed One said. ’Venerable Bhaaravdaaja do not interrupt when we are talking 
with the elderly Brahmins. When this conversation comes to an end. You should 
talk,’ The Brahmin Cankii said. ‘Good Gotama do not blame the young man 
Kaapa.thika. He speaks well, is wise and young and he could dispute with good 
Gotama on these words.’ Then it occurred to the Blessed One. Indeed, there will 
be a discussion with the young man Kaapa.thika on the three Vedas, that he is 
honoured so much by the Brahmins.’ It occurred to the young man Kaapa.thika, 
when the recluse Gotama’s eyes meet with mine, I will, ask my question. The 
Blessed One knowing the thought and thought processes of the young man directed 
his eyes to Kaapa.thika. It occurred to young Kaapa.thika, my eyes have met with 
those of the recluse Gotama, what if I ask the question. He said. ‘Good Gotama, 
the Brahmins believe the ancient sayings handed down through hearsay and by 
authority is the truth, all else is not the truth. What has good Gotama to say 
about it?’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Bharadvaaja, is there a single Brahmin, who 
says, I know this. I see this. This only is the truth, all else is 
false?’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘No, good Gotama, there isn’t’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN

Brahmins, in the past like Atthaka Vaamaka, Vaamadeva, Vessamitta, Yamataggi, 
Angiirasa, Bharadvaaja, Vaasettha, Kassapa and Bhagu who made and protected the 
ancient sayings like the Brahmins who protect reciting the verses, over and over

false.’<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Bharadvaaja, a single Brahmin, among the 
Brahmins did not say. I know this. I see this. This, is the truth, all else is 
false. A single teacher, or a teacher’s teacher up to the seventh generation did 
not say. I know this. I see this. This, only is the truth, all else is false. A 
single sage of the Brahmins, in the past like Atthaka Vaamaka, Vaamadeva,

the verses, over and over again now, did not say I know this. I see this. This, 
only is the truth, all else is false. Bharadvaaja, it is like a line of blind 
men holding hands. The first does not see, the middle one does not see and the 
last one does not see. When this is so, the words of the Brahmins are similar to 
the words of a line of blind men. Bharadvaaja, isn’t this faith not well 
established?<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN

only faith but, also hearsay.’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN

faith, now it is on hearsay. These five things have twofold results here and 
now. What are the five? They are faith, liking, hearsay, careful thinking and 
forbearance with view. These five things are with twofold results here and now. 
Bharadvaaja, there is good faith, it becomes useless, not true, changes. Again 
there is much liking, it becomes useless, not true, changes. There is hearsay, 
which becomes useless, not true, changes. There is very careful thinking too, 
which becomes useless, not true, changes. Also there is forbearance with view, 
which becomes useless, not true, changes. It is not suitable for a wise man who 
protects the truth to take a one sided view and say, this only is the truth, all 
else is not the truth.’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN

endeavour. ’padhaanassa kho bharadvaaja tulanaa bahukaaraa’ The fourfold 
endeavours are pushing the mind forward earnestly, to dispel arisen demerit to 
promote non arising of not arisen demerit To promote the arising of not arisen 
merit and to see the development and completion of arisen merit. For this kind 
of mental work to happen, we should mentally weigh our activities by body speech 
and mind. We should be aware of the activities at the six doors of mental 
contact.&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">2. Struggling is 
of much help for weighing. ‘Tulanaaya kho bharadvaaja ussaaho bahukaaro hoti’ 
This is a mental struggle. It consists of thinking and pondering to sort out the 
correct and comes to be right thinking.&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText2>3.Right speculation is of much help for 
interest.’Chandassa kho Bharadvaaja dhammanijjhaanakhanti bahukaaraa’. Right 
speculation falls to the category of right thinking. So this is falling to the 
Noble Eightfold path, with right view at the foremost.<SPAN
