<P>I heard thus. 
<P>At one time the Blessed One was living in the Kuru country, in the hamlet 
named Kammassadhamma. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from there. 
<P>'Bhikkhus, sensuality is impermanent, useless, false, a stupid thing and a 
deception. It is prattle and foolish talk. Sensuality here and now and 
hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, all these are the 
domain of death, the pasture of death. The evil mind with sensuality is led to 
greed, anger and quarrels 
<P>Bhikkhus. the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality is impermanent, useless, 
false, a stupid thing and a deception. It is prattle and foolish talk. 
Sensuality here and now and hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and 
hereafter, all these are the domain of death, the pasture of death. The evil 
mind with sensuality is led to greed, anger and quarrels. What if I develop the 
mind grown great and much, above the material world, then there will be no 
greed, anger or quarrels. When these are dispelled my mind will be significant, 
limitless and well developed. Fallen to this method, when developped much, the 
mind, partakes pleasure in that sphere or abides in imperturbability here and 
now, or with wisdom it is released.*1) After death, there is a possibility that 
the led on, consciousness should reach imperturbability. Bhikkhus, I say, this 
is the first suitability to reach imperturbability. 
<P>Again bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality here and now and 
hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, whatever matter of 
the four primary elements, is on account of this held on matter.*2) Fallen to 
this method, when developped much, the mind, partakes pleasure in that sphere or 
abides in imperturbability here and now, or with wisdom it is released. After 
death, there is a possibility that the led on, consciousness should reach 
imperturbability. Bhikkhus, I say, this is the second suitability to reach 
imperturbability. 
<P>Again bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality here and now and 
hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, whatever matter, here 
and now or hereafter, whatever material perceptions here and now and here after, 
all these are impermanent. It is not suitable to take pleasure and appropriate 
what is impermanent. Fallen to this method, when developped much, the mind, 
partakes pleasure in that sphere or abides in imperturbability here and now, or 
with wisdom it is released. After death, there is a possibility that this led 
on, consciousness should reach imperturbability. Bhikkhus, this is the third 
suitability to reach imperturbability, I say. 
<P>Again bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality here and now and 
hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, whatever matter, here 
and now or hereafter, whatever material perceptions here and now and here after 
and the perception of imperturbability, all these perceptions cease in this 
sphere of nothingness, without a remainder. It is peaceful and exalted. Fallen 
to this method, when developped much, the mind, partakes pleasure in that sphere 
or abides in imperturbability here and now, or with wisdom it is released. After 
death, there is a possibility that this led on, consciousness should reach 
imperturbability. Bhikkhus, I say, this is the first suitability to reach the 
sphere of nothingness. 
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the noble disciple gone to the forest or to the root of a 
tree reflects. All these are perceived things, of the self, or of the belongings 
of the self. 
<P>Fallen to this method, when developped much, the mind, partakes pleasure in 
that sphere or abides in imperturbability here and now, or with wisdom it is 
released. After death, there is a possibility that this led on, consciousness 
should reach imperturbability. Bhikkhus, I say, this is the second suitability 
to reach the sphere of nothingness. 
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflects, I have no greed, hate or 
delusion for anybody, neither is there greed, hate and delusion to me from 
anyone. Fallen to this method, when developped much, the mind, partakes pleasure 
in that sphere or abides in imperturbability here and now, or with wisdom it is 
released. After death, there is a possibility that this led on, consciousness 
should reach imperturbability. Bhikkhus, I say, this is the third suitability to 
reach the sphere of nothingness. 
<P>Again Aananda, the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality here and now and 
hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, whatever matter, here 
and now or hereafter, whatever material perceptions here and now and here after, 
the perception of imperturbability and the perception of nothingness, all these 
perceptions cease in this sphere of neither perception nor non-perception, 
without a remainder. It is peaceful and exalted. Fallen to this method, when 
developped much, the mind, partakes pleasure in that sphere or abides in neither 
perception nor non perception here and now, or with wisdom it is released. After 
death, there is a possibility that this led on, consciousness should reach the 
sphere of neither perception nor non perception. Bhikkhus, I say, this is 
suitability to reach the sphere of neither perception nor non perception.' 
<P>Then venerable Aananda said. 'Venerable sir, the bhikkhu falls to this 
method, there is not, there is not to me, there will not be, there will not be 
to me, whatever there is, whatever produced, I discard, thus he gains 
equanimity. Venerable sir, is that bhikkhu extinguished?' 
<P>'Aananda, a certain bhikkhu fallen to this method may extinguish, another 
would not.' 
<P>'Venerable sir, why should a certain bhikkhu fallen to this method extinguish 
and another not extinguish?' 
<P>'Ananda, the bhikkhu falls to this method, there is not, there is not to me, 
there will not be, there will not be to me, whatever there is, whatever 
produced, I discard, thus he gains equanimity. He delights in that equanimity, 
welcomes it, tied to it, his consciousness settles in it. Aananda, the bhikkhu 
with settlements does not extinguish.' 
<P>'Venerable sir, where does the bhikkhu setttle' 
<P>'Aananda, in neither-perception-nor-non-perception.' 
<P>'Venerable sir, he settles in the highest settlement.' 
<P>'Aananda, of settlements neither-perception-nor non-perception, is the 
highest settlement Ananda, the bhikkhu falls to this method, there is not, there 
is not to me, there will not be, there will not be to me, whatever there is, 
whatever produced, I discard, thus he gains equanimity. He does not delight in 
that equanimity, does not welcome it, not tied to it his consciousness does not 
settle in it. Aananda, the bhikkhu without settlements is extinguished.' 
<P>'Wonderful, venerable sir, the Blessed One has explained the crossing of the 
flood supported on higher and higher spheres. Venerable sir, how is noble 
release?' 
<P>'Again Aananda, the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality here and now and 
hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, whatever matter, here 
and now or hereafter, whatever material perceptions here and now and here after, 
the perception of imperturbability, the perception of nothingness, and the 
sphere of neither perception nor non perception, these are things of the self 
and are holdings, that mind without holdings is the mind's release. Aananda, I 
have taught you the method to attain, imperturbability, the sphere of 
nothingness, the sphere of neither perception-nor-non-perception, the method of 
crossing the flood supported on higher and higher spheres and the noble release. 
Whatever a teacher should do to his disciples out of compassion, that I have 
done to you. Aananda, these are the roots of trees, and these are the empty 
houses. Aananda, concentrate and do not have remorse later. This is our advice 
to you. 
<P>The Blessed One said those words and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of 
the Blessed One.
