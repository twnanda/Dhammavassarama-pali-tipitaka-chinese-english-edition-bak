<P>I heard thus. 
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in Anathapindika’s monastery in Jeta’s 
grove in Savatthi. The householder Anathapindika was seriously ill and suffering 
badly at that time. He addressed a certain man and said. ‘Good man approach the 
Blessed One, worship the Blessed One for my sake with your head at his feet, and 
tell. "Venerable sir, the householder Anathapindika is seriously ill. Also 
approach venerable Sariputta worship venerable Sariputta for my sake with your 
head at his feet and tell. Venerable sir, the householder Anathapindika is 
seriously ill, it is good if venerable Sariputta would approach the householder 
Anathapindika’s house out of compassion." 
<P>That man agreeing, approached the Blessed One, worshipped the Blessed One, 
sat on a side and said. "Venerable sir, the householder Anathapindika is 
seriously ill and he worships the Blessed One with his head at the feet of the 
Blessed One. Then he approached venerable Saariputta, worshipped him, sat on a 
side and said. "Venerable sir, the householder Anathapindika is seriously ill, 
he worships venerable Saaariputta with his head at the feet of venerable 
Sariputta and also says, it is good if venerable Sariputta would approach the 
householder Anathapindika’s house out of compassion." 
<P>Venerable Sariputta accepted the message silently, put on his robes and 
taking bowl and robes, and accompanied by venerable Ananda as the second 
recluse, approached the house of Anathapindika. Sitting on the prepared seats 
venerable Sariputta said. ‘Householder, how are you feeling? Would you survive? 
Are the unpleasant feelings decreasing or increasing? Do the feelings show the 
increasing end or the decreasing end? 
<P>Good sir, Sariputta, I do not feel well, will not survive. My unpleasant 
feelings are severe and increasing, not decreasing. The unpleasant feelings are 
increasing until the end. Good sir, Sariputta, my top hurts a lot. I feel as 
though a strong man was giving me a headdress with a strong cloth. I do not feel 
well and will not survive. My unpleasant feelings are severe and increasing, not 
decreasing. The unpleasant feelings are increasing until the end. Good sir, 
Sariputta, my belly hurts a lot as though a lot of air was turning about in my 
belly. I feel as though a clever butcher or his apprentice was carving my belly 
with a sharp butcher’s knife I do not feel well and will not survive. My 
unpleasant feelings are severe and increasing, not decreasing. The unpleasant 
feelings are increasing until the end. Good sir, Sariputta, there is a lot 
burning in my body. I feel as though two strong men taking me by my hands and 
feet are pulling me to a pit of burning embers and are scorching and burning me. 
I do not feel well and will not survive. My unpleasant feelings are severe and 
increasing, not decreasing. The unpleasant feelings are increasing until the 
end.

<P>Therefore householder, you should train thus, I will not cling to the earth

entertain thoughts of the other world. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>Therefore householder, you should train, I will not cling to anything seen, 
heard, known through the scents or pursued discursively thinking. 
<P>Hearing this the householder Anathapindika cried loudly and tears streamed 
down. Then venerable Ananda asked ‘Householder, do you stick fast or sink?’*1) 
<P>‘Good sir Ananda, not that I stick fast or sink. Yet, I have associated the 
Teacher and bhikkhus who develop the mind, but have not heard such a discourse 
before this.’ 
<P>Then venerable Sariputta said. ‘Householder, a discourse like this is not 
given to a lay person wearing white clothes.’ 
<P>‘Good sir, Sariputta, discourses like this should be given to lay persons 
wearing white clothes. There are clansmen, with few defiling things who 
deteriorate owing not hearing this sort of discourse. Hearing these they would 
know the Teaching.’ 
<P>Then, venerable Sariputta and venerable Ananda having advised the householder 
Anathapindika got up from their seats and went away. Soon after they had gone 
the householder Anathapindika died and was born with the happy ones.*2) Then 
Anathapindika, the son of gods, when the night was waning, illuminating Jeta’s 
grove completely with a resplendent light, approached the Blessed One, 
worshipped and stood on a side and said to the Blessed One. 
<P>‘This pleasant Jeta’s grove the home of sages in the Community 
<P>Adorned by the king of the Teaching arouses delight in me. 
<P>Beings that have death are purified by actions, knowledge 
<P>And a righteous, virtuous livelihood, but not by clan or wealth. 
<P>Therefore a wise one, seeing his own good, 
<P>Discriminating the Teaching, purifies himself 
<P>Of the bhikkhus, crossed over, the ones like Sariputta, 
<P>In wisdom, virtues and appeasement are the foremost.’ 
<P>Saying this, Anathapindika, the son of the gods waited for the Blessed One’s 
approval. Knowing the Teacher approves my words, worshipped the Blessed One and 
went round him with his right towards the Teacher and disappeared from there. 
Next day the Blessed One, addressed the bhikkhus. ‘Bhikkhus, a certain son of 
the gods when the night was waning, illuminating Jeta’s grove completely with a 
resplendent light, approached me worshipped and stood on a side and said. 
<P>‘This pleasant Jeta’s grove the home of sages in the Community 
<P>Adorned by the king of the Teaching arouses delight in me. 
<P>Beings that have death are purified by actions, knowledge 
<P>And a righteous, virtuous livelihood, but not by clan or wealth. 
<P>Therefore a wise one, seeing his own good, 
<P>Discriminating the Teaching, purifies himself 
<P>Of the bhikkhus, crossed over, the ones like Sariputta, 
<P>In wisdom, virtues and appeasement are the foremost.’ 
<P>Saying this, that son of the gods waited for my approval. Knowing that I 
approved his words, worshipped and went round me with his right towards me and 
disappeared from there. 
<P>Hearing this venerable Ananda said. ‘Venerable sir, is that Anathapindika, 
the son of the gods? The householder, Anathapindika was made happy by venerable 
Sariputta.’ 
<P>‘Good! Ananda, you are right. You have attained that much, which could be 
attained through reasoning. 
<P>He is no other, but Anathapindika the son of the gods’. 
<P>The Blessed One said thus and venerable Ananda delighted in the words of the 
Blessed One. 
<P>Notes. 1. Householder, do you stick fast or sink.’oliiyasi kho tva.m, 
gahapati, sa.msiidasi kho tva.m gahapati’ To stick fast is to crave for this 
world and to sink is to give up hopes. If either of these happened it is loss 
for the householder. Neither of them happened. 
<P>2. The happy ones.’tusita.m kaaya.m’ This is a group of gods who are always 
happy. <BR>&nbsp;
