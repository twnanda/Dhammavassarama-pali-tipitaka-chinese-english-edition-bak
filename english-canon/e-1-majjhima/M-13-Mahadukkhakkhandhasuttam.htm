<P><B>(13) The Major Mass of Unpleasantness.</B></CENTER>
<P><B>I </B>heard thus. 
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monasatery offered by Anaathapindika 
in Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi. That morning a large number of bhikkhus put on 
robes and taking bowls and robes entered Saavatthi for alms. Then it occured to 
those bhikkhus, it is too early to go for alms, what if we went to the monastery 
of the wandering ascetics . Then those bhikkhus went to the monastery of the 
wandering ascetics, exchanged friendly greetings and the bhikkhus sat on a side. 
Then the wandering ascetics said thus to the bhikkhus. Friends, the recluse 
Gotama points the accurate comprehension of sensuality, we too point the 
accurate comprehension of sensuality. The recluse Gotama points the accurate 
comprehension of matter, we too point the accurate comprehension of matter.The 
recluse Gotama points the accurate comprehension of feelings, we too point the 
accurate comprehension of feelings. So friends, what is the difference in the 
teaching and the advice given by our teacher and the recluse Gotama . Those 
bhikkhus, not pleased with those words of the wandering ascetics, and not able 
to protest, got up from their seats and went away thinking we will know the 
meaning of those words from the Blessed One. 
<P>Then those bhikkhus went the alms round in Saavatthi and after the meal was 
over and returning from the alms round approached the Blessed One and said thus: 
Venerable sir, this morning we put on robes and taking our bowls and robes 
entered Saavatthi for alms. Then it occured to us, it is too early to go the 
alms round, what if we went to the monastery of the wandering ascetics. Then we 
went to the monastery of the wandering ascetics, exchanged friendly greetings 
and sat on a side. To us seated the wandering ascetics said thus: Friends, the 
recluse Gotama points the accurate comprehension of sensuality, we too point the 
accurate comprehension of sensuality. The recluse Gotama points the accurate 
comprehension of matter, we too point the accurate comprehension of matter. The 
recluse Gotama points the accurate comprehension of feelings, we too point the 
accurate comprehension of feelings. So friends, what is the difference, in the 
teaching and the advice given by our teacher and the recluse Gotama. Venerable 
sir, we were not pleased with the words of the wandering ascetics, yet unable to 
protest we got up from our seats and came away thinking we will know the meaning 
of those words from the Blessed One. 
<P>Bhikkhus, to the wandering ascetics who say thus this is the reply. Friends, 
what is the satisfaction in sensuality, what is the danger in sensuality, what 
is the escape from sensuality.What is the satisfaction in matter, what is the 
danger in matter, what is the escape from matter. What is the satisfaction in 
feelings, what is the danger in feelings and what is the escape from feelings. 
Bhikkhus, when asked thus the wandering ascetics unable to reply become annoyed. 
What is the reason: Bhikkhus, it is beyond their range. In this world of gods 
and men together with the Maaras and Brahmaas and recluses and brahmins, I do 
not see anyone who could explain this other than the Thus Gone One, or a 
disciple of the Thus Gone One, or one who heard it here. . 
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the satisfaction in sensuality. Bhikkhus, fivefold are the 
strands of sensuality. What five: Exciting, agreeable, pleasant forms, arousing 
sensual desires, cognizable by eye consciousness. Exciting, agreeable, pleasant 
sounds, arousing sensual desires cognizable by ear consciousness. Exciting , 
agreeable , pleasant smells, arousing sensual desires cognizable by nose 
consciousness. Exciting, agreeable pleasant tastes, arousing sensual dessires 
cognizable by tongue consciousness. Exciting agreeable pleasant touches, 
arousing sensual desires congizable by body consciousness Whatever pleasantness 
and pleasure arises on account of these five strands of sensuality, that is the 
satisfaction in sensuality. 
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the danger in sensuality Whoever son of a clansman would 
have to make a living by some craft either handling money, or counting, or 
Mathematics, or farming, or trading, or rearing cattle, or ruling the country, 
or serving the king, or doing any other craft would have to under go cold and 
heat, the sting of gad flies and yellow flies, the heat of the air, the touch of 
creeping things, would have to bear hunger and thirst. This is the danger of 
sensuality here and now, the mass of unpleasantness owing to sensuality. This 
son of a clansman, strives and puts forth effort yet wealth does not accrue to 
him. He grieves and laments beats his breast and comes to bewilderment of mind. 
This son of a clansman strives and puts forth effort and wealth accrues to him, 
then he comes to unpleasantness and displeasure administrating ways and means to 
protect his wealth.What if the king carries away my wealth, or thieves run away 
with it, what if fire burns it or be carried away by water. Or if unwelcome 
heirs carry it away. Then his wealth is either carried away by the king or 
carried away by thieves, or burnt by fire, or carried away by water, or some 
unwelcome heirs carry it away and he grieves and comes to much unpleasantness 
and displeasure. Bhikkhus, this is the danger of sensuality here and now, the 
mass of unpleasantness owing to sensuality. 
<P>Again, bhikkhus, kings dispute with kings, warriors with warriors, brahmins 
with brahmins, householders with householders, mother disputes with the son, the 
son with the mother, the father with the son, the son with the father, brother 
with brother, brother with sister, sister with brother, friend with friend, They 
dispute quarrel and approach each other with hands, clods, sticks, weapons, and 
even face death, or come to deadly unpleasantness. This is the danger of 
sensuality here and now, the mass of unpleasantness owing to sensuality. 
<P>Again on account of sensuality the two parties, take swords and shields, bows 
and arrows, and other weapons and approach each other, throw slippery implements 
at each other, shoot arrows, swords flickering like lightening, boiling oil is 
sprinkled and each other is crushed with superior force, necks are cut and they 
face death or deathly unpleasantness. This too is the danger of sensuality here 
and now, the mass of unpleasaantness owing to sensuality. . 
<P>Again on account of sensuality, robbers break into houses, plunder, rob, stay 
in ambush, go to others’ wives,.. The king metes them punishment are caned and 
wipped, flogged with the jungle rope, flogged with the soiled stick, hands are 
severed, legs are severed, or both hands and legs are severed, ears and nose are 
severed, are put in the boiling gruel pot, shell tonsured, put in Raahu’s mouth, 
garlanded with the blazing garland, hands are scorched, the bark dress is given, 
put with snakes, putting hooks in the flesh, cutting pieces of flesh from the 
body, driving a spike from ear to ear, beating to make the body like straw, 
immersing in the boiling oil, giving to the dogs to be eaten, raising on a spike 
alive until death, and cutting the neck with the sword. This too is the danger 
of sensulaity here and now, the mass of unpleasantness owing to sensuality. 
<P>Again, bhikkhus, on account of sensuality, misbehaving in body, in words and 
mentally, after death are born in loss, in decrease are born in hell. This is 
the danger of sensuality here after, the mass of unpleasantness owing to 
sensuality 
<P>Bhikkkhus, what is the escape from sensuality, Whoever bhikkhu gives up the 
interest and greed for sensuality, that is the escape from sensuality. . 
<P>Bhikkhus, a recluse or brahmin who does not know the satisfaction of 
sensuality as the satisfaction , the danger of sensuality as the danger and the 
escape from sensuality as the escape, as it really is, would know sensuality 
himself accurately or teach others to attain accurate knowledge of sensuality is 
not a possibility. A recluse or brahmin, who knows the satisfaction of 
senssuality as the satisfaction, the danger of sensuality as the danger and the 
escape from sensuality as the escape, would know sensuality himself accurately 
or teach others to attain accurate knowledge of sensuality is a possibility. 
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the satisfaction of matter. Like a young girl of warrior 
caste, or brahmin caste, or of householder caste, in her fifteenth or sixteenth 
year, not too tall nor too short, not very thin nor very fat, not very dark nor 
very fair, that girl at that time has attained the highest pefection of beauty. 
Whatever pleasantness and pleasure arises on account of that perfection of 
beauty, that is the satisfaction in matter. 
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the danger of matter. That same sister with time becomes 
eighty years or ninety years or even a hundred years, and is seen decayed, bent 
like a rafter, shivering and supported on a stick, miserable all the youth gone, 
teeth broken, hair greyed, head bald, the skin wrinkled and spotted, all her 
earlier perfection of beauty vanished and the danger appeared. Bhikkhus, this is 
the danger of matter. That same sister is seen diseased, in unpleasantness, 
badly ill, immersed in her own urine and excreta, raised and laid by others. All 
her earlier perfection of beauty vanished and the danger appeared. Bhikkhus, 
this too is the danger of matter. Again, that same sister is seen dead abandoned 
in the charnel ground. After one, or two, or three days bloated, turned blue and 
festering , her earlier perfection of beauty vanished and danger appeared, this 
too is the danger of matter. Again, that same sister is seen abandoned in the 
charnel ground 
<P>devoured by crows, hawks, vultures or by dogs and foxes, or by various other 
living things, her earlier pefection of beauty vanished and danger appeaared, 
this too is the danger of matter. Again, that same sister would be seen 
abandoned in the charnel ground a skeleton with flesh and blood joined with 
veins.- Askeleton without flesh or blood joined with veins. Bones thrown every 
where, in one place a hand bone, in another a foot bone, in another a knee bone, 
in another a thigh bone, in another a hip bone, in another the back bone and in 
another the scull , her earlier perfection of beauty vanished and the danger 
appeaared.this too is the danger of matter. Again that sister is seen abandoned 
in the charnel ground , bones turned white the colour of shells, bones decayed 
after three years, -bones turned to dust. Her earlier perfection of beauty 
vanished and the danger appeared. Bhikkhus, this too is the danger of matter. 
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the escape from matter. The driving out of interest and 
greed, the dispelling of interest and greed for matter. That is the escape from 
matter. . 
<P>Bhikkhus, a recluse or brahmin who does not know the satisfaction of matter 
as the satisfaction , the danger of matter as the danger and the escape from 
matter as the escape, as it really is, would know matter himself accurately or 
teach others to attain accurate knowledge of matter is not a possibility. A 
recluse or brahmin, who knows the satisfaction of matter as the satisfaction, 
the danger of matter as the danger and the escape from matter as the escape, 
would know matter himself accurately or teach others to attain accurate 
knowledge of matter is a possibility. 
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the satisfaction in feelings: Here the bhikkhu secluded 
from sense desires, secluded.from demeritorious thoughts with thoughts and 
thought processes and with joy born of seclusion abides in the first jhaana. 
When the bhikkhu secluded from sense desires, secluded from demeritorious 
thoughts, with thoughts and thought processes and with joy born of seclusion 
abides in the first jhaana, he does not think to hurt himself, nor does he think 
to hurt others He does not think to hurt either. At such times he feels 
non-hurtful feelings only. Bhikkhus, I say, the satisfaction in feelings is the 
highest non-hurtfulness. 
<P>Again bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu overcoming thoughts and thought processes, 
the mind internally appeased , concentrated and in one point , without thoughts 
and thought processes and with joy born of concentration abides in the second. 
jhaana-- abides in the third jhaana - abides in the fourth jhaana. When the 
bhikkhu dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness, earlier having dispelled 
pleasure and displeassure, mindfulness purified with equanimity abides in the 
fourth jhaana, he does not think to hurt himself, nor does he think to hurt 
others. He does not think to hurt either. At such times he feels non-hurtful 
feelings only. Bhikkhus, I say, the satisfaction in feelings is the highest 
non-hurtfulness. 
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the danger in feelings. That feelings are impermanent, 
unpleasant, changing things that is the danger in feelings. 
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the escape from feelings. That giving up and dispelling of 
interest and greed for feelings that is the escape from feelings. 
<P>Bhikkhus, a recluse or brahmin who does not know the satisfaction of feelings 
as the satisfaction , the danger of feelings as the danger and the escape from 
feelings as the escape, as it really is, would know feelings himself accurately 
or teach others to attain accurate knowledge of feelings is not a possibility. A 
recluse or brahmin, who knows the satisfaction of feelings as the satisfaction, 
the danger of feelings as the danger and the escape from feelings as the escape, 
would know feelings himself accurately or teach others to attain accurate 
knowledge of feelings is a possibility. 
<P>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the 
Blessed One. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;
