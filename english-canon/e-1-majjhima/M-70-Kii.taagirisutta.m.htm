<P class=MsoBodyText>I heard thus.At one time, the Blessed One was touring 
Kashmire with a large community of bhikkhus. Then the Blessed One addressed, 
those bhikkhus: Bhikkhus, I refrain from food at night and experience few 
affictions, few illnesses, lightness, power, and a pleasant living. Come! 
Bhikkhus, you too refrain from food at night and experience few afflictions, few 
illnesses, lightness, power and a pleasant abiding. Those bhikkhus agreed. Then 
the Blessed One touring in stages arrived in a hamlet named Kitagiri in 
Kashmire.At that time a bhikkhu named Assaji-Punabbasuka was a resident of 
Kitagiri. Then many bhikkhus approached the bhikkhu Assaji-Punabbasuka and said 
thus: Friend, the Blessed One and the Community of bhikkhus refrain from food at 
night and experience few affictions, few illnesses, lightness, power, and a 
pleasant living. Come! Bhikkhu, you too, refrain from food at night and 
experience few afflictions, few illnesses, lightness, power and a pleasant 
abiding When this was said, the bhikkhu Assaji-punabbasuka said thus to those 
bhikkhus. Friends, we partake food in the evening, early in the morning, during 
the day and at untimely hours. Partaking in this manner we experience few 
afflictions, few illnesses, lightness, power and a pleasant abiding. Why should 
we, give up, what we, experience here and now, and go after, new 
experiences.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Those bhikkhus, not 
able to convince the bhikkhu Assaji-Punabbasuka, approached the Blessed One, 
worshipped, sat on a side and said to the Blessed One.Venerable sir, we 
approached the bhikkhu Assaji-Punabbasuka and said to him. Friend, the Blessed 
One and the Community of bhikkhus refrain from food at night and experience few 
affictions, few illnesses, lightness, power, and a pleasant living. Bhikkhu, you 
too, refrain from food at night and experience few afflictions, few illnesses, 
lightness, power and a pleasant abiding. When this was said, the bhikkhu 
Assaji-punabbasuka said thus to us. Friends, we partake food in the evening, 
early in the morning, during the day and at untimely hours. Partaking in this 
manner we experience few afflictions, few illnesses, lightness, power and a 
pleasant abiding. Why should we, give up, what we know here and now, and go for 
new experiences? Venerable sir, as we could not convince the bhikkhu 
Assaji-Punabbasukha, we came to inform this to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed 
One addressed a certain bhikkhu. Come bhikkhu! tell the bhikkhu 
Assaji-Punabbasuka in my words, the Teacher wants you. That bhikkhu agreed, 
approached the bhikkhu Assaji-Punabbasuka and said to him: The Teacher wants 
you. The bhikkhu Assaji-Punabbasuka agreeing approached the Blessed One, 
worshipped and sat on a side. Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhu 
Assaji-punabbasuka: Bhikkhu, is it true that, many bhikkhus approached you and 
said to you, friend, the Blessed One and the Community of bhikkhus refrain from 
food at night and experience few affictions, few illnesses, lightness, power, 
and a pleasant living? . Come! Bhikkhu, you too, refrain from food at night and 
experience few afflictions, few illnesses, lightness, power and a pleasant 
abiding. Did you say this to them. Friends, we partake food in the evening, 
early in the morning, during the day and at untimely hours. Partaking in this 
manner we know of few afflictions, few illnesses, lightness, power and a 
pleasant abiding. Why should I, give up, what I know, here and now, to seek new 
experiences?. I said, Venerable sir. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhikkhus, do you 
know this Teaching preached by me: Whatever this person feels, pleasant, 
unpleasant, or neither unpleasant-nor pleasant feelings, to him, there is 
decrease and increase of merit and demerit. No, venerable sir, we do not know 
this. Bhikkhus, do you not know this Teaching preached by me: When a person 
experiences a certain kind of pleasant feeling, demerit increases, merit 
decreases. When a person experiences a certain kind of pleasant feeling, demerit 
decreases, merit increases. When a person experiences a certain kind of 
unpleasant feeling, demerit increases, merit decreases.. When a person 
experiences a certain kind of unpleasant feeling, demerit decreases, merit 
increases.. When a person experiences a certain kind of neither 
unpleasant-nor-pleasant feeling, demerit increases, merit decreases. When a 
person experiences a certain kind of neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant feeling, 
demerit decreases, merit increases? Yes, we know it, venerable sir. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhikkhus, good, that 
you have understood it. If I had not known, seen, experienced, realized it and 
mentally touched, a certain person experiencing, such a kind of pleasant feeling 
increase demerit and decrease merit. Not knowing it, I would have said, give up 
that kind of pleasant feeling. Yet to a person like me, is it suitable to do.so? 
No, venerable sir. Since, bhikkhus, I have known, seen, experienced, realized 
and mentally touched a certain person experiencing such a kind of pleasant 
feeling, increase demerit and decrease merit I say dispel such a kind of 
pleasant feeling.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>If I had not known, 
seen, experienced, realized it and mentally touched, a certain person 
experiencing such a kind of pleasant feeling decrease demerit and increase meit. 
Not knowing I would have said, pursue that kind of pleasant feeling. Yet to a 
person like me, is it suitable? No, venerable sir. Since, bhikkhus, I have 
known, seen, experienced, realized and mentally touched, a certain person 
experiencing such a kind of pleasant feeling decrease demerit and increase 
merit, I say pursue such a kind of pleasant feeling.

kind of pleasant feeling. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhikkhus, I do not 
ask all bhikkhus to abide diligently, neither do I ask all bhikkhus not to abide 
diligently. To those bhikkhus, who are perfect, have destroyed desires, lived 
the holy life, done what should be done, have put down the weight, have come to 
the highest good, have destroyed the bonds ‘to be’ and released rightfully 
knowing, to such bhikkhus, I do not say abide diligently. What is the reason: 
They have done what should be done diligently, and it is impossible that they 
should be negligent. Bhikkhus, as for those trainers, not yet attained to the 
highest end of the yoke, and abiding aiming it, to such bhikkhus, I say, abide 
diligently. What is the reason? These venerable ones partaking of suitable 
dwellings, associating good friends, and with the development of their 
faculties, for whatever reason these sons of clansmen left the household and 
became homeless, that highest end of the holy life, they here and now realize 
and abide. Bhikkhus, seeing these results of diligence I tell these 
bhikkhus<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>to be diligent. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhikkhus, there are 
seven persons evident in the world: What seven: those released both ways, 
released through wisdom, those with body witness, those come to righteousness of 
view, those released in faith, those living according to the Teaching, and those 
living according to faith. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhikkhus, who is 
released both ways: Here bhikkhus, a certain person experiences with the body 
those immaterial attainments and also with wisdom sees the destruction of 
desires.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>To such a one is 
said released both ways. Bhikkhus, to such ones, I do not say abide diligently. 
What is the reason: They have done it diligently and it is impossible that they 
be negligent. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhikkhus, who is 
released through wisdom? Bhikkhus, a certain person does not .experience those 
immaterial attainments with the body, seeing with wisdom his desires are 
destroyed. To this one is said, released through wisdom. Bhikkhus, to such a one 
too I do not say, abide diligently. What is the reason: They have done it 
diligently and it is impossible that they be negligent. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhikkhus, who 
witneses with the body? Bhikkhus, a certain person experiences<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>those immaterial attainments with the body. 
Some of his desires are destroyed seeing with wisdom Bhikkhus, this one is a 
body witness. To this bhikkhu I say, there is something to be done diligently. 
What is the reason? Bhikkhus, this one partaking of suitable dwellings, 
associating good friends, and with the development of his faculties, for 
whatever reason this son<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>of a clansman 
left the household and became homeless, that highest end of the holy life, he 
here and now, would<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>realize and abide. 
Seeing these results of diligence I tell<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>this<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>bhikkhu,<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>to be diligent. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhikkhus, who is the 
person come to righteousness of view. Here, bhikkhus, a certain person does not 
.experience those immaterial attainments with the body, seeing with wisdom some 
of his desires are destroyed. Through wisdom he sees the Teaching of the Thus 
Gone One, and behaves accordingly. Bhikkhus, to this one is said, come to 
righteousness of view To this bhikkhu I say, there is something to be done 
diligently. What is the reason? Bhikkhus, this one partaking of suitable 
dwellings, associating good friends, and with the development of his faculties, 
for whatever reason this son<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>of a clansman 
left the household and became homeless, that highest end of the holy life, he 
here and now, would<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>realize and abide. 
Seeing these good results of diligence I tell this bhikkhu to be diligent. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhikkhus, who is the 
person released in faith? : Here, bhikkhus, a certain person does not 
experience<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>those immaterial attainments 
with the body, and seeing with wisdom some of his desires are destroyed. His 
faith in the Thus Gone One is thoroughly established, well rooted. To this one 
is said, released in faith. To this bhikkhu too I say, there is something to be 
done diligently. What is the reason: Bhikkhus, this one partaking of suitable 
dwellings, associating good friends, and with the development of his faculties, 
for whatever reason this clansman left the household and became homeless, that 
highest end of the holy life, he here and now, will realize and abide. Seeing 
these good results of diligence I tell this bhikkhu to be diligent. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhikkhus, who is the 
person living according to the Teaching. : Here, bhikkhus, a certain person does 
not experience those immaterial attainments with the body. His desires are not 
destroyed, not seeing with wisdom. He is convinced in the Teaching of the Thus 
Gone One to a certain extent, by wisely thinking about it..Yet to him there are 
the faculties of faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration and wisdom. To this 
one is said, living according to the Teaching. To this bhikkhu too I say, there 
is something to be done diligently. What is the reason: Bhikkhus, this one 
partaking of suitable dwellings, associating good friends, and with the 
development of his faculties, for whatever reason this clansman left the 
household and became homeless, that highest end of the holy life, he here and 
now, would realize and abide. Seeing these good results for diligence I tell 
this bhikkhu to be diligent. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhikkhus, who is the 
person living according to faith? Bhikkhus, a certain person does not experience 
the immaterial attainments with the body.His desires are not destroyed, not 
seeing with wisdom.He has some faith and love for the Thus Gone One Yet to him 
there are the faculties of faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration and 
wisdom<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>To this one is said, living 
according to faith. To this bhikkhu too I say, there is something to be done 
diligently. What is the reason: Bhikkhus, this one partaking of suitable 
dwellings, associating good friends, and with the development of his faculties, 
for whatever reason this clansman left the household and became homeless, that 
highest end of the holy life, he here and now, will realize. Seeing these good 
results for diligence, I tell this bhikkhu to be diligent. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhikkhus, I do not 
convince of perfection right at the beginning. It is a gradual ascent, with 
gradual training, action, and follow up. Bhikkhus, how does the conviction of 
perfection come about with gradual training, action, and follow up? Bhikkhus, 
someone approaches when faith is born. Then he associates. Associating lends 
ear. Listening bears the Teaching. Bearing the Teaching examines the meanings. 
Examining the meanings some conviction arises. Pleased with that conviction an 
interest arises for the Teaching. With interest there is effort. With that 
effort there is weighing. Weighing realises the highest truth with the body, and 
wisely penetrates it. Bhikkhus, without faith, there is no approach..Without the 
approach there is no association. Without association there is no lending ear. 
Without lending ear there is no listening, Without listenning, the Teaching is 
not borne in the mind. Without bearing the Teaching there is no examining of the 
meanings. Without an examination, there is no conviction. Without a conviction, 
there is no interest. Without an interest, there is no effort. Without effort 
there is no discrimination..Without discrimination there is no weighing. Without 
weighing, there is no confrontration. Those gone astray are on the wrong track. 
Bhikkhus, the foolish, not interested in this dispensation of Teaching, how far 
have they strayed?. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhikkhus, there is 
an explanation given with four lines.through which the wise learn the meaning 
quickly. Explain it bhikkhus, do you know it? Venerable sir, do we<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>know the Teaching to explain? Bhikkhus, if a 
Teacher honours materiality, leaves a material heritage, abides engrossed in 
materiality, these doings and non-doings, occur to him. That is to us, we will 
do that, that is not to us, we will not do that. Bhikkhus, if the Thus Gone One 
abides unyoked from all materiality, to the disciple with faith in the 
dispensation of the Teacher penetration into the Teaching is lawfulness. The 
Blessed One is the Teacher, we, his disciples. The Blessed One knows, we do not 
know. Bhikkhus, to the disciple with faith in the dispensation of the Teacher 
the essentials for growth and penetration into the Teaching are there. Bhikkhus, 
to the disciple with faith in the dispensation of the Teacher, the penetration 
into the teaching is lawful. Let skin, nerves, and bones remain, let the body 
dry up with the flesh and blood, that which should be attained by manly 
strength, manly effort and manly power should be attained. I will not give up 
the inner effort without attaining it. Bhikkhus, to the disciples with faith in 
the dispensaton of the Teacher yoked to penetration, one of these results could 
be expected. Either perfection here and now, or with susbstratum remaining 
mindfulness of not returning.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The Blessed One said 
thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One.
