<P><B>149. The Longer Discourse on the six spheres.</B></CENTER>
<P><BR><BR><BR>
<P>I heard thus. 
<P>At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by 
Anathapindika in Jeta’s grove in Savatthi and addressed the bhikkhus from there. 
‘Bhikkhus, I will preach the discourse on the six spheres. Listen carefully and 
attentively. Bhikkhus, to someone who does not learn and realize, eye, forms, 
eye-consciousness, eye contact and whatever feelings, pleasant or unpleasant or 
neither unpleasant nor pleasant born of eye contact, as they really are. There 
arise attachments for eye, forms, eye-consciousness, eye contact and whatever 
feelings pleasant or unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant born of that 
eye contact. This deluded one, abiding attached to these as satisfactory and 
agreeable accumulate in the five holding masses for the future. His craving too 
grows with interest and greed to be here and there in the future.. His bodily 
and mental troubles, anxiety and laments increase. Further he experiences bodily 
and mental unpleasantness. 
<P>To someone who does not learn and realize ear, sounds,…re…nose, scents, 
..re.. tongue, tastes,..re… body, touches,….re…. mind, thoughts, 
mind-consciousness, mind contact and whatever feelings pleasant or unpleasant or 
neither unpleasant nor pleasant born of mind contact, as they really are. There 
arises attachment for mind, thoughts, mind-consciousness, mind contact and 
whatever feelings pleasant or unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant born 
of that mind contact. This deluded one abiding attached to these as satisfactory 
and agreeable accumulates in the five holding masses for the future. His craving 
too grows with interest and greed to be here and there in the future. His bodily 
and mental troubles, anxiety and laments increase. Further he experiences bodily 
and mental unpleasantness. 
<P>To someone who learns and realizes, eye, forms, eye-consciousness, eye 
contact and whatever feelings pleasant or unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor 
pleasant born of eye contact, as they really are. Attachment does not arise for 
eye, forms, eye-consciousness, eye contact and whatever feelings pleasant or 
unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant born of that eye contact. This one 
not attached, unyoked and not deluded, abiding seeing the danger does not 
accumulate in the five holding masses for the future. His craving, interest and 
greed, to be here and there in the future, cease. His bodily and mental 
troubles, anxiety and laments cease. Further he experiences bodily and mental 
pleasantness. Whatever his view, it becomes right view. Whatever his thoughts, 
they become right thoughts. Whatever his speech it becomes right speech. 
Whatever his actions, they become right actions. Whatever his effort, it becomes 
right effort. Whatever his mindfulness, it becomes right mindfulness. Whatever 
his concentration, it becomes right concentration. Even earlier his livelihood 
was purified on account of his bodily and verbal actions. His Noble Eightfold 
path by development gets completed. When he develops the Noble Eightfold path, 
the four establishments of mindfulness get completed. So also, the four right 
exertions, the four super-normal powers, the five mental faculties, the five 
powers and the seven enlightenment factors by development get completed. The two 
things calm and insight proceed to him yoked. Whatever things should be 
dispelled knowing deeply, those are known from the depth and dispelled. Whatever 
things should be developed knowing deeply, those are known from the depth and 
developed. Whatever things should be realized knowing deeply, those are known 
from the depth and realized. Bhikkhus, what things should be thoroughly known 
from the depth? The reply is the five holding masses, such as the holding mass 
of matter, the holding mass of feelings, the holding mass of perceptions, the 
holding mass of determinations and the holding mass of consciousness. Bhikkhus, 
what things should be dispelled knowing from the depth? Ignorance and the 
craving 'to be’ should be dispelled knowing deeply. Bhikkhus, what things should 
be developed knowing deeply? Calm and insight should be developed knowing 
deeply. Bhikkhus, what things should be realized knowing deeply? Knowledge and 
release should be realized knowing deeply. 
<P>. To someone who learns and realizes, ear, sounds, ….re…. nose, scents,…re… 
tongue, tastes,..re… mind, thoughts, mind-consciousness, mind contact and 
whatever feelings pleasant or unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant born 
of mind contact, as they really are. Attachment does not arise for mind, 
thoughts, mind-consciousness, mind contact and whatever feelings pleasant or 
unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant born of that mind contact. Not 
attached, unyoked and not deluded he abides seeing the danger and does not 
accumulate in the five holding masses for the future. His craving, interest and 
greed, to be here and there in the future, cease. His bodily and mental 
troubles, anxiety and laments cease. Further he experiences bodily and mental 
pleasantness. Whatever his view, it becomes right view. Whatever his thoughts, 
they become right thoughts. Whatever his speech it becomes right speech. 
Whatever his actions, they become right actions. Whatever his effort, it becomes 
right effort. Whatever his mindfulness, it becomes right mindfulness. Whatever 
his concentration, it becomes right concentration. Even earlier his livelihood 
was purified on account of his bodily and verbal actions. His Noble Eightfold 
path by development gets completed. When he develops the Noble Eightfold path, 
the four establishments of mindfulness get completed. So also, the four right 
exertions, the four super-normal powers, the five mental faculties, the five 
powers and the seven enlightenment factors by development get completed. The two 
things calm and insight proceed to him yoked. Whatever things should be 
dispelled knowing deeply, those are known from the depth and dispelled. Whatever 
things should be developed knowing deeply, those are known from the depth and 
developed. Whatever things should be realized knowing deeply, those are known 
from the depth and realized. Bhikkhus, what things should be thoroughly known 
from the depth? The reply is the five holding masses, such as the holding mass 
of matter, the holding mass of feelings, the holding mass of perceptions, the 
holding mass of determinations and the holding mass of consciousness. Bhikkhus,

be developed knowing deeply? Calm and insight should be developed knowing 
deeply. Bhikkhus, what things should be realized knowing deeply? Knowledge and 
release should be realized knowing deeply. 
<P>The Blessed One said thus, and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the 
Blessed One.
