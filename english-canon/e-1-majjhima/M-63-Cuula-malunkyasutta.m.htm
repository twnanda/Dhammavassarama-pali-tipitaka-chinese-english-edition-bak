<P class=MsoBodyText>I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One was living in the 
monastery offered by Anathapindika in Jet’s grove in Savatthi. When venerable 
Malunkhyaputta was in his seclusion this thought occurred to him These views are 
unexplained, put aside by the Blessed One: Is the world eternal or not eternal, 
is it limited or unlimited? Is the soul and body the same, is the soul different 
from the body? Is the Thus Gone One after death. Isn’t the Thus Gone One after 
death? Or is it the Thus Gone One is and isn’t after death? Or the Thus Gone One 
neither is, nor is not after death? I do not like these things unexplained by 
the Blessed One. If the Blessed One explains them, I will lead the holy life 
under him, or else I will give up robes. These were the thoughts and discurcive 
thoughts that occurred to venerable Malunkhyaputta in his seclusion 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then venerable 
Malunkhyaputta got up from his seclusion, approached.the Blessed One, worshipped 
and sat on a side and said, ‘Venerable sir, in my seclusion this thought 
occurred to me These views are unexplained and put aside by the Blessed One: Is 
the world eternal or not? Is it limited or unlimited, Is the soul and body the 
same, or is the soul different from the body? Is the Thus Gone One after death? 
Isn’t the Thus Gone One after death? Or is it, the Thus Gone One is and isn’t 
after death? Or is it, the Thus Gone One neither is nor is not after death? I do 
not like these things unexplained by the Blessed One. If the Blessed One 
explains them, to me, I will lead the holy life, otherwise I will give up robes: 
If the Blessed One knows the world is eternal, may the Blessed One declare the 
world is eternal. If the Blessed One knows, the world is not eternal may the 
Blessed One declare the world is not eternal. If the Blessed One does not know 
whether the world is eternal or not eternal, he should be straightforward and 
say I do not know and see this. : If the Blessed One knows the world is limited, 
may the Blessed One declare the world is limited. If the Blessed One knows the 
world is not limited, may the Blessed One declare the world is not limited. If 
the Blessed One does not know whether the world is limited or not limited he 
should be straightforward and say I do not know and see this. : If the Blessed 
One knows whether the soul and body is the same. May the Blessed One declare the 
soul and body is the same. If the Blessed One knows, the soul is different from 
the body, may the Blessed One declare the soul is different from the body If the 
Blessed One does not know whether the soul and body is the same or the soul is 
different from body. He should be straightforward and say I do not know and see 
this. If the Blessed One knows the Thus Gone One is after death, may the Blessed 
One declare the Thus Gone One is after death. If the Blessed One knows The Thus 
Gone One is not after death, may the Blessed One declare, the Thus Gone One is 
not after death If the Blessed One does not know whether the Thus Gone One is 
after death or the Thus Gone One is not after death. Should be straightforward 
and say, I do not know and see this. : If the Blessed One knows the Thus Gone 
One is not after death, may the Blessed One declare the Thus Gone One is not 
after death. If the Blessed One does not know, The Thus Gone One is, or is not 
after death, should be straightforward and say I do not know and see this. If 
the Blessed One knows the Thus Gone One is, and is not after death, may the 
Blessed One declare the Thus Gone One is, and is not after death. If the Blessed 
One does not know The Thus Gone One neither is nor is not after death, may the 
Blessed One declare, the Thus Gone One neither is nor is not after death.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>If the Blessed One does not know whether the 
Thus Gone One neither is, nor is not after death or the Thus Gone One neither is 
not or is not, not that after death, he should be straightforward and say I do 
not know and see this: 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Malunkhyaputta, did 
I tell you, Come Malunkhyaputta lead the holy life in my dispensation I will 
declare to you, whether the world is eternal or not eternal The Thus Gone One 
neither is not or is not, not that after death.? No, venerable sir. Then did you 
tell me, venerable sir, I will lead the holy life in your dispensation if you 
declare to me whether the world is eternal or not?<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The Thus Gone One neither is not, nor is not 
that, after death? No, venerable sir.Malunkhyaputta, I did not ask you to lead 
the holy life in my dispensation, with a promise to declare to you whether the 
world is eternal or not eternal and the thus Gone One neither is not or is not, 
not that after death and you did not tell me venerable sir, I will lead the holy 
life in your dispensation if you declare to me whether the world is eternal or 
not eternal and The Thus Gone One neither is not nor is not, not that after 
death. When this is so, what is the reason to give up robes? 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Malunkhyaputta, if 
some one were to say I will not lead the holy life in the dispensation of the 
Blessed One until it is declared to me whether the world is eternal or not and 
the Thus Gone One neither is not nor is not, not that after death. Those things 
would never be declared by the Thus Gone One, and that person would die. It is 
like a man shot with a poisoned arrow, and his friends, co-associates and blood 
relations would call a surgeon to attend on him. He would say, I will not pull 
out this arrow until I know, the one who shot this arrow is of warrior, brahmin, 
householder or out castes’ clan. I will not pull out this arrow until, I knew, 
the name and family of the one who shot this arrow. I will not pull out this 
arrow until, I knew whether the one who shot this arrow is short or tall or of 
middling size. I will not pull out, this arrow until, I knew whether the one who 
shot this arrow is dark, or fair or tan. I will not pull out this arrow until, I 
knew the town, village or the hamlet from which he came. I will not pull out 
this arrow until, I knew the kind of bow used, I will not pull out the arrow 
until, I knew the kind of string used for the bow.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>I will not pull out this arrow until, I knew 
the kind of shaft used to shoot. Malunkhyaputta, this man will die before he 
knew all this In the same manner, Malunkhyaputta, if anyone was to say I will 
not lead the holy life in the dispensation of the Blessed One until, it is 
declared to me whether the world is eternal or not and The Thus Gone One neither 
is not nor is not, not that after death..Those things will never be declared by 
the Thus Gone One, and that person will die. 
<P class=MsoBodyText>Malunkhyaputta, with the view, the world is eternal, a holy 
life is not lead, even with the view the world is not eternal, a holy life is 
not lead. Malunkhyaputta, with<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>the view 
the world is eternal or even the world is not eternal, there is birth, decay, 
death, grief, lament, unpleasantness and displeasure, I declare he is destroyed 
here and now. Malunkhyaputta, with the view, the world is limited, a holy life 
is not lead, even with the view the world is not limited, a holy life is not 
lead. Malunkhyaputta, with the view the world is limited or even the world is 
not limited, there is birth, decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness and 
displeasure, I declare he is destroyed here and now. Malunkhyaputta, with the 
view, the soul and body is the same, a holy life is not lead, even with the view 
the soul is different from the body, a holy life is not lead. Malunkhyaputta, 
with the view, the soul and body is the same or even with the view the soul is 
different from the body, there is birth, decay, death, grief, lament, 
unpleasantness and displeasure, I declare he is destroyed here and now.<SPAN

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Malunkhyaputta, with 
the view, the Thus Gone One is, after death, a holy life is not lead. Even with 
the view the Thus Gone One is not after death, a holy life is not lead. 
Malunkhyaputta, with the view the Thus Gone One is after death or even the view 
the Thus Gone One is not after death, there is birth, decay, death, grief, 
lament, unpleasantness and distress. I declare he is destroyed here and now 
Malunkhyaputta, with the view, the Thus Gone One is and is not after death, a 
holy life is not lead. Even with the view the Thus Gone One neither is, nor is 
not after death. A holy life is not lead. Malunkhyaputta, with the view the Thus 
Gone One is and is not after death or even the view the Thus Gone One neither is 
nor is not after death, there is birth, decay, death, grief, lament, 
unpleasantness and distress.I declare he is destroyed here and now. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Therefore 
Malunkhyaputta, bear the undeclared as undeclared.Malunkhyaputta, what are the 
not declared? The world is eternal, is not declared by me. The world is not 
eternal, is limited, is not limited. The soul and body are the same. The soul is 
different from the body. The Thus Gone One is, after death. The Thus Gone One, 
is not after death. The Thus Gone One is and is not after death. The Thus Gone 
One neither is, nor is not after death, are not declared by me.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Malunkhyaputta, why are these not declared by 
me? They are not the essential for the principles of the holy life, they do not 
lead to turning away, to detachment, to cessation, to appeasement, to 
realisation, to enlightenment and to extinction. Malunkhyaputta, what are the 
declared by me? This, is unpleasant, is declared. This, is its arising, is 
delcared. This, is its cessation is declared. This is the path to its cessation, 
is declared. Malunkhyaputta, why are these declared by me? These are the 
essentials for the principles of the holy life, they lead to turning away, to 
detachment, to cessation, to appeasement, to realisation, to enlightenment and 
to extinction. Malunkhyaputta, I declare them. Bear the undeclared as undeclared 
and the declared as declared.

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>I heard thus. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>At one time the 
Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anathapindika in Jeta’s grove 
in Savatthi. From there the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: Bhikkhus, do you 
remember the five lower bonds of the sensual world preached by me. When this was 
said, venerable Malunkhyaputta said to the Blessed One.Venerable sir, I remember 
the five lower bonds of the sensual world preached by the Blessed One. 
Malunkhyaputta, what do you remember of the five lower bonds of the sensual 
world preached by me? Venerable sir, I remember self view, doubts holding to 
virtues as the highest aim, sensual interest and anger as lower bonds of the 
sensual world preached by the Blessed One. I remember these five lower bonds of 
the sensual world preached by the Blessed One. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Malunkhyaputta, to 
whom do you know me preaching, the lower bonds of the sensual world in this 
manner. Wouldn’t the ascetics of other sects find fault with this foolish 
example. To a toddler, who moves about with difficulty, there is not even a 
self. How could a view arise about a self? The latent tendencies of a self view 
filter to him.*1)<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Maalunkhyaputta, to a 
toddler who moves about with difficulty, there are not even thoughts. How could 
doubts arise to him about thoughts? The latent tendency to doubt, filter to him. 
To a toddler who moves about with difficulty there are not even virtues. How 
could there be a holding to virtues as high?.The latent tendency to hold to 
virtues as high filter to him. Malunkhyaputta, to a toddler there is not even 
sensual desires..How could there be interest for sensual desires?. The latent 
tendencies to greed for sensual interest filter to him.Malunkhyaputta, to a 
toddler beings don’t matter. How could he have anger towards beings? The latent 
tendencies to get angry filter to him. Malunkhyaputta, wouldn’t the ascetics of 
other sects find fault with this foolish example. Then venerable Ananda, said to 
the Blessed One. Venerable sir, this is the time to teach the five lower bonds 
of the sensual world. The bhikkhus hearing it from the Blessed One will bear it 
in mind. Then Ananda, listen I will teach said the Blessed One and venerable 
Ananda agreed. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Ananda, the ordinary 
man who hasn’t seen noble ones, and Great Men not clever in their Teaching and 
not trained in their Teaching abides with a mind overcome with a view of a self. 
He does not know the escape from that arisen view of a self, as it really is. 
That view of self stands firm and untamed, as a lower bond of the sensual world. 
He abides with a mind, overcome with doubts. Not knowing the escape from arisen 
doubts as it really is. Those doubts stand firm and untamed, as a lower bond of 
the sensual world. Abiding with a mind that has taken virtues as high, not 
knowing the escape from the arisen esteem for virtues as it really is. The high 
esteem for virtues becomes firm and untamed, as a lower bond of the sensual 
world. Abiding with a mind overcome by sensual greed, does not know the escape 
from arisen sensual greed, as it really is. That sensual greed stands firm and 
untamed, as a bond of the lower sensual world. Abiding with a mind overcome with 
anger. Does not know the escape from arisen anger as it really is. That anger 
stands firm and untamed, as a lower bond of the sensual world. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Ananda, the learned 
noble disciple who has seen noble ones, and Great Men, clever in their Teaching 
and trained in their Teaching abides with a mind not overcome with the view of a 
self. He knows the escape from the arisen view of a self, as it really is. His 
view of the self, fades together with the latent tendencies. Not abiding with a 
mind, overcome with doubts, knows the escape from arisen doubts as it really is. 
His doubts fade together with the latent tendencies. Not thinking that virtues 
are of high esteem, knows the escape from the arisen high esteem of virtues as 
it really is and the high esteem for virtues fades, together with the latent 
tendencies. Abiding with a mind not overcome by sensual greed knows the escape 
from arisen sensual greed as it really is. That sensual greed fades from him 
together with the latent tendencies. Abiding with a mind, not overcome by anger, 
knows the escape from arisen anger as it really is, and that anger fades 
together with the latendencies. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Ananda, this is the 
path and method, to overcome the lower bonds of the sensual world. It is not 
possible that one could, knowing and seeing overcome the lower bonds of the 
sensual world without coming to this path and method. It is like one come to a 
huge standing tree with heartwood, would cut the heartwood without removing the 
bark and sapwood. That is not possible, in the same manner, it is not possible 
that one could know, see and overcome the lower bonds of the sensual world, 
without coming to this path and method. Ananda, this is the path and method to 
overcome the lower bonds of the sensual world. It is possible that one would 
know, see and overcome the lower bonds of the sensual world coming to this path 
and method. It is like someone come to a huge standing tree with heartwood, 
would cut the bark and sapwood and then take the heartwood. That is possible. In 
the same manner, come to this path and method, it is possible that one would 
know, see and overcome the lower bonds of the sensual world. Like a weak man 
come to the bank of river Ganges, full to the brim with over flowing banks would 
say I will cut the stream of the river, with my hands and safely cross the 
river. It is not posssible that he would cross the river. In the same manner, 
when the Teaching is given for the cessation of the view, of self, the mind does 
not spring, delight and settle to be released. It should be known as the nature 
of that weak man. Like a strong man come to the bank of river Ganges, full to 
the brim with over flowing banks would say I will cut the stream of the river, 
with my hands and safely cross the river. It is posssible that he would cross 
the river. In the same manner, Ananda, when the Teaching is given for the 
cessation of the view, of self, the mind springs, delights and settles to be 
released, it should be known as the nature of the strong man.. .<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Ananda, what is the 
path and method, to dispel the lower bonds of the sensual world? Ananda, the 
bhikkhu secluding the mind thoroughly, by dispelling things of demerit, removes 
all bodily transgressions that bring remorse. Then secluding the mind, from 
sensual thoughts and thoughts of demerit, with thoughts and discursive thoughts 
and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion abides in the first jhana. 
Established in it he reflects all things that matter, all feelings, all 
perceptive things, all intentions, all conscious signs are impermanent, 
unpleasant, an illness, an abscess, an arrow, a misfortune, an ailment, foreign, 
destined for destruction, is void, and devoid of a self. Then he turns the mind 
to the deathless element: This is peaceful, this is exalted, such as the 
appeasement of all determinations, the giving up of all endearments, the 
destruction of craving, detachment, cessation and extinction*1). With that mind 
he comes to the destruction of desires. If he does not destroy desires on 
account of greed and interest for those same things. He arises spontaneously, 
with the destruction of the five lower bonds, of the sensual world, not to 
proceed. Ananda, this too is a method for overcoming the five lower bonds of the 
sensual world.. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Again, Ananda, the 
bhikkhu overcoming thoughts and thought processes, the mind internally appeased, 
in one point, without thoughts and thought processes and with joy and 
pleasantness born of concentration, abides in the second jhana--- in the third 
jhana—in the fourth jhana.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Attained to it, 
he reflects all things that matter, all feelings, all perceptive things, all 
intentions, all conscious signs are impermanent, unpleasant, an illness, an 
abscess, an arrow, a misfortune, an ailment, foreign, destined for destruction, 
is void, and devoid of a self. Then he turns the mind to the deathless

those same things he arises spontaneously, with the destruction of the five 
lower bonds of the sensual world, not to proceed. Ananda, this too is a method 
for overcoming the five lower bonds for the sensual world. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Again, Ananda, the 
bhikkhu overcoming all perceptions of matter and anger, not attending to various 
perceptions, with space is boundless abides in the sphere of space. Attained to 
it, he reflects all things that matter, all feelings, all perceptive things, all 
intentions, all conscious signs, are impermanent, unpleasant, an illness, an 
abscess, an arrow, a misfortune, an ailment, foreign, destined for destruction, 
void, devoid of a self.. Then he turns the mind to the deathless element: This

lower bonds not to proceed. Ananda, this too is a method for overcoming the five 
lower bonds for the sensual world. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Again, Ananda, the 
bhikkhu overcoming all peceptions of space, with consciousness is boundless, 
abides in the sphere of consciousness.--overcoming all the sphere of 
conscioussness, with there is nothing, abides in the sphere of no-thingness 
Attained to it he reflects all things that matter, all feelings, all perceptive 
things, all intentions, all conscious signs::are impermanent, unpleasant, an 
illness,<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>an abscess, an arrow, a 
misfortune, an ailment, foreign, destined for destruction, void, devoid of a 
self. Then he turns the mind to the deathless element: This is peaceful, this is 
exalted, such as the appeasement of all determinations, the giving up of all 
endearments, the destruction of craving, detachment, cessation and extinction. 
With that mind he comes to the destruction of desires. If he does not destroy 
desires on account of greed and interest for those same things, he arises 
spontaneously with the destruction of the five lower bonds not to proceed. 
Ananda, this too is a method for the dispelling of the five lower bonds for the 
sensual world. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Venerable sir, when 
this is the path and the method for the destruction of the five lower bonds for 
the sensual world, why does a certain bhikkhu talk of a release of mind and a 
release through wisdom? Ananda, that is the difference in the maturity of the 
mental faculties. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The Blessed One said 
that and venerable Ananda delighted in the words of the Blessed One.<SPAN

world is, thorough reflection after attaining to one or the other of the jhaanas 
and the higher absorptions, in due order. This is the stage of not returning to 
the sensual world He becomes a non-returner,’anaagaami’. Determinations are 
threefold, as bodily, verbal and mental and their appeasement also happens in 
the attainment of the jhaanas. Endearments are dealt in the
