<P>I heard thus. 
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived with the Sakyas in Nigrodha’s monastery in 
Kapilavatthu. Then the Blessed One put on robes in the morning and taking bowl 
and robes entered Kapilavatthu for alms. After the meal was over and returning 
from the alms round entered the Great forest and sat at the root of a Beluwa 
shoot to spend the day. The Sakya Dandapaani too walking and wandering for 
exercise entered the Great forest, approached the Beluwa shoot where the Blessed 
One was seated, exchanged friendly greetings and getting to a side leaned on a 
stick and said thus: What view has the recluse and what does he teach." I have 
no dispute with anyone in this world of gods and men together with its Maaras, 
Brahmaas, the community of recluses and brahmins and I abide unyoked to 
sensuality, duties done, doubts dispelled and without the slightest perception , 
‘to be’ or ‘not to be’ Friend, I am of this view and teach it" 
<P>When this was said the Sakya Dandapaani shook his head, pulled out his 
tongue, and showing three forks on his forehead went away leaning on his stick. 
<P>Then the Blessed One getting up from his seclusion in the evening approached 
Nigrodha’s monastery, sat on the prepared seat and addressed the 
bhikkhus."Bhikkhus, I put on robes in the morning, and taking bowl and robes 
entered Kapilavatthu for alms, after the meal was over and returning from the 
alms round entered the Great forest and sat at the root of a Beluwa shoot to 
spend the day. The Sakya Dandapaani too walking and wandering for excise entered 
the Great forest, approached the Beluwa shoot where I was seated, exchanged 
friendly greetings and getting to a side leaned on a stick and said thus: What 
view has the recluse and what does the recluse teach. Then I said, I have no 
dispute with anyone in this world, of gods and men together with its Maaras, 
Brahmaas, the community of recluses and brahmins and I abide unyoked to 
sensuality, duties done, doubts dispelled and without the slightest perception, 
‘to be’ and ‘not to be’. Friend, I am of this view and teach it.. When this was 
said the Sakya Dandapaani shook his head, pulled out his tongue and showing 
three forks on his forehead went away leaning on his stick. 
<P>When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said thus Venerable sir, what is that 
view, to have no dispute with anyone in this world of gods and men, Maaras, 
Brahmaas, the community of recluses and brahmins.and gods and men. And how does 
the Blessed One abide unyoked from sensuality, duties done, doubts dispelled, 
and without the slightest perception ‘to be’ and ‘not to be’. Bhikkhu, on 
whatever account there is behaviour in the diffusedness of the world, you should 
not be pleased, or welcome it and appropriate it , then all demeritorious things 
that rise from the latent tendencies to greed, to averse, to hold views, to 
doubt, to measure, to greed to be, to ignore, to take sticks and weapons, to 
fight, to take sides, to dispute, to slander, to tell lies, all these cease 
remainderlessly. 
<P>The Blessed One said this and getting up from the seat entered the monastery. 
Soon after the Blessed One 
<P>had gone to the monastery it occured to those bhikkhus. Friends, the Blessed 
One pointed out the Teaching in short to us and entered the monastery ‘On 
whatever account there is behaviour in the diffusedness of the world, you should 
not be pleased, or welcome it and appropriate it, then all demeritorious things 
that rise from latent tendencies to greed, to averse, to hold views, to doubt, 
to measure, to greed to be, to ignore, to take sticks and weapons, to fight, to 
take sides, to dispute, to slander, to tell lies, all these cease 
remainderlessly. Now who will explain the meaning of this short exposition. Then 
it occured to those bhikkhus, venerable Mahaakaccaana is praised as well 
developed and wise by the Teacher and also by the co-associates in the holy 
life. It is possible for venerable Mahaakaccaana to explain this short 
exposition in detail. The bhikkhus thought about this and approached venerable 
Mahaakaccaana. 
<P>Then the bhikkhus approached venerable Mahaakaccaana exchanged friendly 
greetings sat on a side and said: Friend Mahaakaccana, the Blessed One pointed 
out this short exposition and without giving a detailed explanation entered the 
monastery- ‘On whatever account there is behaviour in the diffusedness of the 
world, you should not be pleased, welcome it and approproiate it, then all 
demeritorious things that rise from the latent tendencies to greed, to averse, 
to hold views, to doubt, to measure, to greed to be, to ignore, to take sticks, 
and weapons, to fight, to take sides, to dispute, to slander and to tell lies, 
cease remainderlessly’. Soon after the Blessed One had gone to the monastery it 
occured to us, venerable Mahaakaccaana is praised as well developed and wise by 
the Teacher and the co-associates in the holy life. It is possible for venerable 
Mahaakaccaana to explain this short exposition in detail. We ask the meaning of 
this short exposition, explain it to us venerable Mahaakaccaana. 
<P>Friends, this is like a man wandering in search of heartwood, come to a 
standing huge tree ignoring the roots and the trunk, was to search the heartwood 
in the branches and the foliage. This act of the venerable ones, having come to 
the presence of the Teacher, not asking him would come to ask us, is something 
similar to that. That Blessed One knows what should be known, sees what should 
be seen, is the one with eyes,the one with wisdom, has become the Teaching, has 
become like brahmaa, practises what he preaches, 
<P>has come to the essence and gives the deathless, is master of the Teaching, 
This is the time to ask its meaning from the Blessed One so that we could keep 
it in our minds. Indeed, venerable Kaccaana, the Blessed One knows what should 
be known, sees what should be seen, is the one with eyes, the one with wisdom, 
has become the Teaching, has become like brahmaa, practises what he preaches, 
has come to the essence and gives the deathless, is master of the Teaching. This 
is the time to ask its meaning from the Blessed One, so that we could keep it in 
our minds Yet venerable Mahaakaccaana is praised as well developed and wise by 
the Teacher and the co-associates in the holy life. It is possible for venerable 
Mahaakaccaana to explain this short exposition in detail. Venerabale 
Mahaakaccaana explain it if you do not mind. -Then friends, listen carefully, I 
will explain. 
<P>Friends, that which the Blessed One explained in short and went to the 
monastery, ‘On whatever account there is behaviour in the diffusedness of the 
world, you should not be pleased, or welcome it and approproiate it, then all 
demeritorious things that rise from the latent tendencies to greed, to averse, 
to hold views, to doubt, to measure, to greed to be, to ignore, to take sticks, 
and weapons, to fight, to take sides, to dispute, to slander and to tell lies, 
cease remainderlessly’.I understand the detailed meaning of this short 
exposition as this: -Friends, on account of eye and forms arise eye 
consciousness. The coincident meeting of the three is contact, on account of 
contact feelings, what is felt is perceived, of what is perceived there is 
thinking, in thoughts there is diffusedness on account of that, diffused 
perceptive components of forms of the past, future and present cognizable by the 
eye consciousness arise and behave in that man. On account of the ear and sounds 
arise ear consciousness. The coincident meeting of the three is contact, on 
account of contact feelings, what is felt is perceived, of what is perceived 
there is thinking, in thoughts there is diffusedness, on acount of that, 
diffused perceptive components of sounds of the past, future and present 
cognizable by ear consciousness arise and behave in that man On account of the 
nose and smells arise nose consciousness. The coincident meeting of the three is 
contact, on account of contact feelings, what is felt is perceived , of what is 
perceived there is thinking, in thoughts there is diffusedness, on account of 
that, diffused perceptive components of smells of the past, future and present 
cognizable by nose consciousness arise and behave in that man. On account of 
tongue and tastes arise tongue consciousness. The coincident meeting ot the 
three is contact, on account of contact feelings, what is felt is perceived, of 
what is perceived there is thinking, in thoughts there is diffusedness on 
account of that diffused pereceptive components of tastes of the past, future 
and present cognizable by tongue consciousness arise and behave in that man. On 
account of body and touches arise body consciousness. The coincident meeting of 
the three is contact, on account of contact feelings, what is felt is perceived, 
of what is perceived, there is thinking, in thoughts there is diffusedness, on 
account of that diffused perceptive components of touches of the past, future 
and present cognizable by body consciousness arise and behave in that man. On 
account of mind and thoughts arise mind consciousness. The coincident meeting of 
the three is contact, on account of contact feelings, what is felt is perceived, 
of what is perceived there is thinking, in thoughts there is diffusedness,on 
account of the diffusedness, perceptive components of thoughts of the past, 
future and present cognizable by mind consciousness arise and behave in that 
man. 
<P>Friends, when the eye is present, forms are present, eye consciousness is 
present, the notion of a contact is present is possible. When the notion of 
contact is present, a notion of feelings is present is possible, when there is a 
notion of feeling a notion of perception is possible, when there is a notion of 
perception a notion of thinking is possible, when there is a notion of thinking 
a notion of diffused perceptive components arising and behaving is possible, 
When the ear is pressent, sounds are present, and ear consciousness is present- 
when the nose is present, smells are present, and nose consciousness is present- 
when the tongue is present, tastes are present, and tongue consciousness is 
presesnt- when the body is present, touches are present and body consciousness 
is present, When the mind is present, thoughts are present, mind conscioussness 
is present, the notion of contact is present is possible. When the notion of 
contact is present, a notion of feelings is present is possible, when there is a 
notion of feeling a notion of perception is possible, when there is a notion of 
perception, a notion of thinking is possible, when there is a notion of thinking 
a notion of diffused perceptive components arising and behaving is possible.. 
<P>Friends, when the eye is not present, forms are not present, eye 
consciousness is not present, the notion of a contact is not is possible. When 
the notion of contact is not present, a notion of feelings is not possible, when 
there is not a notion of feeling a notion of perception is not possible, when 
there is not a notion of perception a notion of thinking is not possible, when 
there is not a notion of thinking a notion of diffused perceptive components 
arising and behaving is not possible, When the ear is not pressent, sounds are 
not present, and ear consciousness is not present- when the nose is not present, 
smells are not present, and nose consciousness is not present- when the is 
tongue is not present, tastes are not present, and tongue consciousness is not 
presesnt- when the body is not present, touches are not present and body 
consciousness is not present- When the mind is not present, thoughts are not 
present, mind conscioussness is not present, the notion of contact is not 
possible. When the notion of contact is not present, a notion of feelings is not 
possible, when there is not a notion of feeling a notion of perception is not 
possible, when there is not a notion of perception, a notion of thinking is not 
possible, when there is not a notion of thinking a notion of diffused perceptive 
components arising and behaving is not possible. Friends, that which the Blessed 
One explained in short and went to the monastery, ‘On whatever account there is 
behaviour in the diffusedness of the world, you should not be pleased, or 
welcome it and approproiate it, then all demeritorious things that rise from the 
latent tendencies to greed, to averse, to hold views, to doubt, to measure, to 
greed to be, to ignore, to take sticks, and weapons, to fight, to take sides, to 
dispute, to slander and to tell lies, cease remainderlessly’.I understand the 
detailed meaning of this short exposition as this If you desire approach the 
Blessed One and ask him as he explains bear it in mind. 
<P>Then those bhikkhus agreeing and delighting in the words of the Blessed One 
got up from their seats and 
<P>approached the Blessed One worshipped and sat on a side and said Venerable 
sir, the Blessed One pointed out this exposition in short and without giving 
the.detailed explanation got up from the seat and entered the monastery ‘On 
whatever account there is behaviour in the diffusedness of the world, you should 
not be pleased, or welcome it and approproiate it, then all demeritorious things 
that rise from the latent tendencies to greed, to averse, to hold views, to 
doubt, to measure, to greed to be, to ignore, to take sticks, and weapons, to 
fight, to take sides, to dispute, to slander and to tell lies, cease 
remainderlessly’ Venerable sir, soon after you left it occured to us, The 
Blessed One gave this short exposition and without giving the detailed 
explanation, got up from the seat and went into the monasatery. Who could give a 
detailed explanation to this short exposition. Then it occured to us: Venerable 
Mahaakaccaana is praised as well developed and wise by the Teacher and the 
co-associates of the holy life. It is possible for venerable Mahaakaccaana to 
explain this exposition in detail. So we approached venerable Mahaakaccaana and 
asked him to explain it to us. Venerable Mahaakaccaana explained it to us with 
these words and these phrases. 
<P>Bhikkhus, Mahaakaccaana is wise, even if you had asked me, I would have 
explained it as Mahaakaccaaana had done it. That is its meaning, so bear it like 
that. 
<P>When this was said venerable Aananda said thus to the Blessed One: Like a man 
hungry and weak who had got a honey comb in whatever manner he tasted it, would 
enjoy its unmixed taste in the same manner any clever bhikkhu would penetrate 
into the meaning of this exposition and he would gain joy and satisfaction of 
mind. Venerable sir, what is the meaning of this exposition. Aananda, bear this, 
as the exposition .of the honey comb. 
<P>The Blessed One said this and venerable Aananda rejoiced in the words of the 
Blessed One.
