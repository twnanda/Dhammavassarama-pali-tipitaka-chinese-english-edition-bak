<P><B>(21) The Simile of the Saw.</B></CENTER>
<P>I heard thus. 
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika 
in Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi. At that time venerable Moliyaphagguna spent much 
time associating the bhikkhunis.This association was such that if any bhikkhu 
blamed the bhikkhunis in the presence of venerable Moliyaphagguna, he was 
annoyed and spoke much in favour of them and if any bhikkhu blamed venerable 
Moliyaphagguna in the presence of the bhikkhunis, they were annoyed and spoke 
much in favour of him. Venerable Moliyaphagguna and the bhikkhunis maintained 
such an association. Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, 
worshipped the Blessed One, sat on a side and said thus: Venerable sir, 
venerable Moliyaphagguna spends much time associating the bhikkhunis. This 
association is such that if any bhikkhu blamed the bhikkhunis in the presence of 
venerable Moliyaphagguna, he gets annoyed and speaks much in favour of them. And 
if any bhikkhu blamed venerable Moliyaphagguna in the presence of the 
bhikkhunis, they were annoyed and spoke much in favour of him. Venerable 
Moliyaphagguna maintains such an association with the bhikkhunis. Then the 
Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu ‘Come here bhikkhu, in my words, call 
bhikkhu Moliyaphagguna, tell the Teacher wants you’ He consented and approached 
venerable Moliyaphagguna and said the Teacher calls you venerable Phagguna. He 
said yes, venerable one and approached the Blessed One worshipped and sat on a 
side. Then the Blessed One said thus: 
<P>Phagguna, is it true, that you spend much time with the bhikkhunis. Do you 
maintain such an association 
<P>with the bhikkhunis that when a bhikkhu blames the bhikkhunis in your 
presence, you get annoyed and talk in favour of the bhikkhunis, and when a 
bhikkhu blames you in the presence of the bhikkhnis, they get annoyed and talk 
in favour of you. Phagguna, do you maintain such an association with the 
bhikkhunis-Yes, veneraable sir.- Aren’t you the son of a clansman who has gone 
forth as a homeless out of faith-I am venerable sir.-Phagguna, it is not 
suitable for the son of a clansman, who has gone forth as a homeless to spend 
much time with the bhikkhunis- Therefore Phagguna, when anyone blames the 
bhikkhunis in your presence, you should give up that worldly interest and 
worldly thoughts. Phagguna, there you should train like this -My mind will not 
change, I will not utter evil words, I will abide with compassion and loving 
kindness without an angry thought. Again Pagguna, if anyone beat those 
bhikkhunis with their hands or with clods, or sticks, or weapons, you should 
train as above. Again Phagguna, if anyone blames you in the face, you should 
train as above. If anyone beats you with hands, or clods, or sticks, or weapons, 
you should give up that worldly interest and worldly thoughts. Phagguna, there 
you should train like this- My mind will not change, I will not utter evil 
words, I will abide with compassion and loving kindness, without an angry 
thought. 
<P>Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus. O! Bhikkhus, at one time I 
convinced the minds of the bhikkhus to partake of one meal a day, this is what I 
said: Bhikkhus, I partake of one meal a day, partaking one meal a day I 
experienced few ailments, few disorders, lightness, power, and a comfortable 
abiding. Bhikkhus, you too partake of one meal a day and experience few 
ailments, few disorders, lightness, power and a comfortable abiding. There 
wasn’t a need to advice those bhikkhus, the mere arousing of mindfulness was 
enough. Like a cart with thoroughbreds yoked, stationed on the four cross roads 
in some even land. Then a clever tamer of horses, a charioteer comes and 
mounting the cart takes the reins in the left hand and the whip in the right 
hand proceeds and receeds as he likes and where he likes. Even so there wasn’t a 
need to advice those bhikkhus,only arousing mindfulness was necessary. Therefore 
bhikkhus, dispel demerit and pursuse merit. In that manner, you come to growth 
and development in this dispensation of the Teaching Like a Sal grove near a 
village or hamlet would have an under growth of weeds. Then a certain man 
desiring their welfare uproots all the weeds which rob the moisture and throws 
them out and the Sal trees grow straight, and well . Thus in the mean time the 
Sal trees grow and develop well. Bhikkhus, in the same manner, dispel demerit 
and pursue merit.So you too grow and develop in this dispensation 
<P>At one time in this same Saavatthi there was a householer’s wife named 
Vedehikaa and there was such praise given to her, Vedehikaa is gentle, humble 
and calm. This householder’s wife had a slave named Kaali. She was clever, not 
lazy, and well arranged in her work.It occured to Kaali, my mistress is praised 
as gentle, humble and calm, What, is my mistress really calm that she does not 
show the anger within, or is she not calm. Or is it because I am well arranged 
in my work that my mistress does not show her anger, or is she not calm What if 
I examined my mistress. So the slave Kaali got up late in the day. The 
householder’s wife Vedehikaa called out, Hey Kaali! Why do you get up late. For 
no reason Lady. Evil one why do you get up late, without a reason, saying this 
she was angry and showed displeasure. Then to the slave Kaali it occured thus: 
Does my mistress have anger within, which she does not show or hasn’t she. Is it 
because am well arranged in my work that my mistress does not show anger and not 
that she hasn’t. What if I examine her further. Then the slave Kaali got up 
still more late.Then the householder’s wife Vedehikaa called out: Hey Kaali! Why 
do you get up late. For no reason lady. Evil one, why do you get up late, 
without a reason, saying this she was angry, showed displeasure and uttered 
distasteful words. Then it occured to the slave Kaali, me’ lady indeed has anger 
within which she does not put out, it is not she hasn’t. It is because am well 
arranged in my work, that she does not show her anger and it is not that she 
hasn’t anger. What if I examine my mistress further. So she got up still more 
late. Then the householder’s wife Vedehikaa called out, Hey Kaali! Why do you 
get up late. For no reason lady. Evil one, why do you get up late for no reason, 
saying this she showed anger, took a rolling pin and hit Kaali on her head. Then 
Kaali with her head split, blood oozing and dripping called out to the 
neighbours: Ladies look at the gentle one’s work, look at the humble one’s work, 
look at the calm one’s work How could she hit the head, and split the head of 
her only slave, for getting up late. Then, the householder’s wife Vedehika’s ill 
fame spread. Vedehika the householder’s wife is rough, not humble and not calm. 
Bhikkhus, in the same manner a certain bhikkhu would be gentle, humble and calm 
until he is touched by disagreeable words. It is when touched by disagreeable 
words that it should be known whether the bhikkhu is gentle, humble and calm. 
Bhikkhus, in the same manner a bhikkhu may become calm with the gain of robes, 
morsel food, dwellings and requisites when ill, not gaining robes, morsel food, 
dwellings and requissites when ill, he would not be calm any more. 
<P>The bhikkhu who becomes calm honouring the Teaching and according to the 
Teaching, is calm and suave. 
<P>Therefore you should train, we honouring the Teaching, and living according 
to the Teaching, will be calm and suave. 
<P>Bhikkhus, others speaking would speak in this fivefold way. At the right 
time, or not at the right time, The false or the truth. With kindness or 
roughly. For the good of someone, or for his disaster. With thoughts of loving 
kindness, or with anger. Then you should train thus: Our minds will not change, 
we will not utter evil words, We will abide compassionate with thoughts of 
loving kindness not angry. We will pervade that person who uttered those words, 
with thoughts of loving kindness. With that same thought of loving kindness 
grown great and measureless, without enmity we will abide pervading everywhere. 
Bhikkhus, thus you should train. . 
<P>Like a man who comes with hoe and basket saying, I will make this great earth 
go without earth . Then he would dig here and there, throw earth here and there, 
spit here and there, urinate here and there and would say, be without earth. Yet 
would he be able to make this great earth without earth. This great earth is 
deep and immearsurable and it would not be possible to make this great earth go 
without earth, it will only bring fatigue to that man. In the same manner 
fivefold is the ways of speech. It would be at the right time or not at the 
right time. The false or the truth. With kindness or roughly. For the good of 
someone or for his disaster. With thoughts of loving kindness or with anger. 
Then you should train thus. Our minds will not change, we will not utter evil 
words. We will abide compassionate with thoughts of loving kindness not angry. 
We will pervade that person who uttered those words with thoughts of loving 
kindness. With that same sign, grown great and developed extensively as much as 
the world I pervade and abide. Bhikkhus, you should train thus. 
<P>Like a man who comes with various colours of dye, red, yellow, blue and 
orange saying I will draw pictures in space.I will make them appear in space.Yet 
would he be able to draw pictures in space, to make them appear . In immaterial 
space, he cannot draw pictures and make them appear, it is not easy, it will 
bring him only fatigue In the same manner fivefold is the ways of speech. It 
would be at the right time or not at the right time. The false or the truth. 
With kindness or roughly. For the good of someone or for his disaster. With 
thoughts of loving kindness or with anger. Then you should train thus. Our minds 
will not change, we will not utter evil words. We will abide compassionate with 
thoughts of loving kindness not angry. We will pervade that person who uttered 
those words with thoughts of loving kindness. With that same sign, grown great 
and developed extensively as much as space I pervade and abide. Bhikkhus, you 
should train thus. 
<P>Like a man who comes with a burning grass torch saying I will heat, scorch 
and dry up river Ganges. Yet would he be able to heat, scorch and dry up river 
Ganges. As immense as the waters of river Ganges it is not posssible to heat, 
scorch and dry her up, it will cause that man only fatigue. In the same manner 
fivefold is the ways of speech. It would be at the right time or not at the 
right time. The false or the truth. With kindness or roughly. For the good of 
someone or for his disaster. With thoughts of loving kindness or with anger. 
Then you should train thus. Our minds will not change, we will not utter evil 
words. We will abide compassionate with thoughts of loving kindness not angry. 
We will pervade that person who uttered those words with thoughts of loving 
kindness. With that same sign, grown great and developed extensively as much as 
the water of Ganges, I pervade and abide. Bhikkhus, you should train thus. 
<P>Like a man who comes with a catskin bag threshed, polished and tested for 
soundlessness, saying I will make a sound with this catskin bag with a stick or 
stone. Yet would he be able to make a sound with the catskin bag with a stick or 
stone. That catskin bag is threshed, polished and tested for soundlessness, it 
would not be possible to make a sound with it, he will only gain fatigue on 
account of it. In the same manner fivefold is the ways of speech. It would be at 
the right time or not at the right time. The false or the truth. With kindness 
or roughly. For the good of someone or for his disaster. With thoughts of loving 
kindness or with anger. Then you should train thus. Our minds will not change, 
we will not utter evil words. We will abide compassionate with thoughts of 
loving kindness not angry. We will pervade that person who uttered those words 
with thoughts of loving kindness. With that same sign, grown great and developed 
extensively as much as the catskin bag , I pervade and abide. Bhikkhus, you 
should train thus. 
<P>O! Bhikkhus, even if robbers cut your limbs one after another with a two 
handled saw, if your mind be defiled on account of that, you have not done the 
duty in my dispensation Then too you should train thus. Our minds will not 
change, we will not utter evil words. We will abide compassionate with thoughts 
of loving kindness not angry. We will pervade that person with thoughts of 
loving kindness. With that same sign, grown great and developed extensively, I 
pervade and abide. Bhikkhus, you should train thus. 
<P>Bhikkhus, you should constantly attend to the advice on the simile of the 
saw. Is there anything small or large in those words of others which you would 
not endure. Therefore bhikkhus, constantly attend to the advice on the simile of 
the saw, it will be for your welfare and happiness for a long time. 
<P>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the 
Blessed One. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;
