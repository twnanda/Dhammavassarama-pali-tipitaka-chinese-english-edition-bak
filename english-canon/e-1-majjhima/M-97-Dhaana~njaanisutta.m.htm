<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU>I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One 
was living in the squirrels’ sanctuary in the bamboo grove in Raajagaha. At that 
time venerable Saariputta was touring the southern hilly regions with a large 
community of bhikkhus. A certain bhikkhu who had spent the rains in Rajagaha 
approached venerable Saariputta and exchanged friendly greetings and sat on 
side.&nbsp;</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Venerable Saariputta asked him.’Venerable one, 
is the Blessed One without ailments and has he a light living?’&nbsp;</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Yes, venerable one, the Blessed One is without 
ailments and has a light living.’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN

without ailments, and with a light living?’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Yes, venerable one, the Community of bhikkhus, 
too are without ailments and they too have a light living.’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable one, there is the Brahmin 
Dhaananjaani, who has power over fields and grains. Is he without ailments and 
in good health?’&nbsp;</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘The Brahmin Dhaananjaani is powerful and in 
good health.’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN

Dhaananjaani? On account of the kings he plunders the Brahmin householders. On 
account of the Brahmin householders he plunders the kings. His wife who had 
faith, brought from a family, which had faith in the Blessed One, has died. Now 
he has brought a wife from a family, which has no faith and she has not 
faith.’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘We 
heard something that should not be heard, about the negligence of the Brahmin 
Dhaananjaani. Indeed we should meet the brahamin Dhaananjaani and have a 
conversation about this.’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Venerable Saariputta abiding as long as he 
wished in the southern hilly regions, left on a tour to reach Rajagaha in 
stages. Venerable Saariputta was then abiding in the squirrels’ sanctuary in the 
bamboo grove in Rajagaha. Venerable Saariputta put on robes in the morning and 
taking bowl and robes entered Rajagaha for alms. At that time the Brahmin 
Dhaananjaani was milking the cows out side the city close to it. Venerable 
Saariputta having gone the alms round, and after the meal was over approached 
the Brahmin Dhaananjaani. The Brahmin, seeing venerable Saariputta approaching 
in the distance said.’Good sir, Saariputta, there is milk, the time to partake 
has not elapsed yet.’&nbsp;</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The 
Brahmin Dhaananjaani agreeing, after partaking his meal approached venerable 
Saariputta, exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side. Then venerable 
Saariputta asked. ‘Brahmin, do you live diligently?’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN

me. I have to support my mother and father, sons and wife, my servants and 
workmen. I have to do what should be done for my friends and co-associates. I 
have to do what should be done for my blood relations and guests. I have to 
think of those who are dead and gone. Have to attend to the needs of recluses

myself.’</SPAN>
