<P><B>151. The Purity of alms food.</B></CENTER>
<P>I Heard thus. 
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the squirrels’ sanctuary in the bamboo 
grove in Rajagaha. Then venerable Sariputta getting up from his seclusion in the 
evening approached the Blessed One, worshipped, and sat on a side. The Blessed 
One said to venerable Sariputta. ‘Sariputta, your mental faculties are bright, 
skin colour is pure, in which abiding, do you spend your time mostly?’ 
<P>‘Venerable sir, I spend my time mostly in voidance.’ 
<P>‘It’s good Sariputta, you abide mostly in the abiding of Great Beings. 
Sariputta, a bhikkhu who desires to abide in voidance most of the time should 
reflect. When going for alms along a certain path, or in a certain region, or 
returning along a certain path, does interest, or greed, or anger, or delusion, 
or aversion, arise in my mind on account of forms cognizable by eye 
consciousness? 
<P>When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows, when going for alms along a certain 
path, or in a certain region, or returning along a certain path, interest, or 
greed, or anger, or delusion, or aversion, arises in my mind on account of forms 
cognizable by eye consciousness. Then he should arouse effort to dispel those 
evil thoughts. 
<P>When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows, when going for alms along a certain 
path, or in a certain region, or returning along a certain path, interest, or 
greed, or anger, or delusion, or aversion, does not arise in my mind on account 
of forms cognizable by eye consciousness. Then he should abide joyful and happy 
training in those thoughts day and night. 
<P>Again Sariputta, when reflecting if the bhikkhu knows, when going for alms 
along a certain path, or in a certain region, or returning along a certain path, 
interest, or greed, or anger, or delusion, or aversion, does not arise in my 
mind on account of sounds cognizable by ear-consciousness, …re…on account of 
scents cognizable by nose-consciousness,…re… on account of tastes cognizable by 
tongue-consciousness,…re… on account of touches cognizable by body 
consciousness, …re… on account of thoughts cognizable by mind-consciousness. He 
should abide joyful and happy training in those thoughts day and night. 
<P>When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows, when going for alms along a certain 
path, or in a certain region, or returning along a certain path, interest, or 
greed, or anger, or delusion, or aversion, does not arise in my mind on account 
of thoughts cognizable by mind-consciousness. He should abide joyful and happy 
training in those thoughts day and night. 
<P>Again Sariputta the bhikkhu should reflect are my five strands of sensuality 
dispelled? When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows, my five strands of sensuality 
are not dispelled he should arouse effort to dispel the five strands of 
sensuality. 
<P>When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows, my five strands of sensuality are 
dispelled, he should abide joyful and happy training in those thoughts day and 
night. 
<P>Again Sariputta, the bhikkhu should reflect are the five hindrances dispelled 
in me? When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows, the five hindrances are not 
dispelled in me he should arouse effort to dispel the five hindrances. When 
reflecting if the bhikkhu knows, the five hindrances are dispelled in me he 
should abide joyful and happy training in those thoughts day and night. 
<P>Again Sariputta, the bhikkhu should reflect are the five holding masses 
accurately understood by me? When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows, the five 
holding masses are not accurately understood, he should arouse effort to 
understand the five holding masses accurately. When reflecting if the bhikkhu 
knows the five holding masses are accurately understood by me. He should abide 
joyful and happy training in those thoughts day and night. 
<P>Again Sariputta, the bhikkhu should reflect are the four establishments of 
mindfulness developed in me? When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows the four 
establishments of mindfulness are not developed in me, he should arouse effort 
to develop the four establishments of mindfulness. When reflecting if the 
bhikkhu knows the four establishments of mindfulness are developed in me, he 
should abide joyful and happy training in those thoughts day and night. 
<P>Again Sariputta, the bhikkhu should reflect are the four right efforts 
developed in me? When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows the four right efforts are 
not developed in me, he should arouse effort to develop the four right efforts. 
When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows the four right efforts are developed in me, 
he should abide joyful and happy training in those thoughts day and night. 
<P>Again Sariputta, the bhikkhu should reflect are the four supernormal powers 
developed in me? When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows the four supernormal 
powers are not developed in me, he should arouse effort to develop the four 
supernormal powers. When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows the four supernormal 
powers are developed in me, he should abide joyful and happy training in those 
thoughts day and night. 
<P>Again Sariputta, the bhikkhu should reflect are the five mental faculties 
developed in me? When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows the five mental faculties 
are not developed in me, he should arouse effort to develop the five mental 
faculties. When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows the five mental faculties are 
developed in me, he should abide joyful and happy training in those thoughts day 
and night. 
<P>Again Sariputta, the bhikkhu should reflect are the five powers developed in 
me? When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows the five powers are not developed in 
me, he should arouse effort to develop the five powers When reflecting if the 
bhikkhu knows the five powers are developed in me, he should abide joyful and 
happy training in those thoughts day and night. 
<P>Again Sariputta, the bhikkhu should reflect are the seven enlightenment 
factors developed in me? When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows the seven 
enlightenment factors are not developed in me, he should arouse effort to 
develop the seven enlightenment factors. When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows 
the seven enlightenment factors are developed in me, he should abide joyful and 
happy training in those thoughts day and night. 
<P>Again Sariputta, the bhikkhu should reflect is the noble Eightfold path 
developed in me? When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows the noble Eightfold path 
is not developed in me, he should arouse effort to develop the noble Eightfold 
path. When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows the noble Eightfold path is developed 
in me, he should abide joyful and happy training in those thoughts day and 
night. 
<P>Again Sariputta, the bhikkhu should reflect is my calm and insight 
developed?*1) When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows my calm and insight is not 
developed, he should arouse effort to develop calm and insight When reflecting 
if the bhikkhu knows calm and insight is developed, he should abide joyful and 
happy training in those thoughts day and night. 
<P>Again Sariputta, the bhikkhu should reflect is science and release realized 
by me*2)? When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows, science and release of mind, is 
not realized by me, he should arouse effort to develop science and release of 
mind. When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows, science and release of mind, is 
realized he should abide joyful and happy training in those thoughts day and 
night. 
<P>Sariputta, whoever recluse or brahmin purified alms food in the past, did so 
reflecting in this manner. Whoever recluse or brahmin would purify alms food in 
the future, will do so reflecting in this manner. Whoever recluse or brahmin 
purifies alms food at present, do so reflecting in this manner. Sariputta, you 
should train in this manner. 
<P>The Blessed One said thus and venerable Sariputta delighted in the words of 
the Blessed One. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>Notes. 1 Is my calm and insight developed? ‘Bhaavitaa nu kho me samatho ca 
vipassanaa caati.’ To develop calm is to pacify the mind by throwing out evil 
things of demerit in the mind and not leaving any room for them to rise again. 
To do this there are various methods to adopt and various signs to develop. The 
most suitable sign should be adopted at the relevant time. A few of them are 
reflecting in and out breaths, being aware of one’s movements, being mindful of 
one’s feelings, being mindful of one’s mental states and thoughts etcetra. To 
develop insight is to be aware of the fact that everything is impermanent. That 
whatever impermanent thing, is unpleasant. And whatever impermanent, unpleasant 
thing lacks self. 
<P>2. Is science and release realized by me? ‘Sacchikataa nu kho me vijjaa ca 
vimutti caati?’ Science is the knowledge of the Truth of unpleasantness, the 
truth of its arising, the truth of its cessation and the truth of the path 
leading to the cessation of unpleasantness. When this is realized the mind is 
released. <BR>&nbsp;
