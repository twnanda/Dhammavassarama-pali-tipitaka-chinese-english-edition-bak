open ground. Aggivessana, now the wild elephant is brought to open space. Then 
the elephant hunter informs the head annointed warrior king. Lord! the wild 
elephant is brought to open space. Next the head annointed warrior king 
addresses the elephant tamer. Good friend, elephant tamer, tame the wild 
elephant, so that it may get over the wild ways, wild thoughts and the 
displeasures and worries of leaving the remote. Make him like the end of the 
village and the ways of humans. The elephant tamer agrees and fixes a huge 
strong post and ties the wild elephant to the post by his neck, so that it may 
get over its wild ways, thoughts and displeasures and worries of leaving the 
remote and would get used to the end of the village and the ways of humans. The 
elephant tamer speaks words that are pleasing and go straight to the heart, 
speaks words that are accepted as polite by many. When the wild elephant listens 
to the words of the elephant tamer. He is given grass and water. If the wild 
elephant accepts grass and water, the elephant trainer knows that the elephant 
would live and not die. Then the elephant trainer gives him a further training 
as, good one, take this! Put it down! If he obeys the elephant trainer, he is 
given a further training. Good one, go forward! Recede! If the king’s elephant 
obeys these orders, he is given a further training as stand up! and sit down! If 
the king’s elephant obeys the elephant trainer’s orders he is given a further

the hind part of the body. Does not move the head nor ears. Does not move the 
teeth, tail or the trunk.The king’s elephant endures the contact of weapons, 
swords, and arrows. Endures loud noises of drums, conches and melodious sounds 
made by enemies. When all crookednesses, and faults are rectified and is 
blameless, he becomes worthy for the king, the property of the king and gets the

style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Aggivessana, in the same manner the Thus Gone 
One arises in the world, perfect, rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge 
and conduct, well gone, knower of the worlds, the incomparable tamer of those to 
be tamed, Teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed. He declares to the 
world together with its Maaras, Brahmaas, the community of recluses and brahmins 
gods and men, that Teaching good at the beginning, in the middle and at the end 
full of meaning even in the letter, complete in every way stating the pure holy 
life. Hearing this a householder or a householder’s son, born to some clan, 
gains faith in the Thus Gone One. With that faith he reflects. The life in a 
household is full of defilements, going forth is like open space. It is not easy 
for one living a household life to lead the holy life complete and pure without 
defilements. What if I shave head and beard, don yellow robes and go forth as a 
homeless. Later he gives up a little wealth, or much wealth, a small circle of 
friends, or a large circle of friends, shaving head and beard, and donning 
yellow robes goes forth as a homeless. Aggivessana, when this much is done, the 
noble disciple comes to open space. Aggivessana, here the greed of gods and men 
is for the five strands sense pleasures. Then the Thus Gone One gives him a 
further training. Come bhikkhu be virtuous, abiding by the higher code of rules, 
practise the right conduct, seeing fear in the slightest fault.When the bhikkhu 
practises right conduct, seeing fear in the slightest fault, the Thus Gone One 
gives him a further training. Come bhikkhu protect your doors of mental contact. 
Seeing a form do not take the sign or details. To one abiding not protecting 
the<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>mental faculty of the eye, evil 
desires of covetousness and<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>displeasure 
may arise, fall to its control. Hearing a sound, ...re..... scenting a smell, 
...re....enjoying a taste, ...re.... experiencing a touch with the 
body,...re.... and cognizing an idea in the.mind.do not take the sign or 
details. To one abiding not protecting the mental contact of the mind, evil 
desires of covetousness and displeasure may arise, fall to its control. 
Aggivessana, when the bhikkhu is protected in his doors of mental contact, the 
Thus Gone One gives him a further training. Come bhikkhu, know<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>the right amount to partake of food. Partake 
food reflecting, it is not, for play, for intoxication, or to look beautiful, 
but for the upkeep of the body. Not for the enjoyment of soups but to lead the 
holy life. Reflect I will put an end to earlier feelings, will not arouse new, 
for a faultless pleasant abiding. Aggivessana, when the bhikkhu knows the right 
amount to partake of food, the Thus Gone One gives him a further training. Come 
bhikkhu abide wakeful. During the day, sit in the cankamana and clean the mind 
of hindering things. In the first watch of the night sit in the cankamana and 
clean the mind of hindering things. In the middle watch of the night turn to the 
right, making the lion’s posture, place one foot over the other and with the 
perception of waking go to sleep. In the last watch of the night, sit in the 
cankamana and clean the mind of hindering things. When the bhikkhu is yoked to 
wakefulness, the Thus Gone One gives him a further training. Come bhikkhu be 
endowed with mindful awareness. Be mindful when approaching and receeding, 
looking on and looking about, bending and stretching, bearing the three robes 
and bowl, enjoying, drinking, eating and tasting, urinating and excreting, when 
going, standing, sitting and lying until awake. Be mindful when talking and 
keeping silence. When the bhikkhu is endowed with mindful awareess, the Thus 
Gone One gives a further training. Come bhikkhu abound a secluded dwelling. 
Abound a forest, the root of a tree, a mountain grotto, a charnel ground, a 
jungle path, an open space or a leaves hut. Then he abounds a forest, the root 
of a tree, a mountain grotto, a charnel ground, a jungle path, an open space or 
a leaves hut. After the meal, he sits cross legged, with the body errect and 
mindfulness established in front of him. He abides dispelling the coveting mind 
and cleans the mind of coveting thoughts. He abides dispelling the angry mind 
and cleans the mind of angry thoughts, with compassion for all living things. 
Dispelling sloth and torpor he abides mindful and aware of a perception of light 
to dispel sloth and torpor. He abides dispelling restlessness and worry, 
internally appeased cleans the mind of restlessness and worry. Abides dispelling

not entertain thoughts concerning those mental states. Abide reflecting thoughts 
on the Teaching, do not entertain them. He overcomes thoughts and thought 
processes, appeases the mind internally and brings it to a single point. With
