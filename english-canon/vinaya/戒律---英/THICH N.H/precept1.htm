    <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Aware of the suffering caused by the destruction
    of life, I undertake to cultivate compassion and learn ways to protect the lives of
    people, animals, plants, and minerals. I am determined not to kill, not to let others
    kill, and not to condone any act of killing in the world, in my thinking, and in my way of
    life.&quot; </font></em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Life is precious. It is everywhere, inside us and all
  around us; it has so many forms. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The First Precept is born from the awareness that lives
  everywhere are being destroyed. We see the suffering caused by the destruction of life,
  and we undertake to cultivate compassion and use it as a source of energy for the
  protection of people, animals, plants, and minerals. The First Precept is a precept of
  compassion, <em>karuna</em> -- the ability to remove suffering and transform it. When we
  see suffering, compassion is born in us. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is important for us to stay in touch with the suffering
  of the world. We need to nourish that awareness through many means -- sounds, images,
  direct contact, visits, and so on -- in order to keep compassion alive in us. But we must
  be careful not to take in too much. Any remedy must be taken in the proper dosage. We need
  to stay in touch with suffering only to the extent that we will not forget, so that
  compassion will flow within us and be a source of energy for our actions. If we use anger
  at injustice as the source for our energy, we may do something harmful, something that we
  will later regret. According to Buddhism, compassion is the only source of energy that is
  useful and safe. With compassion, your energy is born from insight; it is not blind
  energy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We humans are made entirely of non-human elements, such as
  plants, minerals, earth, clouds, and sunshine. For our practice to be deep and true, we
  must include the ecosystem. If the environment is destroyed, humans will be destroyed,
  too. Protecting human life is not possible without also protecting the lives of animals,
  plants, and minerals. The <em>Diamond Sutra</em> teaches us that it is impossible to
  distinguish between sentient and non-sentient beings. This is one of many ancient Buddhist
  texts that teach deep ecology. Every Buddhist practitioner should be a protector of the
  environment. Minerals have their own lives, too. In Buddhist monasteries, we chant,
  &quot;Both sentient and non- sentient beings will realize full enlightenment.&quot; The
  First Precept is the practice of protecting all lives, including the lives of minerals. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<em>I am determined not to kill, not to let others
  kill, and not to condone any act of killing in the world, in my thinking, and in my way of
  life.</em>&quot; We cannot support any act of killing; no killing can be justified. But
  not to kill is not enough. We must also learn ways to prevent others from killing. We
  cannot say, &quot;I am not responsible. They did it. My hands are clean.&quot; If you were
  in Germany during the time of the Nazis, you could not say, &quot;They did it. I did
  not.&quot; If, during the Gulf War, you did not say or do anything to try to stop the
  killing, you were not practicing this precept. Even if what you said or did failed to stop
  the war, what is important is that you tried, using your insight and compassion. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is not just by not killing with your body that you
  observe the First Precept. If in your thinking you allow the killing to go on, you also
  break this precept. We must be determined not to condone killing, even in our minds.
  According to the Buddha, the mind is the base of all actions. It is most dangerous to kill
  in the mind. When you believe, for example, that yours is the only way for humankind and
  that everyone who follows another way is your enemy, millions of people could be killed
  because of that idea. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thinking is at the base of everything. It is important for
  us to put an eye of awareness into each of our thoughts. Without a correct understanding
  of a situation or a person, our thoughts can be misleading and create confusion, despair,
  anger, or hatred. Our most important task is to develop correct insight. If we see deeply
  into the nature of interbeing, that all things &quot;inter-are,&quot; we will stop
  blaming, arguing, and killing, and we will become friends with everyone. To practice
  nonviolence, we must first of all learn ways to deal peacefully with ourselves. If we
  create true harmony within ourselves, we will know how to deal with family, friends, and
  associates. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we protest against a war, for example, we may assume
  that we are a peaceful person, a representative of peace, but this might not be true. If
  we look deeply, we will observe that the roots of war are in the unmindful ways we have
  been living. We have not sown enough seeds of peace and understanding in ourselves and
  others, therefore we are co-responsible: &quot;Because I have been like this, they are
  like that.&quot; A more holistic approach is the way of &quot;interbeing&quot;: &quot;This
  is like this, because that is like that.&quot; This is the way of understanding and love.
  With this insight, we can see clearly and help our government see clearly. Then we can go
  to a demonstration and say, &quot;This war is unjust, destructive, and not worthy of our
  great nation.&quot; This is far more effective than angrily condemning others. Anger
  always accelerates the damage. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">All of us, even pacifists, have pain inside. We feel angry
  and frustrated, and we need to find someone willing to listen to us who is capable of
  understanding our suffering. In Buddhist iconography, there is a bodhisattva named
  Avalokitesvara who has one thousand arms and one thousand hands, and has an eye in the
  palm of each hand. One thousand hands represent action, and the eye in each hand
  represents understanding. When you understand a situation or a person, any action you do
  will help and will not cause more suffering. When you have an eye in your hand, you will
  know how to practice true nonviolence. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To practice nonviolence, first of all we have to practice
  it within ourselves. In each of us, there is a certain amount of violence and a certain
  amount of nonviolence. Depending on our state of being, our response to things will be
  more or less nonviolent. Even if we take pride in being vegetarian, for example, we have
  to acknowledge that the water in which we boil our vegetables contains many tiny
  microorganisms. We cannot be completely nonviolent, but by being vegetarian, we are going
  in the direction of nonviolence. If we want to head north, we can use the North Star to
  guide us, but it is impossible to arrive at the North Star. Our effort is only to proceed
  in that direction. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Anyone can practice some nonviolence, even army generals.
  They may, for example, conduct their operations in ways that avoid killing innocent
  people. To help soldiers move in the nonviolent direction, we have to be in touch with
  them. If we divide reality into two camps -- the violent and the nonviolent -- and stand
  in one camp while attacking the other, the world will never have peace. We will always
  blame and condemn those we feel are responsible for wars and social injustice, without
  recognizing the degree of violence in ourselves. We must work on ourselves and also work
  with those we condemn if we want to have a real impact. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It never helps to draw a line and dismiss some people as
  enemies, even those who act violently. We have to approach them with love in our hearts
  and do our best to help them move in a direction of nonviolence. If we work for peace out
  of anger, we will never succeed. Peace is not an end. It can never come about through
  non-peaceful means. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Most important is to <em>become</em> nonviolence, so that
  when a situation presents itself, we will not create more suffering. To practice
  nonviolence, we need gentleness, loving kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity directed
  to our bodies, our feelings, and other people. With mindfulness -- the practice of peace
  -- we can begin by working to transform the wars in ourselves. There are techniques for
  doing this. Conscious breathing is one. Every time we feel upset, we can stop what we are
  doing, refrain from saying anything, and breathe in and out several times, aware of each
  in-breath and each out-breath. If we are still upset, we can go for walking meditation,
  mindful of each slow step and each breath we take. By cultivating peace within, we bring
  about peace in society. It depends on us. To practice peace in ourselves is to minimize
  the numbers of wars between this and that feeling, or this and that perception, and we can
  then have real peace with others as well, including the members of our own family. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">I am often asked, &quot;What if you are practicing
  nonviolence and someone breaks into your house and tries to kidnap your daughter or kill
  your husband? What should you do? Should you still act in a nonviolent way?&quot; The
  answer depends on your state of being. If you are prepared, you may react calmly and
  intelligently, in the most nonviolent way possible. But to be ready to react with
  intelligence and nonviolence, you have to train yourself in advance. It may take ten
  years, or longer. If you wait until the time of crisis to ask the question, it will be too
  late. A this-or-that kind of answer would be superficial. At that crucial moment, even if
  you know that nonviolence is better than violence, if your understanding is only
  intellectual and not in your whole being, you will not act nonviolently. The fear and
  anger in you will prevent you from acting in the most nonviolent way. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We have to look deeply every day to practice this precept
  well. Every time we buy or consume something, we may be condoning some form of killing. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">While practicing the protection of humans, animals,
  plants, and minerals, we know that we are protecting ourselves. We feel in permanent and
  loving touch with all species on Earth. We are protected by the mindfulness and the loving
  kindness of the Buddha and many generations of Sanghas who also practice this precept.
  This energy of loving kindness brings us the feeling of safety, health, and joy, and this
  becomes real the moment we make the decision to receive and practice the First Precept. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Feeling compassion is not enough. We have to learn to
  express it. That is why love must go together with understanding. Understanding and
  insight show us how to act. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our real enemy is forgetfulness. If we nourish mindfulness
  every day and water the seeds of peace in ourselves and those around us, we become alive,
  and we can help ourselves and others realize peace and compassion. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Life is so precious, yet in our daily lives we are usually
  carried away by our forgetfulness, anger, and worries, lost in the past, unable to touch
  life in the present moment. When we are truly alive, everything we do or touch is a
  miracle. To practice mindfulness is to return to life in the present moment. The practice
  of the First Precept is a celebration of reverence for life. When we appreciate and honor
  the beauty of life, we will do everything in our power to protect all life. </font></p>

  scholar, and poet. He is the founder of the Van Hanh Buddhist University in Saigon, has
  taught at Columbia University and the Sorbonne, and now lives in southern France, where he
  gardens, works to help those in need, and travels internationally teaching ``the art of
  mindful living.'' Martin Luther King, Jr., nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize in
  1967, saying, ``I do not personally know of anyone more worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize
  than this gentle monk from Vietnam.'' </font></p>
