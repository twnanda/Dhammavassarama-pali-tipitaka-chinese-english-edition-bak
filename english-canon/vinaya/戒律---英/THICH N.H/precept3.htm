SEXUAL RESPONSIBILITY</font></h2>

<h3 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>by Thich Nhat Hanh</i></font></font></h3>

<hr width="30%">

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <em><p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Aware of the suffering caused by sexual
    misconduct, I undertake to cultivate responsibility and learn ways to protect the safety
    and integrity of individuals, couples, families, and society. I am determined not to
    engage in sexual relations without love and a long- term commitment. To preserve the
    happiness of myself and others, I am determined to respect my commitments and the
    commitments of others. I will do everything in my power to protect children from sexual
    abuse and to prevent couples and families from being broken by sexual misconduct.&quot; </font></em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So many individuals, children, couples, and families have
  been destroyed by sexual misconduct. To practice the Third Precept is to heal ourselves
  and heal our society. This is mindful living. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Fifth Precept -- not to consume alcohol, toxins, or
  drugs -- and the Third Precept are linked. Both concern destructive and destabilizing
  behavior. These precepts are the right medicine to heal us. We need only to observe
  ourselves and those around us to see the truth. Our stability and the stability of our
  families and society cannot be obtained without the practice of these two precepts. If you
  look at individuals and families who are unstable and unhappy, you will see that many of
  them do not practice these precepts. You can make the diagnosis by yourself and then know
  that the medicine is there. Practicing these precepts is the best way to restore stability
  in the family and in society. For many people, this precept is easy to practice, but for
  others, it is quite difficult. It is important for these people to come together and share
  their experiences. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Buddhist tradition, we speak of the oneness of body
  and mind. Whatever happens to the body also happens to the mind. The sanity of they body
  is the sanity of the mind; the violation of the body is the violation of the mind. When we
  are angry, we may think that we are angry in our feelings, not in our body, but that is
  not true. When we love someone, we want to be close to him or her physically, but when we
  are angry at someone, we don't want to touch or be touched by that person. We cannot say
  that body and mind are separate. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A sexual relationship is an act of communion between body
  and spirit. This is a very important encounter, not to be done in a casual manner. You
  know that in your soul there are certain areas -- memories, pain, secrets -- that are
  private, that you would only share with the person you love and trust the most. You do not
  open your heart and show it to just anyone. In the imperial city, there is a zone you
  cannot approach called the forbidden city; only the king and his family are permitted to
  circulate there. There is a place like that in your soul that you do not allow anyone to
  approach except the one you trust and love the most. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The same is true of our body. Our bodies have areas that
  we do not want anyone to touch or approach unless he or she is the one we respect, trust,
  and love the most. When we are approached casually or carelessly, with an attitude that is
  less than tender, we feel insulted in our body and soul. Someone who approaches us with
  respect, tenderness, and utmost care is offering us deep communication, deep communion. It
  is only in that case that we will not feel hurt, misused, or abused, even a little. This
  cannot be attained unless there is true love and commitment. Casual sex cannot be
  described as love. Love is deep, beautiful, and whole. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">True love contains respect. In my tradition, husband and
  wife are expected to respect each other like guests, and when you practice this kind of
  respect, your love and happiness will continue for a long time. In sexual relationships,
  respect is one of the most important elements. Sexual communion should be like a rite, a
  ritual performed in mindfulness with great respect, care, and love. If you are motivated
  by some desire, that is not love. Desire is not love. Love is something much more
  responsible. It has care in it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">We have to restore the meaning of the word
  &quot;love.&quot; We have been using it in a careless way. When we say, &quot;I love
  hamburgers,&quot; we are not talking about love. We are talking about our appetite, our
  desire for hamburgers. We should not dramatize our speech and misuse words like that. We
  make words like &quot;love&quot; sick that way. We have to make an effort to heal our
  language by using words carefully. The word &quot;love&quot; is a beautiful word. We have
  to restore its meaning. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;I am determined not to engage in sexual relations
  without love and a long-term commitment.&quot; If the word &quot;love&quot; is understood
  in the deepest way, why do we need to say &quot;long-term commitment&quot;? If love is
  real, we do not need long or short-term commitments, or even a wedding ceremony. True love
  includes the sense of responsibility, accepting the other person as he is, with all his
  strengths and weaknesses. If we like only the best things in the person, that is not love.
  We have to accept his weaknesses and bring our patience, understanding, and energy to help
  him transform. Love is maitri, the capacity to bring joy and happiness, and karuna, the
  capacity to transform pain and suffering. This kind of love can only be good for people.
  It cannot be described as negative or destructive. It is safe. It guarantees everything. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Should we cross out the phrase &quot;long-term
  commitment&quot; or change it to &quot;short-term commitment&quot;? &quot;Short-term
  commitment&quot; means that we can be together for a few days and after that the
  relationship will end. That cannot be described as love. If we have that kind of
  relationship with another person, we cannot say that the relationship comes out of love
  and care. The expression &quot;long-term commitment&quot; helps people understand the word
  love. In the context of real love, commitment can only be long-term. &quot;I want to love
  you. I want to help you. I want to care for you. I want you to be happy. I want to work
  for happiness. But just for a few days.&quot; Does this make sense? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You are afraid to make a commitment -- to the precepts, to
  your partner, to anything. You want freedom. But remember, you have to make a long-term
  commitment to love your son deeply and help him through the journey of life as long as you
  are alive. You cannot just say, &quot;I don't love you anymore.&quot; When you have a good
  friend, you also make a long-term commitment. You need her. How much more so with someone
  who wants to share your life, your soul, and your body. The phrase &quot;long-term
  commitment&quot; cannot express the depth of love, but we have to say something so that
  people understand. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A long-term commitment between two people is only a
  beginning. We also need the support of friends and other people. That is why, in our
  society, we have a wedding ceremony. The two families join together with other friends to
  witness the fact that you have come together to live as a couple. The priest and the
  marriage license are just symbols. What is important is that your commitment is witnessed
  by many friends and both of your families. Now you will be supported by them. A long-term
  commitment is stronger and more long-lasting if made in the context of a Sangha. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Your strong feelings for each other are very important,
  but they are not enough to sustain your happiness. Without other elements, what you
  describe as love may turn into something sour rather soon. The support of friends and
  family coming together weaves a kind of web. The strength of your feelings is only one of
  the strands of that web. Supported by many elements, the couple will be solid, like a
  tree. If a tree wants to be strong, it needs a number of roots sent deep into the soil. If
  a tree has only one root, it may be blown over by the wind. The life of a couple also
  needs to be supported by many elements -- families, friends, ideals, practice, and Sangha.
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Plum Village, the practice community where I live in
  France, every time we have a wedding ceremony, we invite the whole community to celebrate
  and bring support to the couple. After the ceremony, on every full moon day, the couple
  recites the Five Awarenesses together, remembering that friends everywhere are supporting
  their relationship to be stable, long-lasting, and happy. Whether or not your relationship
  is bound by law, it will be stronger and more long-lasting if made in the presence of a
  Sangha -- friends who love you and want to support you in the spirit of understanding and
  loving kindness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Love can be a kind of sickness. In the West and in Asia,
  we have the word &quot;lovesick.&quot; What makes us sick is attachment. Although it is a
  sweet internal formation, this kind of love with attachment is like a drug. It makes us
  feel wonderful, but once we are addicted, we cannot have peace. We cannot study, do our
  daily work, or sleep. We only think of the object of our love. We are sick with love. This
  kind of love is linked to our willingness to possess and monopolize. We want the object of
  our love to be entirely ours and only for us. It is totalitarian. We do not want anyone to
  prevent us from a prison, where we lock up our beloved and create only suffering for him
  or her. The one who is loved is deprived of freedom -- of the right to be him or herself
  and enjoy life. This kind of love cannot be described as maitri or karuna. It is only the
  willingness to make use of the other person in order to satisfy our own needs. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When you have sexual energy that makes you feel unhappy,
  as though you are losing your inner peace, you should know how to practice so that you do
  not do things that will bring suffering to other people or yourself. We have to learn
  about this. In Asia, we say there are three sources of energy -- sexual, breath, and
  spirit. <em>Tinh,</em> sexual energy, is the first. When you have more sexual energy than
  you need, there will be an imbalance in your body and in your being. You need to know how
  to reestablish the balance, or you may act irresponsibly. According to Taoism and
  Buddhism, there are practices to help reestablish that balance, such as meditation or
  martial arts. You can learn the ways to channel your sexual energy into deep realizations
  in the domains of art and meditation. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second source of energy is <em>khi</em>, breath
  energy. Life can be described as a process of burning. In order to burn, every cell in our
  body needs nutrition and oxygen. In his <em>Fire Sermon</em>, the Buddha said, &quot;The
  eyes are burning, the nose is burning, the body is burning.&quot; In our daily lives, we
  have to cultivate our energy by practicing proper breathing. We benefit from the air and
  its oxygen, so we have to be sure that non-polluted air is available to us. Some people
  cultivate their khi by refraining from smoking and talking a lot. When you speak, take the
  time to breathe. At Plum Village, every time we hear the bell of mindfulness, everyone
  stops what they are doing and breathes consciously three times. We practice this way to
  cultivate and preserve our khi energy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The third source of energy is <em>than</em>, spirit
  energy. When you don't sleep at night, you lose some of this kind of energy. Your nervous
  system becomes exhausted and you cannot study or practice meditation well, or make good
  decisions. You don't have a clear mind because lack of sleep or from worrying too much.
  Worry and anxiety drain this source of energy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So don't worry. Don't stay up too late. Keep your nervous
  system healthy. Prevent anxiety. These kinds of practices cultivate the third source of
  energy. You need this source of energy to practice meditation well. A spiritual
  breakthrough requires the power of your spirit energy, which comes about through
  concentration and knowing how to preserve this source of energy. When you have strong
  spirit energy, you only have to focus it on an object, and you will have a breakthrough.
  If you don't have <em>than</em>, the light of your concentration will not shine brightly,
  because the light emitted is very weak. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to Asian medicine, the power of <em>than</em> is
  linked to the power of <em>tinh</em>. When we expend our sexual energy, it takes time to
  restore it. In Chinese medicine, when you want to have a strong spirit and concentration,
  you are advised to refrain from having sexual relationships or overeating. You will be
  given herbs, roots, and medicine to enrich your source of <em>than</em>, and during the
  time you are taking this medicine, you are asked to refrain from sexual relationships. If
  your source of spirit is weak and you continue to have sexual relations, it is said that
  you cannot recover your spirit energy. Those who practice meditation should try to
  preserve their sexual energy, because they need it during meditation. If you are an
  artist, you may wish to practice channeling your sexual energy together with your spirit
  energy into your art. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">During his struggle against the British, Gandhi undertook
  many hunger strikes, and he recommended to his friends who joined him on these fasts not
  to have sexual intercourse. When you fast for many days, if you have sexual relations, you
  may die; you have to preserve your energies. Thich Tri Quang, my friend who fasted for one
  hundred days in the hospital in Saigon in 1966, knew very well that not having sexual
  intercourse was very basic. Of course, as a monk, he did not have any problem with that.
  He also knew that speaking is an energy drain, so he refrained from speaking. If he needed
  something, he said it in one or two words or wrote it down. Writing, speaking, or making
  too many movements draws from these three sources of energy. So, the best thing is to lie
  down on your back and practice deep breathing. This brings into you the vitality that you
  need to survive a hundred-day hunger strike. If you don't eat, you cannot replenish this
  energy. If you refrain from studying, doing research, or worrying, you can preserve these
  resources. These three sources of energy are linked to each other. By practicing one, you
  help the other. That is why <em>anapanasati</em>, the practice of conscious breathing, is
  so important for our spiritual life. It helps with all of our sources of energy. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Monks and nuns do not engage in sexual relationships
  because they want to devote their energy to having a breakthrough in meditation. They
  learn to channel their sexual energy to strengthen their spirit energy for the
  breakthrough. They also practice deep breathing to increase the spirit energy. Since they
  live alone, without a family, they can devote most of their time to meditation and
  teaching, helping the people who provide them with food, shelter, and so on. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">They have contact with the population in the village in
  order to share the Dharma. Since they do not have a house or a family to care for, they
  have the time and space to do the things they like the most -- walking, sitting,
  breathing, and helping fellow monks, nuns, and laypeople -- and to realize what they want.
  Monks and nuns don't marry in order to preserve their time and energy for the practice. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Responsibility&quot; is the key word in the Third
  Precept. In a community of practice, if there is no sexual misconduct, if the community
  practices this precept well, there will be stability and peace. This precept should be
  practiced by everyone. You respect, support, and protect each other as Dharma brothers and
  sisters. If you don't practice this precept, you may become irresponsible and create
  trouble in the community at large. We have all seen this. If a teacher cannot refrain from
  sleeping with one of his or her students, he or she will destroy everything, possibly for
  several generations. We need mindfulness in order to have that sense of responsibility. We
  refrain from sexual misconduct because we are responsible for the well-being of so many
  people. If we are irresponsible, we can destroy everything. By practicing this precept, we
  keep the Sangha beautiful. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In sexual relationships, people can get wounded.
  Practicing this precept is to prevent ourselves and others from being wounded. Often we
  think it is the woman who receives the wound, but men also get deeply wounded. We have to
  be very careful, especially in short-term commitments. The practice of the Third Precept
  is a very strong way of restoring stability and peace in ourselves, our family, and our
  society. We should take the time to discuss problems relating to the practice of this
  precept, like loneliness, advertising, and even the sex industry. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The feeling of loneliness is universal in our society.
  There is no communication between ourselves and other people, even in the family, and our
  feeling of loneliness pushes us into having sexual relationship will make us feel less
  lonely, but it isn't true. When there is not enough communication with another person on
  the level of the heart and spirit, a sexual relationship will only widen the gap and
  destroy us both. Our relationship will be stormy, and we will make each other suffer. The
  belief that having a sexual relationship will help us feel lonely is a kind of
  superstition. We should not be fooled by it. In fact, we will feel more lonely afterwards.
  The union of the two bodies can only be positive when there is understanding and communion
  on the level of the heart and the spirit. Even between husband and wife, if the communion
  on the level of the heart and spirit does not exist, the coming together of the two bodies
  will only separate you further. When that is the case, I recommend that you refrain from
  having sexual relationships and first try to make a breakthrough in communication. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are two Vietnamese words, <em>tinh</em> and <em>nghia</em>,
  that are difficult to translate into English. They both mean something like love. In <em>tinh</em>,
  you find elements of passion. It can be very deep, absorbing the whole of your being. <em>Nghia</em>
  is a kind of continuation of <em>tinh</em>. With <em>Nghia</em> you feel much calmer, more
  understanding, more willing to sacrifice to make the other person happy, and more
  faithful. You are not as passionate as in <em>tinh</em>, but your love is deeper and more
  solid. <em>Nghia</em> will keep you and the other person together for a long time. It is
  the result of living together and sharing difficulties and joy over time. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You begin with passion, but, living with each other, you
  encounter difficulties, and as you learn to deal with them, your love deepens. Although
  the passion diminishes, <em>nghia</em> increases all the time. <em>Nghia</em> is a deeper
  love, with more wisdom, more interbeing, more unity. You understand the other person
  better. You and that person become one reality. <em>Nghia</em> is like a fruit that is
  already ripe. It does not taste sour anymore; it is only sweet. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In <em>nghia</em>, you feel gratitude for the other
  person. &quot;Thank you for having chosen me. Thank you for being my husband or my wife.
  There are so many people in society, why have you chosen me? I am very thankful.&quot;
  That is the beginning of <em>nghia</em>, the sense of thankfulness for your having chosen
  me as your companion to share the best things in yourself, as well as your suffering and
  your happiness. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">When we live together, we support each other. We begin to
  understand each other's feelings and difficulties. When the other person has shown his or
  her understanding of our problems, difficulties, and deep aspirations, we feel thankful
  for that understanding. When you feel understood by someone, you stop being unhappy.
  Happiness is, first of all, feeling understood. &quot;I am grateful because you have
  proved that you understand me. While I was having difficulty and remained awake deep into
  the night, you took care of me. You showed me that my well-being is your own well-being.
  You did the impossible in order to bring about my well-being. You took care of me in a way
  that no one else in this world could have. For that I am grateful to you.&quot; </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">If the couple lives with each other for a long time,
  &quot;until our hair becomes white and our teeth fall out,&quot; it is because of <em>nghia</em>,
  and not because of <em>tinh</em>. <em>Tinh</em> is passionate love. <em>Nghia</em> is the
  kind of love that has a lot of understanding and gratitude in it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">All love may begin by being passionate, especially for
  younger people. But in the process of living together, they have to learn and practice
  love, so that selfishness -- the tendency to possess -- will diminish, and the elements of
  understanding and gratitude will settle in, little by little, until their love becomes
  nourishing, protecting, and reassuring. With <em>nghia</em>, you are very sure that the
  other person will take care of you and will love you until your teeth fall out and your
  hair becomes white. Nothing will assure you that the person will be with you for a long
  time except <em>nghia</em>. <em>Nghia</em> is built by both of you in your daily life. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">To meditate is to look into the nature of our love to see
  the kind of elements that are in it. We cannot call our love just <em>tinh</em> or <em>nghia</em>,
  possessive love or altruistic love, because there may be elements of both in it. It may be
  ninety percent possessive love, three percent altruistic love, two percent gratitude, and
  so on. Look deeply into the nature of your love and find out. The happiness of the other
  person and your own happiness depend on the nature of your love. Of course you have love
  in you, but what is important is the nature of that love. If you realize that there is a
  lot of maitri and karuna in your love, that will be very reassuring. <em>Nghia</em> will
  be strong in it. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Children, if they observe deeply, will see that what keeps
  their parents together is <em>nghia</em> and not passionate love. If their parents take
  good care of each other, look after each other with calmness, tenderness, and care, <em>nghia</em>
  is the foundation of that care. That is the kind of love we really need for our family and
  for our society. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In practicing the Third Precept, we should always look
  into the nature of our love in order to see and not be fooled by our feelings. Sometimes
  we feel that we have love for the other person, but maybe that love is only an attempt to
  satisfy our own egoistic needs. Maybe we have not looked deeply enough to see the needs of
  the other person, including the need to be safe, protected. If we have that kind of
  breakthrough, we will realize that the other person needs our protection, and therefore we
  cannot look upon him or her just as an object of our desire. The other person should not
  be looked upon as a kind of commercial item. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sex is used in our society as a means for selling
  products. We also have the sex industry. If we don't look at the other person as a human
  being, with the capacity of becoming a Buddha, we risk transgressing this precept.
  Therefore the practice of looking deeply into the nature of our love has a lot to do with
  the practice of the Third Precept. <em>&quot;I will do everything in my power to protect
  children from sexual abuse and to prevent couples and families from being broken by sexual
  misconduct.&quot;</em> Adults who were molested as children continue to suffer very much.
  Everything they think, do, and say bears the mark of that wound. They want to transform
  themselves and heal their wound, and the best way to do this is to observe the Third
  Precept. Because of their own experience, they can say, &quot;As a victim of sexual abuse,
  I undertake to protect all children and adults from sexual abuse.&quot; Our suffering
  becomes a kind of positive energy that will help us become a bodhisattva. We undertake to
  protect all children and other people. And we <em>also</em> undertake to help those who
  abuse children sexually, because they are sick and need our help. The ones who made us
  suffer become the object of our love and protection. We see that until the sick are
  protected and helped, children are going to continue to be abused sexually. We undertake
  to help these people so that they will not molest children any longer. At the same time,
  we undertake to help children. We take not only the side of children who are being
  molested, but the other side also. These molesters are sick, the products of an unstable
  society. They may be an uncle, an aunt, a grandparent, or a parent. They need to be
  observed, helped, and, if possible, healed. When we are determined to observe this
  precept, the energy that is born helps us to transform into a bodhisattva, and that
  transformation may heal us even before we begin to practice. The best way for anyone who
  was molested as a child to heal is to take this precept and undertake to protect children
  and adults who may be sick, who may be repeating the kind of destructive actions that will
  cause a child to be wounded for the rest of his or her life. </font></p>
