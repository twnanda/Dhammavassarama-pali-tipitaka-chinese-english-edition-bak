<HR>
This book is an attempt to give an organized, detailed account of the Patimokkha 
training rules and the tradi-tions that have grown up around them. It is aimed 
primarily at those whose lives are affected by the rules -- bhikkhus who live by 
them, and other people who have dealings with the bhikkhus -- so that they will 
be able to find gathered in one volume as much essential information as possible 
on just what the rules do and do not entail. Students of Early Buddhism, 
Theravadin history, or contemporary Theravadin issues should also find this book 
interesting, as should anyone who is serious about the practice of the Dhamma 
and wants to see how the Buddha worked out the ramifications of Dhamma practice 
in daily life. 
<P>The amount of information offered here is both the book's strength and its 
weakness. On the one hand, it encompasses material that in some cases is 
otherwise unavailable in Eng-lish or even in romanized Pali, and should be 
sufficient to serve as a life-long companion to any bhikkhu who seriously wants 
to benefit from the precise and thorough training the rules have to offer. On 
the other hand, the sheer size of the book and the mass of details to be 
remembered might prove daunting or discouraging to anyone just embarking on the 
bhikkhu's life. 
<P>To overcome this drawback, I have tried to organize the material in as 
clear-cut a manner as possible. In particular, by analyzing each rule into its 
component factors, I have tried to show not only the rule's precise range but 
also how it connects to the general pattern of mindfully analyzing one's own 
actions in terms of such factors as intention, perception, object, effort, and 
result -- a system that plays an important role in the training of the mind. 
<P>Secondly, I have provided short summaries for the rules and have gathered 
them, organized by topic, in the Rule Index at the back of the book. If you are 
new to the subject of Buddhist monastic discipline, I suggest that you read the 
Rule Index first, to grasp the gist of the rules and their rela-tionship to the 
Buddhist path, before going on to the more detailed discussions in the body of 
the book. This should help you keep the general purpose of the rules in mind, 
and keep you from getting lost in the mass of details. 
<P>I am indebted to the many people who helped directly and indirectly in the 
writing of this book. Phra Ajaan Fuang Jotiko (Phra Khru Nanavisitth) and Phra 
Ajaan Thawng Candasiri (Phra Nanavisitth), my first teachers in Vinaya, gave me 
a thorough grounding in the subject. Ven. Brahmavamso Bhikkhu gave many hours of 
his time to writing detailed criticisms of early versions of the manuscript 
during the long period of research that led up to the book, forcing me to deepen 
my knowledge and sharpen my presentation of the topic. There was a brief period 
when he and I thought of co-authoring the book, but the many questions that 
needed to be settled concerning form and content eventually required that one 
person go it alone, and it fell my lot to be that person. Still, much of the 
precision of the book is a result of his efforts, even in cases where I had to 
differ with his opinions. 
<P>As the manuscript began to approach its final form, Ven. Phra Nanavarodom, 
Bhikkhu Bodhi, Thiradhammo Bhikkhu, Amaro Bhikkhu, Suviro Bhikkhu, Bill Weir, 
and Doris Weir all read copies of it and offered valuable suggestions for 
improvement. I, of course, remain responsible for any errors it may still 
contain. 
<P>I dedicate this book in gratitude and respect to my preceptor, Phra Debmoli 
(Samrong Gunavuddho) of Wat Asokaram, Samut Prakaan, Thailand, and to all my 
teachers in the path of the Dhamma-Vinaya.
