<hr>
Here are some of the answers to the exercises in the early chapters of Warder's <A HREF="index.html#warder"><I>Introduction to Pali</I></A> (1984 edition). I can't promise that these answers are right; they're just <i>my</i> answers. Use at your own risk.
<p>
I've used the same convention for diacritics that's in widespread use on the Internet. To wit: Long vowels are doubled (e.g., the Buddha's chief attendant is spelled "Aananda"); otherwise the diacritic mark precedes the letter it affects. Thus, "t-with-a-dot-under-it" (cerebral "t") is written as ".t"; "n-with-a-tilde-over-it" (palatal"n") is written as "~n"; and so on.
