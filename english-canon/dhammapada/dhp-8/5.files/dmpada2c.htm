      Five hundred bhikkhus, after accompanying the Buddha to a village, 
      returned to the Jetavana monastery. In the evening, while the bhikkhus 
      were talking about the trip, especially the condition of the land, whether 
      it was level or hilly, or whether the soil was clayey or sandy, red or 
      black, etc., the Buddha came to them. Knowing the subject of their talk, 
      he said to them, "Bhikkhus, the earth you are talking about is external to 
      the body; it is better, indeed, to examine your own body and make 
      preparations (for meditation practice)." </P>

      one occasion, a certain bhikkhu, after taking a subject of meditation from 
      the Buddha, went to the forest. Although he tried hard he made little 
      progress in his meditation; so he decided to go back to the Buddha for 
      further instruction. On his way back he saw a mirage, which, after all, 
      was only an illusive appearance of a sheet of water. At that instant, he 
      came to realize that the body also was insubstantial like a mirage. Thus 
      keeping his mind on the insubstantiality of the body he came to the bank 
      of the river Aciravati. While sitting under a tree close to the river, 
      seeing big froths breaking up, he realized the impermanent nature of the

      While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (47) of 
      this book, with reference to Vitatubha, son of King Pasenadi of 
    Kosala.</P></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD bgColor=#fefeda>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      King Pasenadi of Kosala, wishing to marry into the clan of the Sakyans, 
      sent some emissaries to Kapilavatthu with a request for the hand of one of 
      the Sakyan princesses. Not wishing to offend King Pasenadi, the Sakyan 
      princes replied that they would comply with his request, but instead of a 
      Sakyan princess they sent a very beautiful girl born of King Mahanama and 
      a slave woman. King Pasenadi made that girl one of his chief queens and 
      subsequently she gave birth to a son. This son was named Vitatubha. When 
      the prince was sixteen years old, he was sent on a visit to King Mahanama 
      and the Sakyan princes. There he was received with some hospitality but 
      all the Sakyan princes who were younger than Vitatubha had been sent away 
      to a village, so that they would not have to pay respect to Vitatubha. 
      After staying a few days in Kapilavatthu, Vitatubha and his company left 
      for home. Soon after they left, a slave girl was washing with milk the 
      place where Vitatubha had sat; she was also cursing him, shouting, "This 
      is the place where that son of a slave woman had sat". At that moment, a 
      member of Vitatubha's entourage returned to fetch something which he had 
      left at the place and heard what the slave girl said. The slave girl also 
      told him that Vitatubha's mother, Vasabhakhattiya, was the daughter of a 
      slave girl belonging to Mahanama.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      When Vitatubha was told about the above incident, he became wild with rage 
      and declared that one day he would wipe out the whole clan of the Sakyans. 
      True to his word, when Vitatubha became king, he marched on the Sakyan 
      clan and massacred them all, with the exception of a few who were with 
      Mahanama and some others. On their way home, Vitatubha and his army 
      encamped on the sandbank in the river Aciravati. As heavy rain fell in the 
      upper parts of the country on that very night, the river swelled and 
      rushed down with great force carrying away Vitatubha and his army into the 
      ocean.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 
      hearing about these two tragic incidents, the Buddha explained to the 
      bhikkhus that his relatives, the Sakyan princes, had in one of their 
      previous existences, put poison into the river killing the fishes. It was 
      as a result of that particular action that the Sakyan princes had to die 
      en masse. Then, referring to the incident about Vitatubha and his army, 
      the Buddha said, "As a great flood sweeps away all the villagers in a 
      sleeping village, so also, Death carries away all the creatures hankering 
      after sensual pleasures."</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (48) of 
      this book, with reference to Patipujika Kumari.</P></TD></TR>

    <TD bgColor=#fefeda>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Patipujika Kumari was a lady from Savatthi. She married at the age of 
      sixteen and had four sons. She was a virtuous as well as a generous lady, 
      who loved to make offerings of food and other requisites to the bhikkhus. 
      She would often go to the monastery and clean up the premises, fill the 
      pots and jars with water and perform other services. Patipujika. also 
      possessed Jatissara Knowledge through which she remembered that in her 
      previous existence she was one of the numerous wives of Malabhari, in the 
      deva world of Tavatimsa. She also remembered that she had passed away from 
      there when all of them were out in the garden enjoying themselves, 
      plucking and picking flowers. So, every time she made offerings to the 
      bhikkhus or performed any other meritorious act, she would pray that she 
      might be reborn in the Tavatimsa realm as a wife of Malabhari, her 
      previous husband.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      One day, Patipujika fell ill and passed away that same evening. As she had 
      so ardently wished, she was reborn in Tavatimsa deva world as a wife of 
      Malabhari. As one hundred years in the human world is equivalent to just 
      one day in Tavatimsa world, Malabhari and his other wives were still in 
      the garden enjoying themselves and Patipujika was barely missed by them. 
      So, when she rejoined them, Malabhari asked her where she had been the 
      whole morning. She then told him about her passing away from Tavatimsa, 
      her rebirth in the human world, her marriage to a man and also about how 
      she had given birth to four sons, her passing away from there and finally 
      her return to Tavatimsa.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      When the bhikkhus learned about the death of Patipujika, they were 
      stricken with grief. They went to the Buddha and reported that Patipujika, 
      who was offering alms-food to them early in the morning, had passed away 
      in the evening. To them the Buddha replied that the life of beings was 
      very brief; and that before they could hardly be satiated in their sensual 
      pleasures, they were overpowered by Death.</P>

      While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (49) of 
      this book, with reference to the Chief Disciple Maha Moggallana and the 
      miserly rich man, Kosiya.</P></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD bgColor=#fefeda>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
      the village of Sakkara, near Rajagaha, there lived a miserly rich man by 
      the name of Kosiya, who was very reluctant to give away even the tiniest 
      part of anything belonging to him. One day, to avoid sharing with others, 
      the rich man and his wife were making some pancakes in the uppermost 
      storey of their house, where no one would see them.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Early in the morning, on that day, the Buddha through his supernormal 
      power, saw the rich man and his wife in his vision, and knew that both of 
      them would soon attain Sotapatti Fruition. So he sent his Chief Disciple 
      Maha Moggallana to the house of the rich man, with instructions to bring 
      the couple to the Jetavana monastery in time for the midday meal. The 
      Chief Disciple, by supernormal power, reached Kosiya's house in an instant 
      and stood at the window. The rich man saw him and asked him to leave; the 
      Venerable Maha Moggallana just stood there without saying anything. In the 
      end, Kosiya said to his wife, "Make a very small pancake and give it to 
      the bhikkhu." So she took just a little amount of dough and put it in the 
      pan, and the cake filled up the whole pan. Kosiya thought his wife must 
      have put in too much, so he took just a pinch of dough and put it into the 
      pan; his pancake also swelled into a big one. It so happened that however 
      little dough they might put in, they wore unable to make small pancakes. 
      At last, Kosiya asked his wife to offer one from the basket to the 
      bhikkhu. When she tried to take out one from the basket it would not come 
      off because all the pancakes were sticking together and could not be 
      separated. By this time Kosiya has lost all appetite for pancakes and 
      offered the whole basket of pancakes to Maha Moggallana. The Chief 
      Disciple then delivered a discourse on charity to the rich man and his 
      wife. He also told the couple about how the Buddha was waiting with five 
      hundred bhikkhus at the Jetavana monastery in Savatthi, forty-five yojanas 
      away from Rajagaha. Maha Moggallana, by his supernormal power, then took 
      both Kosiya and his wife together with their basket of pancakes, to the 
      presence of the Buddha. There, they offered the pancakes to the Buddha and 
      the five hundred bhikkhus. At the end of the meal, the Buddha delivered a 
      discourse on charity, and both Kosiya and his wife attained Sotapatti 
      Fruition.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Next evening, while the bhikkhus were talking in praise of Maha 
      Moggallana, the Buddha came to them and said, "Bhikkhus, you should also 
      dwell and act in the village like Maha Moggallana, receiving the offerings 
      of the villagers without affecting their faith and generosity, or their 
      wealth."</P>

      of the Buddha, she wished very much to invite him to her house to offer 
      him alms-food. So, the Buddha was invited and choice food was offered. As 
      the Buddha was expressing appreciation (anumodana), Paveyya, who was in 
      the next room, fumed with rage. He blamed and cursed the lady for

      While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verses (51) 
      and (52) of this hook, with reference to the lay disciple Chattapani and 
      the two queens of King Pasenadi of Kosala.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
      lay disciple named Chattapani who was an anagami* lived in Savatthi. On 
      one occasion, Chattapani was with the Buddha at the Jetavana monastery 
      respectfully and attentively listening to a religious discourse, when King 
      Pasenadi also came to the Buddha. Chattapani did not stand up because he 
      thought that by standing up, it might mean that he was paying respect to 
      the king, but not paying due respect to the Buddha. The king took that as 
      an insult and was very much offended. The Buddha knew exactly how the king 
      was feeling; so he spoke in praise of Chattapani, who was well-versed in 
      the Dhamma and had also attained the Anagami Fruition. On hearing this, 
      the king was impressed and favourably inclined towards Chattapani.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      When the king next met Chattapani he said, "You are so learned; could you 
      please come to the palace and give lessons of the Dhamma to my two 
      queens?" Chattapani declined but he suggested that the king should request 
      the Buddha to assign a bhikkhu for this purpose. So, the king approached 
      the Buddha in connection with this, and the Buddha directed the Venerable 
      Ananda to go regularly to the palace and teach the Dhamma to queen Mallika 
      and queen Vasabhakhattiya. After some time, the Buddha asked the Venerable 
      Ananda about the progress of the two queens. The Venerable Ananda answered 
      that although Mallika was learning the Dhamma seriously, Vasabhakhattiya 
      was not paying proper attention. On hearing this the Buddha said that the 
      Dhamma could be of benefit only to those who learn it seriously with due 
      respect and proper attention and then practise diligently what was 
      taught.</P>

      While residing at the Pubbarama monastery in Savatthi, the Buddha uttered 
      Verse (53) of this book, with reference to Visakha, the famous donor of 
      the Pubbarama monastery.</P></TD></TR>

      Visakha was the daughter of a rich man of Bhaddiya, named Danancaya, and 
      his wife Sumanadevi, and the granddaughter of Mendaka, one of the five 
      extremely wealthy men of' King Bimbisara's dominions. When Visakha was 
      seven years old, the Buddha came on a tour to Bhaddiya. On that occasion, 
      the rich man Mendaka took Visakha and her five hundred companions with him 
      to pay homage to the Buddha. After hearing the discourse given by the 
      Buddha, Visakha, her grandfather and all her five hundred companions 
      attained Sotapatti Fruition.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      When Visakha came of age, she married Punnavadahana, son of Migara, a 
      fairly rich man from Savatthi. One day, while Migara was having his meal, 
      a bhikkhu stopped for alms at his house; but Migara completely ignored the 
      bhikkhu. Visakha, seeing this, said to the bhikkhu, "I am sorry, your 
      reverence, my father-in-law only eats leftovers." On hearing this, Migara 
      flew into a rage and told her to leave his house. But Visakha said she was 
      not going away, and that she would send for the eight elderly rich men who 
      were sent by her father to accompany her and to advise her. It was for 
      them to decide whether she was guilty or not. When the elders came, Migara 
      said to them, "While I was having my rice-with-milk in a golden bowl, 
      Visakha said that I was taking only dirt and filth. For this offence, I'm 
      sending her away." Thereupon, Visakha explained as follows: "When I saw my 
      father-in-law completely ignoring the bhikkhu standing for alms-food, I 
      thought to myself that my father-in-law was not doing any meritorious deed 
      in this existence. he was only eating the fruits of has past good deeds. 
      So, I said, 'My father-in-law only eats leftovers.' Now Sirs, what do you 
      think, am I guilty?" The elders decided that Visakha was not guilty. 
      Visakha then said that she was one who had absolute and unshakable faith 
      in the Teaching of the Buddha and so could not stay where the bhikkhus 
      were not welcome; and also, that if she was not given permission to invite 
      the bhikkhus to the house to offer alms-food and make other offerings, she 
      would leave the house. So permission was granted her to invite the Buddha 
      and his bhikkhus to the house. </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The next day, the Buddha and his disciples were invited to the house of 
      Visakha When alms-food was about to be offered, she sent word to her 
      father-in-law to join her in offering food; but he did not come. When the 
      meal was over, again she sent a message, this time requesting her 
      father-in-law to join her in hearing the discourse that would soon be 
      given by the Buddha. Her father-in-law felt that he should not refuse for 
      a second time. But his ascetic teachers, the Niganthas, would not let him 
      go; however, they conceded that he could listen from behind a curtain. 
      After hearing the Buddha's discourse Migara attained Sotapatti Fruition. 
      He felt very thankful to the Buddha and also to his daughter-in-law. Being 
      so thankful, he declared that henceforth Visakha would be like a mother to 
      him, and Visakha came to be known as Migaramata.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Visakha gave birth to ten sons and ten daughters, and ten sons and ten 
      daughters each were born to everyone of her children and grand-children. 
      Visakha possessed an immensely valuable gem-encrusted cloak given by her 
      father as a wedding present. One day, Visakha went to the Jetavana 
      monastery with her entourage. On arrival at the monastery, she found that 
      her bejeweled cloak was too heavy. So, she took it off, wrapped it up in 
      her shawl, and gave it to the maid to hold it and take care of it. The 
      maid absentmindedly left it at the monastery. It was the custom for the 
      Venerable Ananda to look after the things left by any one of the lay 
      disciples. Visakha sent the maid back to the monastery saying, "Go and 
      look for the bejeweled cloak, but if the Venerable Ananda had already 
      found it and kept it in a place do not bring it back; I donate the 
      bejeweled clock to the Venerable Ananda." But the Venerable Ananda did not 
      accept her donation. So Visakha decided to sell the bejeweled cloak and 
      donate the sale proceeds. But there was no one who could afford to buy 
      that bejeweled cloak. So Visakha bought it back for nine crores and one 
      lakh. With this money, she built a monastery on the eastern side of the 
      city; this monastery came to be known as Pubbarama.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      After the libation ceremony she called all her family to her and on that 
      night she told them that all her wishes had ken fulfilled and that she had 
      nothing more to desire. Then reciting five verses of exultation she went 
      round and round the monastery. Some bhikkhus hearing her, thought she was 
      singing and reported to the Buddha that Visakha was not like before, and 
      that she was going round and round the monastery, singing. "Could it be 
      that she had gone off her head?" they asked the Buddha. To this question, 
      the Buddha replied, "Today, Visakha had all her wishes of the past and 
      present existences fulfilled and on account of that sense of achievement, 
      she was feeling elated and contented; Visakha was just reciting some 
      verses of exultation; she certainly had not gone off her head. Visakha, 
      throughout her previous existences, had always been a generous donor and 
      an ardent promoter of the Doctrine of successive Buddhas. She was most 
      strongly inclined to do good deeds and had done much good in her previous 
      existences, just as an expert florist makes many garlands from a 
      collection of flowers.</P>

      While the Venerable Ananda was sitting by himself one evening, the problem 
      relating to scents and perfumes came to his mind and he pondered: "The 
      scent of wood, the scent of flowers, and the scent of roots all spread 
      with the current of wind but not against it. Is there no scent which would 
      spread with the current of wind as well as against it? Is there no scent 
      which would pervade every part of the world?" Without answering the 
      question himself, the Venerable Ananda approached the Buddha and solicited 
      an answer from him. The Buddha said, "Ananda, supposing, there is one who 
      takes refuge in the Three Gems (the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Samgha), who 
      observes the five moral precepts, who is generous and not avaricious; such 
      a man is truly virtuous and truly worthy of praise. The reputation of that

      Arising from<I> nirodhasamapatti</I>*, Thera Mahakassapa entered a poor 
      section of the city of Rajagaha for alms-food. His intention was to give a 
      poor man an opportunity of gaining great merit as a result of offering 
      alms-food to one who had just come out of <I>nirodhasamapatti</I>. Sakka, 
      king of the devas, wishing to take the opportunity of offering alms-food 
      to Thera Mahakassapa, assumed the form of a poor old weaver and came to 
      Rajagaha with his wife Sujata in the form of an old woman. Thera 
      Mahakassapa stood at their door; the poor old weaver took the bowl from 
      the thera and filled up the bowl with rice and curry, and the delicious 
      smell of the curry spread throughout the city. Then it occurred to the 
      thera that this person must be no ordinary human being, and he came to 
      realize that this must be Sakka himself. Sakka admitted the fact and 
      claimed that he too was poor because he had had no opportunity of offering 
      anything to anyone during the time of the Buddhas. So saying, Sakka and 
      his wife Sujata left the thera after paying due respect to him.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The Buddha, from his monastery, saw Sakka and Sujata leaving and told the 
      bhikkhus about Sakka offering alms-food to Theha Mahakassapa. The bhikkhus 
      wondered how Sakka knew that Thera Mahakassapa had just come out of 
      <I>nirodhasamapatti</I>, and that it was the right and auspicious time for 
      him to make offerings to the thera. This question was put up to the 
      Buddha, and the Buddha answered, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Bhikkhus, the 
      reputation of a virtuous one as my son, Thera Mahakassapa, spreads far and

      this book, with reference to Thera Godhika.</P></TD></TR>

      Thera Godhika was, on one occasion, diligently practising Tranquillity and 
      Insight Development, on a stone slab on the side of Isigili mountain in 
      Magadha. When he had achieved one-pointedness of the mind (jhana) he 
      became very ill; that impaired the effectiveness of his practice. In spite 
      of his sickness, he kept on striving hard; but every time he was making 
      some progress he was overcome by sickness. He was thus inflicted for six 
      times. Finally, he made up his mind to overcome all obstacles and attain 
      arahatship even if he were to die. So, without relaxing he continued to 
      practise diligently; in the end he decided to give up his life by cutting 
      his throat; at the point of death he attained arahatship.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      When Mara learned that Thera Godhika had died, he tried to find out where 
      the thera was reborn but failed to find him. So, assuming the likeness of 
      a young man, Mara approached the Buddha and enquired where Thera Godhika 
      was. The Buddha replied to him,<I><FONT color=#800040> "It will be of no 
      benefit to you to learn of the destination of Thera Godhika; for having 
      been freed of moral defilements he became an arahat. One like you, Mara, 
      for all your power will not be able to find out where such arahats go 
      after death."</FONT></I></P>

      While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verses (58) 
      and (59) of this book, with reference to a rich man named Garahadinna and 
      the miracle of the lotus flowers.</P></TD></TR>

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      There were two friends named Sirigutta and Garahadinna in Savatthi. 
      Sirigutta was a follower of the Buddha and Garahadinna was a follower of 
      the Niganthas, the ascetics who were hostile to the Buddhists. At the 
      instance of the Niganthas, Garahadinna often said to Sirigutta, "What 
      benefit do you get by following the Buddha? Come, be a follower of my 
      teachers." Having been told thus many times, Sirigutta said to 
      Garahadinna, "Tell me, what do your teachers know?" To this, Garahadinna 
      replied that his teachers knew everything; with their great power they 
      knew the past, the present and the future and also the thoughts of others. 
      So, Sirigutta invited the Niganthas to his house for alms-food.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Sirigutta wanted to find out the truth about the Niganthas, whether they 
      really possessed the power of knowing other people's thoughts, etc. So he 
      made a long, deep trench and filled it up with excreta and filth. Seats 
      were then placed precariously over the trench; and big empty pots were 
      brought in and covered up with cloth and banana leaves to make them appear 
      as if they were full of rice and curries. When the Niganthas arrived, they 
      were requested to enter one by one, to stand near their respective seats, 
      and to sit down simultaneously. As all of them sat down, the flimsy 
      strings broke and the Niganthas fell into the filthy trench. Then 
      Sirigutta taunted them, "Why don't you know the past, the present and the 
      future? Why don't you know the thoughts of others?" All the Niganthas then 
      fled in terror.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Garahadinna naturally was furious with Sirigutta and refused to talk to 
      him for two weeks. Then, he decided that he would have his revenge on 
      Sirigutta. He pretended that he was no longer angry, and one day asked 
      Sirigutta to invite, on his behalf, the Buddha and his five hundred 
      disciples to partake of alms-food. So Sirigutta went to the Buddha and 
      invited him to the house of Garahadinna. At the same time, he told the 
      Buddha about what he had done to the Niganthas, the teachers of 
      Garahadinna. He also expressed his fear that this invitation might be a 
      reprisal and so the invitation should be accepted only after due 
      consideration.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The Buddha, with his supernormal power, knew that this would be the 
      occasion for the two friends to attain Sotapatti Fruition, and therefore 
      accepted the invitation. Garahadinna made a trench, filled it with live 
      coals and covered it with mats. He also kept some empty pots covered with 
      cloth and banana leaves to make them appear as if filled with rice and 
      curries. The next day, the Buddha came followed by five hundred bhikkhus 
      in single file. When the Buddha stepped on the mat over the trench, the 
      mat and live coals miraculously disappeared, and five hundred lotus 
      flowers, each as large as a cart wheel, sprang up for the Buddha and his 
      disciples to sit upon.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Seeing this miracle, Garahadinna was very much alarmed and he said rather 
      incoherently to Sirigutta, "Help me, dear friend. Out of my desire for 
      revenge, I have truly done a great wrong. My bad designs have had no 
      effect at all on your Teacher. The pots in my kitchen are all empty. 
      Please help me." Sirigutta then told Garahadinna to go and look at the 
      pots. When Garahadinna found all the pots filled with food he was 
      astounded and at the same time very much relieved and very happy. So the 
      food was offered to the Buddha and his disciples. After the meal, the 
      Buddha expressed his appreciation (anumodana) of the meritorious act and 
      then said, "Ignorant worldlings, lacking in knowledge, do not know the 
      unique qualities of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Samgha and so they are 
      like the blind; but the wise, having knowledge, are like people with 
      sight."</P>
      <P 
      align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then 
      the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:</P>
