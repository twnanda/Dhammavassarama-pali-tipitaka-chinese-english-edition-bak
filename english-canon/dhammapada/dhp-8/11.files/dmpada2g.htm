group of six bhikkhus (<I>chabbaggi</I>) who picked a quarrel with another group 
comprising seventeen bhikkhus. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once seventeen bhikkhus were 
cleaning up a building in the Jetavana monastery-complex with the intention of 
occupying it, when another group comprising six bhikkhus arrived on the scene. 
The group of six said to the first group,<FONT color=#ff8040> "We are senior to 
you, so you had better give way to us; we will take this place."</FONT> The 
group of seventeen did not give in, so the <I>chabbaggis</I> beat up the other 
group who cried out in pain. The Buddha learning about this reprimanded them and 
laid down the disciplinary rule forbidding bhikkhus to beat others. </P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verses (133) and (134) of this book, with 
reference to Thera Kondadhana. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the day Kondadhana was 
admitted to the Order, the image of a female was always following him. This 
image was seen by others, but Kondadhana himself did not see it and so did not 
know about it.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he was out on an 
alms-round, people would offer two spoonfuls to him, saying,<FONT color=#0000ff> 
"This is for you, Venerable Sir, and this is for your female companion." 
</FONT>Seeing the bhikkhu going about with a woman, people went to King Pasenadi 
of Kosala and reported about the bhikkhu and the woman. They said to the king, 
<FONT color=#ff8040>"O king! Drive out the bhikkhu, who is lacking in moral 
virtues, from your kingdom."</FONT> So the king went to the monastery where that 
bhikkhu was staying and surrounded it with his men. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing noises and voices, the 
bhikkhus came out and stood at the door, and the image also was there not far 
from the bhikkhu. Knowing that the king had come, the bhikkhu went into the room 
to wait for him. When the king entered the room, the image was not there. The 
king asked the bhikkhu where the woman was and he replied that he saw no woman. 
The king wanted to make sure and he asked the bhikkhu to leave the room for a 
while. The bhikkhu left the room, but when the king looked out, again he saw the 
woman near the bhikkhu. But when the bhikkhu came back to the room the woman was 
nowhere to be found. The king concluded that the woman was not real and so the 
bhikkhu must be innocent. He therefore invited the bhikkhu to come to the palace 
every day for alms-food. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When other bhikkhus heard about 
this, they were puzzled and said to the bhikkhu,<FONT color=#ff8040> "O bhikkhu 
with no morals! Now that the king, instead of driving you out of his kingdom, 
has invited you for alms-food, you are doomed!"</FONT> The bhikkhu on his part 
retorted, <FONT color=#804040>"Only you are the ones without morals; only you 
are doomed because you are the ones who go about with women!"</FONT> </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bhikkhus then reported the 
matter to the Buddha. The Buddha sent for Kodadadhana and said to him, <I><FONT 
color=#800040>"My son, did you see any woman with the other bhikkhus that you 
have talked to them thus? You have not seen any woman with them as they have 
seen one with you. I see that you do not realize that you have been cursed on 
account of an evil deed done by you in a past existence. Now listen, I shall 
explain to you why you have an image of a woman following you 
about.</FONT></I></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I><FONT color=#800040> "You were 
a deva in your last existence. During that time, there were two bhikkhus who 
were very much attached to each other. But you tried to create trouble between 
the two, by assuming the appearance of a woman and following one of the 
bhikkhus. For that evil deed you are now being followed by the image of a woman 
So, my son, in future do not argue with other bhikkhus any more; keep silent 
like a gong with the rim broken off and you will realize Nibbana."

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the Pubbarama 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (135) of this book, with reference to five 
hundred ladies. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, five hundred ladies from 
Savatthi came to the Pubbarama monastery to keep the Uposatha Sila vows. The 
donor of the monastery, the well-renowned Visakha, asked different age groups of 
ladies why they had come to keep the sabbath. She got different answers from 
different age groups for they had come to the monastery for different reasons. 
The old ladies came to the monastery to keep the sabbath because they hoped to 
gain the riches and glories of the devas in their next existence; the 
middle-aged ladies had come to the monastery because they did not want to stay 
under the same roof with the mistresses of their respective husbands. The young 
married ladies had come because they wanted their first born to be a son, and 
the young unmarried ladies had come because they wanted to get married to good 
husbands.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having had these answers, 
Visakha took all the ladies to the Buddha. When she told the Buddha about the 
various answers of the different age groups of ladies, the Buddha said, <I><FONT 
color=#800040>"Visakha! birth, ageing and death are always actively working in 
beings; because one is born, one is subject to ageing and decay, and finally to 
death. Yet, they do not wish to strive for liberation from the round of 
existences (samsara); they still wish to linger in samsara"</FONT></I> </P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the Jetavana

constrictor peta*. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, as Thera Maha Moggallana 
was coming down the Gijjhakuta hill with Thera Lakkhana he saw a boa constrictor 
peta and smiled, but he did not say anything. When they were back at the 
Jetavana monastery, Thera Maha Moggallana told Lakkhana, in the presence of the 
Buddha about the boa constrictor peta, with its long body burning in flames. The 
Buddha also said he himself had also seen that very peta soon after he had 
attained Buddhahood, but that he did not say anything about it because people 
might not believe him and thus they would be doing a great wrong to the Buddha. 
So out of compassion for these beings, the Buddha had kept silent. Then he 
continued, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Now that I have a witness in Moggallana, I 
will tell you about this boa constrictor peta. This peta was a thief during the 
time of Kassapa Buddha. As a thief and a cruel-hearted man, he had set fire to 
the house of a rich man seven times. And not satisfied with that, he also set 
fire to the perfumed hall donated by the same rich man to Kassapa Buddha, while 
Kassapa Buddha was out on an alms-round. As a result of those evil deeds he had 
suffered for a long time in niraya. Now, while serving out his term of suffering 
as a peta, he is being burnt with sparks of flames going up and down the length

evil; but they cannot escape the evil consequences" </FONT></I></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verses (137), (138), (139) and (140) of this book, 
with reference to Thera Maha Moggallana.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, the Nigantha ascetics 
planned to kill Thera Maha Moggallana because they thought that by doing away 
with Thera Maha Moggallana the fame and fortune of the Buddha would also be 
diminished. So they hired some assassins to kill Thera Maha Moggallana who was 
staying at Kalasila near Rajagaha at that time. The assassins surrounded the 
monastery; but Thera Maha Moggallana, with his supernormal power, got away first 
through a key hole, and for the second time through the roof. Thus, they could 
not get hold of the Thera for two whole months. When the assassins again 
surrounded the monastery during the third month, Thera Maha Moggallana, 
recollecting that he had yet to pay for the evil deeds done by him during one of 
his past existences, did not exercise his supernormal power. So he was caught 
and the assassins beat him up until all his bones were utterly broken. After 
that, they left his body in a bush, thinking that he had passed away. But the 
Thera, through his jhanic power, revived himself and went to see the Buddha at 
the Jetavana monastery. When he informed the Buddha that he would soon realize 
parinibbana at Kalasila, near Rajagaha, the Buddha told him to go only after 
expounding the Dhamma to the congregation of bhikkhus, as that would be the last 
time they would see him. So, Thera Maha Moggallana expounded the Dhamma and left 
after paying obeisance seven times to the Buddha.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The news of the passing away of Thera Maha 
Moggallana at the hands of assassins spread like wild fire. King Ajatasattu 
ordered his men to investigate and get hold of the culprits. The assassins were 
caught and they were burnt to death. The bhikkhus felt very sorrowful over the 
death of Thera Maha Moggallana, and could not understand why such a personage 
like Thera Maha Moggallana should die at the hands of assassins. To them the 
Buddha said, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Bhikkhus! Considering that Moggallana had 
lived a noble life in this existence, he should not have met with such a death. 
But in one of his past existences, he had done a great wrong to his own parents, 
who were both blind. In the beginning, he was a very dutiful son, but after his 
marriage, his wife began to make trouble and she suggested that he should get 
rid of his parents. He took his blind parents in a cart into a forest, and there 
he killed them by beating them and making them believe that it was some thief 
who was beating them. For that evil deed he suffered in niraya for a long time; 
and in this existence, his last, he has died at the hands of assassins. Indeed, 
by doing wrong to those who should not be wronged, one is sure to suffer for 
it." </FONT></I></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the Jetavana

Bahubhandika, a bhikkhu with many possessions.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once there was a rich man in Savatthi. After 
the death of his wife, he decided to become a bhikkhu. But before he entered the 
Order, he built a monastery, which included a kitchen and a store room. He also 
brought his own furniture, utensils and a large stock of rice, oil, butter and 
other provisions. Whatever dishes he wanted was cooked for him by his servants. 
Thus, even as a bhikkhu he was living in comfort, and because he had so many 
things with him, he was known as 'Bahubhandika.' One day, other bhikkhus took 
him to the Buddha, and in his presence told the Buddha about the many things he 
had brought along with him to the monastery, and also how he was still leading 
the luxurious life of a rich man. So, the Buddha said to Bahubhandika, <I><FONT 
color=#800040>"My son, I have been teaching all of you to live an austere life; 
why have you brought so much property with you ?" </FONT></I>When reprimanded 
even this much, that bhikkhu lost his temper and said angrily, <FONT

So saying, he cast off his upper robe. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing him thus, the Buddha said to him, 
<I><FONT color=#800040>"My son, in your last existence you were an ogre; even as 
an ogre you had a sense of shame and a sense of fear to do evil. Now that you 
are a bhikkhu in my Teaching, why do you have to throw away the sense of shame, 
and the sense of fear to do evil?"</FONT></I> When he heard those words, the 
bhikkhu realized his mistake; his sense of shame and fear to do evil returned, 
and he respectfully paid obeisance to the Buddha and asked that he should be 
pardoned. The Buddha then said to him,<I><FONT color=#800040> "Standing there 
without your upper robe is not proper; just discarding your robe etc., does not 
maker you an austere bhikkhu; a bhikkhu must also discard his doubt."

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the Jetavana

Santati, the minister of King Pasenadi of Kosala.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On one occasion, Santati the 
minister returned after suppressing a rebellion on the border. King Pasenadi was 
so pleased with him that he honoured the minister with the gift of the riches 
and glory of a ruler together with a dancing girl to entertain him for seven 
days. For seven days, the king's minister enjoyed himself to his heart's 
content, getting intoxicated with drink and infatuated with the young dancer. On 
the seventh day, riding the ornamented royal elephant, he went down to the 
riverside for a bath. On the way, he met the Buddha going on an alms-round, and 
being drunk, he just bowed casually, as a sign of respect to the Buddha. The 
Buddha smiled, and Ananda asked the Buddha why he smiled. So, the Buddha said to 
Ananda, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Ananda, this minister will come to see me this 
very day and after I have given him a short discourse will become an arahat. 
Soon after becoming an arahat he will realize parinibbana."</FONT></I> </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Santati and his party spent the 
whole day at the riverside, bathing, eating, drinking and thus thoroughly 
enjoying themselves. In the evening the minister and his party went to the 
garden to have more drinks and to be entertained by the dancer. The dancer, on 
her part, tried her best to entertain the minister. For the whole week she was 
living on reduced diet to keep herself trim. While dancing, she suffered a 
severe stroke and collapsed, and at that instant she died with her eyes and 
mouth wide open. The minister was shocked and deeply distressed. In agony, he 
tried to think of a refuge and remembered the Buddha. He went to the Buddha, 
accompanied by his followers, and related to him about the grief and anguish he 
suffered on account of the sudden death of the dancer. He then said to the 
Buddha, <FONT color=#0000ff>"Venerable Sir! Please help me get over my sorrow; 
be my refuge, and let me have the peace of mind."</FONT> To him the Buddha 
replied, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Rest assured my son, you have come to one, who 
could help you, One who could be a constant solace to you and who will be your 
refuge. The tears you have shed due to the death of this dancer throughout the 
round of rebirths is more than the waters of all the oceans."</FONT></I>The 
Buddha then instructed the minister in verse. The meaning of the verse is as 
follows. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I><FONT color=#800040>"In the 
past there has been in you clinging (upadana) due to craving; get rid of it. In 
future, do not let such clinging occur in you. Do not also harbour any clinging 
in the present; by not having any clinging, craving and passion will be calmed 
in you and you will realize Nibbana." </FONT></I></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the verse, the 
minister attained arahatship. Then, realizing that his life span was at an end, 
he said to the Buddha, <FONT color=#ff8040>"Venerable Sir! Let me now realize

<P align=center>Verses 143 and 144 </P>
<P align=center>X (10)<FONT color=#800040 size=+1> The Story of Thera <A 
name=pilotikatissa>Pilotikatissa</A></FONT> </P>
<P align=justify>While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered 
Verses (143) and (144) of this book, with reference to Thera Pilotikatissa. </P>
<P align=justify>Once, Thera Ananda saw a shabbily dressed youth going round 
begging for food; he felt pity for the youth and made him a samanera. The young 
samanera left his old clothes and his begging plate on the fork of a tree. When 
he became a bhikkhu he was known as Pilotikatissa. As a bhikkhu, he did not have 
to worry about food and clothing as he was in affluent circumstances. Yet, 
sometimes he did not feel happy in his life as a bhikkhu and thought of going 
back to the life of a lay man. Whenever he had this feeling, he would go back to 
that tree where he had left his old clothes and his plate. There, at the foot of 
the tree, he would put this question to himself, "Oh shameless one! Do you want 
to leave the place where you are fed well and dressed well? Do you still want to 
put on these shabby clothes and go begging again with this old plate in your 
hand?" Thus, he would rebuke himself, and after calming down, he would go back 
to the monastery. </P>
<P align=justify>After two or three days, again, he felt like leaving the 
monastic life of a bhikkhu, and again, he went to the tree where he kept his old 
clothes and his plate. After asking himself the same old question and having 
been reminded of the wretchedness of his old life, he returned to the monastery. 
This was repeated many times. When other bhikkhus asked him why he often went to 
the tree where he kept his old clothes and his plate, he told them that he went 
to see his teacher.* Thus keeping his mind on his old clothes as the subject of 
meditation, he came to realize the true nature of the aggregates of the khandhas 
(i. e., anicca, dukkha, anatta), and eventually he became an arahat. Then, he 
stopped going to the tree. Other bhikkhus noticing that Pilotikatissa had 
stopped going to the tree where he kept his old clothes and his plate asked him, 
"Why don't you go to your teacher any more?" To them, he answered, "When I had 
the need, I had to go to him; but there is no need for me to go to him now." 
When the bhikkhus heard his reply, they took him to see the Buddha. When they 
came to his presence they said, "Venerable Sir! This bhikkhu claims that he has 
attained arahatship; he must be telling lies." But the Buddha refuted them, and 
said, "Bhikkhus! Pilotikatissa is not telling lies, he speaks the truth. Though 
he had relationship with his teacher previously, now he has no relationship 
whatsoever with his teacher. Thera Pilotikatissa has instructed himself to 
differentiate right and wrong causes and to discern the true nature of things. 
He has now become an arahat, and so there is no further connection between him 
and his teacher." </P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the Jetavana

samanera named Sukha. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sukha was made a samanera at the 
age of seven years by Thera Sariputta. On the eighth day after being made a 
samanera he followed Thera Sariputta on his alms-round. While doing the round 
they came across some farmers irrigating their fields, some fletchers 
straightening their arrows and some carpenters making things like cart-wheels, 
etc. Seeing these, he asked Thera Sariputta whether these inanimate things could 
be guided to where one wished or be made into things one wished to make, and the 
thera answered him in the affirmative. The young samanera then pondered that if 
that were so, there could be no reason why a person could not tame his mind and 
practise Tranquillity and Insight Meditation. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, he asked permission from the 
thera to return to the monastery. There, he shut himself up in his room and 
practised meditation in solitude, Sakka and the devas also helped him in his 
practice by keeping the monastery very quiet. That same day, the eighth day 
after his becoming a samanera, Sukha attained arahatship. In connection with 
this, the Buddha said to the congregation of bhikkhus, <I><FONT 
color=#800040>"When a person earnestly practises the Dhamma, even Sakka and the 
devas give protection and help. I myself have kept Sariputta at the entrance so 
that Sukha should not be disturbed. The samanera, having seen the farmers 
irrigating their fields, the fletchers straightening their arrows and the 
carpenters making cart-wheels and other things, trains his mind and practises 
the Dhamma. Thus, he has now become an arahat." </FONT></I></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the Jetavana

companions of Visakha.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five hundred men from Savatthi, 
wishing to make their wives to be generous, kind-hearted and virtuous like 
Visakha, sent them to Visakha to be her constant companions. During a 
bacchanalian festival which lasted for seven days, the wives of those men took 
all the drinks left by their husbands and got drunk in the absence of Visakha. 
For this misbehaviour they were beaten by their husbands. On another occasion, 
saying that they wished to listen to the Buddha's discourse, they asked Visakha 
to take them to the Buddha and secretly took small bottles of liquor hidden in 
their clothes. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On arrival at the monastery, 
they drank all the liquor they had brought and threw away the bottles. Visakha 
requested the Buddha to teach them the Dhamma. By that time, the women were 
getting intoxicated and felt like singing and dancing. Mara, taking this 
opportunity made them bold and shameless, and soon they were boisterously 
singing, dancing, clapping and jumping about in the monastery. The Buddha saw 
the hand of Mara in the shameless behaviour of these women and said to 
himself,<I><FONT color=#800040> "Mara must not be given the 
opportunity."</FONT></I> So, the Buddha sent forth dark-blue rays from his body 
and the whole room was darkened; the women were frightened and began to get 
sober. Then, the Buddha vanished from his seat and stood on top of Mount Meru, 
and from there he sent forth white rays and the sky was lit up as if by a 
thousand moons. After thus manifesting his powers, the Buddha said to those five 
hundred women, <I><FONT color=#800040>"You ladies should not have come to my 
monastery in this unmindful state. Because you have been negligent Mara has had 
the opportunity to make you behave shamelessly, laughing and singing loudly, in

you".</FONT></I></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (147) of this book, with reference to Sirima 
the courtesan.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once, there lived in Rajagaha, a 
very beautiful courtesan by the name of Sirima. Every day Sirima offered 
alms-food to eight bhikkhus. One of these bhikkhus happened to mention to other 
bhikkhus how beautiful Sirima was and also that she offered very delicious food 
to the bhikkhus every day. On hearing this, a young bhikkhu fell in love with 
Sirima even without seeing her. The next day, the young bhikkhu went with the 
other bhikkhus to the house of Sirima. Sirima was not well on that day, but 
since she wanted to pay obeisance to the bhikkhus, she was carried to their 
presence. The young bhikkhu, seeing Sirima, thought to himself,<FONT 
color=#ff8040> "Even though she is sick, she is very beautiful !"</FONT> And he 
felt a strong desire for her.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That very night, Sirima died. 
King Bimbisara went to the Buddha and reported to him that Sirima, the sister of 
Jivaka, had died. The Buddha told King Bimbisara to take the dead body to the 
cemetery and keep it there for three days without burying it, but to have it 
protected from crows and vultures. The king did as he was told. On the fourth 
day, the dead body of the beautiful Sirima was no longer beautiful or desirable; 
it got bloated and maggots came out from the nine orifices. On that day, the 
Buddha took his bhikkhus to the cemetery to observe the body of Sirima. The king 
also came with his men. The young bhikkhu, who was so desperately in love with 
Sirima, did not know that Sirima had died. When he learnt that the Buddha and 
the bhikkhus were going to see Sirima, he joined them. At the cemetery, the 
corpse of Sirima was surrounded by the bhikkhus headed by the Buddha, and also 
by the king and his men. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha then asked the king to 
get a town crier announce that Sirima would be available on payment of one 
thousand in cash per night. But no body would take her for one thousand, or for 
five hundred, or for two hundred and fifty, or even if she were to be given free 
of charge. Then the Buddha said to the audience, <I><FONT 
color=#800040>"Bhikkhus! Look at Sirima. When she was living, there were many 
who were willing to give one thousand to spend one night with her; but now none 
would take her even if given without any payment. The body of a person is 
subject to deterioration and decay."</FONT></I></P>

inconsiderate bhikkhu accepted all her alms-food; so she had to go without food 
for that day. The same thing happened on the next two days. Thus Then Uttara was 
without food for three successive days and she was feeling weak. On the fourth 
day, while she was on her alms-round, she met the Buddha on the road where it 
was narrow. Respectfully, she paid obeisance to the Buddha and stepped back, 
While doing so, she accidentally stepped on her own robe and fell on the ground,

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White residing at the Jetavana

bhikkhus who over-estimated themselves.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five hundred bhikkhus, after 
taking a subject of meditation from the Buddha, went into the woods. There, they 
practised meditation ardently and diligently and soon attained deep mental 
absorption (jhana) and they thought that they were free from sensual desires 
and, therefore, had attained arahatship. Actually, they were only 
over-estimating themselves. Then, they went to the Buddha, with the intention of 
informing the Buddha about what they thought was their attainment of 
arahatship.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they arrived at the outer

them go to the cemetery first and come to see me only afterwards."</FONT></I> 
The Venerable Ananda then delivered the message of the Buddha to those bhikkhus, 
and they reflected, <FONT color=#ff8040>"The Enlightened One knows everything; 
he must have some reason in making us go to the cemetery first." </FONT>So they 
went to the cemetery.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, when they saw the putrid 
corpses they could look at them as just skeletons, and bones, but when they saw 
some fresh dead bodies they realized, with horror, that they still had some 
sensual desires awakening in them. The Buddha saw them from his perfumed chamber 
and sent forth the radiance; then he appeared to them and said,<I><FONT

<P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (150) of this book, with reference to 
Janapadakalyani.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Princess Janapadakalyani was the 
daughter of Gotami, the step-mother of Gotama the Buddha; because she was very 
beautiful she was also known as Rupananda. She was married to Nanda, a cousin of 
the Buddha. One day she pondered,<FONT color=#0000ff> "My elder brother who 
could have become a Universal Monarch has renounced the world to become a 
bhikkhu; he is now a Buddha. Rahula, the son of my elder brother, and my own 
husband Prince Nanda have also become bhikkhus. My mother Gotami has also become 
a bhikkhuni, and I am all alone here!" </FONT>So saying, she went to the 
monastery of some bhikkhunis and became a bhikkhuni herself. Thus, she had 
become a bhikkhuni not out of faith but only in imitation of others and because 
she felt lonely.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rupananda had heard from others 
that the Buddha often taught about the impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and 
insubstantiality of the khandhas. So she thought he would talk deprecatingly 
about her good looks if he should see her; and thus thinking, she kept away from 
the Buddha. But other bhikkhunis coming back from the monastery, kept talking in 
praise of the Buddha; so, one day, she decided to accompany other bhikkhunis to 
the monastery.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha saw her and 
reflected, <I><FONT color=#800040>"A thorn can only be taken out with a thorn; 
Rupananda being very attached to her body and being very proud of her beauty, I 
must take the pride and attachment out of her through beauty." </FONT></I>So, 
with his supernormal power, he caused an image of a very beautiful lady of about 
sixteen years of age to be seated near him, fanning him. This young girl was 
visible only to Rupananda and the Buddha. When Rupananda saw the girl, she 
realized that compared to that girl, she herself was just like an old, ugly crow 
compared to a beautiful white swan. Rupananda had a good lock at the girl and 
she felt that she liked her very much. Then, she looked again and was surprised 
to find that the girl had grown to the age of about twenty. Again and again, she 
looked at the figure beside the Buddha and every time she noticed that the girl 
had grown older and older. Thus, the girl turned into a grown-up lady, then into 
a middle-aged lady, an old lady, a decrepit and a very old lady successively. 
Rupananda also noticed that with the arising of a new image, the old image 
disappeared, and she came to realize that there was a continuous process of 
change and decay in the body. With the coming of this realization, her 
attachment to the body diminished. Meanwhile, the figure near the Buddha had 
turned into an old, decrepit lady, who could no longer control her bodily 
functions, and was rolling in her own excreta. Finally, she died, her body got 
bloated, pus and maggots came out of the nine openings and crows and vultures 
were trying to snatch at the dead body.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having seen all these, Rupananda 
pondered, <FONT color=#0000ff>"This young girl has grown old and decrepit and 
died in this very place under my own eyes. In the same way, my body will also 
grow old and wear out; it will be subject to disease and I will also 
die."</FONT> Thus, she came to perceive the true nature of the khandhas. At this 
point, the Buddha talked about the impermanence, the unsatisfactoriness and the 
insubstantiality of the khandhas, and Rupananda attained Sotapatti Fruition.</P>

name=mallika> Mallika</A></FONT></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (151) of this book, with reference to 
Mallika, queen of King Pasenadi of Kosala.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, Mallika went into the 
bathroom to wash her face, hands and feet. Her pet dog also came in; as she was 
bending to wash her feet, the dog tried to have sex with her, and the queen 
appeared to be amused and somewhat pleased. The king saw this strange incident 
through the window from his bedroom. When the queen came in, he said angrily to 
the queen,<FONT color=#0000ff> "Oh, you wicked woman! What were you doing with 
that dog in the bathroom? Do not deny what I saw with my own eyes."</FONT> The 
queen replied that she was only washing her face, her hands and her feet, and so 
was doing nothing wrong. Then she continued, <FONT color=#0000ff><I>"But, that 
room is very strange. If anyone went into that room, to one looking from this 
window there would appear to be two. If you do not believe me, O King, please go 
into that room and I will look through this window."</I></FONT></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the king went into the 
bathroom. When he came out, Mallika asked the king why he misbehaved with a 
she-goat in that room. The king denied it, but the queen insisted that she saw 
them with her own eyes. The king was puzzled, but being dim-witted, he accepted 
the queen's explanation, and concluded that the bath room was, indeed, very 
strange.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From that time, the queen was 
full of remorse for having lied to the king and for having brazenly accused him 
of misbehaving with a she-goat. Thus, even when she was approaching death, she 
forgot to think about the great unrivalled charities she had shared with her 
husband and only remembered that she had been unfair to him. As a result of 
this, when she died she was reborn in niraya. After her burial, the king 
intended to ask the Buddha where she was reborn. The Buddha wished to spare his 
feelings, and also did not want him to lose faith in the Dhamma. So he willed 
that this question should not he put to him, and King Pasenadi forgot to ask the 
Buddha.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, after seven days in 
niraya, the queen was reborn in the <I>Tusita</I> deva world. On that day, the 
Buddha went to King Pasenadi's palace for alms-food; he indicated that he wished 
to rest in the coach-shed where the royal carriages were kept. After offering 
alms-food, the king asked the Buddha where queen Mallika was reborn and the 
Buddha replied, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Mallika has been reborn in the Tusita 
deva world." </FONT></I>Hearing this the king was very pleased, and said, <FONT

<P align=center><FONT color=#0000ff size=+2>XI (8) The Story Concerning the "<A 
name=words>Words</A> of Exultation of the Buddha"</FONT> </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These two verses are expressions 
of intense and sublime joy felt by the Buddha at the moment of attainment of 
Supreme Enlightenment (<I>Bodhi nana or Sabbannuta nana</I>). These verses were 
repeated at the Jetavana monastery at the request of the Venerable Ananda.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prince Siddhattha, of the family 
of Gotama, son of King Suddhodana and Queen Maya of the kingdom of the Sakyans, 
renounced the world at the age of twenty-nine and became an ascetic in search of 
the Dhamma (Truth). For six years, he wandered about the valley of the Ganges, 
approaching famous religious leaders, studying their doctrines and methods. He 
lived austerely and submitted himself strictly to rigorous ascetic discipline; 
but he found all these traditional practices to be unsound. He was determined to 
find the Truth in his own way, and by avoiding the two extremes of excessive 
sensual indulgence and self-mortification*, he found the Middle Pathwhich would 
lead to Perfect Peace, Nibbana. This Middle Path (<I>Majjhimapatipada</I>) is 
the Noble Path of Eight Constituents, viz., Right view, Right thought, Right 
speech, Right action, Right livelihood, Right effort, Right mindfulness and 
Right concentration.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, one evening, seated under a 
Bo tree on the bank of the Neranjara river, Prince Siddhattha Gotama attained 
Supreme Enlightenment (<I>Bodhi nana</I> or <I>Sabbannuta nana</I>) at the age 
of thirty-five. During the first watch of the night, the prince attained the 
power of recollection of past existences (<I>Pubbenivasanussati-nana</I>) and 
during the second watch he attained the divine power of sight (<I>Dibbacakkhu 
nana</I>). Then, during the third watch of the night he contemplated the 
Doctrine of Dependent Origination (<I>Paticcasamuppada</I>) in the order of 
arising (<I>anuloma</I>) as well as in the order of cessation (<I>patiloma</I>). 
At the crack of dawn, Prince Siddhattha Gotama by his own intellect and insight 
fully and completely comprehended the Four Noble Truths. The Four Noble Truths 
are: The Noble Truth of Dukkha (<I>Dukkha Ariya Sacca</I>), the Noble Truth of 
the Cause of Dukkha (<I>Dukkha Samudaya Ariya Sacca</I>), the Noble Truth of the 
Cessation of Dukkha (<I>Dukkha Nirodha Ariya Sacca</I>), and The Noble Truth of 
the Path Leading to the Cessation of Dukkha (<I>Dukkha Nirodha Gamini Patipada 
Ariya Sacca</I>). There also appeared in him, in all their purity. The knowledge 
of the nature of each Noble Truth (<I>Sacca nana</I>), knowledge of the 
performance required for each Noble Truth (<I>Kicca nana</I>), and the knowledge 
of the completion of the performance required for each Noble Truth (<I>Kata 
nana</I>); and thus, he attained the <I>Sabbannuta nana </I>(also called 
<I>Bodhi nana</I>) of a Buddha. From that time, he was known as Gotama the 
Buddha.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this connection, it should be 
noted that only when the Four Noble Truths, under their three aspects 
(therefore, the twelve modes), had become perfectly clear to him that the Buddha 
acknowledged in the world of Men, the world of Devas and that of Brahmas that he 
had attained the Supreme Enlightenment and therefore had become a Buddha.</P>
<P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment of the attainment of 
Buddhahood, the Buddha uttered the following two verses:</P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Migadaya 
wood, the Buddha uttered Verses (155) and (156) of this book, with reference to 
the son of Mahadhana, a rich man from Baranasi.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The son of Mahadhana did not 
study while he was young; when he came of age he married the daughter of a rich 
man, who, like him, also had no education. When the parents on both sides died, 
they inherited eighty crores from each side and so were very rich. But both of 
them were ignorant and knew only how to spend money and not how to keep it or to 
make it grow. They just ate and drank and had a good time, squandering their 
money. When they had spent all, they sold their fields and gardens and finally 
their house. Thus, they became very poor and helpless; and because they did not 
know how to earn a living they had to go begging. One day, the Buddha saw the 
rich man's son leaning against a wall of the monastery, taking the leftovers 
given him by the samaneras; seeing him, the Buddha smiled.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Venerable Ananda asked the 
Buddha why he smiled, and the Buddha replied, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Ananda, 
look at this son of a very rich man; he had lived a useless life, an aimless 
life of pleasure. If he had learnt to look after his riches in the first stage 
of his life he would have been a top-ranking rich man; or if he had become a 
bhikkhu, he could have been an arahat, and his wife could have been an anagami. 
If he had learnt to lock after his riches in the second stage of his life he 
would have been a second rank rich man, or if he had become a bhikkhu he could 
have been an anagami, and his wife could have been a sakadagami. If he had 
learnt to look after his riches in the third stage of his life he would have 
been a third rank rich man, or if he had become a bhikkhu he could have been a 
sakadagami, and his wife could have been a sotapanna. However, because he had 
done nothing in all the three stages of his life he had lost all his worldly 
riches, he had also lost all opportunities of attaining any of the Maggas and

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the Bhesakala 
wood, the Buddha uttered Verse (157) of this book, with reference to Prince 
Bodhi (Bodhirajakumara).</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, Prince Bodhi built a 
magnificent palace for himself. When the palace was finished he invited the 
Buddha for alms-food. For this special occasion, he had the building decorated 
and perfumed with four kinds of scents and incense. Also, a long length of cloth 
was spread on the floor, starting from the threshold to the interior of the 
room. Then, because he had no children, the prince made a solemn asseveration 
that if he were to have any children the Buddha should step on the cloth. When 
the Buddha came, Prince Bodhi respectfully requested the Buddha three times to 
enter the room. But the Buddha, instead of moving, only looked at Ananda. Ananda 
understood him and so asked Prince Bodhi to remove the cloth from the door-step. 
Then only, the Buddha entered the palace. The prince then offered delicious and 
choice food to the Buddha. After the meal, the prince asked the Buddha why he 
did not step on the cloth. The Buddha in turn asked the prince whether he had 
not spread the cloth making a solemn asseveration that if he were to be blessed 
with a child, the Buddha would step on it; and the prince replied in the 
affirmative. To him, the Buddha said that he and his wife were not going to have 
any children because of their past evil deeds. The Buddha then related their 
past story. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In one of their past existences, 
the prince and his wife were the sole survivors of a shipwreck. They were 
stranded on a deserted island, and there they lived by eating birds' eggs, 
fledglings and birds, without any feeling of remorse at any time. For that evil 
deed, they would not be blessed with any children. If they had felt even a 
slight remorse for their deed at any stage of their lives, they could have a 
child or two in this existence. Then turning to the prince, the Buddha 
said,<I><FONT color=#800040> "One who loves himself should guard himself in all 
stages of life, or at least, during one stage in his life." </FONT></I></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (158) of this book, with reference to 
Upananda, a thera of the Sakyan Clan.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upananda was a very eloquent 
preacher. He used to preach to others not to be greedy and to have only a few 
wants and would talk eloquently on the merits of contentment and frugality 
(<I>appicchata</I>) and austere practices (<I>dhutangas</I>). However, he did 
not practise what he taught and took for himself all the robes and other 
requisites that were given up by others.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one occasion, Upananda went to 
a village monastery just before the vassa. Some young bhikkhus, being impressed 
by his eloquence, asked him to spend the vassa in their monastery. He asked them 
how many robes each bhikkhu usually received as donation for the vassa in their 
monastery and they told him that they usually received one robe each. So he did 
not stop there, but he left his slippers in that monastery. At the next 
monastery, he learned that the bhikkhus usually received two robes each for the 
vassa; there he left his staff. At the next monastery, the bhikkhus received 
three robes each as donation for the vassa; there he left his water bottle. 
Finally, at the monastery where each bhikkhu received four robes, he decided to 
spend the vassa.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the vassa, he 
claimed his share of robes from the other monasteries where he had left his 
personal effects. Then he collected all his things in a cart and came back to 
his old monastery. On his way, he met two young bhikkhus who were having a 
dispute over the share of two robes and a valuable velvet blanket which they had 
between them. Since they could not come to an amicable settlement, they asked 
Upananda to arbitrate. Upananda gave one robe each to them and took the valuable 
velvet blanket for having acted as an arbitrator.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two young bhikkhus were not 
satisfied with the decision but they could do nothing about it. With a feeling 
of dissatisfaction and dejection, they went to the Buddha and reported the 
matter. To then the Buddha said, <I><FONT color=#800040>"One who teaches others

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Jetavana

Padhanikatissa.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thera Padhanikatissa, after 
taking a subject of meditation from the Buddha, left for the forest with five 
hundred other bhikkhus. There, he told the bhikkhus to be ever mindful and 
diligent in their meditation practice. After thus exhorting others he himself 
would lie down and go to sleep. The young bhikkhus did as they were told. They 
practised meditation during the first watch of the night and when they were 
about to go to bed, Padhanikatissa would get up and tell them to go back to 
their practice. When they returned after meditation practice during the second 
and third watches also he would say the same thing to them.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he was always acting in this 
way, the young bhikkhus never had peace of mind, and so they could not 
concentrate on meditation practice or even on recitation of the texts. One day, 
they decided to investigate if their teacher was truly zealous and vigilant as 
he posed himself to be. When they found out that their teacher Padhanikatissa 
only exhorted others but was himself sleeping most of the time, they 
remarked,<FONT color=#ff8040> "We are ruined, our teacher knows only how to 
scold us, but he himself is just wasting time, doing nothing."</FONT> By this 
time, as the bhikkhus were not getting enough rest, they were tired and worn 
out. As a result, none of the bhikkhu made any progress in their meditation 
practice.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the vassa, they 
returned to the Jetavana monastery and reported the matter to the Buddha. To

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (160) of this book, with reference to the 
mother of Kumarakassapa.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, a young married woman 
asked permission from her husband to become a bhikkhuni. Through ignorance, she 
went to join some bhikkhunis who were the pupils of Devadatta. This young woman 
was pregnant before she became a bhikkhuni, but she was not aware of the fact at 
that time. But in due course, the pregnancy became obvious and the other 
bhikkhunis took her to their teacher Devadatta. Devadatta ordered her to go back 
to the household life. She then said to the other bhikkhunis,<FONT 
color=#0000ff> "I have not intended to become a bhikkhuni under your teacher 
Devadatta; I have come here by mistake. Please take me to the Jetavana 
monastery, take me to the Buddha." </FONT>Thus she came to the Buddha. The 
Buddha knew that she was pregnant before she became a bhikkhuni and was 
therefore innocent; but he was not going to handle the case. The Buddha sent for 
King Pasenadi of Kosala, Anathapindika, the famous rich man, and Visakha, the 
famous donor of the Pubbarama monastery, and many other persons. He then told 
Thera Upali to settle the case in public.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visakha took the young girl 
behind a curtain; she examined her and reported to Thera Upali that the girl was 
already pregnant when she became a bhikkhuni. Thera Upali then declared to the 
audience that the girl was quite innocent and therefore had not soiled her 
morality (sila). In due course, a son was born to her. The boy was adopted by 
King Pasenadi and was named Kumarakassapa. When the boy was seven years old, on 
learning that his mother was a bhikkhuni, he also became a samanera under the 
tutelage of the Buddha. When he came of age he was admitted to the Order; as a 
bhikkhu, he took a subject of meditation from the Buddha and went to the forest. 
There, he practised meditation ardently and diligently and within a short time 
attained arahatship. However, he continued to live in the forest for twelve more 
years. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus his mother had not seen him 
for twelve years and she longed to see her son very much. One day, seeing him, 
the mother bhikkhuni ran after her son weeping and calling out his name. Seeing 
his mother, Kumarakassapa thought that if he were to speak pleasantly to his 
mother she would still be attached to him and her future would be ruined. So for 
the sake of her future (realization of Nibbana) he was deliberately stern and 
spoke harshly to her:<FONT color=#ff8040> "How is it, that you, a member of the 
Order, could not even cut off this affection for a son?" </FONT>The mother 
thought that her son was very cruel to her, and she asked him what he meant. 
Kumarakassapa repeated what he had said before. On hearing his answer, the 
mother of Kumarakassapa reflected: <FONT color=#0000ff>"O yes, for twelve years 
I have shed tears for this son of mine. Yet, he has spoken harshly to me. What 
is the use of my affection for him ?"</FONT> Then, the futility of her 
attachment to her son dawned upon her, and then and there, she decided to cut 
off her attachment to her son. By cutting off her attachment entirely, the 
mother of Kumarakassapa attained arahatship on the same day.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, at the congregation of 
bhikkhus, some bhikkhus said to the Buddha,<FONT color=#804040> "Venerable Sir! 
If the mother of Kumarakassapa had listened to Devadatta, she as well as her son 
would not have become arahats. Surely, Devadatta had tried to do them a great 
wrong; but you, Venerable Sir, are a refuge to them!" </FONT>To them the Buddha 
said,<I><FONT color=#800040> "Bhikkhus! In trying to reach the deva world, or in 
trying to attain arahatship, you cannot depend on others, you must work hard on 
your own." </FONT></I></P>

went after the thieves. The thieves ran away in all directions. Some ran in the 
direction of the monastery. It was then nearing dawn, and Mahakala was washing 
his face at the pond close to the monastery. The thieves dropped their stolen 
property in from of Mahakala and ran on. When the owners arrived, they saw 
Mahakala with the stolen property. Taking him for one of the thieves they 
shouted at him, threatened him and beat him hard. Mahakala died on the spot. 
Early in the morning, when some young bhikkhus and samaneras from the monastery 
came to the pond to fetch water, they saw the dead body and recognize it.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On their return to the 
monastery, they reported what they had seen and said to the Buddha,<FONT 
color=#0000ff> "Venerable Sir! The lay disciple who was at this monastery 
listening to the religious discourses all through the night has met with a death 
which he does not deserve." </FONT>To them the Buddha replied, <I><FONT 
color=#800040>"Bhikkhus! If you judge from the good deeds he has done in this 
existence, he has indeed met with a death he does not deserve. But the fact is 
that he has only paid for the evil he had done in a past existence. In one of 
his previous existences, when he was a courtier in the palace of the king, he 
fell in love with another man's wife and had beaten her husband to death. Thus, 
evil deeds surely get one into trouble; they even lead one to the four 
apayas."</FONT></I></P>

<P align=center><FONT color=#0000ff size=+1>XII (6) The Story of <A 
name=devadatta01>Devadatta</A></FONT></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (162) of this book, with reference to 
Devadatta.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, some bhikkhus were 
talking amongst themselves when the Buddha came in and asked the subject of 
their talk. They answered that they were talking about Devadatta and then 
continued as follows:</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT color=#0000ff> "Venerable 
Sir! Devadatta is, indeed, a man without morality; he is also very avaricious. 
He has tried to gain fame and fortune by getting the confidence of Ajatasattu by 
unfair means. He has also tried to convince Ajatasattu that by getting rid of 
his father, he (Ajatasattu) would immediately become a powerful king. Having 
been thus misled by Devadatta, Ajatasattu killed his father, the noble king, 
Bimbisara. Devadatta has even attempted three times to kill you, our most 
Venerable Teacher. Devadatta is, indeed, very wicked and incorrigible 
!"</FONT></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the bhikkhus, 
the Buddha told them that Devadatta has tried to kill him not only now but also 
in his previous existences. The Buddha then narrated the story of a 
deer-stalker.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT color=#800040><I> "Once, 
while King Brahmadatta was reigning in Baranasi, the future Buddha was born as a 
deer, and Devadatta was then a deer-stalker. One day, the deer-stalker saw the 
footprints of a deer under a tree. So, he put up a bamboo platform in the tree 
and waited with the spear ready for the deer. The deer came but he came very 
cautiously. The deer-stalker saw him hesitating, and threw some fruits of the 
tree to coax him. Bat that put the deer on guard; he looked more carefully and 
saw the deer-stalker in the tree. He pretended not to see the deer stalker and 
turned away slowly. From some distance, he addressed the tree 
thus:</I></FONT></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I><FONT color=#800040> 'O tree! 
You always drop your fruits vertically, but today you have broken the law of 
nature and have dropped your fruits slantingly. Since you have violated the 
nature law of trees, I am now leaving you for another tree.'</FONT></I></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT color=#800040><I> "Seeing 
the deer turning away, the dear-stalker dropped his spear to the ground and 
said, 'Yes, you can now move on; for today, I have been wrong in my 
calculations.' The deer who was the Buddha-to-be replied, 'O hunter! You have 
truly miscalculated today, but your evil kamma will not take any mistake; it 
will certainly follow you.' Thus, Devadatta had attempted to kill me not only 
now but also in the past, yet he had never succeeded." 'Then the Buddha 
continued, 'Bhikkhus! Just as a creeper strangles the tree to which it clings, 
so also, those without morality, being overwhelmed by lust, are finally thrown 
into niraya."</I></FONT></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Buddha spoke in verse 
as follows:</P>

<P align=center><B>Verse 163</B></P>
<P align=center><FONT color=#0000ff size=+1>XII (7) The Story of<A name=schism> 
Schism </A>in the Order</FONT></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the Veluvana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (163) of this book, with reference to 
Devadatta, who committed the offence of causing a schism in the Order of the 
bhikkhus.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On one occasion, while the 
Buddha was giving a discourse in the Veluvana monastery, Devadatta came to him 
and suggested that since the Buddha was getting old, the duties of the Order 
should be entrusted to him (Devadatta); but the Buddha rejected his proposal and 
also rebuked him and called him a "spittle swallow or" (Khelasika). From that 
time, Devadatta felt very bitter towards the Buddha. He even tried to kill the 
Buddha three times, but all his attempts failed. Later, Devadatta tried another 
tactic. This time, he came to the Buddha and proposed five rules of discipline 
for the bhikkhus to observe throughout their lives. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He proposed:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P align=justify><I>(i) that the bhikkhus should live in the forest; </I></P>
  <P align=justify><I>(ii) that they should live only on food received on 
  alms-rounds; </I></P>
  <P align=justify><I>(iii) that they should wear robes made only from pieces of 
  cloth collected from rubbish heaps; </I></P>
  <P align=justify><I>(iv) that they should reside under trees; and </I></P>
  <P align=justify><I>(v) that they should not take fish or 
meat.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha did not have any 
objections to these rules and made no objections to those who were willing to 
observe them, but for various valid considerations, he was not prepared to 
impose these rules of discipline on the bhikkhus in general.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Devadatta claimed that the rules 
proposed by him were much better than the existing rules of discipline, and some 
new bhikkhus agreed with him. One day, the Buddha asked Devadatta if it was true 
that he was trying to create a schism in the Order, and he admitted that it was 
so. The Buddha warned him that it was a very serious offence, but Devadatta paid 
no heed to his warning. After this, as he met Thera Ananda on his alms-round in 
Rajagaha, Devadatta said to Thera Ananda,<FONT color=#ff0080> "Ananda, from 
today I will observe the sabbath (Uposatha), and perform the duties of the Order 
separately, independent of the Buddha and his Order of bhikkhus." </FONT>On his 
return from the alms-round, Thera Ananda reported to the Buddha what Devadatta 
had said.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On hearing this, the Buddha 
reflected, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Devadatta is committing a very serious 
offence; it will send him to Avici Niraya. For a virtuous person, it is easy to 
do good deeds and difficult to do evil; but for an evil one, it is easy to do 
evil and difficult to do good deeds. Indeed, in life it is easy to do something 
which is not beneficial, but it is very difficult to do something which is good 
and beneficial." </FONT></I></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Buddha spoke in verse 
as follows:</P>

  </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, on the Uposatha day, 
Devadatta, followed by five hundred Vajjian bhikkhus, broke off from the Order, 
and went to Gayasisa. However, when the two Chief Disciples, Sariputta and 
Moggallana, went to see the bhikkhus who had followed Devadatta and talked to 
them they realized their mistakes and most of them returned with the two Chief 
Disciples to the Buddha. </P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (164) of this book, with reference to Thera 
Kala.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once in Savatthi, an elderly 
woman was looking after a Thera named Kala, like her own son. One day hearing 
from her neighbours about the virtues of the Buddha, she wished very much to go 
to the Jetavana monastery and listen to the discourses given by the Buddha. So 
she told Thera Kala about her wishes; but the thera advised her against it. 
Three times she spoke to him about her wishes but he always dissuaded her. But 
one day, in spite of his dissuasion, the lady decided to go. After asking her 
daughter to look to the needs of Thera Kala she left the house. When Thera Kala 
came on his usual round of alms-food, he learned that the lady of the house had 
left for the Jetavana monastery. Then he reflected, <FONT color=#ba5901>"It is 
quite possible that the lady of this house is losing her faith in me."</FONT> 
So, he made haste and quickly followed her to the monastery. There, he found her 
listening to the discourse being given by the Buddha. He approached the Buddha 
respectfully, and said,<FONT color=#ba5901> "Venerable Sir! This woman is very 
dull; she will not be able to understand the sublime Dhamma; please teach her 
only about charity (dana) and morality (sila)."</FONT></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha knew very well that 
Thera Kala was talking out of spite and with an ulterior motive. So he said to 
Thera Kala, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Bhikkhu! Because you are foolish and because 
of your wrong view, you scorn my Teaching. You yourself are your own ruin; in 
fact, you are only trying to destroy yourself."</FONT></I></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Buddha spoke in verse as

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (165) of this book, with reference to 
Culakala, a lay disciple. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cukakala, a lay disciple, 
observed the Uposatha precepts on a certain sabbath day and spent the night at 
the Jetavana monastery, listening to religious discourses all through the night. 
Early in the morning, as he was washing his face at the pond near the monastery, 
some thieves dropped a bundle near him. The owners seeing him with the stolen 
property took him for a thief and beat him hard. Fortunately some slave girls 
who had come to fetch water testified that they knew him and that he was not the 
thief. So Culakala was let off.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Buddha was told about 
it, he said to Culakala, <I><FONT color=#800040>"You have been let off not only 
because the slave girls said that you were not the thief but also because you 
did not steal and was therefore innocent. Those who do evil go to niraya, but 
those who do good are reborn in the deva worlds or else realize 
Nibbana."</FONT></I></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Buddha declared that he 
would realize parinibbana in four months' time, many puthujjana bhikkhus* were 
apprehensive and did not know what to do; so they kept close to the Buddha. 
Attadattha, however, did not go to the Buddha and, having resolved to attain 
arahatship during the lifetime of the Buddha, was striving hard in the 
meditation practice. Other bhikkhus, not understanding him, took him to the 
Buddha and said, <FONT color=#804000>"Venerable Sir, this bhikkhu does not seem 
to love and revere you as we do; he only keeps to himself."</FONT> The thera 
then explained to them that he was striving hard to attain arahatship before the 
Buddha realized parinibbana and that was the only reason why he had not come to 
the Buddha.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha then said to the 
bhikkhus, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Bhikkhus, those who love and revere me should 
act like Attadattha. You are not paying me homage by just offering flowers, 
perfumes and incense and by coming to see me; you pay me homage only by

Dhamma."</FONT></I></P>
