<H2 align=center><FONT color=#0000ff><B>The Story of Kapila the Fish 
</B></FONT></H2><BR>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verses (334), (335), (336) and (337) of this book, 
with reference to a fish with a lovely, golden colour and a stinking mouth. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the time of Kassapa 
Buddha, there was a bhikkhu named Kapila, who was very learned in the 
<I>Pitakas</I>. Because of his great learning he gained much fame and fortune; 
he also became very conceited and was full of contempt for other bhikkhus. When 
other bhikkhus pointed out to him, what was proper or not proper he invariably 
retorted, <FONT color=#0000ff>"How much do you know?"</FONT> implying that he 
knew much more than those bhikkhus. In course of time, all good bhikkhus shunned 
him and only the bad ones gathered round him. On one sabbath day, while the 
bhikkhus were reciting the Fundamental Precepts for the bhikkhus (i.e., the 
<I>Patimokkha</I>) Kapila said, <FONT color=#0000ff>"There is no such thing as 
<I>Sutta</I>, <I>Abhidhamma</I>, or <I>Vinaya</I>. It makes no difference 
whether you have a chance to listen to the<I> Patimokkha</I> or not, "</FONT> 
etc., and left the congregation of the bhikkhus. Thus, Kapila was a hindrance to 
the development and growth of the Teaching (<I>Sasana</I>).</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this evil deed, Kapila had 
to suffer in <I>niraya</I> between the time of Kassapa Buddha and Gotama Buddha. 
Later, he was reborn as a fish in the Aciravati River. That fish, as mentioned 
above, had a very beautiful golden body, but his mouth had a very horrid, 
offensive smell. One day, that fish was caught by some fishermen, and because it 
was so beautiful, they took it in a boat to the king. The king, in his turn took 
the fish to the Buddha. When the fish opened its mouth, the horrid and offensive 
smell spread all around. The king then asked the Buddha why such a beautiful 
fish should have such a horrid and offensive smell. To the king and the 
audience, the Buddha explained, <I><FONT color=#800040>"O king! During the time 
of Kassapa Buddha there was a very learned bhikkhu who taught the Dhamma to 
others. Because of that good deed, when he was reborn in another existence, even 
as a fish, he was endowed with a golden body. But that bhikkhu was very greedy, 
proud and very contemptuous of others; he also disregarded the Disciplines and 
abused other bhikkhus. For these evil deeds, he was reborn in niraya, and now, 
he has become a beautiful fish with a mouth that stinks."</FONT></I> The Buddha 
then turned to the fish and asked whether it knew where it would be going in its 
next existence. The fish answered that it would have to go again to niraya and 
it was filled with great despair. As predicted, on its death the fish was reborn 
in niraya, to undergo another term of continuous torment.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All those present hearing about 
the fish got alarmed. To then, the Buddha gave a discourse on the benefits of 
combining learning with practice.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Buddha spoke in verse 
as follows:</P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On one occasion, while the 
Buddha was on an alms-round at Rajagaha, he saw a young dirty sow and smiled. 
When asked by the Venerable Ananda, the Buddha replied, <I><FONT

Buddha. As she was then staying near a refectory in a monastery she used to hear 
the recitation of the sacred text and the discourses on the Dhamma. When she 
died she was reborn as a princess. On one occasion, while going to the latrine, 
the princess noticed the maggots and she became mindful of the loathsomeness of 
the body, etc. When she died she was reborn in the Brahma realm as a puthujjana 
brahma but later due to some evil kamma, she was reborn as a sow. Ananda! Look,

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the Veluvana

bhikkhu who was a pupil of the Venerable Mahakassapa. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a pupil of the Venerable 
Mahakassapa, this bhikkhu had achieved the four mental absorptions (jhanas). But 
one day, as he went for alms-food to his uncle's house, he saw a woman and felt 
a great desire to have her. Then he left the Order of the bhikkhus. As a layman, 
he was a failure as he did not work hard. So, his uncle drove him out of the 
house, and subsequently he became mixed up with some thieves. All of them were 
caught by the authorities and were taken to the cemetery to be executed. The 
Venerable Mahakassapa saw his pupil as he was being led out and said to 
him,<FONT color=#800080> "My pupil, keep your mind steadfastly on a subject of 
meditation."</FONT> As instructed, he concentrated and let himself be 
established in deep mental absorption. At the cemetery, while the executioners 
were making preparations to kill him, the ex-bhikkhu was very much composed and 
showed no signs of fear or anxiety. The executioners and the onlookers were 
awe-struck and very much impressed by the man's courage and composure and they 
reported about him to the king and also to the Buddha. The king gave orders to 
release the man. The Buddha on hearing about the matter sent his radiance and 
appeared to the thief as if in person.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Buddha spoke to him in

      man who having become free rushes back into that very bondage.

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the discourse, the 
thief who was steadfastly keeping his mind on the arising and perishing of the 
aggregates discerned the impermanent, unsatisfactory and non-self nature of all 
conditioned things and soon attained Sotapatti Fruition. Later, he went to the 
Buddha at the Jetavana monastery where he was again admitted to the Order by the 
Buddha and he instantly attained arahatship. </P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verses (345) and (346) of this book, with 
reference to some thieves who were kept in chains.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, thirty bhikkhus came 
into Savatthi for alms-food. While they were on their alms-round, they saw some 
prisoners being brought out with their hands and legs in chains. Back at the 
monastery, after relating what they had seen in the morning, they asked the 
Buddha whether there were any other bonds stronger than these. To them the 
Buddha answered, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Bhikkhus! These bonds are nothing 
compared to those of craving for food and clothing, for riches and for family. 
Craving is a thousand times, a hundred thousand times stronger than those 
chains, hand-cuffs and cages. That is the reason why the wise cut off craving 
and renounce the world and enter the Order of the bhikkhus."</FONT></I></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the Veluvana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (347) of this book, with reference to Queen 
Khema.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Queen Khema was the chief queen 
of King Bimbisara. She was very beautiful and also very proud.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The king wanted her to go to the 
Veluvana monastery and pay homage to the Buddha. But she had heard that the 
Buddha always talked disparagingly about beauty and she therefore tried to avoid 
seeing the Buddha.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The king understood her attitude 
towards the Buddha; he also know how proud she was of her beauty. So the king 
ordered his minstrels to sing in praise of the Veluvana monastery, about its 
pleasant and peaceful atmosphere, etc. Hearing them, Queen Khema became 
interested and decided to set out for the Veluvana monastery.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Queen Khema arrived at the 
monastery, the Buddha was expounding the Dhamma to an audience. By his 
supernormal power, the Buddha made a very beautiful young lady appear, sitting 
not far from him, and fanning him. When Queen Khema came to the audience hall, 
she alone saw the beautiful young lady. Comparing the exquisite beauty of the 
young lady to that of her own, Khema realised that her beauty was much inferior 
to that of the young lady. As she looked again intently at the young lady her 
beauty began to fade gradually. In the end, she saw before her eyes an old 
decrepit being, which again changed into a corpse, her stinking body being 
attacked by maggots. At that instant, Queen Khema realized the impermanence and 
worthlessness of beauty.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha knowing the state of 
her mind remarked, <I><FONT color=#800040>"O Khema! Look carefully at this 
decaying body which is built around a skeleton of bones and is subject to 
disease and decay. Look carefully at the body which is thought of so highly by 
the foolish. Look at the worthlessness of the beauty of this young girl."

Story of Uggasena</FONT> </B></FONT></H2>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (348) of this book, with reference to 
Uggasena, a rich man's son who fell in love with a dancer.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, a wandering theatrical 
troupe consisting of five hundred dancers and some acrobats came to Rajagaha and 
performed on the grounds of the palace of King Bimbisara for seven days. There, 
a young dancer who was the daughter of an acrobat sang and danced on top of a 
long bamboo pole. Uggasena, the young son of a rich man, fell desperately in 
love with this dancer and his parents could not stop him from marrying her. He 
married the young dancer and followed the troupe. As he was not a dancer nor an 
acrobat, he was not of much use to the party. So, as the party moved from place 
to place, he had to help carry boxes, to drive the carts, etc.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In course of time, a son was 
born to Uggasena and his wife, the dancer. To this child, the dancer would often 
sing a song which ran thus: <FONT color=#0000ff>"O you, son of the man who keeps 
watch over the carts; the man who carries boxes and bundles! O , you, son of the 
ignorant one who can do nothing!"</FONT> Uggasena heard the song; he knew that 
his wife was referring to him and he was very much hurt and depressed. So he 
went to his father-in-law, the acrobat, and requested him to teach him 
acrobatics. After a year's training, Uggasena became a skilful acrobat.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Uggasena went back to 
Rajagaha, and it was proclaimed that Uggasena would publicly demonstrate his 
skill in seven days' time. On the seventh day, a long pole was put up and 
Uggasena stood on top of it. At a signal given from below he somersaulted seven 
times on the pole. At about this time, the Buddha saw Uggasena in his vision and 
knew that time was ripe for Uggasena to attain arahatship. So, he entered 
Rajagaha and willed that the audience should turn their attention to him instead 
of applauding Uggasena for his acrobatic feats. When Uggasena saw that he was 
being neglected and ignored, he just sat on top of the pole, feeling very 
discontented and depressed. The Buddha then addressed Uggasena,<I><FONT

khandha aggregates and strive to gain liberation from the round of rebirths."

existences.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once a young bhikkhu took his 
alms-food in one of the shelters specially built for bhikkhus in town. After his 
meal he felt like drinking water. So he went to a house and asked for some 
drinking water, and a young woman came out to give him some water. As soon as 
this young woman saw the young bhikkhu she fell in love with him. Wishing to 
entice him, she invited the young bhikkhu to come to her house whenever he felt 
thirsty. After some time, she invited him to her house for alms-food. On that 
day, she told him that they had everything they could wish for in the house, but 
that there was no male to look after their affairs, etc. Hearing those words, 
the young bhikkhu took the hint and he soon found himself to be more and more 
attached to the young, attractive woman. He became very much dissatisfied with 
his life as a bhikkhu and was getting thin. Other bhikkhus reported about him to 
the Buddha.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha called the young 
bhikkhu to his presence and said to him,<I><FONT color=#800040> "My son, listen 
to me. This young woman will be your undoing just as she had been to you in a 
previous existence. In one of your previous existences you were a very skilful 
archer and she was your wife. On one occasion, while the two of you were 
travelling, you came upon a gang of highwaymen. She fell in love with the gang 
leader. So, while you and the gang leader were engaged in fighting and you 
called out to her to give you the sword, she gave the sword to the robber who 
promptly killed you. Thus, she was the cause of your death. Now, too, she will

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On one occasion, at a meeting of 
the devas in the Tavatimsa realm, four questions were raised, but the devas 
failed to get the correct answers. Eventually, Sakka took these devas to the 
Buddha at the Jetavana monastery. After explaining their difficulty, Sakka 
presented the following four questions:</P>
<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Among

<P align=justify><FONT color=#0000ff>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Among

the eradication of craving said to be the most excellent? </FONT></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To these questions, the Buddha 
replied, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Oh Sakka, the Dhamma is the noblest of all

Craving leads to the attainment of arahatship and is, therefore, the greatest of

Rich Man</FONT> </B></H2>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (355) of this book, with reference to a 
childless rich man.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On one occasion, King Pasenadi 
of Kosala came to pay homage to the Buddha. He explained to the Buddha that he 
was late because earlier that day a rich man had died in Savatthi without 
leaving any heirs, and so he had to confiscate all that man's property. Then, he 
proceeded to relate about the man, who, although very rich, was very stingy. 
While he lived, he did not give away anything in charity. He was reluctant to 
spend his money even on himself, and therefore, ate very sparingly and wore 
cheap, coarse clothes only. On hearing this the Buddha told the king and the 
audience about the man in a past existence. In that existence also he was a rich 
man.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, when a paccekabuddha 
came and stood for alms at his house, he told his wife to offer some thing to 
the paccekabuddha. His wife thought it was very rarely that her husband gave her 
permission to give anything to anybody. So, she filled up the alms-bowl with 
some choice food. The rich man again met the paccekabuddha on his way home and 
he had a look at the alms-bowl. Seeing that his wife had offered a substantial 
amount of good food, he thought, <I><FONT color=#0000ff>"Oh, this bhikkhu would 
only have a good sleep after a good meal. It would have been better if my 
servants were given such good food; at least, they would have given me better 
service."</FONT></I> In other words, he regretted that he had asked his wife to 
offer food to the paccekabuddha. This same man had a brother who also was a rich 
man. His brother had an only son. Coveting his brother's wealth, he had killed 
his young nephew and had thus wrongfully inherited his brother's wealth on the 
latter's death.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the man had offered 
alms-food to the paccekabuddha he became a rich man in his present life; because 
he regretted having offered food to the paccekabuddha he had no wish to spend 
anything even on himself. Because he had killed his own nephew for the sake of 
his brother's wealth he had to suffer in niraya for seven existences. His bad 
kamma having come to an end he was born into the human world but here also he 
had not gained any good kamma. The king then remarked, <FONT 
color=#0000ff>"Venerable Sir! Even though he had lived here in the lifetime of 
the Buddha himself, he had not made any offering of anything to the Buddha or to 
his disciples. Indeed, he had missed a very good opportunity; he had been very 
foolish." </FONT></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While on a visit to the

with reference to a deva named Ankura.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha visited the Tavatimsa 
deva realm to expound the Abhidhamma to Deva Santusita, who had been his mother. 
During that time, there was a deva named Indaka in Tavatimsa. Indaka, in his 
last existence as a man, had offered a little alms-food to Thera Anuruddha. As 
this good deed was made to a thera within the period of the Buddha's Teaching he 
was amply rewarded for it. Thus, on his death he was reborn in the Tavatimsa 
realm and was lavishly bestowed with the luxuries of the deva world. At that 
time, there was also another deva by the name of Ankura in Tavatimsa who had 
given much in charity; in fact, many times more than what Indaka had given. But 
his charity was made outside the period of the Teaching of any of the Buddhas. 
So, in spite of his lavish and grand charities, he was enjoying the benefits of 
the life of a deva on a much smaller scale than Indaka, who had offered very 
little. As the Buddha was then at Tavatimsa, Ankura asked him the reason for the 
discrepancy in gaining the benefits. To him the Buddha answered,<I><FONT 
color=#800040> "O deva! When giving charities and donations you should choose 
whom you give, for acts of charities are just like seeds. Seeds put into fertile 
soil will grow into strong, vigorous plants or trees and will bear much fruit; 
but you had sown your seed in poor soil, so you reap poorly."</FONT></I></P>

embraced the teaching of Devadatta.</P>

      have ruined me."</FONT> Then, taking up his plate of rice, he approached 
      the Buddha and apologetically requested,<FONT color=#0000ff> "Venerable 
      Sir! Please accept this rice which I have partly consumed." </FONT>To him 
      the Buddha replied, <I><FONT color=#800040>"O brahmin! Any rice is 
      suitable for me, whether it is not yet consumed, or is partly consumed, or 
      even if it is the last remaining spoonful."</FONT></I> The brahmin was 
      very much surprised by the Buddha's reply; at the same time, it made him 
      happy because his offer of rice was accepted by the Buddha, The brahmin 
      next asked the Buddha by what standard a bhikkhu was judged and how a 
      bhikkhu was defined. The Buddha knew that both the brahmin and his wife 
      had already learned something about mind and body 
      (<I>nama</I>-<I>rupa</I>); so he answered, <I><FONT color=#800040>"O

      of a Great Many Bhikkhus </FONT></H2>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the 
      Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verses (368) to (376) of this book, 
      with reference to nine hundred bhikkhus.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once there was a very rich 
      lady in the town of Kuraraghara, about one hundred and twenty 
      <I>yojanas</I> from Savatthi. She had a son who had become a bhikkhu; his 
      name was Sona. On one occasion, Bhikkhu Sona passed through his home town. 
      On his return from the Jetavana monastery his mother met him and organized 
      a grand charity in his honour. Having heard that Bhikkhu Sona could 
      expound the Dhamma very well she also requested him to expound the Dhamma 
      to her and other people of the home town. Bhikkhu Sona complied with her 
      request. So a pavilion was built and a meeting was organized for Bhikkhu 
      Sona to give a discourse. There was a large gathering at the pavilion; the 
      mother of the bhikkhu also went to listen to the Dhamma expounded by her 
      son. She took all the members of her household with her leaving only a 
      maid to look after the house.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the lady was away, 
      some thieves broke into the house. Their leader, however, went io the 
      pavilion where the mistress of the house was, sat down near her and kept 
      an eye on her. His intention was to get rid of her should she return home 
      early on learning about the theft at her house. The maid seeing the 
      thieves breaking into the house went to report the matter to her mistress, 
      but the lady only said,<FONT color=#0000ff> "Let the thieves take all my 
      money, I don't care; but do not come and disturb we while I am listening 
      to the Dhamma. You'd better go back."</FONT> So the maid went home.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There the girl saw the 
      thieves breaking into the room where her mistress kept all her silverware. 
      Again she went to the pavilion where her mistress was and reported to her 
      that the thieves were taking away her silverware, but she was given the 
      same answer as before. So she had to go back to the house. There she saw 
      the thieves breaking into the room where her mistress kept her gold and 
      she reported the matter to her mistress. This time, her mistress shouted 
      at her, <FONT color=#0000ff>"O dear! Let the thieves take whatever they 
      wish to take; why do you have to come and worry me again when I am 
      listening to a discourse on the Dhamma? Why did you not go back when I 
      told you to? Don't you dare come near me again and say things about the 
      theft or the thieves."</FONT></P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The leader of the gang of 
      thieves who was close at hand heard everything the lady had said and he 
      was extremely surprised. Her words also kept him thinking, <FONT 
      color=#0000ff>"If we take away the property of this wise and noble person, 
      we will surely be punished; we might even be struck by lightning and our 
      heads broken into many pieces." </FONT>The leader got alarmed over this 
      possibility and he hurried back to the house of the lady and made his 
      followers return all the things they had taken. He then took all his 
      followers to where the mistress of the house was; she was still at the 
      pavilion, listening attentively to the Dhamma.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thera Sona finished his 
      exposition on the Dhamma with the crack of dawn and came down from the 
      dais from where he had expounded the Dhamma. The leader of the thieves 
      approached the rich, noble lady, paid respect to her and revealed his 
      identity to her. He also related to her how they had plundered her house 
      and also that they had returned all her property on hearing her words to 
      her maid, who reported the theft to her during the night. Then, the leader 
      and all the thieves asked the lady to forgive them for having wronged her. 
      Then, they asked Thera Sona to admit them to the Order of bhikkhus. After 
      the admission, each one of the nine hundred bhikkhus took a subject of 
      meditation from Thera Sona and went to the nearby forest to practise 
      meditation in seclusion.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From a distance of one 
      hundred and twenty yojanas, the Buddha saw those bhikkhus and sent forth 
      his radiance to them so that he seemed to be sitting in their midst. </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then noticing their 
      individual dispositions, the Buddha spoke in verse as follows: </P>

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five hundred bhikkhus from 
      Savatthi, after taking a subject of meditation from the Buddha, set out 
      for the forest to practise meditation. There, they noticed that the jasmin 
      flowers which bloomed in the early morning dropped off from the plants 
      onto the ground in the evening. Then the bhikkhus resolved that they would 
      strive hard to free themselves from all moral defilements even before the 
      flowers were shed from the plants. The Buddha, through his supernormal

      named Santakaya, who had been a lion in his past existence. It is said 
      that lions usually go out in search of food one day and then rest in a 
      cave for the next seven days without moving. Thera Santakaya, having been 
      a lion in his last existence, behaved very much like a lion. He moved 
      about very little; his moments were slow and steady; and he was usually 
      calm and composed. Other bhikkhus took his behaviour to be very queer and

      book, with reference to Thera Nangala.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nangala was a poor field 
      labourer in the service of a farmer. One day, a bhikkhu, seeing him 
      ploughing a field in his old clothes, asked him if he would like to become 
      a bhikkhu. When he replied in the affirmative, the bhikkhu took him along 
      to the monastery and made him a bhikkhu. After the admission to the Order, 
      as instructed by his teacher, he left his plough and his old clothes in a 
      tree not far away from the monastery. Because the poor man had left his 
      plough to join the Order, he was known as Thera Nangala 
      (nangala&nbsp;=&nbsp;plough). Due to better living conditions at the 
      monastery, Thera Nangala became healtheir and soon put on weight. However, 
      after some time, he grew tired of the life of a bhikkhu and often felt 
      like returning to home-life. Whenever this feeling arose in him, he would 
      go to the tree near the monastery, the tree where he had left his plough 
      and his old clothes. There he would reproach himself saying, <FONT 
      color=#0000ff>"O you shameless man! Do you still want to put on these old 
      rags and return to the hard, lowly life of a hired labourer ?" 
      </FONT>After this, his dissatisfaction with the life of a bhikkhu would 
      disappear and he would go back to the monastery. Thus, he went to the tree 
      at an interval of every three or four days, to remind himself of the 
      wretchedness of his old life.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When other bhikkhus asked

      attained arahatship and he stopped going to the tree. Other bhikkhus, 
      noticing this, asked him teasingly,<FONT color=#008080> "Why don't you go 
      to your teacher now?"</FONT> To those bhikkhus, he replied,<FONT 
      color=#0000ff> "I used to go to my teacher because I had need of him; but 
      now, I have no need to go to him."</FONT> The bhikkhus understood what he 
      meant by his answer and they went to the Buddha and reported, <FONT

      a bhikkhu, Vakkali always kept close to the Buddha; he did not care much

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha, knowing full 
      well the extent of Vakkali's grief and despondency, reflected that because 
      of his great sorrow and despondency Vakkali might miss the chance of 
      attaining the Maggas. Accordingly, he sent forth his radiance to Vakkali, 
      made him feel his presence and appeared as if in person to Vakkali. With 
      the Buddha near him, Vakkali soon forgot all his sorrow; he became 
      cheerful and very much heartened. </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To him the Buddha spoke in

<H2 align=center><A name=382></A><FONT color=#0000ff size=+1>The Story of 
Samanera Sumana</FONT></H2>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the Pubbarama 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (382) of this book, with reference to 
Samanera Sumana.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Samanera Sumana was a pupil of 
Thera Anuruddha. Although he was only seven years old he was an arahat, endowed 
with supernormal powers. Once, when his teacher Anuruddha was ill at a monastery 
in a forest of the Himalayas, he fetched water from the Anotatta lake which was 
five hundred yojanas away from the monastery. The journey was made not by land 
but by air through his supernormal power. Later, Thera Anuruddha took Samanera 
Sumana to the Buddha, who was then sojourning at Pubbarama, the monastery 
donated by Visakha.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There, other young bhikkhus and 
samaneras teased him by patting his head, or pulling his ears, nose and arms, 
and jokingly asked him if he was not feeling bored. The Buddha saw them and 
thought that he would make those young bhikkhus see the rare qualities of young 
Samanera Sumana. So it was made known by the Buddha that he wanted some samanera 
to get a jar of water from the Anotatta lake. The Venerable Ananda searched 
among the bhikkhus and samaneras of the Pubbarama monastery, but there was none 
who was able to undertake the job. Finally, the Venerable Ananda asked Samanera 
Sumana who readily agreed to fetch water from the Anotatta lake. He took a big 
golden jar front the monastery and soon brought the water from the Anotatta lake 
for the Buddha. As before, he went to the Anotatta lake and came back by air 
through his supernormal power. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the congregation of the 
bhikkhus in the evening, the bhikkhus told the Buddha about the wonderful trip 
made by Samanera Sumana. To them the Buddha said,<I><FONT color=#800040> 
"Bhikkhus, one who practises the Dhamma vigilantly and zealously is capable of 
attaining supernormal powers, even though he is young."</FONT></I> </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Buddha spoke in verse 
as follows:</P>
