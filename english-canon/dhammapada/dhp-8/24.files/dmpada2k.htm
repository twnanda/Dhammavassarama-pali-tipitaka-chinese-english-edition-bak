      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the 
      Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (290) of this book, with 
      reference to the power and glory of the Buddha as witnessed by many people 
      on his visit to Vesali. </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once, a famine broke out in 
      Vesali. It began with a serious drought. Because of drought, there was 
      almost a total failure of crops and many people died of starvation. This 
      was followed by an epidemic of diseases and as people could hardly cope 
      with the disposal of the corpses there was a lot of stench in the air. 
      This stench attracted the ogres. The people of Vesali were facing the 
      dangers of destruction by famine, disease and also by the ogres. In their 
      grief and sorrow they tried to look for a refuge. They thought of going 
      for help from various sources but finally, they decided to invite the 
      Buddha. So a mission headed by Mahali, the Licchavi prince, and the son of 
      the chief brahmin were sent to King Bimbisara to request the Buddha to pay 
      a visit to Vesali and help them in their distress. The Buddha knew that 
      this visit would be of much benefit to many people, so he consented to go 
      to Vesali.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, King Bimbisara 
      repaired the road between Rajagaha and the bank of the river Ganga. He 
      also made other preparations and set up special resting-places at an 
      interval of every yojana. When everything was ready, the Buddha set out 
      for Vesali with five hundred bhikkhus. King Bimbisara also accompanied the 
      Buddha. On the fifth day they came to the bank of the river Ganga and King 
      Bimbisara sent word to the Licchavi princes. On the other side of the 
      river, the Licchavi princes had repaired the road between the river and 
      Vesali and had set up resting places as had been done by King Bimbisara on 
      his side of the river. The Buddha went to Vesali with Licchavi princes but 
      King Bimbisara stayed behind. </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as the Buddha 
      reached the other bank of the river heavy rains fell in torrents, thus 
      cleansing up Vesali. The Buddha was put up in the rest-house which was 
      specially prepared for him in the central part of the city. Sakka, king of 
      the devas, came with his followers to pay obeisance to the Buddha, and the 
      ogres fled. That same evening the Buddha delivered the Ratana Sutta and 
      asked the Venerable Ananda to go round between the threefold walls of the 
      city with the Licchavi princes and recite it. The Venerable Ananda did as 
      he was told. As the protective verses (parittas) were being recited, many 
      of those who were sick recovered and followed the Venerable Ananda to the 
      presence of the Buddha. The Buddha delivered the same Sutta and repeated 
      it for seven days. At the end of the seven days, everything was back to 
      normal in Vesali. The Licchavi princes and the people of Vesali were very 
      much relieved and were overjoyed. They were also very grateful to the 
      Buddha. They paid obeisance to the Buddha and made offerings to him on a 
      grand and lavish scale. They also accompanied the Buddha on his return 
      journey until they came to the bank of the Ganga at the end of three 
      days.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On arrival at the river 
      bank, King Bimbisara was waiting for the Buddha; so also were the devas 
      and the brahmas and the king of the Nagas with their respective entourage. 
      All of them paid obeisance and made offerings to the Buddha. The devas and 
      the brahmas paid homage with umbrellas, flowers, etc., and sang in praise 
      of the Buddha. The Nagas had come with barges made of gold, silver and 
      rubies to invite the Buddha to the realm of the Nagas; they had also 
      strewn the surface of the water with five hundred kinds of lotuses. This 
      was one of the three occasions in the life of the Buddha when human 
      beings, devas and brahmas came together to pay homage to the Buddha. The 
      first occasion was when the Buddha manifested his power and glory by the 
      miracle of the pairs, emitting rays of light and sprays of water; and the 
      second was on his return from the Tavatimsa deva world after expounding 
      the Abhidhamma.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha, wishing to 
      honour the Nagas, then paid a visit to the realm of the Nagas accompanied 
      by the bhikkhus. The Buddha and his entourage went in the five hundred 
      barges brought by the Nagas. After his visit to the realm of the Nagas, 
      the Buddha returned to Rajagaha accompanied by King Bimbisara. They 
      arrived at Rajagaha on the fifth day. Two days after their arrival at 
      Rajagaha, while the bhikkhus were talking about the amazing grandeur and 
      glory of the trip to and from Vesali, the Buddha arrived on the scene. On 
      learning the subject of their talk, the Buddha said to them, <I><FONT 
      color=#800040>"Bhikkhus, that I have been revered so much by brahmas, 
      devas and human beings alike and that they have made offerings on such a 
      grand and lavish scale to me on this occasion is not due to the power I 
      now possess; it is simply because I had done some small meritorious deeds 
      in one of my previous existences that I now enjoy such great benefits". 
      </FONT></I>Then the Buddha related the story of one of his past 
      existences, when he was a brahmin by the name of Sankha.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once there was a brahmin 
      named Sankha who lived in the city of Taxila. He had a son named Susima. 
      When Susima was sixteen years old, he was sent by his father to another 
      brahmin to study astrology. His teacher taught him all that should be 
      learnt, but Susima was not fully satisfied. So, his teacher directed him 
      to approach the paccekabuddhas who were then staying in Isipatana. Susima 
      went to Isipatana, but the paccekabuddhas told him that he must first 
      become a bhikkhu. Thus, he became a bhikkhu, and was instructed how to 
      conduct himself as a bhikkhu. Susima diligently practised meditation and 
      he soon comprehended the Four Noble Truths, acquired Bodhi nana, and 
      became a paccekabuddha himself. But as a result of his previous kamma 
      Susima did not live long; he realized parinibbana soon afterwards.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sankha, the father of 
      Susima, came in search of his son, but when he arrived he only found the 
      stupa where the relics of his son were enshrined. The brahmin felt very 
      much distressed at the loss of his son. He proceeded to clean up the 
      precincts of the stupa, by clearing away grass and weeds; then he covered 
      up the ground with sand and sprinkled it with water. Next, he went into 
      the nearby woods for some wild flowers and stuck them on the wet ground. 
      In that way, he offered his services and paid respect to the paccekabuddha 
      who was once his son. It was because of that good deed done in that 
      previous existence of his that the Buddha gained such benefits, that he 
      was showered with such lavish offerings, that he was shown such deep 
      reverence and great devotion on that particular occasion.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Buddha spoke in 
      verse as follows:</P>

  <TR>
    <TD vAlign=top align=left>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the 
      Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (291) of this book, with 
      reference to a feud between a woman and a hen.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, there lived a woman 
      in a village near Savatthi. She had a hen in her house; every time the hen 
      laid an egg she would eat it up. The hen was very much hurt and angry and 
      made a vow to have vengeance on the woman and made a wish that it should 
      be reborn as some being that would be in a position to kill the offspring 
      of that woman. The hen's wish was fulfilled as it was reborn as a cat and 
      the woman was reborn as a hen in the same house. The cat ate up the eggs 
      of the hen. In their next existence the hen became a leopard and the cat 
      became a deer. The leopard ate up the deer as well as its offspring. Thus, 
      the feud continued for five hundred existences of the two beings. At the 
      time of the Buddha one of them was born as a woman and the other an 
      ogress.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On one occasion, the woman 
      was returning from the house of' her parents to her own house near 
      Savatthi. Her husband and her young son were also with her. While they 
      were resting near a pond at the roadside, her husband went to have a bath 
      in the pond. At that moment the woman saw the ogress and recognized her as 
      her old enemy. Taking her child she fled from the ogress straight to the 
      Jetavana monastery where the Buddha was expounding the Dhamma and put her 
      child at the feet of the Buddha. The ogress who was in hot pursuit of the 
      woman also came to the door of the monastery, but the guardian spirit of 
      the gate did not permit her to enter. The Buddha, seeing her, sent the 
      Venerable Ananda to bring the ogress to his presence. When the ogress 
      arrived, the Buddha reprimanded both the woman and the ogress for the long 
      chain of feud between them. He also added, <I><FONT color=#800040>"If you 
      two had not come to me today, your feud would have continued endlessly. 
      Enmity cannot be appeased by enmity; it can only be appeased by 
      loving-kindness."</FONT></I></P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Buddha spoke in 
      verse as follows:</P>

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, some bhikkhus who

  <TR>
    <TD vAlign=top align=left>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the 
      Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verses (294) and (295) of this 
      book, with reference to Thera Bhaddiya who was also known as Lakundaka 
      Bhaddiya because of his short stature. </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On one occasion, some 
      bhikkhus came to visit and pay homage to the Buddha at the Jetavana 
      monastery. While they were with the Buddha, Lakundaka Bhaddiya happened to 
      pass by not far from them. The Buddha called their attention to the short 
      thera and said to them, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Bhikkhus, look at that 
      thera. He has killed both his father and his mother, and having killed his 
      parents he goes about without any dukkha."</FONT></I> The bhikkhus could 
      not understand the statement made by the Buddha. So, they entreated the 
      Buddha to make it clear to them and the Buddha explained the meaning to 
      them.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the above statement, 
      the Buddha was referring to an arahat, who had eradicated craving, 
      conceit, wrong beliefs, and attachment to sense bases and sense objects. 
      The Buddha had made the statement by means of metaphors. Thus, the terms 
      'mother' and 'father' are used to indicate craving and conceit 
      respectively. The Eternity-belief (Sassataditthi) and Annihilation-belief 
      (Ucchedaditthi) are likened to two kings, attachment is likened to a 
      revenue officer and the sense bases and sense objects (the ajjhatta and 
      bahiddha ayatanas) are likened to a kingdom.</P>

  <TR>
    <TD vAlign=top align=left>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the 
      Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verses (296) to (301) of this book, 
      with reference to the son of a wood-cutter.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once in Rajagaha, a 
      wood-cutter went into the woods with his son to cut some firewood. On 
      their return home in the evening, they stopped near a cemetery to have 
      their meal. They also took off the yoke from the two oxen to enable them 
      to graze nearby; but the two oxen went away without being noticed by them. 
      As soon as they discovered that the oxen were missing, the wood-cutter 
      went to look for them, leaving his son with the cart of firewood. The 
      father entered the town, looking for his oxen. When he returned to his son 
      it was getting late and the city-gate was closed. Therefore, the young boy 
      had to spend the night alone underneath his cart.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wood-cutter's son, 
      though young, was always mindful and was in the habit of contemplating the 
      unique qualities of the Buddha. That night two ogres came to frighten him 
      and to harm him. When one of the ogres pulled at the leg of the boy, he 
      cried out, <FONT color=#0000ff>"I pay homage to the Buddha (Namo 
      Buddhassa)".</FONT> Hearing those words from the boy, the ogres got 
      frightened and also felt that they must look after the boy. So, one of 
      them remained near the boy, guarding him from all danger; the other went 
      to the king's palace and brought the food-tray of King Bimbisara. The two 
      ogres then fed the boy as if he were their own son. At the palace, the 
      ogre left a written message concerning the royal food-tray; and this 
      message was visible only to the king.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning, the king's 
      men discovered that the royal food-tray was missing and they were very 
      upset and very much frightened. The king found the message left by the 
      ogre and directed his men where to look for it. The king's men found the 
      royal food-tray among the firewood in the cart, They also found the boy 
      who was still sleeping underneath the cart. When questioned, the boy 
      answered that his parents came to feed him in the night and that he went 
      to sleep contentedly and without fear after taking his food. The boy knew 
      only that much and nothing more. The king sent for the parents of the boy, 
      and took the boy and his parents to the Buddha. The king, by that time, 
      had heard that the boy was always mindful of the unique qualities of the 
      Buddha and also that he had cried out "Namo Buddhassa", when the ogre 
      pulled at his leg in the night. </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The king asked the Buddha, 
      <FONT color=#0000a0>"Is mindfulness of the unique qualities of the Buddha, 
      the only dhamma that gives one protection against evil and danger, or is 
      mindfulness of the unique qualities of the Dhamma equally potent and 
      powerful?"</FONT> To him the Buddha replied, <I><FONT color=#800040>"O

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the night of the full

      and there was much merry-making with singing, dancing, etc. As he looked 
      towards the city, standing alone in the monastery, the bhikkhu felt lonely

      At that instant, the spirit guarding the woods appeared to him, and said,

      the deva world; so also, people envy the lot of those who live alone in 
      the woods."</FONT> Hearing those words, the bhikkhu realized the truth of

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anathapindika and Ugga, 
      the rich man from Ugga, studied under the same teacher when they were both 
      young. Ugga had a son while Anathapindika had a daughter. When their 
      children came of age, Ugga asked for the consent of Anathapindika to the 
      marriage of their two children. So the marriage took place, and 
      Culasubhaddi, the daughter of Anathapindika, had to stay in the house of 
      her parents-in-law. Ugga and his family were followers of non-Buddhist 
      ascetics. Sometimes, they would invite those non-Buddhist ascetics to 
      their house. On such occasions, her parents-in-law would ask Culasubhadda 
      to pay respect to those naked ascetics, but she always refused to comply.

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mother-in-law of 
      Culasubhadda was very anxious to see the Buddha when she was told about 
      him by her daughter-in-law. She even agreed to let Culasubhaddha invite 
      the Buddha for alms-food to their house. So, Culasubhadda prepared food 
      and collected other offerings for the Buddha and his disciples. She then 
      went up to the upper part of the house and looking towards the Jetavana 
      monastery, she made offerings of flowers and incense and contemplate the

      and threw them up into the sky. The flowers floated through the air all

      Buddha to invite him to have alms-food in his house the following day. But 
      the Buddha replied that he had already accepted Culasubhadda's invitation 
      for the next day.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anathapindika was puzzled

      distance of one hundred and twenty yojanas from here." </FONT>To him the 
      Buddha said, <I><FONT color=#800040>"True, householder, but the good are

      reference to Sundari, a wandering female ascetic.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the number of 
      people revering the Buddha increased, the non-Buddhist ascetics found that 
      the number of their following was dwindling. Therefore, they became very 
      jealous of the Buddha; they were also afraid that things would get worse 
      if they did not do something to damage the reputation of the Buddha. So, 
      they sent for Sundari and said to her, <FONT color=#0000ff>"Sundari, you 
      are a very beautiful and clever young lady. We want you to put Samana 
      Gotama to shame, by making it appear to others that you are having sexual 
      dealings with him. By so doing, his image will be impaired, his following 
      will decrease and many would come to us. Make the best use of your looks 
      and be crafty."</FONT></P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sundari understood 
      what was expected of her. Thus, late in the evening, she went in the 
      direction of the Jetavana monastery. When she was asked where she was 
      going, she answered, <FONT color=#ff00ff>"I am going to visit Samana 
      Gotama; I live with him in the Perfumed Chamber of the Jetavana 
      monastery." </FONT>After saying this, she proceeded to the place of the 
      non-Buddhist ascetics. Early in the morning the next day, she returned 
      home, if anyone asked her from where she had come she would reply, <FONT 
      color=#ff00ff>"I have come from the Perfumed Chamber after staying the 
      night with Samana Gotama." </FONT>She carried on like this for two more 
      days. At the end of three days, those ascetics hired some drunkards to 
      kill Sundari and put her body in a rubbish heap near the Jetavana 
      monastery.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day, the 
      ascetics spread the news about the disappearance of Paribbajika Sundari. 
      They went to the king to report the matter and their suspicion. The king 
      gave them permission to search where they wished. Finding the body near 
      the Jetavana monastery, they carried it to the palace. Then they said to 
      the king, <FONT color=#0000ff>"O king, the followers of Gotama have killed 
      this Paribbajika and have thrown away her body in the rubbish heap near

      have tried to cover up the misdeed of Gotama!" </FONT>The procession then 
      returned to he palace. The bhikkhus living in the Jetavana monastery told 
      the Buddha what those ascetics were (doing to damage his reputation and 
      impair his image. But the Buddha only said, <I><FONT color=#800040>"My 
      sons, you just tell them this,"</FONT></I> and then spoke in verse as

      drunkards. So they were brought to the king. When questioned, the 
      drunkards disclosed that they were hired by the ascetics to kill Sundari 
      and put her body near the Jetavana monastery. The king then sent for the 
      non-Buddhist ascetics, and they finally confessed their role in the murder 
      of Sundari. The king then ordered them to go round the town and confess 
      their guilt to the people. So they went round the town saying, <FONT

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, there was a

      fared during the vassa. To the bhikkhus from Vaggumuda River the Buddha 
      specifically asked whether they had any difficulty in getting alms-food on 
      account of the famine. They answered that they had no difficulty at all in 
      getting alms-food.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha knew how those

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On one occasion, some

      elephant, one of the bhikkhus, who was an ex-elephant trainer, told the 
      other bhikkhus how it could be easily handled. The elephant trainer 
      hearing him did as told by the bhikkhu, and the elephant was quickly 
      subdued. Back at the monastery, the bhikkhus related the incident to the 
      Buddha. The Buddha called the ex-elephant trainer bhikkhu to him and 
      said,<I><FONT color=#800040> "O vain bhikkhu, who is yet far away from 
      Magga and Phala ! You do not gain anything by taming elephants. There is

      Nibbana) by taming elephants; only one who has tamed himself can get

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the 
      Veluvana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (324) of this book, with 
      reference to an old brahmin.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, there lived in 
      Savatthi an old brahmin who had eight lakhs in cash. He had four sons; 
      when each one of the sons got married, he gave one lakh to him. Thus, he 
      gave away four lakhs. Later, his wife died. His sons came to him and 
      looked after him very well; in fact, they were very loving and 
      affectionate to him. In course of time, somehow they coaxed him to give 
      them the remaining four lakhs. Thus, he was left practically 
penniless.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, he went to stay 
      with his eldest son. After a few days, the daughter-in-law said to him, 
      <FONT color=#0000ff>"Did you give any extra hundred or thousand to your 
      eldest son? Don't you know the way to the houses of your other sons?" 
      </FONT>Hearing this, the old brahmin got very angry and he left the eldest 
      son's house for the house of his second son. The same remarks were made by 
      the wife of his second son and the old man went to the house of his third 
      son and finally to the house of his fourth and youngest son. The same 
      thing happened in the houses of all his sons. Thus, the old man became 
      helpless; then, taking a staff and a bowl he went to the Buddha for 
      protection and advice.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the monastery, the 
      brahmin told the Buddha how his sons had treated him and asked for his 
      help. Then the Buddha gave him some verses to memorize and instructed him 
      to recite them wherever there was a large gathering of people. The gist of 
      the verses is this:<FONT color=#8000ff> "My four foolish sons are like 
      ogres. They call me 'father, father', but the words come only out of their 
      mouths and not from their hearts. They are deceitful and scheming. Taking 
      the advice of their wives they have driven me out of their houses. So, now 
      I have got to be begging. Those sons of mine are of less service to me 
      than this staff of mine."</FONT> When the old brahmin recited these 
      verses, many people in the crowd, hearing him, went wild with rage at his 
      sons and some even threatened to kill them.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this, the sons became 
      frightened and knelt down at the feet of their father and asked for 
      pardon. They also promised that starting from that day they would look 
      after their father properly and would respect, love and honour him. Then, 
      they took their father to their houses; they also warned their wives to 
      look after their father well or else they would be beaten to death. Each 
      of the sons gave a length of cloth and sent every day a food-tray. The 
      brahmin became healthier than before and soon put on some weight. He 
      realized that he had been showered with these benefits on account of the 
      Buddha. So, he went to the Buddha and humbly requested him to accept two 
      food-trays out of the four he was receiving every day from his sons. Then 
      he instructed his sons to send two food-trays to the Buddha.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, the eldest son 
      invited the Buddha to his house for alms-food. After the meal, the Buddha 
      gave a discourse on the benefits to be gained by looking after one's 
      parents. Then he related to them the story of the elephant called 
      Dhanapala, who looked after his parents. Dhanapala when captured pined for 
      the parents who were left in the forest.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Buddha spoke in

      reference to a young samanera named Sanu.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, Samanera Sanu was 
      urged by older bhikkhus to go up on the dais and recite parts of the Pali 
      texts. When he had finished his recitation he solemnly called out, <FONT 
      color=#0000ff>"May the merits gained by me today for reciting these sacred 
      texts be shared by my mother and my father". </FONT>At that time, the 
      devas and the ogress who had been the mother of the young samanera in a 
      previous existence were listening to his recitation. When they heard his 
      words, the ogress was elated and promptly cried out, <FONT 
      color=#8000ff>"My dear son, how happy I am to share your merit; you have 
      done well, my son. Well done! Well done! (Sadhu! Sadhu !)."</FONT> On 
      account of Samanera Sanu, the mother ogress came to be very much respected 
      and was given precedence in their assemblies by the devas and other 
      ogres.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the samanera grew 
      older, he wanted to return to the life of a lay man; he went home and 
      asked for his clothes from his mother. His mother did not want him to 
      leave the Order and tried to dissuade him front leaving it, but he was 
      quite firm in his decision. So, his mother promised to give him the 
      clothes after his meal. As his mother was busy cooking his meal, the 
      ogress, who was his mother of a past existence, thought, <FONT 
      color=#8000ff>"If my son Sanu leaves the Order, I shall be put to shame 
      and become a laughing stock among other ogres and devas; I must try and 
      stop him leaving the Order." </FONT>So, the young samanera was possessed 
      by her; the boy rolled on the floor, muttering in coherently with saliva 
      streaming out of his mouth. The mother got alarmed; neighbours came and 
      tried to appease the spirits. Then, the ogress spoke out <FONT 
      color=#8000ff>"This samanera wants to leave the religious Order and return 
      to the life of a lay man; if he does so he will not be able to escape from 
      dukkha."</FONT> After saying those words, the ogress left the body of the 
      boy and the boy became normal again.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finding his mother in 
      tears and the neighbours crowding around him, he asked what had happened. 
      His mother told him everything that had happened to him and also explained 
      to him that to return to lay life after leaving it was very foolish; in 
      fact, even though living he would be like a dead person. The samanera then 
      came to realize his mistake. Taking the three robes from his mother, he 
      went back to the monastery and was soon admitted as a bhikkhu.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When told about Samanera 
      Sanu, the Buddha wishing to teach him about the restraint of mind said, 
      <I><FONT color=#800040>"My son, one who does not restrain the mind which 
      wanders about cannot find happiness. So, control your mind as a mahout
