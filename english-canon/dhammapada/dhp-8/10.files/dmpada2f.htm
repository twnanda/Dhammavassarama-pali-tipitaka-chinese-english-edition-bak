name=Tambadathika>Tambadathika</A></FONT></B></FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the 
Buddha uttered Verse (100) of this book, with reference to Tambadathika, the 
executioner of thieves.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tambadathika served the king as an executioner 
of thieves for fifty-five years; he had just retired from that post. One day, 
after preparing rice gruel at his house, he went to the river for a bath; he had 
intended to take the specially prepared rice gruel on his return. As he was 
about to take the rice gruel, Thera Sariputta, who had just arisen from 
sustained absorption in Concentration (<I>jhana samapatti</I>), stood at his 
door for alms-food. Seeing the thera, Tambadathika thought to himself, <FONT 
color=#ff0080>"Throughout my life, I have been executing thieves; now I should 
offer this food to the thera."</FONT> So, he invited Thera Sariputta to come in 
and respectfully offered the rice gruel.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the meal, the thera taught him the 
Dhamma, but Tambadathika could not pay attention, because he was so agitated as 
he recollected his past life as an executioner. When the thera knew this, he 
decided to ask Tambadathika tactfully whether he killed the thieves because he 
wished to kill them or because he was ordered to do so. Tambadathika answered 
that he was ordered to kill them by the king and that he had no wish to kill. 
Then the thera asked, <FONT color=#800000>"If that is so, would you be guilty or 
not ?"</FONT> Tambadathika then concluded that, as he was not responsible for 
the evil deeds, he was not guilty. He, therefore, calmed down, and requested the 
thera to continue his exposition. As he listened to the Dhamma with proper 
attention, he came very close to attaining Sotapatti Magga, and reached as far 
as <I>anuloma nana.*</I> After the discourse, Tambadathika accompanied Thera 
Sariputta for some distance and then returned home. On his way home a cow 
(actually a demon in the guise of a cow) gored him to death.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Buddha came to the congregation of the 
bhikkhus in the evening, they informed him about the death of Tambadathika. When 
asked where Tambadathika was reborn, the Buddha told them that although 
Tambadathika had committed evil deeds throughout his life, because he 
comprehended the Dhamma after hearing it from Thera Sariputta and had already 
attained<I> anuloma nana </I>before he died, he was reborn in the Tusita deva 
world. The bhikkhus wondered how such an evil-doer could have such great benefit 
after listening to the Dhamma just once. To them the Buddha said that the length 
of a discourse is of no consequence, for one single word of sense can produce 
much benefit.</P>

<A name=Bahiyadaruciriya>Bahiyadaruciriya</A></FONT></FONT></B></FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the 
Buddha uttered Verse (101) of this book, with reference to Bahiyadaruciriya. 
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of merchants went out to sea in a boat; 
their boat was wrecked at sea and all, except one, died. The only survivor got 
hold of a plank and eventually came to land at the port of Supparaka. As he was 
naked, he tied the plank to his body, got hold of a bowl, and sat in a place 
where people could see him. Passersby gave him rice and gruel; some took him for 
an arahat and talked in praise of him. Some brought clothes for him to wear but 
he refused, fearing that by wearing clothes, people would give less to him. 
Besides, because some said that he was an arahat, he mistakenly came to think 
that he really was one. Thus, because he was a man of wrong views who was 
wearing a piece of wood as his clothing, he came to be known as 
Bahiyadaruciriya.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At about this time, Mahabrahma, who had been 
his friend in one of his previous existences, saw him going astray and felt that 
it was his duty to put Bahiya on the right path. So, Mahabrahma came to him in 
the night and said to him<FONT color=#0000ff> "Bahiya, you are not an arahat 
yet, and what is more, you do not have the qualities that make one an 
arahat."</FONT> Bahiya looked up at Mahabrahma and said, <FONT 
color=#800000>"Yes, I must admit that I am not an arahat, as you have said. I 
now realize that I have done a great wrong. But is there anyone else in this 
world now who is an arahat?"</FONT> Mahabrahma then told him that there lived in 
Savatthi Gotama Buddha, an arahat, who was perfectly self-enlightened.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bahiya, realizing the enormity of his guilt, 
felt very much distressed and ran all the way to Savatthi. Mahabrahma helped him 
by his supernormal power, so that the whole stretch of one hundred and twenty 
<I>yojanas</I> was covered in one night. Bahiya found the Buddha going on an 
alms-round with other bhikkhus and respectfully followed him. He pleaded with 
the Buddha to teach him the Dhamma, but the Buddha replied that since they were 
on an alms-round it was not yet time for a religious discourse. And again, 
Bahiya pleaded,<FONT color=#0000ff> "Venerable Sir, one cannot know the danger 
to your life or to my life, so please talk to me about the Dhamma."</FONT> The 
Buddha knew that Bahiya had made the journey of one hundred and twenty yojanas 
in one night, and also that he was overwhelmed with joy at seeing the Buddha. 
That was why the Buddha did not want to talk about the Dhamma immediately but 
wanted him to calm down to enable him to take in the Dhamma properly. Still, 
Bahiya persistently pleaded. So, while standing on the road, the Buddha said to 
Bahiya, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Bahiya, when you see an object, be conscious of 
just the visible object; when you hear a sound, be conscious of just the sound; 
when you smell or taste or touch something, be conscious of just the smell, the 
taste or the touch; and when you think of anything, be conscious of just the 
mind-object."</FONT></I></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the above discourse, Bahiya 
attained arahatship and he asked permission from the Buddha to join the Order. 
The Buddha told him to get the robes, the bowl and other requisites of a 
bhikkhu. On his way to get them, he was gored to death by a cow which was, in 
fact, an ogress in the likeness of a cow. When the Buddha and the other bhikkhus 
came out after having had their meal, they found Bahiya lying dead on a rubbish 
heap. As instructed by the Buddha, the bhikkhus cremated the body of Bahiya and 
had his bones enshrined in a stupa.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha told 
the bhikkhus that Bahiya had realized Nibbana. He also told them that as far as 
speed was concerned in attaining Magga Insight (<I>abhinna</I>), Bahiya was the 
fastest, the best (<I>Etadaggam</I>). The bhikkhus were puzzled by the statement 
made by the Buddha and they asked him why and when Bahiya became an arahat. To 
this, the Buddha replied, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Bahiya attained arahatship 
while he listened to my instructions given to him on the road when we were on 
the alms-round."</FONT></I> The bhikkhus wondered how one could attain 
arahatship after listening to just a few sentences of the Dhamma. So, the Buddha 
told them that the number of words or the length of a speech did not matter if 
it was beneficial to someone.</P>

of Theri <A name=Kundalakesi>Kundalakesi</A></B></FONT></FONT></B></FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the 
Buddha uttered Verses (102) and (103) of this book, with reference to Theri 
Kundalakesi.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kundalakesi was the daughter of a rich man from 
Rajagaha. She had led a very secluded life; but one day, she happened to see a 
thief being led out to be killed and she immediately fell in love with him. Her 
parents had to pay for the freedom of the thief, and they married her off to 
him. Although she loved her husband very dearly, her husband being a thief, was 
only attracted to her property and her jewels. One day, he coaxed her to put on 
all her jewellery and led her to a mountain saying that he wanted to make some 
offerings to the guardian spirit of the mountain because that guardian spirit 
had saved his life when he was about to be killed. Kundalakesi went along with 
her husband, but when they reached their destination, the thief revealed that he 
intended to kill her and take her jewels. She pleaded with him to take her 
jewels, but to spare her life, but it was of no avail. She then realized that if 
she did not get rid of her husband, there would be no way of escape for her. She 
felt she must be cautious and crafty. So she said to her husband that as they 
would be together only for a few moments more, she wanted to pay respect to him 
for the last time. So saying, and going round the man respectfully, she pushed 
him off the crag, taking him unaware.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this, she had no desire to return home. 
She left all her jewellery hanging on a tree, and went on her way, without any 
idea where she was going. She happened to come to a place of some 
<I>Paribbajikas</I> (female wandering ascetics) and she herself became a 
Paribbajikas. The Paribbajikas taught her all their one thousand problems in 
sophistry; being intelligent she mastered all of them within a short time. Then 
her teachers told her to go out into the world and if she should find somebody 
who could answer all her questions, to become a pupil to him. Kundalakesi went 
throughout the length and breadth of <I>Jambudipa</I>, openly challenging 
everyone else to compete with her. Accordingly, she came to be known as 
"<I>Jambukaparibbajika</I>." </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one occasion, she came to Savatthi. Before 
entering the city for alms-food she made a mound of sand and stuck a branch of 
eugenia on it, her usual sign of invitation to all others to take up her 
challenge. <I>Thera Sariputta</I> took up her challenge. Kundalakesi asked him a 
thousand questions and Thera Sariputta answered them all. When his turn came, he 
asked her just this, <FONT color=#ff8040>"What is the one? (<I>ekam nama 
kim</I>)." </FONT>Kundalakesi could not answer, so she asked Thera Sariputta to 
teach her the answer to the question. Thera Sariputta replied that she should 
first become a<I>bhikkhuni</I>; so she became a bhikkhuni, by the name of<I> 
Theri Kundalakesi</I>. Within a few days, she became an arahat.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after this, the bhikkhus asked the Buddha, 
<FONT color=#800000>"Could it be possible for Bhikkhuni Kundalakesi to become an 
arahat after listening to the Dhamma only a little?"</FONT> They also added that 
this lady had fought and won a victory over her husband, who was a thief, before 
she became a paribbajika.</P>

of the Brahmin Anatthapucchaka </FONT></A></B></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the 
Buddha uttered Verses (104) and (105) of this book, with reference to 
Anatthapucchaka, a brahmin.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one occasion, a Brahmin by the name of 
Anatthapucchaka came to the Buddha and said to him, <FONT 
color=#0000ff>"Venerable Sir, I think that you know only the practices that are 
beneficial and not the practices that are unbeneficial."</FONT> To him, the 
Buddha answered that he also knew the practices which were unbeneficial and 
harmful. Then the Buddha enumerated six practices which cause dissipation of 
wealth; they are: (1) sleeping until the sun has risen, (2) habitual idleness, 
(3) cruelty, (4) indulgence in intoxicants which causes drunkenness and 
negligence, (5) sauntering alone in streets at unearthly hours, and (6) sexual 
misconduct.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the Buddha asked the brahmin how he 
earned his living, and the brahmin replied that he earned his living by playing 
dice, i.e., by gambling. Next, the Buddha asked him whether he won or lost. When 
the brahmin answered that he sometimes lost and sometimes won, the Buddha said 
to him,<I><FONT color=#800040> "To win in a game of dice is nothing compared to 
a victory over moral defilements."</FONT></I></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one occasion, Thera Sariputta asked his

answered that he was making offerings to the value of one thousand 
<I>Kahapanas</I> every month to the Nigantha ascetics, hoping to get to the

his teachers had given him false hopes and that they themselves did not know the 
way to the Brahma world. So saying, he took his uncle the brahmin to the Buddha, 
and requested the Buddha to expound the Dhamma, which would surely take one to

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing in a village monastery near 
Dighalanghika., the Buddha uttered Verse (109) of this book, with reference to 
Ayuvaddhanakumara.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once, there were two hermits who fixed together 
practising religious austerities (<I>tapacaranam</I>) for forty eight years. 
Later, one of the two left the hermit life and got married. After a son was 
born, the family visited the old hermit and paid obeisance to him. To the 
parents the hermit said, "May you live long," but he said nothing to the child. 
The parents were puzzled and asked the hermit the reason for his silence. The 
hermit told them that the child would live only seven more days and that he did 
not know how to prevent his death, but Gotama Buddha might know how to do 
it.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the parents took the child to the Buddha; 
when they paid obeisance to the Buddha, he also said, "May you live long" to the 
parents only and not to the child. The Buddha also predicted the impending death 
of the child. To prevent his death, the parents were told to build a pavilion at 
the entrance to the house, and put the child on a couch in the pavilion. Then 
some bhikkhus were sent there to recite the <I>parittas*</I> for seven days. On 
the seventh day the Buddha himself came to that pavilion; the devas from all 
over the universe also came. At that time the ogre Avaruddhaka was at the 
entrance, waiting for a chance to take the child away. But as more powerful 
devas arrived the ogre had to step back and make room for them so that he had to 
stay at a place two yojanas away from the child. That whole night, recitation of 
parittas continued, thus protecting the child. The next day, the child was taken 
up from the couch and made to pay obeisance to the Buddha. This time, the Buddha 
said, <I><FONT color=#800040>"May you live long"</FONT></I> to the child. When 
asked how long the child would live, the Buddha replied that he would live up to 
one hundred and twenty years. So the child was named Ayuvaddhana.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the child grew up, he went about the 
country with a company of five hundred fellow devotees. One day, they came to 
the Jetavana monastery, and the bhikkhus, recognizing him, asked the Buddha, 
<FONT color=#800000>"For beings, is there any means of gaining 
longevity?"</FONT> To this question the Buddha answered, "<I><FONT 
color=#800040>By respecting and honouring the elders and those who are wise and 
virtuous, one would gain not only longevity, but also beauty, happiness and 
strength."</FONT></I></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the 
Buddha uttered Verse (110) of this book, with reference to Samanera Samkicca. 
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one occasion, thirty bhikkhus each took a 
subject of meditation from the Buddha and left for a large village, one hundred 
and twenty yojanas away from Savatthi. At that time, five hundred robbers were 
staying in a thick jungle, and they wanted to make an offering of human flesh 
and blood to the guardian spirits of the forest. So they came to the village 
monastery and demanded that one of the bhikkhus be given up to them for 
sacrifice to the guardian spirits. From the eldest to the youngest, each one of 
the bhikkhus volunteered to go. With the bhikkhus, there was also a young 
samanera by the name of Samkicca, who was sent along with them by Thera 
Sariputta. This samanera was only seven years old, but had already attained 
arahatship. Samkicca said that Thera Sariputta, his teacher, knowing this danger 
in advance, had purposely sent him to accompany the bhikkhus, and that he should 
be the one to go with the robbers. So saying, he went along with the robbers. 
The bhikkhus felt very bad for having let the young samanera go. The robbers 
made preparations for the sacrifice; when everything was ready, their leader 
came to the samanera, who was then seated, with his mind fixed on <I>jhana</I> 
concentration. The leader of the robbers lifted his sword and struck hard at the 
young samanera, but the blade of the sword curled up without cutting the flesh. 
He straightened up the blade and struck again; this time, it bent upwards right 
up to the hilt without harming the samanera. Seeing this strange happening, the 
leader of the robbers dropped his sword, knelt at the feet of the samanera and 
asked his pardon. All the five hundred robbers were amazed and terror-stricken; 
they repented and asked permission from Samkicca to become bhikkhus. He complied 
with their request.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young samanera accompanied by five hundred 
new bhikkhus returned to the village monastery and the thirty bhikkhus felt very 
much relieved and happy on seeing him. Then Samkicca and the five hundred 
bhikkhus continued on their way to pay respect to Thera Sariputta, his teacher, 
at the Jetavana monastery. After seeing Thera Sariputta they went to pay homage 
to the Buddha. When told what had happened, the Buddha said,<I><FONT 
color=#800040> "Bhikkhus, if you rob or steal and commit all sorts of evil 
deeds, your life would be useless, even if you were to live a hundred years. 
Living a virtuous life even for a single day is much better than a hundred years 
of a life of depravity.</FONT></I></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the 
Buddha uttered Verse (111) of this book, with reference to Khanu Kondanna.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thera Kondanna, after taking a subject of 
meditation from the Buddha, went into the jungle to practise meditation and 
there attained arahatship. Coming back to pay homage to the Buddha, he stopped 
on the way because he was very tired. He sat on a large stone-slab, his mind 
fixed in jhana concentration. At that moment five hundred robbers after looting 
a large village came to the place where the thera was. Taking him for a tree 
stump they put their bundles of loot all over and around the body of the thera. 
When day broke they realized that what they took to be a tree stump was, in 
fact, a living being. Then again, they thought it was an ogre and ran away in 
fright.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thera revealed to them that he was only a 
bhikkhu and not an ogre and told them not to get frightened. The robbers were 
awed by his words, and asked his pardon for having wronged him. Soon after 
wards, all the robbers requested the thera to admit them into the Order. From 
that time, Thera Kondanna came to be known as "Khanu Kondanna" (tree-stump 
Kondanna)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thera accompanied by the new bhikkhus went 
to the Buddha and told him all that had happened. To them the Buddha 
said,<I><FONT color=#800040> "To live for a hundred years in ignorance, doing 
foolish things, is useless; now that you have seen the Truth and have become 
wise, your life of one day as a wise man is much more

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the 
Buddha uttered Verse (112) of this book, with reference to Thera Sappadasa.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a bhikkhu was not feeling happy with the 
life of a bhikkhu; at the same time he felt that it would be improper and 
humiliating for him to return to the life of a householder. So he thought it 
would be better to die. So thinking, on one occasion, he put his hand into a pot 
where there was a snake but the snake did not bite him. This was because in a 
past existence the snake was a slave and the bhikkhu was his master. Because of 
this incident the bhikkhu was known as Thera Sappadasa. On another occasion, 
Thera Sappadasa took a razor to cut his throat; but as he placed the razor on 
his throat he reflected on the purity of his morality practice throughout his 
life as a bhikkhu and his whole body was suffused with delightful satisfaction 
(<I>piti</I>) and bliss (<I>sukha</I>). Then detaching himself from piti, he 
directed his mind to the development of Insight Knowledge and soon attained 
arahatship, and he returned to the monastery.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On arrival at the monastery, other bhikkhus 
asked him where he had been and why he took the knife along with him. When he 
told them about his intention to take his life, they asked him why he did not do 
so. He answered,<FONT color=#800000> "I originally intended to cut my throat 
with this knife, but I have now cut off all moral defilements with the knife of 
Insight Knowledge."</FONT> The bhikkhus did not believe him; so they went to the 
Buddha and asked.<FONT color=#0000ff> "Venerable Sir, this bhikkhu claims, that 
he has attained arahatship as he was putting the knife to his throat to kill 
himself. Is it possible to attain Arahatta Magga within such a short

is possible; for one who is zealous and strenuous in the practice of

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the 
Buddha uttered Verse (113) of this book, with reference to Patacara.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patacara was the daughter of a rich man from 
Savatthi. She was very beautiful and was guarded very strictly by her parents. 
But one day, she eloped with a young male attendant of the family and went to 
live in a village, as a poor man's wife. In due course she became pregnant and 
as the time for confinement drew near, she asked permission from her husband to 
return to her parents in Savatthi. but her husband discouraged her. So, one day, 
while her husband was away, she set out for the home of her parents. Her husband 
followed her and caught up with her on the way and pleaded with her to return 
with him; but she refused. It so happened that as her time was drawing so near, 
she had to give birth to a son in one of the bushes. After the birth of her son 
she returned home with her husband.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, she was again with child and as the time 
for confinement drew nears taking her son with her, she again set out for the 
home of her parents in Savatthi. Her husband followed her and caught up with her 
on the way; but her time for delivery was coming on very fast and it was also 
raining hard. The husband looked for a suitable place for confinement and while 
he was clearing a little patch of land, he was bitten by a poisonous snake, and 
died instantaneously. Patacara waited for her husband, and while waiting for his 
return she gave birth to her second son. In the morning, she searched for her 
husband, but only found his dead body. Saying to herself that her husband died 
on account of her, she continued on her way to her parents. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it had rained incessantly the whole 
night, the river Aciravati was in spate; so it was not possible for her to cross 
the river carrying both her sons. Leaving the elder boy on this side of the 
river, she crossed the stream with her day-old son and left him on the other 
bank. She then came back for the elder boy. While she was still in the middle of 
the river, a large hawk hovered over the younger child taking it for a piece of 
meat. She shouted to frighten away the bird, but it was all in vain; the child 
was carried away by the hawk. Meanwhile, the elder boy heard his mother shouting 
from the middle of the stream and thought she was calling out to him to come to 
her. So he entered the stream to go to his mother, and was carried away by the 
strong current. Thus, Patacara lost her two sons as well as her husband.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she wept and lamented loudly, <FONT 
color=#0000ff>"A son is carried away by a hawk, another son is carried away by 
the current, my husband is also dead, bitten by a poisonous snake!"</FONT> Then, 
she saw a man from Savatthi and she tearfully asked after her parents. The man 
replied that due to a violent storm in Savatthi the previous night, the house of 
her parents had fallen down and that both her parents together with her three 
brothers, had died, and had been cremated on one funeral pyre. On hearing this 
tragic news, Patacara went stark mad. She did not even notice that her clothes 
had fallen off from her and that she was half-naked. She went about the streets, 
shouting out her woes.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Buddha was giving a discourse at the 
Jetavana monastery, he saw Patacara at a distance; so he willed that she should 
come to the congregation. The crowd seeing her coming tried to stop her, saying 
<FONT color=#ff0080>"Don't let the mad woman come in."</FONT> But the Buddha 
told them not to prevent her coming in. When Patacara was close enough to hear 
him, he told her to be careful and to keep calm. Then, she realized that she did 
not have her skirt on and shamefacedly sat down. Some one gave her a piece of 
cloth and she wrapped herself up in it. She then told the Buddha how she had 
lost her sons, her husband, her brothers and her parents. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha said to her, <I><FONT 
color=#800040>"Patacara, have no fear; you have now come to one who can protect 
you and guide you. Throughout this round of existences (samsara), the amount of 
tears you have shed on account of the death of your sons, husbands, parents and 
brothers is voluminous; it is even more than the waters of the four 
oceans."</FONT></I> Thus the Buddha expounded to her the <I>Anamatagga 
Sutta</I>, which dealt with countless existences, and she felt relieved. Then, 
the Buddha added that one should not think too much about those who were gone, 
but that one should purify oneself and strive to realize Nibbana. On hearing 
this exhortation from the Buddha, Patacara attained Sotapatti Fruition.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Patacara became a bhikkhuni. One day, she 
was cleaning her feet with water from a water-pot. As she poured the water for 
the first time, it flowed only a short distance and disappeared; then she poured 
for the second time and the water went a little farther, but the water she 
poured for the third time went the farthest. As she looked at the flow and the 
disappearance of water poured cut successively for three times, she came to 
perceive clearly the three stages in the life of beings. The Buddha seeing her 
through supernormal power from the Jetavana monastery sent forth his radiance 
and appeared to her in person. He then said to her, <I><FONT 
color=#800040>"Patacara, you are now on the right track, and you now have the 
true perception of the aggregates (khandhas). One who does not perceive the 
impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and insubstantiality of the aggregates is 
useless, even if he were to live for a hundred years.</FONT></I> </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Jetavana monastery, thc 
Buddha uttered Verse (114) of this book, with reference to Kisagotami.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kisagotami was the daughter of a rich man from 
Savatthi; she was known as Kisagotami because of her slim body. Kisagotami was 
married to a rich young man and a son was born to them. The boy died when he was 
just a toddler and Kisagotami was stricken with grief. Carrying the dead body of 
her son, she went about asking for medicine that would restore her son to life 
from everyone she happened to meet. People began to think that she had gone mad. 
But a wise man seeing her condition thought that he should be of some help to 
her. So, he said to her, <FONT color=#0000ff>"The Buddha is the person you 
should approach, he has the medicine you want; go to him." </FONT>Thus, she went 
to the Buddha and asked him to give her the medicine that would restore her dead 
son to life.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha told her to get some mustard seeds 
from a house where there had been no death. Carrying her dead child in her 
bosom. Kisagotami went from house to house, with the request for some mustard 
seeds. Everyone was willing to help her, but she could not find a single house 
where death had not occurred. Then, she realized that hers was not the only 
family that had faced death and that there were more people dead than living. As 
soon as she realized this, her attitude towards her dead son changed; she was no 
longer attached to the dead body of her son.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She left the corpse in the jungle and returned 
to the Buddha and reported that she could find no house where death had not 
occurred. Then the Buddha said,<I><FONT color=#800040> "Gotami, you thought that 
you were the only one who had lost a son. As you have now realized, death comes 
to all beings; before their desires are satiated death takes them away." 
</FONT></I>On hearing this, Kisagotami fully realized the impermanence, 
unsatisfactoriness and insubstantiality of the aggregates and attained Sotapatti 
Fruition.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon afterwards, Kisagotami became a bhikkhuni. 
One day, as she was lighting the lamps she saw the flames flaring up and dying 
out, and suddenly she clearly perceived the arising and the perishing of beings. 
The Buddha, through supernormal power, saw her from his monastery, and sent 
forth his radiance and appeared to her in person. Kisagotami was told to 
continue meditating on the impermanent nature of all beings and to strive hard 
to realize Nibbana.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the

of many children.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once in Savatthi, there lived a couple, with 
their seven sons and seven daughters. All the children got married and the 
family was doing quite well. Then, the father died and the mother kept all the 
property without giving anything to the children. Her sons and daughters wanted 
the inheritance, so they said, to their mother,<FONT color=#0000ff> "What 
benefit do we get from our property? Can't we make it multiply? Can't we look 
after our mother?"</FONT> They said such things again and again so their mother 
thought that her children would look after her, and she finally divided up the 
property without leaving anything for herself.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the division of the property, she first 
went to stay with her eldest son, but her daughter-in-law complained and 
said,<FONT color=#ff00ff> "She has come and stayed with us, as if she has given 
us two shares!"</FONT>, and such other things. So, Bahuputtika went to stay with 
her second son, and the same things were said. Thus, she went from one son to 
another, from one daughter to the next; but none of them was willing to take her 
on for a long stretch of time and none paid her due respect.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old lady was hurt and felt bitter against 
her children; she left her family and became a bhikkhuni. Because she was a 
mother of many children she came to he known as Bahuputtika. Bahuputika realized 
that she became a bhikkhuni only in her old age and that she must not be 
negligent, but must make use of the remaining period of her life to the utmost. 
So, for the whole night, she meditated on the Dhamma taught by the Buddha. The 
Buddha seeing her from the Jetavana monastery, through supernormal power, sent

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (116) of this book, with reference to a 
brahmin couple by the name of Culekasataka.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was once a brahmin couple 
in Savatthi, who had only one outer garment between the two of them. Because of 
this they were also known as Ekasataka. As they had only one outer garment, both 
of them could not go out at the same time. So, the wife would go to listen to 
the discourse given by the Buddha during the day and the husband would go at 
night. One night, as the brahmin listened to the Buddha, his whole body came to 
be suffused with delightful satisfaction and he felt a strong desire to offer 
the outer garment he was wearing to the Buddha. But he realized that if he were 
to give away the only outer garment he had, there would be none left for him and 
his wife. So he wavered and hesitated. Thus, the first and the second watches of 
the night passed. Came the third watch and he said to himself, <FONT 
color=#0000ff>"If I am so miserly and hesitant, I will not be able to avoid 
falling to the four Lower Worlds (apayas); I shall now offer my outer garment to 
the Buddha." </FONT>So saying, he placed the piece of cloth at the feet of the 
Buddha and cried out<FONT color=#0000ff> "I have won"</FONT>three times.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; King Pasenadi of Kosala, who was 
among the audience, heard those words and ordered a courtier to investigate. 
Learning about the brahmin's offering to the Buddha, the king commented that the 
brahmin had done something which was not easy to do and so should be rewarded. 
The king ordered his men to give the brahmin a piece of cloth as a reward for 
his faith and generosity. The brahmin offered that piece of cloth also to the 
Buddha and he was rewarded by the king with two pieces of cloth. Again, the 
brahmin offered the two pieces of cloth to the Buddha and he was rewarded with 
four. Thus, he offered to the Buddha whatever was given him by the king, and 
each time the king doubled his reward. When finally, the reward came up to 
thirty-two pieces of cloth, the brahmin kept one piece for himself and another 
for his wife, and offered the remaining thirty pieces to the Buddha.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, thinking again commented 
that the brahmin had truly performed a very difficult task and so must be 
rewarded fittingly. The king sent a messenger to the palace to bring two pieces 
of velvet cloth, each of which was worth one hundred thousand, and gave them to 
the brahmin. The brahmin made those two pieces of valuable cloth into two 
canopies and kept one in the Perfumed Chamber where the Buddha slept and the 
other in his own house above the place where a bhikkhu was regularly offered 
alms-food. When the king next went to Jatavana monastery to pay homage to the 
Buddha, he saw the velvet canopy and recognized it as the offering made by the 
brahmin and he was very pleased. This time he made a reward of seven kinds in 
fours (sabbacatukka), viz., four elephants, four horses, four female slaves, 
four male slaves, four errand boys, four villages and four thousands in 
cash.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bhikkhus heard about 
this, they asked the Buddha,<FONT color=#ff8040> "How is it that, in the case of 
this brahmin, a good deed done at present bears fruit immediately?" </FONT>To 
them the Buddha replied <I><FONT color=#800040>"If the brahmin had offered his 
outer garment in the first watch of the night, he would have been rewarded with 
sixteen of each kind; if he had made his offering during the middle watch, he 
would have been rewarded with eight of each kind; since he had made his offering 
only during the last watch of the night, he was rewarded with only four of each

a female deva.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At one time Thera Mahakassapa 
stayed in the Pippali cave and remained in sustained absorption in concentration 
(samapatti) for seven days. Soon after he had arisen from samapatti, wishing to 
give someone a chance of offering something to a thera just arisen from 
samapatti, he looked out and found a young maid frying corn in a field-hut. So 
he stood at her door for alms-food and she put all the pop corn into the bawl of 
the thera. As she turned back after offering pop corn to the thera, she was 
bitten by a poisonous snake and died. She was reborn in Tavatimsa deva world and 
was known as Laja (pop corn) devadhita.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laja realized that she was 
reborn in Tavatimsa because she had offered pop corn to Thera Mahakassapa and 
felt very grateful to him. Then she concluded that she should keep on doing some 
services to the thera in order to make her good fortune more enduring. So, every 
morning she went to the monastery of the thera, swept the premises, filled up 
water pots, and did other services. At first, the thera thought that young 
samaneras had done those services; but one day, he found out that a female deva 
had been performing those services. So he told her not to come to the monastery 
any more, as people might start talking if she kept on coming to the monastery. 
Lajadevadhita was very upset; she pleaded with the thera and cried, <FONT

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verses (119) and (120) of this book, with 
reference to Anathapindika, the famous rich man of Savatthi.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anathapindika was the donor of 
the Jetavana monastery, which was built at a cost of fifty-four crores. He was 
not only generous but also truly devoted to the Buddha. He would go to the 
Jetavana monastery and pay homage to the Buddha thrice daily. In the mornings he 
would bring along rice gruel, in the day-time some suitable rich food or 
medicine and in the evenings some flowers and incense. After some time 
Anathapindika became poor, but being a sotapanna he was not shaken by 
misfortune, and he continued to do his daily acts of charity. One night, the 
spirit guarding the gate to the house of Anathapindika appeared to him in 
person, and said, <FONT color=#ff0080>"I am the guardian of your gate. You have 
been offering your property to Samana Gotama with no thoughts of your future. 
That is why you are now a poor man. Therefore, you should make no more offerings 
to Samana Gotama and should look after your own business affairs and get rich 
again"</FONT></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anathapindika drove the guardian 
spirit out of his house for saying such things, and as Anathapindika was a 
sotapanna the guardian spirit could not disobey him and so had to leave the 
premises. He had nowhere to go and wanted to return but was afraid of 
Anathapindika . So, he approached Sakka, king of the devas. Sakka advised him 
first to do a good turn to Anathapindika, and after that, to ask his pardon. 
Then Sakka continued, <FONT color=#ff8040>"There are about eighteen crores taken 
as loans by some traders which are not yet repaid to Anathapindika; another 
eighteen crores buried by the ancestors of Anathapindika, which have been washed 
away into the ocean, and another eighteen crores, which belong to no one, buried 
in a certain place. Go and recover all these wealth by your supernatural power 
and fill up the rooms of Anathapindika. Having done so, you may ask his 
pardon".</FONT> The guardian spirit did as instructed by Sakka, and 
Anathapindika again became rich.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the guardian spirit told 
Anathapindika about the information and instructions given by Sakka, about the 
recovery of his riches from underneath the earth, from within the ocean and from 
the debtors, he was struck with awe. Then Anathapindika took the guardian spirit 
to the Buddha. To both of them the Buddha said,<I><FONT color=#800040> "One may 
not enjoy the benefits of a good deed, or suffer the consequences of a bad deed 
for a long time; but time will surely come when his good or bad deed will bear

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (122) of this book, with reference to 
Bilalapadaka, a rich man. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, a man from Savatthi, 
having heard a discourse given by the Buddha, was very much impressed, and 
decided to practise what was taught by the Buddha. The exhortation was to give 
in charity not only by oneself but also to get others to do so and that by so 
doing one would gain much merit and have a large number of followers in the next 
existence. So, that man invited the Buddha and all the resident bhikkhus in the 
Jetavana monastery for alms-food the next day. Then he went round to each one of 
the houses and informed the residents that alms-food would he offered the next 
day to the Buddha and other bhikkhus and so to contribute according to their 
wishes. The rich man Bilalapadaka seeing the man goings round from house to 
house disapproved of his behaviour and felt a strong dislike for him and 
murmured to himself, <FONT color=#0000ff>"O this wretched man! Why did he not 
invite as many bhikkhus as he could himself offer alms, instead of going round 
coaxing people?"</FONT> So he asked the man to bring his bowl and into this 
bowl, he put only a little rice, only a little butter, only a little molass. 
These were taken away separately and not mixed with what others had given. The 
rich men could not understand why his thing; were kept separately, and he 
thought perhaps that man wanted others to know that a rich man like him had 
contributed very little and so put him to shame. Therefore, he sent a servant to 
find out. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The promoter of charity put a 
little of everything that was given by the rich man into various pots of rice 
and curry and sweetmeats so that the rich man may gain much merit. His servant 
reported what he had seen; but Bilalapadaka did not get the meaning and was not 
sure of the intention of the promoter of charity. However, the next day he went 
to the place where alms-food was being offered. At the same time, he took a 
knife with him, intending to kill the chief promoter of charity, if he were to 
reveal in public just how little a rich man like him had contributed.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this promoter of charity 
said to the Buddha, <FONT color=#ff8040>"Venerable Sir, this charity is a joint 
offering of all; whether one has given much or little is of no account; each one 
of us has given in faith and generosity; so may all of us gain equal merit." 
</FONT>When he heard those words, Bilalpadaka realized that he had wronged the 
man and pondered that if he were not to own up his mistake and ask the promoter 
of charity to pardon him, he would he reborn in one of the four lower worlds 
(apayas). So he said, <FONT color=#0000ff>"My friend, I have done you a great 
wrong by thinking ill of you; please forgive me." </FONT>The Buddha heard the 
rich man asking for pardon, and on enquiry found out the reason. So, the Buddha 
said, <I><FONT color=#800040>"My disciple, you should not think lightly of a 
good deed, however small it may be, for small deeds will become big if you do 
them habitually."</FONT></I></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mahadhana was a rich merchant 
from Savatthi. On one occasion, five hundred robbers were planning to rob him, 
but thy did not get the chance to rob him. In the meantime, they heard that the 
merchant would soon be going out with five hundred carts loaded with valuable 
merchandise. The merchant Mahadhana also invited the bhikkhus who would like to 
go on the same journey to accompany him, and he promised to look to their needs 
on the way. So five hundred bhikkhus accompanied him. The robbers got news of 
the trip and went ahead to lie in wait for the caravan of the merchant. But the 
merchant stopped at the outskirts of the forest where the robbers were waiting. 
The caravan was to move on after camping there for a few days. The robbers got 
the news of the impending departure and made ready to loot the caravan; the 
merchant, in his turn, also got news of the movements of the bandits and he 
decided to return home. The bandits now heard that the merchant would go home; 
so they waited on the homeward way. Some villagers sent word to the merchant 
about the movements of the bandits, and the merchant finally decided to remain 
in the village for some time. When he told the bhikkhus about his decision, the 
bhikkhus returned to Savatthi by themselves. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On arrival at the Jetavana 
monastery they went to the Buddha and informed him about the cancellation of 
their trip. To then, the Buddha said, <FONT color=#0000ff>"Bhikkhus, Mahadhana

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the Veluvana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (124) of this book, with reference to the 
hunter Kukkutamitta and his family.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Rajagaha there was once a 
rich man's daughter who had attained Sotapatti Fruition as a young girl. One 
day, Kukkutamitta, a hunter, came into town in a cart to sell venison. Seeing 
Kukkutamitta the hunter, the rich young lady fell in love with him immediately; 
she followed him, married him and lived with him in a small village. As a result 
of that marriage, seven sons were born to them and in course of time, all the 
sons got married. One day, the Buddha surveyed the world early in the morning 
with his supernormal power and found that the hunter, his seven sons and their 
wives were due for attainment of Sotapatti Fruition. So, the Buddha went to the 
place where the hunter had set his trap in the forest. He put his footprint 
close to the trap and seated himself under the shade of a bush, not far from the 
trap.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the hunter came, he saw no 
animal in the trap; he saw the footprint and surmised that someone must have 
come before him and let cut the animal. So, when he saw the Buddha under the 
shade of the bush, he took him for the man who had freed the animal from his 
trap and flew into a rage. He took out his bow and arrow to shoot at the Buddha, 
but as he drew his bow, he became immobilized and remained fixed in that 
position like a statue. His sons followed and found their father; they also saw 
the Buddha at some distance and thought he must he the enemy of their father. 
All of them took out their bows and arrows to shoot at the Buddha, but they also 
became immobilized and remained fixed in their respective postures. When the 
hunter and his sons failed to return, the hunter's wife followed them into the 
forest, with her seven daughters-in-law. Seeing her husband and all her sons 
with their arrows aimed at the Buddha, she raised both her hands and shout: 
<FONT color=#ff8040>"Do not kill my father."</FONT> </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When her husband heard her 
words, he thought,<FONT color=#0000ff> "This must be my father-in-law",</FONT> 
and her sons thought, <FONT color=#8000ff>"This must be our grandfather";</FONT> 
and thoughts of loving-kindness came into them. Then the lady said to them, 
<FONT color=#ff8040>''Put away your bows and arrows and pay obeisance to my 
father". </FONT>The Buddha realized that, by this time, the minds of the hunter 
and his son; had softened and so he willed that they should be able to move and 
to put away their bows and arrows. After putting away their bows and arrows, 
they pad obeisance to the Buddha and the Buddha expounded the Dhamma to them. In 
the end, the hunter, his seven sons and seven daughters-in-law, all fifteen of 
them, attained Sotapatti Fruition. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Buddha returned to the 
monastery and told Thera Ananda and other bhikkhus about the hunter Kukkutamitta 
and his family attaining Sotapatti Fruition in the early part of the morning. 
The bhikkhus then asked the Buddha, <FONT color=#800000>"Venerable Sir, is the 
wife of the hunter who is a sotapanna, also not guilty of taking life, if she 
has been getting things like nets, bows and arrows for her husband when he goes 
out hunting?" </FONT>To this question her Buddha answered,<FONT color=#0000ff> 
<FONT color=#800040><I>"Bhikkhus, the sotapannas do not kill, they do not wish 
others to get killed. The wife of the hunter was only obeying her husband in

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One morning, as Koka was going

alms-food. He took that as a bad omen and grumbled to himself, <FONT

anything today," </FONT>and he went on his way. As expected by him he did not 
get anything. On his way home also he again saw the same bhikkhu returning to 
the monastery after having had his alms-food in the city, and the hunter became 
very angry. So he set his hounds on the bhikkhu. Swiftly, the bhikkhu climbed up 
a tree to a level just out of reach of the hounds. Then the hunter went to the 
foot of the tree and pricked the heels of the bhikkhu with the tip of his arrow. 
The bhikkhu was in great pain and was not able to hold his robes on; so the 
robes slipped off his body on to the hunter who was at the foot of the tree.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dogs seeing the yellow robe 
thought that the bhikkhu had fallen off the tree and pounced on the body, biting 
and pulling at it furiously. The bhikkhu, from his shelter in the tree, broke a 
dry branch and threw it at the dogs. Then the dogs discovered that they had been 
attacking their own master instead of the bhikkhu, and ran away into the forest. 
The bhikkhu came down from the tree and found that the hunter had died and felt 
sorry for him. He also wondered whether he could be held responsible for the 
death, since the hunter had died for having been covered up by his yellow robes.

name=theratissa>Thera Tissa</A></FONT></B> </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (126) of this book, with reference to Thera 
Tissa.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, there was a gem polisher 
and his wife in Savatthi; there was also a thera, who was an arahat. Every day, 
the couple offered alms-food to the thera. One day, while the gem polisher was 
handling meat, a messenger of King Pasenadi of Kosala arrived with a ruby, which 
was to be cut and polished and sent back to the king. The gem polisher took the 
ruby with his hand which was covered with blood, put it on a table and went into 
the house to wash his hands. The pet crane of the family seeing the blood 
stained ruby and taking it for a piece of meat picked it up and swallowed it in 
the presence of the thera. When the gem polisher returned, he found that the 
ruby was missing. He asked his wife and his son and they answered that they had 
not taken it. Then, he asked the thera and the thera said that he did not take 
it; but he was not satisfied. As there was no one else in the house, the gem 
polisher concluded that it must be the thera who had taken the precious ruby: so 
he told his wife that he must torture the thera to get admission of theft.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But his wife replied, <FONT 
color=#0000ff>"This thera had been our guide and teacher for the last twelve 
years, and we have never seen him doing anything evil; please do not accuse the 
thera. It would be better to take the king's punishment than to accuse a noble 
one."</FONT> But her husband paid no heed to her words; he took a rope and tied 
up the thera and beat him many times with a stick, as a result of which the 
thera bled profusely from the head, ears and nose, and dropped on the floor. The 
crane, seeing blood and wishing to take it, came close to the thera. The gem 
polisher, who was by then in a great rage, kicked the crane with all his might 
and the bird died instantaneously. Then, the thera said, <FONT 
color=#ff8040>"Please see whether the crane is dead or not," </FONT>and the gem 
polisher replied, <FONT color=#ff0080>"You too shall die like this crane." 
</FONT>When the thera was sure the crane had died, he said softly, <FONT 
color=#ff8040>"My disciple, the crane swallowed the ruby."</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing this, the gem polisher cut up the 
crane and found the ruby in the stomach. Then the gem polisher realized his 
mistake and trembled with fear. He pleaded with the thera to pardon him and also 
to continue standing at his door for alms. To him the thera replied, <FONT 
color=#ff8040>"My disciple, it is not your fault, nor is it mine. This has 
happened on account of what has been done in our previous existences; it is just 
our debt in samsara; I feel no ill will towards you. As a matter of fact, this 
has happened because I have entered a house. From today, I would not enter any 
house; I would only stand at the door."</FONT> Soon after saying this, the thera 
expired as a result of his injuries. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, the bhikkhus asked the Buddha where the 
various characters in the above episode were reborn, and the Buddha 
answered,<I><FONT color=#800040> "The crane was reborn as the son of the gem 
polisher; the gem polisher was reborn in niraya; the wife of the gem polisher 
was reborn in one of the deva worlds; and the thera, who was already an arahat 
when he was living, realized Parinibbana."</FONT></I> </P>
<P align=center>Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:</P>

<P align=center>Verse 127: IX (11) </P>
<P align=center><B><FONT color=#0000ff size=+2>The Story of <A 
name=threegroupsof>Three Groups of Persons</A></FONT></B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (127) of this book, with reference to 
questions raised by three groups of bhikkhus concerning three extraordinary 
incidents.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first group: A group of 
bhikkhus were on their way to pay homage to the Buddha and they stopped at a 
village on the way. Some people were cooking alms-food for those bhikkhus when 
one of the houses caught fire and a ring of fire flew up into the air. At that 
moment, a crow came flying, got caught in the ring of fire and dropped dead in 
the central part of the village. The bhikkhus seeing the dead crow observed that 
only the Buddha would be able to explain for what evil deed this crow had to die 
in this manner. After taking alms-food they continued on their journey to pay 
homage to the Buddha, and also to ask about the unfortunate crow. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second group: Another group 
of bhikkhus wore travelling in a boat; they too wore on their way to pay homage 
to the Buddha. When they were in the middle of the ocean the boat could not be 
moved. So, lots were drawn to find out who the unlucky one was; three times the 
lot fell on the wife of the skipper. Then the skipper said sorrowfully,<FONT 
color=#ff0080> "Many people should not die on account of this unlucky woman; tie 
a pot of sand to her neck and threw her into the water so that I would not see 
her."</FONT> The woman was thrown into the sea as instructed by the skipper and 
the ship could move on. On arrival at their destination. the bhikkhus 
disembarked and continued on their way to the Buddha. They also intended to ask 
the Buddha due to what evil kamma the unfortunate woman was thrown overboard. 
</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third group: A group of 
seven bhikkhus were also on their way to pay homage to the Buddha. On the way, 
they enquired at a monastery whether there was any suitable place for them to 
take shelter for the night in the neighbourhood. They were directed to a cave, 
and there they spent the night; but in the middle of the night, a large boulder 
slipped off from above and effectively closed the entrance. In the morning, the 
bhikkhus from the nearby monastery coming to the cave saw what had happened and 
they went to bring people from seven villages. With the help of these people 
they tried to move the boulder, but it was of no avail. Thus, the seven bhikkhus 
were trapped in the cave without food or water for seven days. On the seventh 
day, the boulder moved miraculously by itself, and the bhikkhus came out and 
continued their way to the Buddha. They also intended to ask the Buddha due to 
what previous evil deed they were thus shut up for seven days in a cave. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The three groups of travellers 
met on the way and together they went to the Buddha. Each group related to the 
Buddha what they had seen or experienced on their way and the Buddha answered 
their questions. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha answer to the first 
group: <I><FONT color=#800040>"Bhikkhus, once there was a farmer who had an ox. 
The ox was very lazy and also very stubborn. It could not be coaxed to do any 
work; it would lie down chewing the cud or else go to sleep. The farmer lost his 
temper many times on account of this lazy, stubborn animal; so in anger he tied 
a straw rope round the neck of the ox and set fire to it, and the ox died. On 
account of this evil deed the, farmer had suffered for a long time in niraya. 
and in serving out the remaining part of his punishment, he had been burnt to 
death in the last seven existences."</FONT></I> </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha's answer to the 
second group:<I><FONT color=#800040> "Bhikkhus, once there was a woman who had a 
pet dog. She used to take the dog along with her wherever she went and young 
boys of the city poked fun at her. She was very angry and felt so ashamed that 
she planned to kill the dog. She filled a pot with sand, tied it round the neck 
of the dog and threw it into the water; and the dog was drowned. On account of 
this evil deed that woman had suffered for a long time in niraya and in serving 
the remaining part of her punishment, she had been thrown into the water to 
drown in the last one hundred existences." </FONT></I></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha's answer to the third 
group:<I><FONT color=#800040> "Bhikkhus, once, seven cowherds saw an iguana 
going into a mound and they dosed all the seven outlets of the mound with twigs 
and branches of trees. After closing the outlets they went away, completely 
forgetting the iguana that was trapped in the mound. Only after seven days, they 
remembered what they had done and hurriedly returned to the scene of their 
mischief and let out the iguana. On account of this evil deed, those seven had 
been imprisoned together for seven days without any food, in the last fourteen 
existences." </FONT></I></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, a bhikkhu remarked, <FONT 
color=#ff8040>"O indeed! There is no escape from evil consequences for one who 
has done evil, even if he were in the sky, or in the ocean, or in a 
cave."</FONT> To him, the Buddha said,<I><FONT color=#800040> "Yes, Bhikkhu! You 
are right; even in the sky or anywhere else, there is no place which is beyond 
the reach of evil consequences." </FONT></I></P>

<P align=center>Verse 128: IX (12)</P>
<P align=center><B><FONT color=#0000ff size=+2>The Story of <A 
name=kingsuppabuddaha>King Suppabuddha </A></FONT></B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at the 
Nigrodharama monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (128) of this book, with 
reference to King Suppabuddha.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; King Suppabuddha was the father 
of Devadatta and father-in-law of Prince Siddhattha who later became Gotama 
Buddha. King Suppabuddha was very antagonistic to the Buddha for two reasons. 
First, because as prince Siddhattha he had left his wife Yasodhara, the daughter 
of King Suppabuddha, to renounce the world; and secondly, because his son 
Devadatta, who was admitted into the Order by Gotama Buddha, had come to regard 
the Buddha as his arch enemy. One day, knowing that the Buddha would be coming 
for alms-food, he got himself drunk and blocked the way. When the Buddha and the 
bhikkhus came, Suppabuddha refused to make way, and sent a message saying, <FONT 
color=#0000ff>"I cannot give way to Samana Gotama, who is so much younger than 
me." </FONT>Finding the road blocked, the Buddha and the bhikkhus turned back. 
Suppabuddha then sent someone to follow the Buddha secretly and find out what 
the Buddha said, and to report to him. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Buddha turned back, he 
said to Ananda, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Ananda, because King Suppabuddha had 
refused to give way to me, on the seventh day from now he would be swallowed up 
by the earth, at the foot of the steps leading to the pinnacled hall of his 
palace." </FONT></I>The king's spy heard these words and reported to the king. 
And the king said that he would not go near those steps and would prove the 
words of the Buddha to be wrong. Further, he instructed his men to remove those 
steps, so that he would not be able to use them; he also kept some men on duty, 
with instructions to hold him back should he go in the direction of the stairs. 
</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Buddha was told about 
the king's instructions to his men, he said, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Bhikkhus! 
Whether King Suppabuddha lives in a pinnacled tower, or up in the sky, or in an 
ocean, or in a cave, my word cannot go wrong; King Suppabuddha will be swallowed 
up by the earth at the very place I have told you."</FONT></I> </P>
<P align=center>Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows: </P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the seventh day, about the 
time of the alms meal the royal horse got frightened for some unknown reason and 
started neighing loudly and kicking about furiously. Hearing frightening noises 
from his horse, the king felt that he must handle his pet horse and forgetting 
all precautions, he started towards the door. The door opened of its own accord, 
the steps which had been pulled down earlier were also there, his men forgot to 
stop him from going down. So the king went down the stairs and as soon as he 
stepped on the earth, it opened and swallowed him up and dragged him right down 
to Avici Niraya.</P>
