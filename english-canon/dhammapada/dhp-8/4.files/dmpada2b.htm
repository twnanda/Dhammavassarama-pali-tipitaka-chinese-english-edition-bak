<P align=center>III (1)<B><FONT color=#0000ff> The Story of Thera<A

<P align=justify>While residing on the Calika Mountain, the Buddha uttered 
Verses (33) and (34) of this book, with reference to Thera Meghiya.</P>
<P align=justify>At that time, Thera Meghiya was attending upon the Buddha. On 
one occasion, on his return from alms-round, the thera noticed a pleasant and 
beautiful mango grove, which he thought was an ideal spot for meditation. He 
asked the Buddha's permission to let him go there, but as the Buddha was alone 
at that time, he was told to wait for awhile until the arrival of some other 
bhikkhus. The thera was in a hurry to go and so he repeated his request again 
and again, until finally the Buddha told him to do as he wished.</P>
<P align=justify>Thus, Thera Meghiya set out for the mango grove, sat at the 
foot of a tree and practised meditation. He stayed there the whole day, but his 
mind kept wandering and he made no progress. He returned in the evening and 
reported to the Buddha how all the time he was assailed by thoughts associated 
with the senses, ill will and cruelty ( kama vitakka, byapada vitakka and 
vihimsa vitakka).</P>
<P align=justify>So, the Buddha told him that as the mind is easily excitable 
and fickle, one should control one's mind.</P>
<P align=center>Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:</P>

<P align=center><B>III (2) The Story of a <A name=CertainBhikkhu>Certain 
Bhikkhu</A></B></P>
<P align=justify>While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered 
Verse (35) of this book, with reference to a certain bhikkhu.</P>
<P align=justify>On one occasion, sixty bhikkhus, after obtaining a subject of 
meditation from the Buddha, went to Matika village, at the foot of a mountain. 
There, Matikamata, mother of the village headman, offered them alms-food; she 
also built a monastery for them, so that they could stay in the village during 
the rainy season. One day she asked the group of bhikkhus to teach her the 
practice of meditation. They taught her how to meditate on the thirty-two 
constituents of the body leading to the awareness of the decay and dissolution 
of the body. Matikamata practised with diligence and attained the three Maggas 
and Phalas together with Analytical Insight and mundane supernormal powers, even 
before the bhikkhus did.</P>
<P align=justify>Rising from the bliss of the Magga and Phala she looked with 
the Divine Power of Sight (Dibbacakkhu) and saw that the bhikkhus had not 
attained any of the Maggas yet. She also learnt that those bhikkhus had enough 
potentiality for the attainment of arahatship, but that they needed proper food. 
So, she prepared good, choice food for them. With proper food and right effort, 
the bhikkhus developed right concentration and eventually attained 
arahatship.</P>
<P align=justify>At the end of the rainy season, the bhikkhus returned to the 
Jetavana monastery, where the Buddha was in residence. They reported to the 
Buddha that all of them were in good health and in comfortable circumstances and 
that they did not have to worry about food. They also mentioned about Matikamata 
who was aware of their thoughts and prepared and offered them the very food they 
wished for.</P>
<P align=justify>A certain bhikkhu, hearing them talking about Matikamata, 
decided that he, too, would go to that village. So, taking a subject of 
meditation from the Buddha he arrived at the village monastery. There, he found 
that everything he wished for was sent to him by Matikamata, the lay-devotee. 
When he wished her to come she personally came to the monastery, bringing along 
choice food with her. After taking the food, he asked her if he knew the 
thoughts of others, but she evaded his question and replied, "People who can 
read the thoughts of others behave in such and such a way." Then, the bhikkhu 
thought, "Should I, like an ordinary worldling, entertain any impure thought, 
she is sure to find out." He therefore got scared of the lay-devotee and decided 
to return to the Jetavana monastery. He told the Buddha that he could not stay 
in Matika village because he was afraid that the lay-devotee might detect impure 
thoughts in him. The Buddha then asked him to observe just one thing; that is, 
to control his mind. The Buddha also told the bhikkhu to return to Matika 
village monastery, and not to think of anything else, but the object of his 
meditation only. The bhikkhu went back. The lay-devotee offered him good food as 
she had done to others before, so that he might able to practise meditation 
without worry. Within a short time, he, too, attained arahatship.</P>
<P align=center>With reference to this bhikkhu, the Buddha spoke in verse as 
follows:</P>

<P align=justify>While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered 
Verse (36) of this book, with reference to a young disgruntled bhikkhu who was 
the son of a banker.</P>
<P align=justify>Once, there lived in Savatthi, the son of a banker. This young 
man asked the bhikkhu, who used to come to his house for alms, what he should do 
to be liberated from the ills of life. The bhikkhu instructed him to divide his 
property into three parts; one part to do business with, one part to support the 
family and one part to give in charity. He did as he was told and again asked 
what else should be done next. So he was further instructed; first to take 
refuge in the Three Gems* and to observe the five precepts; secondly, to observe 
the ten precepts; and thirdly, to renounce the world and enter the Buddhist 
religious Order. The young man complied with all these instructions and became a 
bhikkhu.</P>
<P align=justify>As a bhikkhu, he was taught the Abhidhamma** by one teacher and 
the Vinaya by another. Being taught in this way, he felt that there was too much 
to be learnt, that the disciplinary rules were too strict and too many, so much 
so that there was not enough freedom even to stretch out one's hands. He thought 
that it might be better to return to the life of a householder. As a result of 
doubt and discontent, he became unhappy and neglected his duties; he also became 
thin and emaciated. When the Buddha came to know about this, he said to the 
young bhikkhu, "if you can only control your mind, you will have nothing more to 
control; so guard your own mind."</P>

<P align=justify>While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered 
Verse (37) of this book, with reference to the nephew of Thera Samgharakkhita. 
</P>
<P align=justify>Once, there lived in Savatthi, a senior bhikkhu by the name of 
Samgharakkhita. When his sister gave birth to a son, she named the child after 
the thera and he came to be known as Samgharakkhita Bhagineyya. The nephew 
Samgharakkhita, in due course, was admitted into the Order. While the young 
bhikkhu was staying in a village monastery he was offered two sets of robes, and 
he intended to offer one to his uncle, the thera.</P>
<P align=justify>At the end of the vassa he went to his uncle to pay respect to 
him and offered the robe to the thera. But, the uncle declined to accept the 
robe, saying that he had enough. Although he repeated his request, the thera 
would not accept. The young bhikkhu felt disheartened and thought that since his 
uncle was so unwilling to share the requisites with him, it would be better for 
him to leave the Order and live the life of a layman.</P>
<P align=justify>From that point, his mind wandered and a train of thoughts 
followed. He thought that after leaving the Order he would sell the robe and buy 
a she-goat; that she-goat would breed quickly and soon he would make enough 
money to enable him to marry; his wife would give birth to a son. He would take 
his wife and child in a small cart to visit his uncle at the monastery. On the 
way, he would say that he would carry the child; she would tell him to drive the 
cart and not to bother about the child. He would insist and grab the child from 
her; between them the child would drop on the cart-track and the wheel would 
pass over the child. He would get so furious with his wife that he would strike 
her with the goading-stick.</P>
<P align=justify>At that time he was fanning the thera with a palmyra fan and he 
absentmindedly struck the head of the thera with the fan. The thera, knowing the 
thoughts of the young bhikkhu, said, "You were unable to beat your wife; why 
have you beaten an old bhikkhu ?" Young Samgharakkhita was very much surprised 
and embarrassed at the words of the old bhikkhu; he also became extremely 
frightened. So he fled. Young bhikkhus and novices of the monastery chased him 
and finally took him to the presence of the Buddha.</P>
<P align=justify>When told about the whole episode, the Buddha said that the 
mind has the ability to think of an object even though it might be far away, and 
that one should strive hard for liberation from the bondage of passion, ill will 
and ignorance.</P>
<P align=center>Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:</P>

<P align=center>III (5)<B>The Story of Thera<A 
name=Cittahattha>Cittahattha</A></B></P>
<P align=justify>While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered 
Verses (38) and (39) of this book, with reference to Thera Cittahattha.</P>
<P align=justify>A man from Savatthi, after looking for his lost ox in the 
forest, felt very hungry and went to a village monastery, where he was given the 
remains of the morning meal. While taking his food, it occurred to him that even 
though he worked hard every day he could not get such good food and that it 
might be a good idea to become a bhikkhu. So he asked the bhikkhus to admit him 
into the Order. At the monastery, he performed the duties of a bhikkhu and as 
there was plenty of food he soon gained weight. After some time, he got weary of 
going round for alms-food and returned to the life of a lay man. A few days 
later, he felt that life at home was too strenuous and he went back to the 
monastery to be admitted as a bhikkhu for a second time. For a second time, he 
left the Order and returned to home-life. Again, he went back to the monastery 
for a third time and left it. This shuttling process went on for six times, and 
because he acted only according to his whims he was known as Thera Cittahattha. 
</P>
<P align=justify>While he was going back and forth between his home and the 
monastery, his wife became pregnant. One day, during his last stay at home, he 
happened to enter the bedroom while his wife was asleep. She was almost naked as 
the clothes she was wearing had partially fallen off. She was also snoring 
loudly through her nose and mouth and saliva was trickling down her mouth. Thus, 
with her mouth open and her bloated stomach, she looked just like a corpse. 
Seeing her thus, he instantly came to perceive the impermanent and unpleasant 
nature of the body, and he reflected, "I have been a bhikkhu for several times 
and it is only because of this woman that I have not been able to remain as a 
bhikkhu." Hence, taking the yellow robe with him he left his home for the 
monastery for the seventh time. As he went along he repeated the words 
"impermanence" and "unpleasantness" (anicca and dukkha) and thus attained 
Sotapatti Fruition on the way to the monastery.</P>
<P align=justify>On arrival at the monastery he asked the bhikkhus to admit him 
into the Order. They refused and said, "We cannot admit you as a bhikkhu. You 
have been shaving your head so often that your head is like a whetting stone." 
Still, he entreated them to admit him into the Order just once more and they 
complied. Within a few days, the bhikkhu Cittahattha attained arahatship 
together with Analytical Insight. Other bhikkhus, seeing him staying on for a 
long time in the monastery, were surprised and they asked him the reason why. To 
this, he replied. "I went home when I still had attachment in me, but now that 
attachment has been cut off" The bhikkhus, not believing him, approached the 
Buddha and reported the matter. To them, the Buddha said, "Thera Cittahattha was 
speaking the truth; he shifted between home and monastery before because at that 
time, his mind was not steadfast and he did not understand the Dhamma. But at 
this moment, Thera Cittahattha is already an arahat; he has discarded both good 
and evil."</P>

<P align=justify>While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered 
Verse (40) of this book, with reference to five hundred bhikkhus.</P>
<P align=justify>Five hundred bhikkhus from Savatthi, after obtaining a subject 
of meditation from the Buddha, travelled for a distance of one hundred yojanas* 
away from Savatthi and came to a large forest grove, a suitable place for 
meditation practice. The guardian spirits of the trees dwelling in that forest 
thought that if those bhikkhus were staying in the forest, it would not be 
proper for them to live with their families in the trees. So they descended from 
the trees, thinking that the bhikkhus would stop there only for one night. But 
the bhikkhus were still there at the end of a fortnight; then it occurred to 
them that the bhikkhus might be staying there till the end of the vassa. In that 
case, they and their families would have to be living on the ground for a long 
time. So, they decided to frighten away the bhikkhus, by making ghostly sounds 
and frightful apparitions. They showed up with bodies without heads, and with 
heads without bodies, etc. The bhikkhus were very upset and left the place and 
returned to the Buddha, to whom they related everything. On hearing their 
account, the Buddha told them that this had happened because previously they 
went without any weapon and that they should go back there armed with a suitable 
weapon. So saying, the Buddha taught them the entire Metta Sutta (discourse on 
Loving-Kindness) beginning with the following stanza:</P>
<P align=center><B><FONT color=#800040>Karaniyamattha kusalena</FONT></B> </P>

<P align=center><B><FONT color=#800040>Suvaco c'assa mudu

<P align=justify>[The above stanza may be translated as follows: He who is 
skilled in (acquiring) what is good and beneficial, (mundane as well as 
supra-mundane), aspiring to attain Perfect Peace (Nibbana) should act (thus): He 
should be efficient, upright, perfectly upright, compliant, gentle and free from 
conceit.]</P>
<P align=justify>The bhikkhus were instructed to recite the sutta from the time 
they came to the outskirts of the forest grove and to enter the monastery 
reciting the same. The bhikkhus returned to the forest grove and did as they 
were told. The guardian spirits of the trees receiving loving-kindness from the 
bhikkhus reciprocated by readily welcoming and not harming them. There were no 
more ghostly sounds and ungainly sights. Thus left in peace, the bhikkhus 
meditated on the body and came to realize its fragile and impermanent nature. 
</P>
<P align=justify>From the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha, by his supernormal 
power, learned about the progress of the bhikkhus and sent forth his radiance 
making them feel his presence. To them he said, "Bhikkhus just as you have 
realized, the body is, indeed, impermanent.</P>

<P align=justify>While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered 
Verse (41) of this book, with reference to Thera Tissa.</P>
<P align=justify>After taking a subject of meditation from the Buddha, Thera 
Tissa was diligently practising meditation when he was afflicted with a disease. 
Small boils appeared all over his body and these developed into big sores. When 
these sores burst, his upper and lower robes became sticky and stained with pus 
and blood, and his whole body was stinking. For this reason, he was known as 
Putigattatissa, Tissa the thera with stinking body.</P>
<P align=justify>As the Buddha surveyed the universe with the light of his own 
intellect, the thera appeared in his vision. He saw the sorrowful state of the 
thera, who had been abandoned by his resident pupils on account of his stinking 
body. At the same time, he also knew that Tissa would soon attain arahatship. 
So, the Buddha proceeded to the fire-shed, close to the place where the thera 
was staying. There, he boiled some water, and then going, to where the thera was 
lying down, took hold of the edge of the couch. It was then only that the 
resident pupils gathered round the thera, and as instructed by the Buddha, they 
carried the thera to the fire-shed, where he was washed and bathed. While he was 
being bathed, his upper and lower robes were washed and dried. After the bath, 
the thera became fresh in body and mind and soon developed one-pointedness of 
concentration. Standing at the head of the couch, the Buddha said to him that 
this body when devoid of life would be as useless as a log and would be laid on 
the earth.</P>

<P align=justify>While on a visit to a village in the kingdom of Kosala, the 
Buddha uttered Verse (42) of this book, with reference to Nanda, the herdsman. 
</P>
<P align=justify>Nanda was a herdsman who looked after the cows of 
Anathapindika. Although only a herdsman, he had some means of his own. 
Occasionally, he would go to the house of Anathapindika and there he sometimes 
met the Buddha and listened to his discourses. Nanda requested the Buddha to pay 
a visit to his house. But the Buddha did not go to Nanda's house immediately, 
saying that it was not yet time.</P>
<P align=justify>After some time, while travelling with his followers, the 
Buddha went off his route to visit Nanda, knowing that the time was ripe for 
Nanda to receive his teaching properly. Nanda respectfully received the Buddha 
and his followers; he served them milk and milk products and other choice food 
for seven days. On the last day, after hearing the discourse given by the 
Buddha, Nanda attained Sotapatti Fruition. As the Buddha was leaving that day, 
Nanda carrying the bowl of the Buddha, followed him for some distance, paid 
obeisance and turned back to go home.</P>
<P align=justify>At that instant, a hunter who was an old enemy of Nanda, shot 
him down. The bhikkhus who were following the Buddha, saw Nanda lying dead. They 
reported the matter to the Buddha, saying, "Venerable Sir, because you came 
here, Nanda who made great offerings to you and accompanied you on your return 
was killed as he was turning back to go home." To them, the Buddha replied, 
"Bhikkhus, whether I came here or not, there was no escape from death for him, 
as a wrongly directed mind can do oneself much greater harm than an enemy or a 
thief can."</P>

<P align=justify>On one occasion, Soreyya accompanied by a friend and some 
attendants was going out in a luxurious carriage for a bath. At that moment, 
Thera Mahakaccayana was adjusting his robes outside the city, as he was going 
into the city of Soreyya for alms-food. The youth Soreyya, seeing the golden 
complexion of the thera, thought, "How I wish the thera were my wife, or else 
that the complexion of my wife were like that of his." As the wish arose in him, 
his sex changed and he became a woman. Very much ashamed, he got down from the 
carriage and ran away, taking the road to Taxila. His companions missing him, 
looked for him, but could not find him.</P>
<P align=justify>Soreyya, now a woman, offered her signet ring to some people 
going to Taxila, to allow her to go along with them in their carriage. On 
arrival at Taxila, her companions told a young rich man of Taxila about the lady 
who came along with them. The young rich man, finding her to be very beautiful 
and of a suitable age for him, married her. As a result of this marriage two 
sons were born; there were also two sons from the previous marriage of Soreyya 
as a man.</P>
<P align=justify>One day, a rich man's son from the city of Soreyya came to 
Taxila with five hundred carts. Lady-Soreyya recognizing him to be an old friend 
sent for him. The man from Soreyya city was surprised that he was invited, 
because he did not know the lady who invited him. He told the lady-Soreyya that 
he did not know her, and asked her whether she knew him. She answered that she 
knew him and also enquired after the health of her family and other people in 
Soreyya city. The man from Soreyya city next told her about the rich man's son 
who disappeared mysteriously while going out for a bath. Then the Lady-Soreyya 
revealed her identity and related all that had happened, about the wrongful 
thoughts with regard to Thera Mahakaccayana, about the change of sex, and her 
marriage to the young rich man of Taxila. The man from the city of Soreyya then 
advised the lady-Soreyya to ask pardon of the thera. Thera Mahakaccayana was 
accordingly invited to the home of Soreyya and alms-food was offered to him. 
After the meal, the lady-Soreyya was brought to the presence of the thera, and 
the man from Soreyya told the thera that the lady was at one time the son of a 
rich man from Soreyya city. He then explained to the thera how Soreyya was 
turned into a female on account of his wrongful thoughts towards the respected 
thera. Lady-Soreyya then respectfully asked pardon of Thera Mahakaccayana. The 
thera then said, "Get up, I forgive you." As soon as these words were spoken, 
the woman was changed back to a man. Soreyya then pondered how within a single 
existence and with a single body he had undergone change of sex and how sons 
were born to him, etc. And feeling very weary and repulsive of all these things, 
he decided to leave the household life and joined the Order under the thera.</P>
<P align=justify>After that, he was often asked, "Whom do you love more, the two 
sons you had as a man or the other two you had as a wife?" To them, he would 
answer that his love for those born of the womb was greater. This question was 
put to him so often, he felt very much annoyed and ashamed. So he stayed by 
himself and with diligence, contemplated the decay and dissolution of the body. 
He soon attained arahatship together with the Analytical Insight. When the old 
question was next put to him he replied that he had no affection for any one in 
particular. Other bhikkhus hearing him thought he must be telling a lie. When 
reported about Soreyya giving a different answer, the Buddha said, "My son is 
not telling lies, he is speaking the truth. His answer now is different because 
he has now realized arahatship and so has no more affection for anyone in 
particular. By his well-directed mind my son has brought about in himself a 
well-being which neither the father nor the mother can bestow on him."</P>
<P align=center>Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:</P>
