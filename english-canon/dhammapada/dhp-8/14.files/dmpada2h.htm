      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at 
      the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (167) of this book, with 
      reference to a young bhikkhu.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, a young 
      bhikkhu accompanied an older bhikkhu to the house of Visakha. After taking 
      rice gruel, the elder bhikkhu left for another place, leaving the young 
      bhikkhu behind at the house of Visakha. The granddaughter of Visakha was 
      filtering some water for the young bhikkhu, and when she saw her own 
      reflection in the big water pot she smiled. Seeing her thus smiling, the 
      young bhikkhu looked at her and he also smiled. When she saw the young 
      bhikkhu looking at her and smiling at her, she lost her temper, and cried 
      out angrily, <FONT color=#0000ff>"You, a shaven head! Why are you smiling 
      at me ?" </FONT>The young bhikkhu reported, <FONT color=#804000>"You are a 
      shaven head yourself; your mother and your father are also shaven heads!" 
      </FONT>Thus, they quarrelled, and the young girl went weeping to her 
      grandmother. Visakha came and said to the young bhikkhu,<FONT 
      color=#ff8040> "Please do not get angry with my grand daughter. But, a 
      bhikkhu does have his hair shaved, his finger nails and toe nails cut, and 
      putting on a robe which is made up of cut pieces, he goes on alms-round 
      with a bowl which is rimless. What this young girl said was, in a way, 
      quite right, is it not?"</FONT> The young bhikkhu replied. <FONT 
      color=#804000>"It is true but why should she abuse me on that account ?" 
      </FONT>At this point, the elder bhikkhu returned; but both Visakha and the 
      old bhikkhu failed to appease the young bhikkhu and the young girl.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after this, the 
      Buddha arrived and learned about the quarrel. The Buddha knew that time 
      was ripe for the young bhikkhu to attain Sotapatti Fruition. Then, in 
      order to make the young bhikkhu more responsive to his words, he seemingly 
      sided with him and said to Visakha, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Visakha, what 
      reason is there for your grand daughter to address my son as a shaven head 
      just because he has his head shaven? After all, he had his head shaven to 
      enter my Order, didn't he?"</FONT></I></P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearing these words, 
      the young bhikkhu went down on his knees, paid obeisance to the Buddha, 
      and said,<FONT color=#804000> "Venerable Sir! You alone understans me; 
      neither my teacher nor the great donor of the monastery understands 
      me."</FONT> The Buddha knew that the bhikkhu was then in a receptive mood 
      and so he said, <I><FONT color=#800040>"To smile with sensual desire is 
      ignoble; it is not right and proper to have ignoble thoughts."</FONT></I> 
      </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Buddha 
      spoke in verse as follows:</P>

    <TD vAlign=top align=left>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at 
      the Nigrodharama monastery, the Buddha uttered Verses (168) and (169) of 
      this book, with reference to King Suddhodana, father of Gotama Buddha.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Buddha 
      revisited Kapilavatthu for the first time he stayed at the Nigrodharama 
      monastery. There, he expounded the Dhamma to his relatives. King 
      Suddhodana thought that Gotama Buddha, who was his own son, would go to no 
      other place, but would surely come to his palace for alms-food the next 
      day; but he did not specifically invite the Buddha to come for alms-food. 
      However, the next day, he prepared alms-food for twenty thousand bhikkhus. 
      On that morning the Buddha went on his alms-round with a retinue of 
      bhikkhus, as was the custom of all the Buddhas.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yasodhara, wife of 
      Prince Siddhattha before he renounced the world, saw the Buddha going on 
      an alms-round, from the palace window. She informed her father-in-law, 
      King Suddhodana, and the King went in great haste to the Buddha. The king 
      told the Buddha that for a member of the royal Khattiya family, to go 
      round begging for food from door to door was a disgrace. Whereupon the 
      Buddha replied that it was the custom of all the Buddhas to go round for 
      alms-food from house to house, and therefore it was right and proper for 
      him to keep up the tradition.</P>

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On one occasion, 
      five hundred bhikkhus, after taking a subject of meditation from the 
      Buddha, went into the forest to practise meditation. But they made very 
      little progress; so they returned to the Buddha to ask for a more suitable 
      subject of meditation. On their way to the Buddha, seeing a mirage they 
      meditated on it. As soon as they entered the compound of the monastery, a 
      storm broke out; as big drops of rain fell, bubbles were formed on the 
      ground and soon disappeared. Seeing those bubbles, the bhikkhus reflected 
      <FONT color=#ff8040>"This body of ours is perishable like the 
      bubbles"</FONT>, and perceived the impermanent nature of the aggregates 
      (khandhas).</P>

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On one occasion,

      Abhaya was given the glory and honour of a ruler, together with a dancing 
      girl to entertain him. On the last day, while the dancer was entertaining 
      the prince and his company in the garden, she had a severe stroke; she 
      collapsed and died on the spot. The prince was shocked and very much 
      distressed. Sorrowfully, he went to the Buddha to find solace. To him the

      reference to Thera Sammajjana.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thera Sammajjana 
      spent most of his time sweeping the precincts of the monastery. At that 
      time, Thera Revata was also staying at the monastery; unlike Sammajjana, 
      Thera Revata spent most of his time in meditation or deep mental 
      absorption. Seeing Thera Revata's behaviour, Thera Sammajjana thought the 
      other thera was just idling away his time. Thus, one day Sammajjana went 
      to Thera Revata and said to him, <FONT color=#ff8040>"You are being very 
      lazy, living on the food offered out of faith and generosity; don't you 
      think you should sometimes sweep the floors or the compound or some other 
      place?" </FONT>To him, Thera Revata replied, <FONT color=#ba5901>"Friend, 
      a bhikkhu should not spend all his times sweeping. He should sweep early 
      in the morning, then go out on the alms-round. After the meal, 
      contemplating his body he should try to perceive the true nature of the 
      aggregates, or else, recite the texts until nightfall. Then he can do the 
      sweeping again if he so wishes." </FONT>Thera Sammajjana strictly followed 
      the advice given by Thera Revata and soon attained arahatship.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other bhikkhus 
      noticed some rubbish piling up in the compound and they asked Sammajjana 
      why he was not sweeping as much as he used to, and he replied, <FONT 
      color=#ff8040>"When I was not mindful, I was all the time sweeping; but 
      now I am no longer unmindful." </FONT>When the bhikkhus heard his reply 
      they were sceptical; so they went to the Buddha and said, <FONT 
      color=#0000ff>"Venerable Sir! Thera Sammajjana falsely claims himself to 
      be an arahat; he is telling lies." </FONT>To them the Buddha said,

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at 
      the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (173) of this book, with 
      reference to Thera Angulimala. </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angulimala was the 
      son of the Head Priest in the court of King Pasenadi of Kosala. His 
      original name was Ahimsaka. When he was of age, he was sent to Taxila, a 
      renowned university town. Ahimsaka was intelligent and was also obedient 
      to his teacher. So he was liked by the teacher and his wife; as a result, 
      other pupils were jealous of him. So they went to the teacher and falsely 
      reported that Ahimsaka was having an affair with the teacher's wife. At 
      first, the teacher did not believe them, but after being told a number of 
      times he believed them; and so he vowed to have revenge on the boy. To 
      kill the boy would reflect badly on him; so he thought of a plan which was 
      worse than murder. He told Ahimsaka to kill one thousand men or women and 
      in return he promised to give the boy priceless knowledge. The boy wanted 
      to have this knowledge, but was very reluctant to take life. However, he 
      agreed to do as he was told.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, he kept on 
      killing people, and not to lose count, he threaded a finger each of 
      everyone he killed and wore them like a garland round his neck. In this 
      way, he was known as Angulimala, and became the terror of the countryside. 
      The king himself heard about the exploits of Angulimala, and he made 
      preparations to capture him. When Mantani, the mother of Angulimala, heard 
      about the king's intention, out of love for her son, she went into the 
      forest in a desperate bid to save her son. By this time, the chain round 
      the neck of Angulimala had nine hundred and ninety-nine fingers in it, 
      just one finger short of one thousand.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early in the morning 
      on that day, the Buddha saw Angulimala in his vision, and reflected that 
      if he did not intervene, Angulimala who was on the look out for the last 
      person to make up the one thousand would see his mother and might kill 
      her. In that case, Angulimala would have to suffer in niraya endlessly. So 
      out of compassion, the Buddha left for the forest where Angulimala 
was.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angulimala, after 
      many sleepless days and nights, was very tired and near exhaustion. At the 
      same time, he was very anxious to kill the last person to make up his full 
      quota of one thousand and so complete his task. He made up his mind to 
      kill the first person he met. Suddenly, as he looked out he saw the Buddha 
      and ran after him with his knife raised. But the Buddha could not be 
      reached while he himself was completely exhausted. Then, looking at the 
      Buddha, he cried out, <FONT color=#ff0080>"O bhikkhu, stop! stop !" 
      </FONT>and the Buddha replied, <FONT color=#800040><I>"I have stopped, 
      only you have not stopped."</I></FONT> Angulimala did not get the 
      significance of the words of the Buddha, so he asked,<FONT color=#ff0080> 
      "O Bhikkhu! Why do you say that you have stopped and I have not stopped?" 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha then said 
      to him,<I><FONT color=#800040> "I say that I have stopped, because I have 
      given up killing all beings, I have given up ill-treating all beings, and 
      because I have established myself in universal love, patience, and 
      knowledge through reflection. But, you have not given up killing or 
      ill-treating others and you are not yet established in universal love and 
      patience. Hence, you are the one who has not stopped."</FONT></I> On 
      hearing these words from the mouth of the Buddha, Angulimala reflected, 
      <FONT color=#ff0080>"These are the words of a wise man. This bhikkhu is so 
      very wise and so very brave ; he must be the ruler of the bhikkhus. 
      Indeed, he must be the Buddha himself! He must have come here specially to 
      make me see the light."</FONT> So thinking, he threw away his weapon and 
      asked the Buddha to admit him to the Order of the bhikkhus. Then and 
      there, the Buddha made him a bhikkhu.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angulimala's mother 
      looked for her son everywhere in the forest shouting out his name, but 
      failing to find him she returned home. When the king and his men came to 
      capture Angulimala, they found him at the monastery of the Buddha. Finding 
      that Angulimala had given up his evil ways and had become a bhikkhu, the 
      king and his men went home. During his stay at the monastery, Angulimala 
      ardently and diligently practised meditation, and within a short time he 
      attained arahatship .</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, one day, while 
      he was on an alms-round, he came to a place where some people were 
      quarrelling among themselves. As they were throwing stones at one another, 
      some stray stones hit Thera Angulimala on the head and he was seriously 
      injured. Yet, he managed to come back to the Buddha, and the Buddha said 
      to him,<I><FONT color=#800040> "My son Angulimala! You have done away with 
      evil. Have patience. You are paying in this existence for the deeds you 
      have done. These deeds would have made you suffer for innumerable years in 
      niraya." </FONT></I>Soon afterwards, Angulimala passed away peacefully; he 
      had realized parinibbana.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other bhikkhus asked 
      the Buddha where Angulimala was reborn, and when the Buddha replied 
      <I><FONT color=#800040>"My son has realized parinibbana"</FONT></I>, they 
      could hardly believe it. So they asked him whether it was possible that a 
      man who had killed so many people could have realized parinibbana. To this 
      question, the Buddha replied, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Bhikkhus! Angulimala 
      had done much evil because he did not have good friends. But later, he 
      found good friends and through their help and good advice he had been 
      steadfast and mindful in his practice of the dhamma. Therefore, his evil 
      deeds have been overwhelmed by good (i e., Arahatta Magga).</FONT></I></P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Buddha spoke in verse as

  <TR>
    <TD vAlign=top align=left>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at 
      the monastery near Aggavala shrine in the country of Alavi, the Buddha 
      uttered Verse (174) of this book, with reference to a young maiden, who 
      was a weaver. </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the conclusion of 
      an alms-giving ceremony in Alavi, the Buddha gave a discourse on the 
      impermanence of the aggregates (khandhas). The main points the Buddha 
      stressed on that day may be expressed as follows:</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I><FONT 
      color=#800040>"My life is impermanent; for me, death only is permanent. I 
      must certainly die; my life ends in death. Life is not permanent; death is 
      permanent." </FONT></I></P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha also 
      exhorted the audience to be always mindful and to strive to perceive the 
      true nature of the aggregate He also said,<I><FONT color=#800040>"As one 
      who is armed with a stick or a spear is prepared to meet an enemy (e.g.. a 
      poisonous snake), so also, one who is ever mindful of death will face 
      death mindfully. He would then leave this world for a good destination 
      (sugati)."</FONT></I> Many people did not take the above exhortation 
      seriously, but a young girl of sixteen who was a weaver clearly understood 
      the message. After giving the discourse, the Buddha returned to the 
      Jetavana monastery.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a lapse of 
      three years, when the Buddha surveyed the world, he saw the young weaver 
      in his vision, and knew that time was ripe for the girl to attain 
      Sotapatti Fruition. So the Buddha came to the country of Alavi to expound 
      the dhamma for the second time. When the girl heard that the Buddha had 
      come again with five hundred bhikkhus, she wanted to go and listen to the 
      discourse which would be given by the Buddha. However, her father had also 
      asked her to wind some thread spools which he needed urgently, so she 
      promptly wound some spools and took them to her father. On the way to her 
      father, she stopped for a moment at the outer fringe of the audience, who 
      had come to listen to the Buddha.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, the 
      Buddha knew that the young weaver would come to listen to his discourse; 
      he also knew that the girl would die when she got to the weaving shed. 
      Therefore, it was very important that she should listen to the Dhamma on 
      her way to the weaving shed and not on her return. So, when the young 
      weaver appeared on the fringe of the audience, the Buddha looked at her. 
      When she saw him looking at her, she dropped her basket and respectfully 
      approached the Buddha. Then, he put four questions to her and she answered 
      all of them. The questions and answers are as given below.</P>

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha was

      died on the spot, and her father was broken-hearted. With eyes full of

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at 
      the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (176) of this book, with 
      reference to Cincamanavika.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Buddha went 
      on teaching the Dhamma, more and more people came flocking to him, and the 
      ascetics of other faiths found their following to be dwindling. So they 
      made a plan that would harm the reputation of the Buddha. They called the 
      very beautiful Cincamanavika, a devoted pupil of theirs, to them and said 
      to her, <FONT color=#0000ff>"If you have our interests in your heart, 
      please help us and put Samana Gotama to shame." </FONT>Cincamanavika 
      agreed to comply.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That same evening, 
      she took some flowers and went in the direction of the Jetavana monastery. 
      When people asked her where she was going, she replied, <FONT 
      color=#ff0080>"What is the use of you knowing where I am going?" 
      </FONT>Then she would go to the place of other ascetics near the Jetavana 
      monastery and would come back early in the morning to make it appear as if 
      she had spent the night at the Jetavana monastery. When asked, she would 
      reply,<FONT color=#ff0080> "I spent the night with Samana Gotama at the 
      Perfumed Chamber of the Jetavana monastery." </FONT>After three or four 
      months had passed, she wrapped up her stomach with some cloth to make her 
      look pregnant. Then, after eight or nine months, she wrapped up her 
      stomach with a round piece of thin wooden plank; she also beat up her 
      palms and feet to make them swollen, and pretended to be feeling tired and 
      worn out. Thus, she assumed a perfect picture of a woman in an advanced 
      stage of pregnancy. Then, in the evening, she went to the Jetavana 
      monastery to confront the Buddha.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha was then 
      expounding the Dhamma to a congregation of bhikkhus and laymen. Seeing him 
      teaching on the platform, she accused the Buddha thus: <FONT 
      color=#ff0080>"O you big Samana! You only preach to others. I am now 
      pregnant by you, yet you do nothing for my confinement. You only know how 
      to enjoy your self!" </FONT>The Buddha stopped preaching for a while and 
      said to her, <FONT color=#800040><I>"Sister, only you and I know whether 
      you are speaking the truth or not," </I></FONT>and Cincamanavika replied, 
      <FONT color=#ff0080>"Yes, you are right, how can others know what only you 
      and I know?"</FONT> </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that instant, 
      Sakka, king of the devas, became aware of the trouble being brewed at the 
      Jetavana monastery, so he sent four of his devas in the form of young 
      rats. The four rats got under the clothes of Cincamanavika and bit off the 
      strings that fastened the wooden plank round her stomach. As the strings 
      broke, the wooden plank dropped, cutting off the front part of her feet. 
      Thus, the deception of Cincamanavika was uncovered, and many from the 
      crowd cried out in anger, <FONT color=#408080>"Oh you wicked woman! A liar 
      and a cheat! How dare you accuse our noble Teacher!" </FONT>Some of them 
      spat on her and drove her out. She ran as fast as she could, and when she 
      had gone some distance the earth cracked and fissured and she was 
      swallowed up.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day, while 
      the bhikkhus were talking about Cincamanavika, the Buddha came to them and 
      said. <I><FONT color=#800040>"Bhikkhu;, one who is not afraid to tell 
      lies, and who does not care what happens in the future existence, will not

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at 
      the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (177) of this book, with 
      reference to the unrivalled alms-giving of King Pasenadi of Kosala.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, the king 
      offered alms to the Buddha and other bhikkhus on a grand scale. His 
      subjects, in competition with him, organized another alms-giving ceremony 
      on a grander scale than that of the king. Thus, the king and his subjects 
      kept on competing in giving alms. Finally, Queen Mallika thought of a 
      plan; to implement this plan, she asked the king to have a grand pavilion 
      built. Next, she asked for five hundred white umbrellas and five hundred 
      tame elephants; those five hundred elephants were to hold the five hundred 
      white umbrellas over the five hundred bhikkhus. In the middle of the 
      pavilion, they kept ten boats which were filled with perfumes and incense. 
      There were also two hundred and fifty princesses, who kept fanning the 
      five hundred bhikkhus. Since the subjects of the king had no princesses, 
      nor white umbrellas, nor elephants, they could no longer compete with the 
      king. When all preparations were made, alms-food was offered. After the 
      meal, the king made an offering of all the things in the pavilion, which 
      were worth fourteen crores. </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time, two 
      ministers of the king were present. Of those two, the minister named Junha 
      was very pleased and praised the king for having offered alms so 
      generously to the Buddha and his bhikkhus. He also reflected that such 
      offerings could only be made by a king. He was very glad because the king 
      would share the merit of his good deeds with all beings. In short, the 
      minister Junha rejoiced with the king in his unrivalled charity. The 
      minister Kala, on the other hand, thought that the king was only 
      squandering, by giving away fourteen crores in a single day, and that the 
      bhikkhus would just go back to the monastery and sleep.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the meal, the 
      Buddha looked over at the audience and knew how Kala the minister was 
      feeling. Then, he thought that if he were to deliver a lengthy discourse 
      of appreciation, Kala would get more dissatisfied, and in consequence 
      would have to suffer more in his next existence. So, out of compassion for 
      Kala, the Buddha delivered only a short discourse and returned to the 
      Jetavana monastery. The king had expected a lengthy discourse of 
      appreciation, and so he was very sad because the Buddha had been so brief. 
      The king wondered if he had failed to do something which should have been 
      done, and so he went to the monastery.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On seeing the king, 
      the Buddha said,<I><FONT color=#800040> "Great King! You should rejoice 
      that you have succeeded in making the offering of the unrivalled charity 
      (asadisadana). Such an opportunity comes very rarely; it comes only once 
      during the appearance of each Buddha. But your minister Kala had felt that 
      it was a waste, and was not at all appreciative. So, if I had given a 
      lengthy discourse, he would get more and more dissatisfied and 
      uncomfortable, and in consequence, he would suffer much more in the 
      present existence as well as in the next. That was why I preached so 
      briefly</FONT></I>". </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Buddha 
      added,<FONT color=#0000ff><I><FONT color=#800040> "Great King! Fools do 
      not rejoice in the charities given by others and go to the lower worlds. 
      The wise rejoice in other people's charities. and through appreciation, 
      they share in the merit gained by others and go to the abode of the

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at 
      the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (178) of this book, with 
      reference to Kala, son of Anathapindika, the well renowned rich man of 
      Savatthi.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kala, son of 
      Anathapindika, always kept away whenever the Buddha and his company of 
      bhikkhus came to their house. Anathapindika was afraid that if his son 
      kept on behaving in this way, he would be reborn in one of the lower 
      worlds (apayas). So, he enticed his son with the promise of money. He 
      promised to give one hundred if the youth consented to go to the monastery 
      and keep sabbath for one day. So, the youth went to the monastery and 
      returned home early the next day, without listening to any religious 
      discourses. His father offered him rice gruel, but instead of taking his 
      food, he first demanded to have the money.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day, the 
      father said to his son, <FONT color=#0000ff>"My son, if you learn a stanza 
      of the Text from the Buddha I will give you one thousand on your 
      return."</FONT> So, Kala went to the monastery again, and told the Buddha 
      that he wanted to learn something. The Buddha gave him a short stanza to 
      learn by heart; at the same time he willed that the youth would not be 
      able to memorize it. Thus, the youth had to repeat a single stanza many 
      times, but because he had to repeat it so many times, in the end, he came 
      to perceive the full meaning of the Dhamma and attained Sotapatti 
      Fruition.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early on the next 
      morning, he followed the Buddha and the bhikkhus to his own house. But on 
      that day, he was silently wishing, <FONT color=#ff00ff>" I wish my father 
      would not give me the one thousand in the presence of the Buddha. I do not 
      wish the Buddha to know that I kept the sabbath just for the sake of 
      money." </FONT>His father offered rice gruel to the Buddha and the 
      bhikkhus, and also to him. Then, his father brought one thousand, and told 
      Kala to take the money but surprisingly he refused. His father pressed him 
      to take it, but he still refused. Then, Anathapindika said to the 
      Buddha,<FONT color=#0000ff> "Venerable Sir, my son is quite changed; he 
      now behaves in a very pleasant manner."</FONT> Then he related to the 
      Buddha how he had enticed the youth with money to go to the monastery and 
      keep sabbath and to learn some religious texts. To him the Buddha replied, 
      <I><FONT color=#800040>"Anathapindika! Today, your son has attained 
      Sotapatti Fruition, which is much better than the riches of the Universal 
      Monarch or that of the devas or that of the brahmas."</FONT></I></P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Buddha

    <TD vAlign=top align=left>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha first 
      uttered Verses (179) and (180) of this book while residing near the Bodhi 
      tree, with reference to the three daughters of Mara. He repeated these 
      verses to the brahmin Magandiya while journeying through the Kuru 
      country.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Magandiya the 
      Brahmin and his wife lived in the kingdom of the Kurus with their daughter 
      Magandiya who was exceedingly beautiful. She was so beautiful that her 
      father rudely turned down all her suitors. One day, early in the morning, 
      when the Buddha surveyed the world, he found that time was ripe for the 
      brahmin Magandiya and his wife to attain Anagami Fruition. So, taking his 
      bowl and the robes, the Buddha set out for the place where the brahmin 
      usually went to offer fire sacrifice.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The brahmin, seeing 
      the Buddha, promptly decided that the Buddha was the very person who was 
      worthy of his daughter. He pleaded with the Buddha to wait there and 
      hurriedly went off to fetch his wife and daughter. The Buddha left his 
      footprint and went to another place, close at hand. When the brahmin and 
      his family came, they found only the footprint. Seeing the footprint, the 
      wife of the brahmin remarked that it was the footprint of one who was free 
      from sensual desires. Then, the brahmin saw the Buddha and he offered his 
      daughter in marriage to him.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha did not 
      accept nor did he refuse the offer, but first, he related to the brahmin 
      how the daughters of Mara tempted him soon after his attainment of 
      Buddhahood. To the beautiful Tanha, Arati and Raga, the daughters of Mara, 
      the Buddha had said, <I><FONT color=#800040>"It is no use tempting one who 
      is free from craving, clinging and passion, for he cannot be lured by any 
      temptation whatsoever."</FONT></I></P>
      <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Buddha spoke in verse as 
      follows:</P>

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, the Buddha

      all, what is this body of your daughter? It is full of urine and filth; I 
      don't like to touch it even with my foot!" </FONT></I>On hearing those 
      words of the Buddha, both the brahmin and his wife attained Anagami 
      Fruition. Later, they joined the Order and eventually both of them 
      attained arahatship. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On return from the 
      Tavatimsa deva world, the Buddha uttered Verse (181) of this book at 
      Sankassanagara, in reply to Thera Sariputta's words of welcome.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On one occasion, 
      while at Savatthi, the Buddha performed the Miracle of the Pairs in answer 
      to the challenge of the ascetics of various sects. After this, the Buddha 
      went to the Tavatimsa deva world; his mother who had been reborn in the 
      Tusita deva world as a deva known as Santusita also came to the Tavatimsa 
      deva world. There the Buddha expounded the Abhidhamma to the devas and the 
      brahmas throughout the three months of the vassa. As a result, Santusita 
      deva attained Sotapatti Fruition; so did numerous other devas and 
      brahmas.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During that period 
      Thera Sariputta spent the vassa at Sankassanagara, thirty yojanas away 
      from Savatthi. During his stay there, as regularly instructed by the 
      Buddha, he taught the Abhidhamma to the five hundred bhikkhus staying with 
      him and covered the whole course by the end of the vassa. </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Towards the end of 
      the vassa, Thera Maha Moggalana went to the Tavatimsa deva world to see 
      the Buddha. Then, he was told that the Buddha would return to the human 
      world on the full moon day at the end of the vassa to the place where 
      Thera Sariputta was spending the vassa. </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As promised, the 
      Buddha came with the six coloured rays shining forth from his body to the 
      city-gate of Sankassanagara, on the night of the full moon day of the 
      month of Assayuja when the moon was shining brightly. He was accompanied 
      by a large following of devas on one side and a large following of brahmas 
      on the other. A large gathering headed by Thera Sariputta welcomed the 
      Buddha back to this world; and the whole town was lit up. Thera Sariputta 
      was awed by the grandeur and glory of the whole scene of the Buddha's 
      return. He respectfully approached the Buddha and said,<FONT 
      color=#ff8040> "Venerable Sir! We have never seen or even heard of such 
      magnificent and resplendent glory. Indeed, Venerable Sir, you are loved,

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing near 
      Baranasi the Buddha uttered Verse (182) of this book, with reference to 
      Erakapatta, a king of nagas (dragons). </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once there was a 
      naga king by the name of Erakapatta. In one of his past existences during 
      the time of Kassapa Buddha he had been a bhikkhu for a long time. Through 
      worry (kukkucca) over a minor offence he had committed during that time, 
      he was reborn as a naga. As a naga, he waited for the appearance of a 
      Buddha. Erakapatta had a very beautiful daughter, and he made use of her 
      as a means of finding the Buddha. He made it known that whoever could 
      answer her questions could claim her for a wife. Twice every month, 
      Erakapatta made her dance in the open and sing out her questions. Many 
      suitors came to answer her questions hoping to claim her, but no one could 
      give the correct answer.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, the Buddha 
      saw a youth named Uttara in his vision. He also knew that the youth would 
      attain Sotapatti Fruition in connection with the questions put by the 
      daughter of Erakapatta the naga. By then the youth was already on his way 
      to see Erakapatta's daughter. The Buddha stopped him and taught him how to 
      answer the questions. While he was being taught, Uttara attained Sotapatti 
      Fruition. Now that Uttara had attained Sotapatti Fruition, he had no 
      desire for the naga princess. However, Uttara still went to answer the 
      questions for the benefit of numerous other beings.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first four 
      questions were:</P>
      <OL>
        <LI>Who is a ruler? 
        <LI>Is one who is overwhelmed by the mist of moral defilements to be 
        called a ruler? 
        <LI>What ruler is free from moral defilements? 
        <LI>What sort of person is to be called a fool? </LI></OL>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The answers to the 
      above questions were: </P>
      <OL>
        <LI>He who controls the six senses is a ruler. 
        <LI>One who is overwhelmed by the mist of moral defilements is not to be 
        called a ruler; he who is free from craving is called a ruler. 
        <LI>The ruler who is free from craving is free from moral defilements. 
        <LI>A person who hankers after sensual pleasures is called a fool. 
      </LI></OL>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having had the 
      correct answers to the above, the naga princess sang out questions 
      regarding the floods (oghas) of sensual desire, of renewed existence, of 
      false doctrine and of ignorance, and how they could be overcome. Uttara 
      answered these questions as taught by the Buddha.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Erakapatta 
      heard these answers he knew that a Buddha had appeared in this world. So 
      he asked Uttara to take him to the Buddha. On seeing the Buddha, 
      Erakapatta related to the Buddha how he had been a bhikkhu during the time 
      of Kassapa Buddha, how he had accidentally caused a grass blade to be 
      broken off while travelling in a boat, and how he had worried over that 
      little offence for having failed to do the act of exoneration as 
      prescribed, and finally how he was reborn as a naga. After hearing him, 
      the Buddha told him how difficult it was to be born in the human world, 
      and to be born during the appearance of the Buddhas or during the time of 
      their Teaching.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Buddha 
      spoke in verse as follows:</P>

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above discourse

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at 
      the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verses (186) and (187) of this 
      book, with reference to a young bhikkhu who was unhappy with his life as a 
      bhikkhu. </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, there was a 
      young bhikkhu at the Jetavana monastery. One day his teacher sent him to 
      another monastery to study. While he was away, his father became seriously 
      ill and died without seeing him. But his father left for him one hundred 
      kahapanas with his brother, the boy's uncle. On his return, his uncle told 
      him about his father's death and about the one hundred kahapanas left to 
      him. At first, he said that he had no need of the money. Later, he thought 
      that it might be better to return to lay-life, and as a result, he got 
      dissatisfied with the life of a bhikkhu. Gradually, he began to lose 
      interest in his life and was also losing weight. When other bhikkhus knew 
      about this, they took him to the Buddha.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha asked him 
      whether it was true that he was feeling unhappy with his life as a bhikkhu 
      and whether he had any capital to start the life of a layman. He answered 
      that it was true and that be had one hundred kahapanas to start his life 
      with. Then the Buddha explained to him that he would need to get food, 
      clothing, household utensils, two oxen, ploughs, pickaxes, knives, etc., 
      so that his one hundred in cash would hardly meet the expenses. The Buddha 
      then told him that for human beings there could never be enough, not even 
      for Universal Monarchs who could call for a shower of coins or gems or any 
      amount of wealth and treasures at any moment. Further, the Buddha related 
      the story of Mandatu, the Universal Monarch, who enjoyed the glory of the 
      devas both in the Catumaharajika and Tavatimsa realms for a long time. 
      After spending a long time in Tavatimsa, one day, Mandatu wished that he 
      were the sole ruler of Tavatimsa, instead of sharing it with Sakka. But 
      this time, his wish could not be fulfilled and instantly he became old and 
      decrepit; he returned to the human world and died soon after. </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Buddha 
      spoke in verse as follows:</P>

            disciple of the Buddha, does not find delight even in the pleasures 
            of the devas, but rejoices in the cessation of craving (i.e.,

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While residing at 
      the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verses (188) to (192) of this 
      book, with reference to Aggidatta, a brahmin.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aggidatta was the 
      head priest during the time of King Mahakosala, father of King Pasenadi. 
      After the death of King Mahakosala, Aggidatta gave away his property in 
      charity, and after that he left his home and became a non-Buddhist 
      ascetic. He lived with his ten thousand followers in a place near the 
      border of the three kingdoms of Anga, Magadha and Kuru, not far from a 
      mound of sand where a powerful naga was staying. To his followers and the 
      people of these three kingdoms, Aggidatta used to exhort: <FONT 
      color=#800000>"Pay homage to forests, mountains, parks and gardens, and 
      trees; by doing so, you will be liberated from all ills of 
      life."</FONT></P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, the Buddha 
      saw Aggidatta and his followers in his vision and realized that the time 
      was ripe for them to attain arahatship. So the Buddha sent Thera Maha 
      Moggalana to Aggidatta and his followers and told him that he himself 
      would follow afterwards. Thera Maha Moggalana went to the place of 
      Aggidatta and his followers and asked them to give him shelter for one 
      night. They first turned down his request, but finally they agreed to let 
      him stop at the mound of sand, the home of the naga. The naga was very 
      antagonistic to Thera Maha Moggalana, and there followed a duel between 
      the naga and the thera; on both sides, there was a display of power by 
      emitting smoke and flames. However, in the end, the naga was subdued. He 
      coiled himself round the mound of sand, and raised his head spreading it 
      out like an umbrella over Thera Maha Moggalana, thus showing respect for 
      him. Early in the morning, Aggidatta and the other ascetics came to the 
      mound of sand to find out whether Thera Maha Moggalana was still alive; 
      they had expected to see him dead. When they found the naga tamed, and 
      meekly holding his head like an umbrella over Thera Maha Moggalana, they 
      were very much astounded.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just then, he Buddha 
      arrived and Thera Maha Moggalana got up from his seat on the mound and 
      paid obeisance to the Buddha. Thera Maha Moggalana then proclaimed to the 
      audience of ascetics, <FONT color=#ff8040>"This is my Teacher, the supreme 
      Buddha, and I am but a humble pupil of this great Teacher!"</FONT> Hearing 
      him, the ascetics who had been very much impressed even by the power of 
      Thera Maha Moggalana were awed by the greater power of the Buddha. The 
      Buddha then asked Aggidatta what he taught his followers and the residents 
      of the neighbourhood. Aggidatta replied that he had taught them to pay 
      homage to mountains, forests, parks and gardens, and trees, and that by 
      doing so, they would be liberated from all ills of life. The Buddha's 
      reply to Aggidatta was, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Aggidatta, people go to 
      mountains, forests, gardens and parks, and trees for refuge when they are 
      threatened with danger, but these things cannot offer them any protection. 
      Only those who take refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Samgha are

      Aggidatta and all his followers attained arahatship. All of them entered

      from Anga, Magadha and Kuru came to pay respect to him, they saw their 
      teacher and his followers garbed as bhikkhus and they were puzzled and

      Buddha.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On one occasion, 
      while the Buddha and his followers were on a journey to Baranasi they came 
      to a field where there was a spirit-shrine. Not far from the shrine, a 
      brahmin was ploughing the field; seeing the brahmin the Buddha sent for 
      him. When he arrived, the brahmin made obeisance to the shrine but not to 
      the Buddha. To him the Buddha said, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Brahmin, by 
      paying respect to the shrine you are doing a meritorious 
      deed."</FONT></I>That made the brahmin happy. After thus putting him in a 
      favourable frame of mind, the Buddha, by his supernormal power, brought 
      forth the golden stupa of Kassapa Buddha and let it remain visible in the 
      sky. The Buddha then explained to the brahmin and the other bhikkhus that 
      there were four classes of persons worthy of a stupa. They are: the 
      Buddhas (Tathagatas) who are homage-worthy and perfectly self-enlightened, 
      the Paccekabuddhas, the Ariya disciples, and the Universal Monarchs. He 
      also told them about the three types of stupas erected in honour of these 
      four classes of persons. The stupas where corporeal relics are enshrined 
      are known as <I>Sariradhatu cetiya</I>; the stupas and figures made in the 
      likeness of the above four personages are known as <I>Uddissa cetiya</I>; 
      and the stupas where personal effects like robes, bowls, etc. of those 
      revered personages are enshrined are known as <I>Paribhoga cetiya</I>. The 
      Bodhi tree is also included in the Paribhoga cetiya. The Buddha then
