<P align=justify><B><FONT color=#800040>Dhammapada </FONT></B>is one of the best 
known books of the Pitaka. It is a collection of the teachings of the Buddha 
expressed in clear, pithy verses. These verses were culled from Various 
discourses given by the Buddha in the course of forty-five years of his 
teaching, as he travelled in the valley of the Ganges (Ganga) and the 
sub-mountain tract of the Himalayas. These verses are often terse, witty and 
convincing. Whenever similes are used, they are those that are easily understood 
even by a child, e.g., the cart's wheel, a man's shadow, a deep pool, flowers. 
Through these verses, the Buddha exhorts one to achieve that greatest of all 
conquests, the conquest of self; to escape from the evils of passion, hatred and 
ignorance; and to strive hard to attain freedom from craving and freedom from 
the round of rebirths. Each verse contains a truth (dhamma), an exhortation, a 
piece of advice. </P>
<P align=justify><B><FONT color=#0000ff>Dhammapada verses</FONT></B> are often 
quoted by many in many countries of the world and the book has been translated 
into many languages. One of the earliest translations into English was made by 
Max Muller in 1870. Other translations that followed are those by F.L. Woodward 
in 1921, by Wagismara and Saunders in 1920, and by A.L. Edmunds (Hymns of the 
Faith) in 1902. Of the recent translations, that by Narada Mahathera is the most 
widely known. Dr. Walpola Rahula also has translated some selected verses from 
the Dhammapada and has given them at the end of his book "What the Buddha 
Taught," revised edition. The Chinese translated the Dhammapada from Sanskrit. 
The Chinese version of the Dhammapada was translated into English by Samuel Beal 
(Texts from the Buddhist Canon known as Dhammapada) in 1878. </P>
<P align=justify>In Burma, translations have been male into Burmese, mostly in 
prose, some with paraphrases, explanations and abridgements of stories relating 
to the verses. In recent years, some books on Dhammapada with both Burmese and 
English translations, together with Pali verses, have also been published.</P>
<P align=justify>The Dhammapada is the second book of the Khuddaka Nikaya of the 
Suttanta Pitaka, consisting of four hundred and twenty-three verses in 
twenty-six chapters arranged under various heads. - In the Dhammapada are 
enshrined the basic tenets of the Buddha's Teaching.</P>
<P align=justify>Verse (21) which begins with "Appamado amatapadam" meaning 
"Mindfulness is the way to Nibbana, the Deathless," is a very important and 
significant verse. Mindfulness is the most important element in Tranquillity and 
Insight Meditation. The last exhortation of the Buddha just before he passed 
away was also to be mindful and to endeavour diligently (to complete the task of 
attaining freedom from the round of rebirths through Magga and Phala). It is 
generally accepted that it was on account of this verse on mindfulness that the 
Emperor Asoka of India And King Anawrahta of Burma became converts to Buddhism. 
Both kings had helped greatly in the propagation of Buddhism in their respective 
countries. </P>
<P align=justify>In verse (29) the Buddha has coupled his call for mindfulness 
with a sense of urgency. The verse runs: "Mindful amongst the negligent, highly 
vigilant amongst the drowsy, the wise man advances like a race horse, leaving 
the jade behind." </P>
<P align=justify>Verses (1) and (2) illustrate the immutable law of Kamma, under 
which every deed, good or bad, comes back to the doer. Here, the Buddha 
emphasizes the importance of mind in all our actions and speaks of the 
inevitable consequences of our deeds, words and thoughts. </P>
<P align=justify>Verses (153) and (154) are expressions of sublime and intense 
joy uttered by the Buddha at the very moment of his Enlightenment. These two 
verses give us a graphic account of the culmination of the Buddha's search for 
Truth. They tell us about the Buddha finding the 'house-builder,' Craving, the 
cause of repeated births in Samsara. Having rid of Craving, for him no more 
houses (khandhas) shall be built by Craving, and there will be no more rebirths. 
</P>
<P align=justify>Verses (277), (278) and (279) are also important as they tell 
us about the impermanent, unsatisfactory and the non-self nature of all 
conditioned things; It is every important that one should perceive the true 
nature of all conditioned things and become weary of the khandhas, for this is 
the Path to Purity.</P>
<P align=justify>Then the Buddha shows us the Path leading to the liberation 
from round of rebirths, i.e., the Path with eight constituents (Atthangiko 
Maggo) in Verse (273). Further, the Buddha exhorts us to make our own effort in 
Verse (276) saying, "You yourselves should make the effort, the Tathagatas only 
show the way." Verse (183) gives us the teaching of the Buddhas." It says, "Do 
no evil, cultivate merit, purify one's mind; this is the teaching of the 
Buddhas." </P>
<P align=justify>In Verse (24) the Buddha shows us the way to success in life, 
thus: "If a person is energetic, mindful, pure in thought, word and deed, if he 
does everything with care and consideration, restrains his senses; earns his 
living according to the Dhamma and is not unheedful, then, the fame and fortune 
of that mindful person increase." </P>
<P align=justify>These are some of the examples of the gems to be found in the 
Dhammapada. Dhammapada is, indeed, a philosopher, guide and friend to all. </P>
<P align=justify>This translation of verses is from Pali into English. The Pali 
text used is the Dhammapada Pali approved by the Sixth International Buddhist 
Synod. We have tried to make the translation as close to the text as possible, 
but sometimes it is very difficult, if not impossible, to find an English word 
that would exactly correspond to a Pali word. For example, we cannot yet find a 
single English word that can convey the real meaning of the word "dukkha" used 
in the exposition of the Four Noble Truths. In this translation, wherever the 
term "dukkha" carries the same meaning as it does in the Four Noble Truths, it 
is left untranslated; but only explained. </P>
<P align=justify>When there is any doubt in the interpretation of the dhamma 
concept of the verses or when the literal meaning is vague or unintelligible, we 
have referred to the Commentary (in Pali) and the Burmese translation of the 
Commentary by the Nyaunglebin Sayadaw, a very learned thera. On many occasions 
we have also consulted the teachers of the Dhamma (Dhammacariyas) for 
elucidation of perplexing words and sentences.</P>
<P align=justify>In addition we have also consulted Burmese translations of the 
Dhammapada, especially the translation by the Union Buddha Sasana Council, the 
translation by the Sangaja Sayadaw (l805-1876), a leading maha thera in the time 
of King Mindon and King Thibaw, and also the translation by Sayadaw U Thittila, 
an Ovadacariya maha thera of the Burma Pitaka Association. The book by the 
Sangaja Sayadaw also includes paraphrases and abridgements of the Dhammapada 
stories. </P>
<P align=center><B><FONT color=#0000ff>Dhammapada Stories</FONT></B></P>
<P align=justify>Summaries of the Dhammapada stories are given in the second 
part of the book as it is generally believed that the Dhammapada Commentary 
written by Buddhaghosa (5th. century A.D.) is a great help towards a better 
understanding of the Dhammapada. Three hundred and five stories are included in 
the Commentary. Most of the incidents mentioned in the stories took place during 
the life-time of the Buddha. In some stories, some facts about some past 
existences were also retold.</P>
<P align=justify>In writing summaries of stories we have not tried to translate 
the Commentary. We have simply culled the facts of the stories and have 
rewritten them briefly: A translation of the verses is given at the end of each 
story.</P>
<P align=justify>It only remains for me now to express my deep and sincere 
gratitude to the members of the Editorial Committee, Burma Pitaka Association, 
for having meticulously gone through the script; to Sayagyi Dhammacariya U Aung 
Moe and to U Thein Maung, editor, Burma Pitaka Association, for helping in the 
translation of the verses.</P>
<P align=center>May the reader find the Path to Purity.</P>
