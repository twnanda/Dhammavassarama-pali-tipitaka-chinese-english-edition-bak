<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (76) of this hook, with reference to Thera 
Radha, who was at one time a poor old Brahmin.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radha was a poor brahmin who 
stayed in the monastery doing small services for the bhikkhus. For his services 
he was provided with food and clothing and other needs, but was not encouraged 
to join the Order, although he had a strong desire to become a bhikkhu.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, early in the morning, 
when the Buddha surveyed the world with his supernormal power, he saw the poor 
old brahmin in his vision and knew that he was due for arahatship. So the Buddha 
went to the old man, and learned from him that the bhikkhus of the monastery did 
not want him to join the Order. The Buddha therefore called all the bhikkhus to 
him and asked them, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Is there any bhikkhu here who 
recollects any good turn done to him by this old man?" </FONT></I>To this 
question, the Venerable Sariputta replied,<FONT color=#800000> "Venerable Sir, I 
do recollect an instance when this old man offered me a spoonful of 
rice."</FONT> "<I><FONT color=#800040>If that be so," </FONT></I>the Buddha 
said, <I><FONT color=#800040>"shouldn't you help your benefactor get liberated 
from the ills of life?" </FONT></I>Then the Venerable Sariputta agreed to make 
the old man a bhikkhu and he was duly admitted to the Order. The Venerable 
Sariputta guided the old bhikkhu and the old bhikkhu strictly followed his 
guidance. Within a few days, the old bhikkhu attained arahat ship.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Buddha next came to see 
the bhikkhus, they reported to him how strictly the old bhikkhu followed the 
guidance of the Venerable Sariputta. To them, the Buddha replied that a bhikkhu 
should be amenable to guidance like Radha ,and should not resent when rebuked 
for any fault or failing.</P>
<P align=center>Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows :</P>

bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka 
and their five hundred disciples were staying at Kitagiri village. While staying 
there they made their living by planting flowering plants and fruit trees for 
gain, thus violating the rules of Fundamental Precepts for bhikkhus.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha hearing about these 
bhikkhus sent his two Chief Disciples Sariputta and Maha Moggallana, to stop 
them from committing further misconduct. To his two Chief Disciples the Buddha 
said,<I><FONT color=#800040> "Tell those bhikkhus not to destroy the faith and 
generosity of the lay disciples by misconduct and if anyone should disobey, 
drive him out of the monastery. Do not hesitate to do as I told you, for only

evil."</FONT></I></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (78) of this book, with reference to Thera 
Channa.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Channa was the attendant who 
accompanied Prince Siddhattha when he renounced the world and left the palace on 
horseback. When the prince attained Buddhahood, Channa also became a bhikkhu. As 
a bhikkhu, he was very arrogant and overbearing because of his close connection 
to the Buddha. Channa used to say, <FONT color=#0000ff>"I came along with my 
Master when he left the palace for the forest. At that time, I was the only 
companion of my Master and there was no one else. But now, Sariputta and 
Moggallana are saying, 'we are the Chief Disciples,' and are strutting about the 
place."</FONT></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Buddha sent for him and 
admonished him for his behaviour, he kept silent but continued to abuse and 
taunt the two Chief Disciples. Thus the Buddha sent for him and admonished him 
three times; still, he did not change. And again, the Buddha sent for Channa and 
said, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Channa, these two noble bhikkhus are good friends 
to you; you should associate with them and be on good terms with 
them."</FONT></I></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of repeated admonitions 
and advice given by the Buddha, Channa did as he pleased and continued to scold 
and abuse the bhikkhus. The Buddha, knowing this, said that Channa would not 
change during the Buddha's lifetime but after his demise (<I>parinibbana</I>) 
Channa would surely change. On the eve of his<I> parinibbana</I>, the Buddha 
called Thera Ananda to his bedside and instructed him to impose the 
Brahma-punishment (<I>Brahmadanda</I>) to Channa; i.e., for the bhikkhus to 
simply ignore him and to have nothing to do with him.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the parinibbana of the 
Buddha, Channa, learning about the punishment from Thera Ananda, felt a deep and 
bitter remorse for having done wrong and he fainted three times. Then, he owned 
up his guilt to the bhikkhus and asked for pardon. From that moment, he changed 
his ways and outlook. He also obeyed their instructions in his meditation 
practice and soon attained arahatship.</P>

<P align=center>VI (4) <B><FONT color=#0000ff>The Story of Thera<A 
name=Mahakappina><FONT color=#0000ff> Mahakappina</FONT></A></FONT></B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (79) of this book, with reference to Thera 
Mahakappina.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mahakappina was king of 
Kukkutavati. He had a queen named Anoja; he also had one thousand ministers to 
help him rule the country. One day, the king accompanied by those one thousand 
ministers, was out in the park. There, they met some merchants from Savatthi. On 
learning about the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Samgha from these merchants the 
king and his ministers immediately set out for Savatthi.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that day, when the Buddha 
surveyed the world with his supernormal power, he saw in his vision, Mahakappina 
and his ministers coming towards Savatthi. He also knew that they were due for 
arahatship. The Buddha went to a place one hundred and twenty yojanas away from 
Savatthi to meet them. There, he waited for them under a banyan tree on the bank 
of the river Candabhaga. King Mahakappina and his ministers came to the place 
where the Buddha was waiting for them. When they saw the Buddha, with 
six-coloured rays radiating from his body, they approached the Buddha and paid 
homage to him. The Buddha then delivered a discourse to them. After listening to 
the discourse the king and all his ministers attained <I>Sotapatti </I>Fruition, 
and they asked the Buddha to permit them to join the Order. The Buddha, 
reflecting on their past and finding that they had made offerings of yellow 
robes in a past existence, said to them, "<I><FONT color=#800040>Ehi 
bhikkhu</FONT></I>", and they all became <I>bhikkhus</I>.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, Queen Anoja, learning 
about the king's departure for Savatthi, sent for the wives of the one thousand 
ministers, and together with them followed the king's trail. They too came to 
the place where the Buddha was and seeing the Buddha with a halo of six colours, 
paid homage to him. All this time, the Buddha by exercising his supernormal 
power had made the king and his ministers invisible so that their wives did not 
see them. 'The queen therefore enquired where the king and his ministers were. 
The Buddha told the queen and her party to wait for a while and that the king 
would soon come with his ministers. The Buddha then delivered another discourse; 
at the end of this discourse the king and his ministers attained<I> 
arahatship</I>; the queen and the wives of the ministers attained <I>Sotapatti 
</I>Fruition. At that instant, the queen and her party saw the newly admitted<I> 
bhikkhus</I> and recognized them as their former husbands. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ladies also asked permission 
from the Buddha to enter the Order of <I>Bhikkhunis</I>; so they were directed 
to go ahead to Savatthi. There they entered the Order and very soon they also 
attained <I>arahatship</I>. The Buddha then returned to the Jetavana monastery 
accompanied by one thousand bhikkhus. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Jetavana monastery, Thera 
Mahakappina while resting during the night or during the day would often say, 
<FONT color=#800000>"Oh, what happiness!" (<I>Aho Sukham</I>)</FONT>. The 
bhikkhus, hearing him saying this so many times a day told the Buddha about it. 
To them the Buddha replied, <I><FONT color=#800040>"My son Kappina having had 
the taste of the Dhamma lives happily with a serene mind; he is saying these 
words of exultation repeatedly with reference to Nibbana."</FONT></I></P>

<P align=center>VI (5)<B><FONT color=#0000ff>The Story of Samanera <A 
name=Pandita><FONT color=#0000ff>Pandita</FONT></A></FONT></B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (80) of this book, with reference to 
Samanera Pandita.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pandita was a young son of a rich 
man of Savatthi. He became a samanera at the age of seven. On the eighth day 
after becoming a samanera, as he was following Thera Sariputta on an alms-round, 
he saw some farmers channeling water into their fields and asked the thera, 
<FONT color=#800000>"Can water which has no consciousness be guided to wherever 
one wishes ?" </FONT>The thera replied, <FONT color=#ff8040>"Yes, it can be 
guided to wherever one wishes."</FONT> As they continued on their way, the 
samanera next saw some fletchers heating their arrows with fire and 
straightening them. Further on, he came across some carpenters cutting, sawing 
and planing timber to make it into things like cart-wheels. Then he 
pondered,<FONT color=#800000> "If water which is without consciousness can be 
guided to wherever one desires, if a crooked bamboo which is without 
consciousness can be straightened, and if timber which is without consciousness 
can be made into useful things, why should I, having consciousness, be unable to 
tame my mind and practise Tranquillity and Insight Meditation?"</FONT></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then and there he asked 
permission from the thera and returned to his own room in the monastery. There 
he ardently and diligently practised meditation, contemplating the body. Sakka 
and the devas also helped him in his meditation by keeping the monastery and its 
precincts very quiet and still. Before Meal time Samanera Pandita attained 
Anagami Fruition.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time Thera Sariputta was 
bringing food to the samanera. The Buddha saw with his supernormal power that 
Samanera Pandita had attained Anagami Fruition and also that if he continued to 
practise meditation he would soon attain arahatship. So the Buddha decided to 
stop Sariputta from entering the room, where the samanera was. The Buddha went 
to the door and kept Sariputta engaged by putting some questions to him. While 
the conversation was taking place, the samanera attained arahatship. Thus, the 
samanera attained arahatship on the eighth day after becoming a novice.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, the Buddha 
said to the bhikkhus of the monastery, <I><FONT color=#800040>"When one is 
earnestly practising the Dhamma, even Sakka and the devas give protection and 
keep guard; I myself have kept Thera Sariputta engaged at the door so that 
Samanera Pandita should not be disturbed. The samanera, having seen the farmers 
irrigating their fields, the fletchers straightening their arrows, and 
carpenters making cart-wheels and other things, tames his mind and practises the 
dhamma; he has now become an arahat."</FONT></I></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Jetavana

Bhaddiya.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bhaddiya was one of the bhikkhus 
staying at the Jetavana monastery. Because of his short stature he was known as 
Lakundaka (the dwarf) to other bhikkhus. Lakundaka Bhaddiya was very good 
natured; even young bhikkhus would often tease him by pulling his nose or his 
ear, or by patting him on his head. Very often they would jokingly say,<FONT 
color=#0000ff> "Uncle, how are you? Are you happy, or are you bored with your 
life here as a bhikkhu?", </FONT>etc. Lakundaka Bhaddiya never retaliated in 
anger, or abused them; in fact, even in his heart he did not get angry with 
them.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When told about the patience of 
Lakundaka Bhaddiya. the Buddha said, <I><FONT color=#800040>"An arahat never 
loses his temper, he has no desire to speak harshly or to think ill of others. 
He is like a mountain of solid rock; as a solid rock is unshaken, so also, an

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (82) of this book, with reference to the 
mother of Kana, Kanamata.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kanamata was a devoted lay 
disciple of the Buddha. Her daughter Kana was married to a man from another 
village. As Kana had been on a visit to her mother for some time, her husband 
sent a message for her to come home. Her mother told her to wait for one more 
day as she wanted to send along some sweet meals with her for her husband. The 
next day, Kanamata made some sweetmeats, but when four bhikkhus stood at her 
door for alms, she offered some to them. The four bhikkhus told other bhikkhus 
about the sweetmeats from Kanamata's house and they also came to stand at the 
door of Kanamata, as a devotee of the Buddha and his disciples, offered her 
sweetmeats to the bhikkhus as they came in, one after another. The result was 
that in the end there was none left for Kana and she did not go home on that 
day. The same thing happened on the next two days; her mother made some 
sweetmeats, the bhikkhus stood at her door, she offered her sweetmeats to the 
bhikkhus, there was nothing left for her daughter to take home, and her daughter 
did not go home. On the third day, for the third time, her husband sent her a 
message, which was also an ultimatum stating that if she failed to come home the 
next day, he would take another wife. But on the next day also Kana was unable 
to go home because her mother offered all her sweetmeats to the bhikkhus. Kana's 
husband then took another wife and Kana became very bitter towards the bhikkhus. 
She used to abuse all bhikkhus so much so that the bhikkhus kept away from the 
house of Kanamata.</P>
<P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha heard about Kana and went 
to the house of Kanamata; there Kanamata offered him some rice gruel. After the 
meal, the Buddha sent for Kana and asked her,<I><FONT color=#800040> "Did my 
bhikkhus take what was given them or what was not given them ?" </FONT></I>Kana 
answered that the bhikkhus had taken only what was given them, and then 
added,<FONT color=#0000ff> "They were not in the wrong; only I was in the 
wrong." </FONT>Thus, she owned up her fault and she also paid homage to the 
Buddha. The Buddha then gave a discourse. At the end of the discourse, Kana 
attained Sotapatti Fruition.</P>
<P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way back to the monastery, 
the Buddha met King Pasenadi of Kosala. On being told about Kana and her bitter 
attitude towards the bhikkhus, King Pasenadi asked the Buddha whether he had 
been able to teach her the Dhamma and, make her see the Truth (Dhamma). The 
Buddha replied, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Yes, I have taught her the Dhamma, and I 
have also made her rich in her next existence." </FONT></I>Then the king 
promised the Buddha that he would make Kana rich even in this existence. The 
king then sent his men with a palanquin to fetch Kana. When she arrived, the 
king announced to his ministers, <FONT color=#ff00ff>"Whoever can keep my 
daughter Kana in comfort may take her."</FONT> One of the ministers volunteered 
to adopt Kana as his daughter, gave her all his wealth, and said to her,<FONT 
color=#008000> "You may give in charity as much as you like." </FONT>Every day, 
Kana made offerings to the bhikkhus at the four city-gates. When told about Kana 
giving generously in charity, the Buddha said, <FONT color=#800040><I>"Bhikkhus,

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (83) of this book, with reference to five 
hundred bhikkhus.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the request of a brahmin from 
Veranja, the Buddha was, on one occasion, staying at Veranja with five hundred 
bhikkhus. While they were at Veranja, the brahmin failed to look after them. The 
people of Varanja, who were then facing a famine, could offer very little to the 
bhikkhus when they went on their rounds for alms-food. In spite of all these 
hardships, the bhikkhus were not disheartened; they were quite contented with 
the small amount of shrivelled grain which the horse-traders offered them daily. 
At the end of the vasa, after informing the brahmin from Veranja, the Buddha 
returned to the Jetavana monastery, accompanied by the five hundred bhikkhus. 
The people of Savatthi welcomed them back with choice food of all kinds.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people living with the 
bhikkhus, eating whatever was left over by the bhikkhus, ate greedily like true 
gluttons and went to sleep after their meals. On waking up, they were shouting, 
singing and dancing, thus making themselves a thorough nuisance. When the Buddha 
came in the evening to the congregation of bhikkhus, they reported to him about 
the behaviour of those unruly persons, and said, <FONT color=#800000>"These 
people living on the leftovers were quite decent and well-behaved when all of us 
were facing hardship and famine in Veranja. Now that they have enough good food 
they are going about shouting, singing and dancing, and thus make themselves a 
thorough nuisance. The bhikkhus, however, behave themselves here just as they 
were in Veranja". </FONT></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To them the Buddha replied, 
<I><FONT color=#800040>"It is in the nature of the foolish to be full of sorrow 
and feel depressed when things go wrong, and to be full of gladness and feel 
elated when things go well. The wise, however, can withstand the ups and downs

better leave it, too."</FONT> With this thought she left the house and became a 
bhikkhuni; eventually, she too attained arahatship.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the congregation of the 
bhikkhus, the Buddha was told how Dhammika became a bhikkhu and attained 
arahatship, and how through him his son and his wife also attained arahatship. 
To them the Buddha said, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Bhikkhus, a wise man does not 
wish for wealth and prosperity by doing evil, whether it is for his own sake or

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devadatta, on one occasion, tried 
to kill the Buddha by pushing a big rock from the peak o fGijjhakuta mountain 
(Vulture's Peak). The rock struck a ledge on the side of the mountain and a 
splinter struck the big toe of the Buddha. The Buddha was taken to the 
mango-grove monastery of Jivaka. There, Jivaka, the renowned physician, attended 
on the Buddha; he put some medicine on the toe of the Buddha and bandaged it. 
Jivaka then left to see another patient in town, but promised to return and 
remove the bandage in the evening. When Jivaka returned that night, the 
city-gates were already closed and he could not come to see the Buddha that 
night. He was very upset because if the bandage was not removed in time, the 
whole body would become very hot and the Buddha would be very ill.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just about this time, the Buddha 
asked Thera Ananda to remove the bandage from his big toe and found that the 
wound was completely healed. Jivaka came to the monastery early next morning and 
asked the Buddha whether he felt great pain and distress the previous night. The 
Buddha replied,<I><FONT color=#800040> "Jivaka! Ever since I attained Buddhahood

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Veluvana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (91) of this book, with reference to Thera 
Mahakassapa.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Buddha once spent the vassa 
at Rajagaha with a number of bhikkhus. About two weeks before the end of the 
vassa, the Buddha informed the bhikkhus that they would soon be leaving Rajagaha 
and told them to prepare for departure. Some bhikkhus stitched and dyed new 
robes, some washed the old robes. When some bhikkhus saw Mahakassapa washing his 
robes, they speculated, "There are so many people inside and outside Rajagaha 
who love and respect Thera Mahakassapa and are constantly looking to all his 
needs; is it possible that the thera would leave his lay devotees here and 
follow the Buddha elsewhere?"</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of fifteen days, on 
the eve of his departure, the Buddha thought that there might be some occasions 
like alms-food offering ceremonies, initiation of novices, funerals, etc., and 
so it would not be proper for all the bhikkhus to leave. So he decided that some 
bhikkhus should remain at the Veluvana monastery and that the most suitable 
person would be Thera Mahakassapa. Consequently, Thera Mahakassapa remained in 
Rajagaha with some junior bhikkhus.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the other bhikkhus said 
scornfully, "Mahakassapa has not accompanied the Buddha, just as we have 
predicted!" The Buddha heard their remark and said to them, "Bhikkhus! Do you 
wish to say that my son Kassapa is attached to his lay disciples of Rajagaha and 
to the things they offer him? You are very much mistaken. My son Kassapa remains 
here under my instruction; he is not attached to anything here."</P>

Belatthasisa.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thera Belatthasisa, after going 
on an alms-round in the village, stopped on the way and took his food there. 
After the meal, he continued his round of alms for more food. When he had 
collected enough food he returned to the monastery, dried up the rice and 
hoarded it. Thus, there was no need for him to go on an alms-round every day; he 
then remained in jhana concentration for two or three days. Arising from jhana 
concentration he ate the dried rice he had stored up, after soaking it in water. 
Other Bhikkhunis thought ill of the thera on this account, and reported to the 
Buddha about his hoarding of rice. Since then, the hoarding of food by the 
bhikkhus has been prohibited.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Thera Belatthasisa, since 
he stored up rice before the ruling on hoarding was made and because he did it 
not out of greed for food, but only to save time for meditation practice, the 
Buddha declared that the thera was quite innocent and that he was not to be 
blamed.</P>

Anuruddha.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thera Anuruddha was one day 
looking for some discarded pieces of cloth in a rubbish heap to make into a robe 
as his old robe was getting soiled and torn. Jalini, his wife of a previous 
existence, who was now in a deva world, saw him. Knowing that he was looking for 
some cloth, she took three pieces of good deva material and put them in the 
rubbish heap, making them barely visible. The thera found the pieces of cloth 
and took them to the monastery. While he was making the robe, the Buddha arrived 
with his Chief Disciples and senior disciples and they also helped stitch the 
robe.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, Jalini, assuming the 
form of a young lady, came to the village and learnt about the arrival of the 
Buddha and his disciples and also how they were helping Thera Anuruddha. She 
urged the villagers to send good delicious food to the monastery and 
consequently there was more than enough for all. Other bhikkhus, seeing so much 
surplus, put the blame on the thera and said, "Thera Anuruddha should have asked 
his relatives and lay disciples to send just enough food; may be, he just wanted 
to show off that he had so many devotees." To those bhikkhus, the Buddha said, 
"Bhikkhus, do not think my son Anuruddha has asked his relatives and lay 
disciples to send rice gruel and other foods. My son the thera did not ask for 
anything; arahats do not talk about such things like food and clothing. The 
excessive amount of food brought to the monastery this morning was due to the 
promptings of a celestial being and not of a man." </P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the end of the vassa; and 
Thera Sariputta was about to set out on a journey with some followers. A young 
bhikkhu, who bore some grudge against the thera, approached the Buddha and 
falsely reported that Thera Sariputta had abused him and beaten him. The Buddha 
therefore sent for the thera and questioned him, and Thera Sariputta replied as 
follows: <FONT color=#800000>"Venerable Sir! How could a bhikkhu, who 
steadfastly keeps his mind on the body, set out on a journey without 
apologizing, after doing wrong to a fellow bhikkhu? I am like the earth, which 
feels no pleasure when flowers are cast on it, nor resentment when rubbish and 
excreta are piled upon it. I am also like the door-mat, the beggar, the bull 
with broken horns; I also feel abhorrence for the impurity of the body and am no 
longer attached to it."</FONT></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Thera Sariputta spoke thus, 
the young bhikkhu felt very much distressed and wept bitterly, and admitted that 
he had lied about the Chief Disciple Sariputta. Then the Buddha advised Thera 
Sariputta to accept the apology of the young bhikkhu, lest a heavy punishment 
should fall on him and get his head crushed. The young bhikkhu then admitted 
that he had done wrong and respectfully asked for pardon. Thera Sariputta 
pardoned the young bhikkhu and also asked to be forgiven if he also had done any 
wrong.</P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Jetavana

samanera, a pupil of Thera Tissa from Kosambi.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once, a seven year old boy was 
made a samanera at the request of his father. Before his head was shaved the boy 
was given a subject of meditation. While he was being shaved, the boy had his 
mind fixed steadfastly on the object of meditation; as a result, he attained 
arahatship as soon as they finished shaving his head.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some time, Thera Tissa, 
accompanied by the samanera, set out for Savatthi to pay homage to the Buddha. 
On the way, they spent one night in a village monastery. The thera fell asleep, 
but the young samanera sat up the whole night beside the bed of the old thera. 
Early in the morning, the old thera thought it was time to wake up the young 
samanera. So he roused up the samanera with a palm-leaf fan, and accidentally 
hit the eye of the samanera with the handle of the fan and damaged the eye. The 
samanera covered that eye with one hand and went about doing his duties of 
getting water for the thera to wash his face and clean his mouth, sweeping the 
floor of the monastery, etc. When the young samanera offered water with one hand 
to the thera, the thera chided him, and said that he should offer things with 
both hands. Only then, did the thera learn how the samanera lost his eye. At 
that instant, he realized that he had wronged a truly noble person. Feeling very 
sorry and humiliated, he made an apology to the samanera. But the samanera said 
that it was not the fault of the thera, nor his own fault, but that it was only 
the result of kamma, and so the thera was not to feel sad about it. But the 
thera could not get over the unfortunate incident.</P>
<P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they continued their journey to 
Savatthi and arrived at the Jetavana monastery where the Buddha was in 
residence. The thera then told the Buddha that the young samanera who came along 
with him was the most noble person he had ever met, and related all that had 
happened on their way. The Buddha listened to him, and replied, <I><FONT

from others." </FONT>Sariputta's answer was not properly understood by the 
bhikkhus; they thought, <FONT color=#0000ff>"Sariputta has not given up wrong 
views yet; even now, he has no faith in the Buddha."</FONT></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Buddha explained to them 
the true meaning of Sariputta's answer.<I><FONT color=#800040> "Bhikkhus, 
Sariputta's answer is simply this; he accepts the fact that Nibbana is realized 
by means of meditation on the senses, but his acceptance is due to his own 
personal realization and not merely because I have said it or somebody else has 
said it. Sariputta has faith in me; he also has faith in the consequences of 
good and bad deeds."</FONT></I></P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (98) of this book, with reference to Thera 
Revata of the Acacia (khadira) Forest.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revata was the youngest brother 
of the Chief Disciple, Sariputta. He was the only one of the brothers and 
sisters of Sariputta who had not left home for the homeless life. His parents 
were very anxious to get him married. Revata was only seven years old when his 
parents arranged a marriage for him to a young girl. At the wedding reception, 
he met an old lady who was one hundred and twenty years old, and he realized 
that all beings are subject to ageing and decay. So, he ran away from the house 
and went straight to a monastery, where there were thirty bhikkhus. Those 
bhikkhus had been requested earlier by Thera Sariputta to make his brother a 
samanera if he should come to them. Accordingly, he was made a samanera and 
Thera Sariputta was informed about it.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samanera Revata took a subject of 
meditation from those bhikkhus and left for an acacia forest, thirty yojanas 
away from the monastery. At the end of the vassa, the samanera attained 
arahatship. Thera Sariputta then asked permission from the Buddha to visit his 
brother, but the Buddha replied that he himself would go there. So the Buddha 
accompanied by Thera Sariputta, Thera Sivali and five hundred other bhikkhus set 
out to visit Samanera Revata. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The journey was long, the road 
was rough and the area was uninhabited by people; but the devas looked to all 
the needs of the Buddha and the bhikkhus on the way. At an interval of every 
yojana, a monastery and food were provided, and they travelled at the rate of a 
yojana a day. Revata, learning about the visit of the Buddha, also made 
arrangements to welcome him. By supernormal power he created a special monastery 
for the Buddha and five hundred monasteries for the other bhikkhus, and made 
them comfortable throughout their stay there.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On their return journey, they 
travelled at the same rate as before, and came to the Pubbarama monastery on the 
eastern end of Savatthi at the end of the month. From there, they went to the 
house of Visakha, who offered them alms-food. After the meal, Visakha asked the 
Buddha if the place of Revata in the acacia forest was pleasant.</P>
<P align=center>And the Buddha answered in verse as follows:</P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the Jetavana 
monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (99) of this book, with reference to a woman 
of doubtful character.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bhikkhu, after taking a subject 
of meditation from the Buddha, was practising meditation in an old garden. A 
woman of doubtful character came into the garden and, seeing the bhikkhu, tried 
to attract his attention and seduce him. The thera got frightened; at the same 
time, his whole body was diffused with some kind of delightful satisfaction. The 
Buddha saw him from his monastery, and with his supernormal power, sent rays of 
light to him, and the bhikkhu received this message, which said, <I><FONT

for bhikkhus; bhikkhus should take delight in forests where worldlings find no 
pleasure."</FONT></I></P>
