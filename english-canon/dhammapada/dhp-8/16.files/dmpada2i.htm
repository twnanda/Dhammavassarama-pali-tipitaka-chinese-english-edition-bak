      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha uttered 
      Verse (197) to (199) of this book, in the Sakyan country, with reference 
      to his relatives who were quarrelling over the use of the water from the 
      Rohini river. </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kapilavatthu the 
      town of the Sakyans and Koliya the town of the Kolyans were situated on 
      either side of the Rohini river. The cultivators of both towns worked the 
      fields watered by the Rohini river. One year, they did not have enough 
      rain and finding that the paddy and other crops were beginning to shrivel 
      up, cultivators on both sides wanted to divert the water from the Rohini 
      river to their own fields. Those living in Koliya said that there was not 
      enough water in the river for both sides, and that if only they could 
      channel the water just once more to their fields that would be enough for 
      the paddy to mature and ripen. On the other hand, people from Kapilavatthu 
      argued that, in that case, they would be denied the use of the water and 
      their crops would surely fail, and they would be compelled to buy from 
      other people. They said that they were not prepared to go carrying their 
      money and valuables to the opposite bank of the river in exchange for 
      food.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both sides wanted 
      the water for their own use only and there was much ill will between them 
      due to abusive language and accusations on both sides. The quarrel that 
      started between the cultivators came to the ears of the ministers 
      concerned, and they reported the matter to their respective rulers, and 
      both sides prepared to go to war.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha, 
      surveying the world with his supernormal powers, saw his relatives on both 
      sides of the river coming out to meet in battle and he decided to stop 
      them. All alone, he went to them by going through the sky, and stopped 
      immediately above the middle of the river. His relatives seeing him, 
      powerfully and yet peacefully sitting above them in the sky, hid aside all 
      their weapons and paid obeisance to the Buddha. Then, the Buddha said to 
      them, <I><FONT color=#800040>"For the sake of some water, which is of 
      little value, you should not destroy your lives which are of so much value 
      and priceless. Why have you taken this stupid action? If I had not stopped 
      you today, your blood would have been flowing like a river by now. You 
      live hating your enemies, but I have none to hate; you are ailing with 
      moral defilements, but I am free from them; you are striving to have 
      sensual pleasures, but I do not strive for them."</FONT></I></P>

    <TD vAlign=top align=left>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha uttered Verse (200) 
      of this book in a brahmin village known as Pancasala (village of five 
      halls), with reference to Mara. </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On one occasion, the Buddha saw 
      in his vision that five hundred maidens from Pancasala village were due to 
      attain Sotapatti Fruition. So he went to stay near that village. The five 
      hundred maidens went to the riverside to have a bath; after the bath they 
      returned to the village fully dressed up, because it was a festival day. 
      About the same time, the Buddha entered Pancasila village for alms-food 
      but none of the villagers offered him anything because they had been 
      possessed by Mara.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On his return the Buddha met 
      Mara, who promptly asked him whether he had received much alms-food.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha saw the hand of Mara 
      in his failure to get any alms-food on that day and replied, <I><FONT 
      color=#800040>"You wicked Mara! It was you who turned the villagers 
      against me. Because they were possessed by you they did not offer any 
      alms-food to me. Am I not right ?"</FONT></I> Mara made no reply to that 
      question, but he thought that it would be fun to entice the Buddha back to 
      the village and get the villagers to insult the Buddha by making fun of 
      him. So he suggested, <FONT color=#ff0080>"O Buddha, why don't you go back 
      to the village again? This time, you are sure to get some 
food."</FONT></P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just then, the five hundred 
      village maidens arrived on the scene and paid obeisance to the Buddha. In 
      their presence, Mara taunted the Buddha, <FONT color=#ff0080>"O Buddha, 
      since you received no alms-food this morning, you must be feeling the 
      pangs of hunger!" </FONT>To him the Buddha replied,<I><FONT color=#800040> 
      "O wicked Mara, even though we do not get any food, like the Abhassara 
      brahmas who live only on the delightful satisfaction (piti) and bliss

      nephew.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fighting against Ajatasattu, 
      the King of Kosala was defeated three times. Ajatasattu was the son of 
      King Bimbisara and Queen Vedehi, the sister of the King of Kosala. The 
      King of Kosala was ashamed and very much depressed over his defeat. Thus 
      his lamentation:<FONT color=#0000ff> "What a disgrace! I cannot even 
      conquer this boy who still smells of mother's milk. It is better that I 
      should die." </FONT>Feeling depressed and very much ashamed, the king 
      refused to take food, and kept to his bed. The news about the king's 
      distress spread like wild fire and when the Buddha came to learn about it,

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the day a young woman was to 
      be wedded to a young man, the parents of the bride invited the Buddha and 
      eighty of his disciples for alms-food. Seeing the girl as she moved about 
      the house, helping with the offering of alms-food, the bridegroom was very 
      much excited, and he could hardly attend to the needs of the Buddha and 
      the other bhikkhus. The Buddha knew exactly how the young bridegroom was 
      feeling and also that time was ripe for both the bride and the bridegroom 
      to attain Sotapatti Fruition. </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By his supernormal power, the 
      Buddha willed that the bride would not be visible to the bridegroom. When 
      the young man could no longer see the young woman, he could pay full 
      attention to the Buddha, and his love and respect for the Buddha grew 
      stronger in him. Then the Buddha said to the young man, <FONT

      lay-disciple.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, the Buddha saw in 
      his vision that a poor man would attain Sotapatti Fruition at the village 
      of Alavi. So he went to that village, which was thirty yojanas away from 
      Savatthi. It so happened that on that very day the man lost his ox. So, he 
      had to be looking for the ox. Meanwhile, alms-food was being offered to 
      the Buddha and his disciples in a house in the village of Alavi. After the 
      meal, people got ready to listen to the Buddha's discourse; but the Buddha 
      waited for the young man. Finally, having found his ox, the man came 
      running to the house where the Buddha was. The man was tired and hungry, 
      so the Buddha directed the donors to offer food to him. Only when the man 
      had been fed, the Buddha gave a discourse, expounding the Dhamma step by 
      step and finally leading to the Four Noble Truths. The lay-disciple 
      attained Sotapatti Fruition at the end of the discourse.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterwards, the Buddha and 
      his disciples returned to the Jetavana monastery. On the way, the bhikkhus 
      remarked that it was so surprising that the Buddha should have directed 
      those people to feed the young man before he gave the discourse. On 
      hearing their remarks, the Buddha said, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Bhikkhus! 
      What you said is true, but you do not understand that I have come here, 
      all this distance of thirty yojanas, because I knew that he was in a 
      fitting condition to take in the Dhamma. If he were feeling very hungry, 
      the pangs of hunger might have prevented him from taking in the Dhamma 
      fully. That man had been out looking for his ox the whole morning, and was 
      very tired and also very hungry. Bhikkhus After all, there is no ailment

      bushel) of rice with meat curry on that day; so while listening to the 
      Buddha's discourse he felt very sleepy and was nodding most of the time. 
      Seeing him nodding, the Buddha advised him to take a little less rice 
      everyday and to decrease the amount on a sliding scale to the minimum of 
      one-sixteenth part of the original amount he was taking. The king did as 
      he was told and found that by eating less he became thin, but he felt very 
      much lighter and enjoyed much better health. When he told the Buddha about 
      this, the Buddha said to him,<I><FONT color=#800040> "O king! Health is a

      this book, with reference to Sakka, king of the devas.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About ten months before 
      the Buddha realized parinibbana, the Buddha was spending the vassa at 
      Veluva village near Vesali. While he was staying there, he suffered from 
      dysentery. When Sakka learned that the Buddha was ailing, he came to 
      Veluva village so that he could personally nurse the Buddha during his 
      sickness. The Buddha told him not to worry about his health as there were 
      many bhikkhus near him; but Sakka did not listen to him and kept on 
      nursing the Buddha until he recovered. </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bhikkhus were 
      surprised and awe-struck to find Sakka himself attending on the Buddha. 
      When the Buddha heard their remarks he said, <I><FONT 
      color=#800040>"Bhikkhus! There is nothing surprising about Sakka's love 
      and devotion to me. Once, when the former Sakka was growing old and was 
      about to pass away, he came to see me. Then, I expounded the Dhamma to 
      him. While listening to the Dhamma, he attained Sotapatti Fruition; then 
      he passed away and was reborn as the present Sakka. All these happened to 
      him simply because he listened to the Dhamma expounded by me. Indeed, 
      bhikkhus, it is good to see the Noble Ones (ariyas); it is a pleasure to 
      live with them; to live with fools is, indeed, painful."</FONT></I></P>

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On one festival day, the 
      Buddha entered the city of Rajagaha for alms-food, accompanied by a number 
      of bhikkhus. On their way, they met five hundred boys going to a pleasure 
      garden. The boys were carrying some baskets of pan-cakes but they did not

      and his bhikkhus rested under the shade of a tree. Just at that moment

      as they were told. The Buddha accepted their offering of pan-cakes. Later,

      Kassapa, the Buddha said to them, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Bhikkhus, all

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nandiya was a rich man

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While residing at the 
      Nigrodharama monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (221) of this book, with 
      reference to Princess Rohini, sister of Thera Anuruddha.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one occasion, Thera 
      Anuruddha visited Kapilavatthu. While he was staying at the monastery 
      there, all his relatives, with the exception of his sister Rohini, came to 
      see him. On learning from them that Rohini did not come because she was 
      suffering from leprosy, he sent for her. Covering her head in shame, 
      Rohini came when she was sent for. Thera Anuruddha told her to do some 
      meritorious deed and he suggested that she should sell some of her 
      clothing and jewelry; and with the money raised, to build a refectory for 
      the bhikkhu. Rohini agreed to do as she was told. Thera Anuruddha also 
      asked his other relatives to help in the construction of the hall. 
      Further, he told Rohini to sweep the floor and fill the water-pots every 
      day even while the construction was still going on. She did as she was 
      instructed and she began to get better.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the hall was 
      completed, the Buddha and his bhikkhus were invited for alms-food. After 
      the meal, the Buddha asked for the donor of the building and alms-food, 
      but Rohini was not there. So the Buddha sent for her and she came. The 
      Buddha asked her whether she knew why she was inflicted with this dreaded 
      disease and she answered that she did not know. So the Buddha told her 
      that she had the dreadful disease because of an evil deed she bad done out 
      of spite and anger, in one of her past existences. As explained by the 
      Buddha, Rohini was, at one time, the chief queen of the king of Baranasi. 
      It so happened that the king had a favourite dancer and the chief queen 
      was very jealous of her. So the queen wanted to punish the dancer. Thus 
      one day, she had her attendants put some itching powder made from cow-hage 
      pods in the dancer's bed, her blankets, etc. Next, they called the dancer, 
      and as though in jest, they threw some itching powder on her. The girl 
      itched all over and was in great pain and discomfort. Thus itching 
      unbearably, she ran to her room and her bed, which made her suffer even 
      more.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of that evil 
      deed Rohini had become a leper in this existence. The Buddha then exhorted 
      the congregation not to act foolishly in anger and not to bear any ill 
      will towards others.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Buddha spoke in

      this book, with reference to a bhikkhu.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, a bhikkhu from Alavi 
      wanted to build a monastery for himself and so he began to cut down a 
      tree. The deva dwelling in that tree (rukkha devata) tried to stop him, 
      saying that she and her infant son had nowhere to go. Failing to stop the 
      bhikkhu she put her son on a branch, hoping that it would stop him from 
      felling the tree. By then, the bhikkhu was already swinging his axe and he 
      could not stop it in time and unintentionally cut off an arm of the child. 
      Seeing her child being harmed in this way, the mother flew in a rage and 
      was about to kill the bhikkhu. As she raised her hands to strike the 
      bhikkhu, she suddenly checked herself and thought, <FONT color=#0000ff>"If 
      I were to kill a bhikkhu, I would be killing one who observes the moral 
      precepts (sila); in that case, I would surely suffer in niraya. Other 
      guardian devas of the trees would be following my example and other 
      bhikkhus would also be killed. But this bhikkhu has a master; I must go 
      and see his master." </FONT>So she went weeping to the Buddha and related 
      all that had happened.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To her the Buddha said,

      While residing at the Veluvana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (223) 
      of this book, with reference to Uttara, a female lay-disciple.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Uttara was the daughter of a farm labourer named Punna and his wife. Punna 
      worked for a rich man named Sumana, in Rajagaha. One day, Punna and his 
      wife offered alms-food to Thera Sariputta soon after his arising from 
      sustained deep mental absorption (nirodha samapatti), and as a result of 
      that good deed they suddenly became very rich. Punna came upon gold in the 
      field he was ploughing, and the king officially declared him a royal 
      banker. On one occasion, the family of Punna offered alms-food to the 
      Buddha and the bhikkhus for seven days. and on the seventh day, after 
      hearing the Buddha's discourse, all the three members of the family 
      attained Sotapatti Fruition.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Later, Uttara the daughter of Punna married the son of the rich man 
      Sumana. That family being non-Buddhist, Uttara did not feel happy in her 
      husband's home. So, she told her father,<FONT color=#0000ff> "My father, 
      why have you put me in this cage? Here, I do not see any bhikkhu and I 
      have no chance to offer anything to any bhikkhu."</FONT> Her father felt 
      sorry for her and sent her fifteen thousand in cash. With this money, 
      after getting permission from her husband, Uttara engaged a courtesan to 
      look to the needs of her husband. So it was arranged that Sirima, a 
      well-known and very beautiful courtesan, was to take her place as a wife 
      for fifteen days.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      During that time, Uttara offered alms-food to the Buddha and the bhikkhus. 
      On the fifteenth day, as she was busy preparing food in the kitchen, her 
      husband saw her from the bedroom window and smiled, and then muttered to 
      himself, <FONT color=#ff00ff>"How foolish she is! She does not know how to 
      enjoy herself. She is tiring herself out with this alms-giving 
      ceremony!"</FONT> Sirima saw him smile, and forgetting that she was only a 
      paid substitute wife felt very jealous of Uttara. Being unable to control 
      herself, Sirima went into the kitchen and got a ladleful of boiling butter 
      with the intention of pouring it over the head of Uttara. Uttara saw her 
      coming, but she bore no ill will towards Sirima. She reflected that 
      because Sirima had stood in for her, she had been able to listen to the 
      dhamma, make offerings of alms-food for fifteen days, and perform other 
      acts of charity. Thus she was quite thankful to Sirima. Suddenly, she 
      realized that Sirima had come very close to her and was going to pour 
      boiling-hot butter over her; so she made this asseveration: <FONT 
      color=#0000ff>"If I bear any ill will towards Sirima may this boiling-hot 
      butter burn me; if I have no ill will towards her may it not burn 
      me."</FONT></P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As 
      Uttara had no ill will towards Sirima, the boiling butter poured over her 
      head by Sirima was just like cold water. Then Sirima thought the butter 
      must have gone cold; and as she went for another ladleful of boiling 
      butter, the attendants of Uttara fell upon her and beat her hard. Uttara 
      stopped her attendants and instructed them to rub Sirima with medicinal 
      ointment.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Then, Sirima remembered her true position and she regretted that she had 
      done wrong to Uttara and asked Uttara to forgive her. To her Uttara 
      replied,<FONT color=#0000ff> "I have my father; I shall ask him whether I 
      should accept your apology." </FONT>Sirima then said that she would 
      readily go and apologize to the rich man, the father of Uttara. Uttara 
      then explained to Sirima, <FONT color=#0000ff>"Sirima,. when I said 'My 
      father', I did not mean my real father, who had brought me into this round 
      of rebirths. I was referring to my father, the Buddha, who had helped me 
      break the chain of rebirths, who had taught me the Dhamma, the Noble 
      Truths."</FONT> Sirima then expressed her wish to see the Buddha. So it 
      was arranged that Sirima should offer alms-food to the Buddha and the 
      bhikkhus on the following day at the house of Uttara.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      After the meal, the Buddha was told everything that had happened between 
      Sirima and Uttara. Sirima then owned up that she had done wrong to Uttara 
      and entreated the Buddha that she should be forgiven, for otherwise Uttara 
      would not forgive her. The Buddha then asked Uttara how she felt in her 
      mind when Sirima poured boiling butter on her head, and Uttara 
      answered,<FONT color=#0000ff>"Venerable Sir, because I owed so much to 
      Sirima I had resolved not to lose my temper, not to bear any ill will 
      towards her. I sent forth my love towards her". </FONT>The Buddha then 
      said, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Well done, well done, Uttara! By not bearing 
      any ill will you have been able to conquer one who has done you wrong 
      through hate. By not abusing, you should conquer one who abuses you; by 
      being generous you should conquer one who is stingy; by speaking the truth 
      you should conquer one who tells lies."</FONT></I></P>

      While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (224) 
      of this book, with reference to the question raised by Thera Maha 
      Moggallana.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Once, Thera Maha Moggallana visited the deva world and found many devas 
      living in luxurious mansions. He asked them for what good deed they were 
      reborn in the deva world and they gave him different answers. One of them 
      was reborn in the deva world not because he gave away much wealth in 
      charity or because he had listened to the dhamma, but just because he 
      always spoke the truth. The second one was a female deva who was reborn in 
      the deva world because she did not get angry with her master and had no 
      ill will towards him even though he often beat her and abused her. For 
      keeping her temper and abandoning hatred she was reborn in the deva world. 
      Then, there were others who were reborn in the deva world because they had 
      offered little things like a stick of sugar cane, a fruit, or some 
      vegetables to a bhikkhu or to someone else. </P>
      <P align=justify>On his return from the deva world, Thera Maha Moggallana 
      asked the Buddha whether it was possible to gain such great benefits by 
      just speaking the truth, or by restraining one's actions, or by giving 
      small amounts of such trifling things like fruits and vegetables. To him 
      the Buddha answered, "My son, why do you ask? Have you not seen for 
      yourself and heard what the devas said? You should not have any doubt. 
      Little deeds of merit surely lead one to the world of the devas."</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      While residing at the Anjana wood, near Saketa, the Buddha uttered Verse 
      (225) of this book, with reference to a brahmin, who claimed that the 
      Buddha was his son.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Once, the Buddha accompanied by some bhikkhus entered the town of Saketa 
      for alms-food. The old brahmin, seeing the Buddha, went to him and said, 
      <FONT color=#0000ff>"O son, why have you not allowed us to see you all 
      this long time? Come with me and let your mother also see you."</FONT> So 
      saying, he invited the Buddha to his house. On reaching the house, the 
      wife of the brahmin said the same things tothe Buddha and introduced the 
      Buddha as "Your big brother" to her children, and made them pay obeisance 
      to him. From that day, the couple offered alms-food to the Buddha every 
      day, and having heard the religious discourses, both the brahmin and his 
      wife attained Anagami Fruition in due course.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The bhikkhus were puzzled why the brahmin couple said the Buddha was their 
      son; so they asked the Buddha. The Buddha then replied, <I><FONT 
      color=#800040>"Bhikkhus, they called me son because I was a son or a 
      nephew to each of them for one thousand five hundred existences in the 
      past." </FONT></I>The Buddha continued to stay there, near the brahmin 
      couple for three more months and during that lime, both the brahmin and 
      his wife attained arahatship, and then realized parinibbana.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      The bhikkhus, not knowing that the brahmin couple had already become 
      arahats, asked the Buddha where they were reborn. To them the Buddha 
      answered:</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      <I><FONT color=#800040>"Those who have become arahats are not reborn any

      While residing at the Gijjhakuta mountain, the Buddha uttered Verse (226) 
      of this book, with reference to a slave girl in Rajagaha. </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      One night, Punna the slave girl was up pounding rice for her master. As 
      she got tired she rested for a while. While resting, she saw Thera Dabba 
      leading some bhikkhus to their respective monasteries on their return from 
      listening to the Dhamma. The girl seeing them up so late, pondered,<FONT 
      color=#0000ff> "I have to be up at this late hour because I am so poor and 
      have to work hard. But, why are these good people up at this late hour? 
      May be a bhikkhu is sick, or are they being troubled by a 
      snake?"</FONT></P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Early in the morning the next day, Punna took some broken rice, soaked it 
      in water and made a pan-cake out of it. Then, intending to eat it at the 
      riverside she took her cheap, coarse pan-cake along with her. On the way, 
      she saw the Buddha coming on an alms-round. She wanted to offer her 
      pan-cake to the Buddha, but she was not sure whether the Buddha would 
      condescend to eat such cheap, coarse pan-cake. The Buddha knew her 
      thoughts. He accepted her pan-cake and asked Thera Ananda to spread the 
      small mat on the ground. The Buddha sat on the mat and ate the pan-cake 
      offered by the slave girl. After eating, the Buddha called Punna to him 
      and answered the question which was troubling her. Said the Buddha to the 
      slave girl, <I><FONT color=#800040>"Punna, you cannot go to sleep because 
      you are poor and so have to work hard. As for my sons the bhikkhus, they

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      Once, Atula and his companions numbering five hundred, wishing to listen 
      to words of dhamma, went to Thera Revata. The thera however was very aloof 
      like a lion; he did not say anything to them. They were very much 
      dissatisfied and so they went to Thera Sariputta. When Thera Sariputta 
      learned why they bad come, he expounded exhaustively on the Abhidhamma. He 
      also was not to their liking, and they grumbled that Thera Sariputta had 
      been too lengthy and too profound. Next, Atula and his party approached 
      Thera Ananda. Thera Ananda expounded to them the bare essentials of the 
      Dhamma. This time, they remarked that Thera Ananda had been too brief and 
      too sketchy. Finally they came to the Buddha and said to him,<FONT 
      color=#0000ff> "Venerable Sir, we have come to listen to your teaching. We 
      have been to other teachers before we come here, but we are not satisfied 
      with any of them. Thera Revata did not bother to teach us and he just kept 
      silent; Thera Sariputta was too exhaustive and the Dhamma he taught us was 
      too difficult for us. As for Thera Ananda, he was too brief and too 
      sketchy. We do not like any of their discourses."</FONT></P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To 
      them the Buddha said, <I><FONT color=#800040>"My disciples, blaming others 
      is not something new. There is no one in this world who is never blamed; 
      people would blame even a king, or even a Buddha. To be blamed or to be
