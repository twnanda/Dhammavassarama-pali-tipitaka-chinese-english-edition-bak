    Story of the Pacification of the <a NAME="relatives">Relatives </a>of the Buddha</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha uttered Verse (197) to (199) of this book, in
    the Sakyan country, with reference to his relatives who were quarrelling over the use of
    the water from the Rohini river. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kapilavatthu the town of the Sakyans and Koliya the town
    of the Kolyans were situated on either side of the Rohini river. The cultivators of both
    towns worked the fields watered by the Rohini river. One year, they did not have enough
    rain and finding that the paddy and other crops were beginning to shrivel up, cultivators
    on both sides wanted to divert the water from the Rohini river to their own fields. Those
    living in Koliya said that there was not enough water in the river for both sides, and
    that if only they could channel the water just once more to their fields that would be
    enough for the paddy to mature and ripen. On the other hand, people from Kapilavatthu
    argued that, in that case, they would be denied the use of the water and their crops would
    surely fail, and they would be compelled to buy from other people. They said that they
    were not prepared to go carrying their money and valuables to the opposite bank of the
    river in exchange for food.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Both sides wanted the water for their own use only and
    there was much ill will between them due to abusive language and accusations on both
    sides. The quarrel that started between the cultivators came to the ears of the ministers
    concerned, and they reported the matter to their respective rulers, and both sides
    prepared to go to war.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha, surveying the world with his supernormal
    powers, saw his relatives on both sides of the river coming out to meet in battle and he
    decided to stop them. All alone, he went to them by going through the sky, and stopped
    immediately above the middle of the river. His relatives seeing him, powerfully and yet
    peacefully sitting above them in the sky, hid aside all their weapons and paid obeisance
    to the Buddha. Then, the Buddha said to them, <i>&quot;For the sake of some water, which
    is of little value, you should not destroy your lives which are of so much value and
    priceless. Why have you taken this stupid action? If I had not stopped you today, your
    blood would have been flowing like a river by now. You live hating your enemies, but I
    have none to hate; you are ailing with moral defilements, but I am free from them; you are
    striving to have sensual pleasures, but I do not strive for them.&quot;</i></font></p>

    village known as Pancasala (village of five halls), with reference to Mara. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On one occasion, the Buddha saw in his vision that five
    hundred maidens from Pancasala village were due to attain Sotapatti Fruition. So he went
    to stay near that village. The five hundred maidens went to the riverside to have a bath;
    after the bath they returned to the village fully dressed up, because it was a festival
    day. About the same time, the Buddha entered Pancasila village for alms-food but none of
    the villagers offered him anything because they had been possessed by Mara.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On his return the Buddha met Mara, who promptly asked him
    whether he had received much alms-food.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha saw the hand of Mara in his failure to get any
    alms-food on that day and replied, <i>&quot;You wicked Mara! It was you who turned the
    villagers against me. Because they were possessed by you they did not offer any alms-food
    to me. Am I not right ?&quot;</i> Mara made no reply to that question, but he thought that
    it would be fun to entice the Buddha back to the village and get the villagers to insult
    the Buddha by making fun of him. So he suggested, &quot;O Buddha, why don't you go back to
    the village again? This time, you are sure to get some food.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just then, the five hundred village maidens arrived on the
    scene and paid obeisance to the Buddha. In their presence, Mara taunted the Buddha,
    &quot;O Buddha, since you received no alms-food this morning, you must be feeling the
    pangs of hunger!&quot; To him the Buddha replied,<i> &quot;O wicked Mara, even though we
    do not get any food, like the Abhassara brahmas who live only on the delightful
    satisfaction (piti) and bliss (sukha) of jhana, we shall live on the delightful

    battle by Ajatasattu, his own nephew.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In fighting against Ajatasattu, the King of Kosala was
    defeated three times. Ajatasattu was the son of King Bimbisara and Queen Vedehi, the
    sister of the King of Kosala. The King of Kosala was ashamed and very much depressed over
    his defeat. Thus his lamentation:<font> &quot;What a disgrace! I cannot even conquer this
    boy who still smells of mother's milk. It is better that I should die.&quot; </font>Feeling
    depressed and very much ashamed, the king refused to take food, and kept to his bed. The
    news about the king's distress spread like wild fire and when the Buddha came to learn

    bride.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the day a young woman was to be wedded to a young man,
    the parents of the bride invited the Buddha and eighty of his disciples for alms-food.
    Seeing the girl as she moved about the house, helping with the offering of alms-food, the
    bridegroom was very much excited, and he could hardly attend to the needs of the Buddha
    and the other bhikkhus. The Buddha knew exactly how the young bridegroom was feeling and
    also that time was ripe for both the bride and the bridegroom to attain Sotapatti
    Fruition. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">By his supernormal power, the Buddha willed that the bride
    would not be visible to the bridegroom. When the young man could no longer see the young
    woman, he could pay full attention to the Buddha, and his love and respect for the Buddha
    grew stronger in him. Then the Buddha said to the young man, <i><font>&quot;O young man,

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day, the Buddha saw in his vision that a poor man
    would attain Sotapatti Fruition at the village of Alavi. So he went to that village, which
    was thirty yojanas away from Savatthi. It so happened that on that very day the man lost
    his ox. So, he had to be looking for the ox. Meanwhile, alms-food was being offered to the
    Buddha and his disciples in a house in the village of Alavi. After the meal, people got
    ready to listen to the Buddha's discourse; but the Buddha waited for the young man.
    Finally, having found his ox, the man came running to the house where the Buddha was. The
    man was tired and hungry, so the Buddha directed the donors to offer food to him. Only
    when the man had been fed, the Buddha gave a discourse, expounding the Dhamma step by step
    and finally leading to the Four Noble Truths. The lay-disciple attained Sotapatti Fruition
    at the end of the discourse.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Afterwards, the Buddha and his disciples returned to the
    Jetavana monastery. On the way, the bhikkhus remarked that it was so surprising that the
    Buddha should have directed those people to feed the young man before he gave the
    discourse. On hearing their remarks, the Buddha said, <i>&quot;Bhikkhus! What you said is
    true, but you do not understand that I have come here, all this distance of thirty
    yojanas, because I knew that he was in a fitting condition to take in the Dhamma. If he
    were feeling very hungry, the pains of hunger might have prevented him from taking in the
    Dhamma fully. That man had been out looking for his ox the whole morning, and was very
    tired and also very hungry. Bhikkhus after all, there is no ailment which is so difficult
    to bear as hunger.&quot;</i></font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day, King Pasenadi of Kosala went to the Jetavana
    monastery after having his full morning meal. It was said that the king had eaten one
    quarter basket (about half a bushel) of rice with meat curry on that day; so while
    listening to the Buddha's discourse he felt very sleepy and was nodding most of the time.
    Seeing him nodding, the Buddha advised him to take a little less rice everyday and to
    decrease the amount on a sliding scale to the minimum of one-sixteenth part of the
    original amount he was taking. The king did as he was told and found that by eating less
    he became thin, but he felt very much lighter and enjoyed much better health. When he told
    the Buddha about this, the Buddha said to him,<i> &quot;O king! Health is a great boon;

    resolved that he would attain arahatship in the life-time of the Buddha did not go to him,
    but left for a secluded place to practise meditation. Other bhikkhus, not understanding
    his behaviour, took him to the Buddha and said, <font>&quot;Venerable Sir, this bhikkhu
    does not seem to cherish and honour you; he only keeps to himself instead of coming to
    your presence.&quot; </font>Thera Tissa then explained to them that he was striving hard
    to attain arahatship before the Buddha realized parinibbana, and that was the only reason
    why he had not come to see the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having heard his explanation, the Buddha said to the

    was suffering from leprosy, he sent for her. Covering her head in shame, Rohini came when
    she was sent for. Thera Anuruddha told her to do some meritorious deed and he suggested
    that she should sell some of her clothing and jewelry; and with the money raised, to build
    a refectory for the bhikkhu. Rohini agreed to do as she was told. Thera Anuruddha also
    asked his other relatives to help in the construction of the hall. Further, he told Rohini

    and alms-food, but Rohini was not there. So the Buddha sent for her and she came. The
    Buddha asked her whether she knew why she was inflicted with this dreaded disease and she
    answered that she did not know. So the Buddha told her that she had the dreadful disease
    because of an evil deed she bad done out of spite and anger, in one of her past
    existences. As explained by the Buddha, Rohini was, at one time, the chief queen of the
    king of Baranasi. It so happened that the king had a favourite dancer and the chief queen
    was very jealous of her. So the queen wanted to punish the dancer. Thus one day, she had
    her attendants put some itching powder made from cow-hage pods in the dancer's bed, her
    blankets, etc. Next, they called the dancer, and as though in jest, they threw some
    itching powder on her. The girl itched all over and was in great pain and discomfort. Thus
    itching unbearably, she ran to her room and her bed, which made her suffer even more.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a result of that evil deed Rohini had become a leper in
    this existence. The Buddha then exhorted the congregation not to act foolishly in anger
    and not to bear any ill will towards others.</font></p>

    The story of <a name="uttara">Uttara</a> the Lay-Disciple </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Veluvana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (223) of this book, with reference to Uttara, a female lay-disciple.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Uttara was the daughter of a farm labourer named Punna and
    his wife. Punna worked for a rich man named Sumana, in Rajagaha. One day, Punna and his
    wife offered alms-food to Thera Sariputta soon after his arising from sustained deep
    mental absorption (nirodha samapatti), and as a result of that good deed they suddenly
    became very rich. Punna came upon gold in the field he was ploughing, and the king
    officially declared him a royal banker. On one occasion, the family of Punna offered
    alms-food to the Buddha and the bhikkhus for seven days. and on the seventh day, after
    hearing the Buddha's discourse, all the three members of the family attained Sotapatti
    Fruition.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Later, Uttara the daughter of Punna married the son of the
    rich man Sumana. That family being non-Buddhist, Uttara did not feel happy in her
    husband's home. So, she told her father,<font> &quot;My father, why have you put me in
    this cage? Here, I do not see any bhikkhu and I have no chance to offer anything to any
    bhikkhu.&quot;</font> Her father felt sorry for her and sent her fifteen thousand in cash.
    With this money, after getting permission from her husband, Uttara engaged a courtesan to
    look to the needs of her husband. So it was arranged that Sirima, a well-known and very
    beautiful courtesan, was to take her place as a wife for fifteen days.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">During that time, Uttara offered alms-food to the Buddha
    and the bhikkhus. On the fifteenth day, as she was busy preparing food in the kitchen, her
    husband saw her from the bedroom window and smiled, and then muttered to himself, <font>&quot;How
    foolish she is! She does not know how to enjoy herself. She is tiring herself out with
    this alms-giving ceremony!&quot;</font> Sirima saw him smile, and forgetting that she was
    only a paid substitute wife felt very jealous of Uttara. Being unable to control herself,
    Sirima went into the kitchen and got a ladleful of boiling butter with the intention of
    pouring it over the head of Uttara. Uttara saw her coming, but she bore no ill will
    towards Sirima. She reflected that because Sirima had stood in for her, she had been able
    to listen to the dhamma, make offerings of alms-food for fifteen days, and perform other
    acts of charity. Thus she was quite thankful to Sirima. Suddenly, she realized that Sirima
    had come very close to her and was going to pour boiling-hot butter over her; so she made
    this asseveration: <font>&quot;If I bear any ill will towards Sirima may this boiling-hot
    butter burn me; if I have no ill will towards her may it not burn me.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As Uttara had no ill will towards Sirima, the boiling
    butter poured over her head by Sirima was just like cold water. Then Sirima thought the
    butter must have gone cold; and as she went for another ladleful of boiling butter, the
    attendants of Uttara fell upon her and beat her hard. Uttara stopped her attendants and
    instructed them to rub Sirima with medicinal ointment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then, Sirima remembered her true position and she
    regretted that she had done wrong to Uttara and asked Uttara to forgive her. To her Uttara
    replied, &quot;I have my father; I shall ask him whether I should accept your
    apology.&quot; Sirima then said that she would readily go and apologize to the rich man,
    the father of Uttara. Uttara then explained to Sirima, <font>&quot;Sirima,. when I said
    'My father', I did not mean my real father, who had brought me into this round of
    rebirths. I was referring to my father, the Buddha, who had helped me break the chain of
    rebirths, who had taught me the Dhamma, the Noble Truths.&quot;</font> Sirima then
    expressed her wish to see the Buddha. So it was arranged that Sirima should offer
    alms-food to the Buddha and the bhikkhus on the following day at the house of Uttara.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the meal, the Buddha was told everything that had
    happened between Sirima and Uttara. Sirima then owned up that she had done wrong to Uttara
    and entreated the Buddha that she should be forgiven, for otherwise Uttara would not
    forgive her. The Buddha then asked Uttara how she felt in her mind when Sirima poured
    boiling butter on her head, and Uttara answered,&quot;Venerable Sir, because I owed so
    much to Sirima I had resolved not to lose my temper, not to bear any ill will towards her.
    I sent forth my love towards her&quot;. The Buddha then said, <i>&quot;Well done, well
    done, Uttara! By not bearing any ill will you have been able to conquer one who has done
    you wrong through hate. By not abusing, you should conquer one who abuses you; by being
    generous you should conquer one who is stingy; by speaking the truth you should conquer
    one who tells lies.&quot;</i></font></p>

    found many devas living in luxurious mansions. He asked them for what good deed they were
    reborn in the deva world and they gave him different answers. One of them was reborn in
    the deva world not because he gave away much wealth in charity or because he had listened
    to the dhamma, but just because he always spoke the truth. The second one was a female
    deva who was reborn in the deva world because she did not get angry with her master and
    had no ill will towards him even though he often beat her and abused her. For keeping her
    temper and abandoning hatred she was reborn in the deva world. Then, there were others who
    were reborn in the deva world because they had offered little things like a stick of sugar
    cane, a fruit, or some vegetables to a bhikkhu or to someone else. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On his return from the deva world, Thera Maha Moggallana
    asked the Buddha whether it was possible to gain such great benefits by just speaking the
    truth, or by restraining one's actions, or by giving small amounts of such trifling things
    like fruits and vegetables. To him the Buddha answered, &quot;My son, why do you ask? Have
    you not seen for yourself and heard what the devas said? You should not have any doubt.
    Little deeds of merit surely lead one to the world of the devas.&quot;</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Anjana wood, near Saketa, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (225) of this book, with reference to a brahmin, who claimed that the Buddha
    was his son.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, the Buddha accompanied by some bhikkhus entered the
    town of Saketa for alms-food. The old brahmin, seeing the Buddha, went to him and said, <font>&quot;O
    son, why have you not allowed us to see you all this long time? Come with me and let your
    mother also see you.&quot;</font> So saying, he invited the Buddha to his house. On
    reaching the house, the wife of the brahmin said the same things tothe Buddha and
    introduced the Buddha as &quot;Your big brother&quot; to her children, and made them pay
    obeisance to him. From that day, the couple offered alms-food to the Buddha every day, and
    having heard the religious discourses, both the brahmin and his wife attained Anagami
    Fruition in due course.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The bhikkhus were puzzled why the brahmin couple said the
    Buddha was their son; so they asked the Buddha. The Buddha then replied, <i>&quot;Bhikkhus,
    they called me son because I was a son or a nephew to each of them for one thousand five
    hundred existences in the past.&quot; </i>The Buddha continued to stay there, near the
    brahmin couple for three more months and during that lime, both the brahmin and his wife
    attained arahatship, and then realized parinibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The bhikkhus, not knowing that the brahmin couple had
    already become arahats, asked the Buddha where they were reborn. To them the Buddha
    answered:</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One night, Punna the slave girl was up pounding rice for
    her master. As she got tired she rested for a while. While resting, she saw Thera Dabba

    the Dhamma. The girl seeing them up so late, pondered,<font> &quot;I have to be up at this
    late hour because I am so poor and have to work hard. But, why are these good people up at
    this late hour? May be a bhikkhu is sick, or are they being troubled by a snake?&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Early in the morning the next day, Punna took some broken
    rice, soaked it in water and made a pan-cake out of it. Then, intending to eat it at the
    riverside she took her cheap, coarse pan-cake along with her. On the way, she saw the
    Buddha coming on an alms-round. She wanted to offer her pan-cake to the Buddha, but she
    was not sure whether the Buddha would condescend to eat such cheap, coarse pan-cake. The
    Buddha knew her thoughts. He accepted her pan-cake and asked Thera Ananda to spread the
    small mat on the ground. The Buddha sat on the mat and ate the pan-cake offered by the
    slave girl. After eating, the Buddha called Punna to him and answered the question which
    was troubling her. Said the Buddha to the slave girl, <i>&quot;Punna, you cannot go to

    so they went to Thera Sariputta. When Thera Sariputta learned why they bad come, he
    expounded exhaustively on the Abhidhamma. He also was not to their liking, and they
    grumbled that Thera Sariputta had been too lengthy and too profound. Next, Atula and his
    party approached Thera Ananda. Thera Ananda expounded to them the bare essentials of the
    Dhamma. This time, they remarked that Thera Ananda had been too brief and too sketchy.
    Finally they came to the Buddha and said to him,<font> &quot;Venerable Sir, we have come
    to listen to your teaching. We have been to other teachers before we come here, but we are
    not satisfied with any of them. Thera Revata did not bother to teach us and he just kept
    silent; Thera Sariputta was too exhaustive and the Dhamma he taught us was too difficult
    for us. As for Thera Ananda, he was too brief and too sketchy. We do not like any of their
