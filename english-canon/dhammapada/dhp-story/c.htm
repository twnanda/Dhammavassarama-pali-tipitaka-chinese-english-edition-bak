    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On one occasion, a certain bhikkhu, after taking a subject
    of meditation from the Buddha, went to the forest. Although he tried hard he made little
    progress in his meditation; so he decided to go back to the Buddha for further
    instruction. On his way back he saw a mirage, which, after all, was only an illusive
    appearance of a sheet of water. At that instant, he came to realize that the body also was
    insubstantial like a mirage. Thus keeping his mind on the insubstantiality of the body he
    came to the bank of the river Aciravati. While sitting under a tree close to the river,
    seeing big froths breaking up, he realized the impermanent nature of the body.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (47) of this book, with reference to Vitatubha, son of King Pasenadi of
    Kosala.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Pasenadi of Kosala, wishing to marry into the clan of
    the Sakyans, sent some emissaries to Kapilavatthu with a request for the hand of one of
    the Sakyan princesses. Not wishing to offend King Pasenadi, the Sakyan princes replied
    that they would comply with his request, but instead of a Sakyan princess they sent a very
    beautiful girl born of King Mahanama and a slave woman. King Pasenadi made that girl one
    of his chief queens and subsequently she gave birth to a son. This son was named
    Vitatubha. When the prince was sixteen years old, he was sent on a visit to King Mahanama
    and the Sakyan princes. There he was received with some hospitality but all the Sakyan
    princes who were younger than Vitatubha had been sent away to a village, so that they
    would not have to pay respect to Vitatubha. After staying a few days in Kapilavatthu,
    Vitatubha and his company left for home. Soon after they left, a slave girl was washing
    with milk the place where Vitatubha had sat; she was also cursing him, shouting,
    &quot;This is the place where that son of a slave woman had sat&quot;. At that moment, a
    member of Vitatubha's entourage returned to fetch something which he had left at the place
    and heard what the slave girl said. The slave girl also told him that Vitatubha's mother,
    Vasabhakhattiya, was the daughter of a slave girl belonging to Mahanama.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Vitatubha was told about the above incident, he
    became wild with rage and declared that one day he would wipe out the whole clan of the
    Sakyans. True to his word, when Vitatubha became king, he marched on the Sakyan clan and
    massacred them all, with the exception of a few who were with Mahanama and some others. On
    their way home, Vitatubha and his army encamped on the sandbank in the river Aciravati. As
    heavy rain fell in the upper parts of the country on that very night, the river swelled
    and rushed down with great force carrying away Vitatubha and his army into the ocean.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On hearing about these two tragic incidents, the Buddha
    explained to the bhikkhus that his relatives, the Sakyan princes, had in one of their
    previous existences, put poison into the river killing the fishes. It was as a result of
    that particular action that the Sakyan princes had to die en masse. Then, referring to the
    incident about Vitatubha and his army, the Buddha said, &quot;As a great flood sweeps away
    all the villagers in a sleeping village, so also, Death carries away all the creatures
    hankering after sensual pleasures.&quot;</font></p>

    The Story of <a NAME="Patipujika">Patipujika</a> Kumari</b></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
    While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (48) of this book, with
    reference to Patipujika Kumari.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Patipujika Kumari was a lady from Savatthi. She married at
    the age of sixteen and had four sons. She was a virtuous as well as a generous lady, who
    loved to make offerings of food and other requisites to the bhikkhus. She would often go
    to the monastery and clean up the premises, fill the pots and jars with water and perform
    other services. Patipujika. also possessed Jatissara Knowledge through which she
    remembered that in her previous existence she was one of the numerous wives of Malabhari,
    in the deva world of Tavatimsa. She also remembered that she had passed away from there
    when all of them were out in the garden enjoying themselves, plucking and picking flowers.
    So, every time she made offerings to the bhikkhus or performed any other meritorious act,
    she would pray that she might be reborn in the Tavatimsa realm as a wife of Malabhari, her
    previous husband.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day, Patipujika fell ill and passed away that same
    evening. As she had so ardently wished, she was reborn in Tavatimsa deva world as a wife
    of Malabhari. As one hundred years in the human world is equivalent to just one day in
    Tavatimsa world, Malabhari and his other wives were still in the garden enjoying
    themselves and Patipujika was barely missed by them. So, when she rejoined them, Malabhari
    asked her where she had been the whole morning. She then told him about her passing away
    from Tavatimsa, her rebirth in the human world, her marriage to a man and also about how
    she had given birth to four sons, her passing away from there and finally her return to
    Tavatimsa.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the bhikkhus learned about the death of Patipujika,
    they were stricken with grief. They went to the Buddha and reported that Patipujika, who
    was offering alms-food to them early in the morning, had passed away in the evening. To
    them the Buddha replied that the life of beings was very brief; and that before they could
    hardly be satiated in their sensual pleasures, they were overpowered by Death.</font></p>

    The Story of<a NAME="Kosiya,"> Kosiya</a>, the Miserly Rich Man</b></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (49) of this book, with reference to the Chief Disciple Maha Moggallana and
    the miserly rich man, Kosiya.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the village of Sakkara, near Rajagaha, there lived a
    miserly rich man by the name of Kosiya, who was very reluctant to give away even the
    tiniest part of anything belonging to him. One day, to avoid sharing with others, the rich
    man and his wife were making some pancakes in the uppermost storey of their house, where
    no one would see them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Early in the morning, on that day, the Buddha through his
    supernormal power, saw the rich man and his wife in his vision, and knew that both of them
    would soon attain Sotapatti Fruition. So he sent his Chief Disciple Maha Moggallana to the
    house of the rich man, with instructions to bring the couple to the Jetavana monastery in
    time for the midday meal. The Chief Disciple, by supernormal power, reached Kosiya's house
    in an instant and stood at the window. The rich man saw him and asked him to leave; the
    Venerable Maha Moggallana just stood there without saying anything. In the end, Kosiya
    said to his wife, &quot;Make a very small pancake and give it to the bhikkhu.&quot; So she
    took just a little amount of dough and put it in the pan, and the cake filled up the whole
    pan. Kosiya thought his wife must have put in too much, so he took just a pinch of dough
    and put it into the pan; his pancake also swelled into a big one. It so happened that
    however little dough they might put in, they wore unable to make small pancakes. At last,
    Kosiya asked his wife to offer one from the basket to the bhikkhu. When she tried to take
    out one from the basket it would not come off because all the pancakes were sticking
    together and could not be separated. By this time Kosiya has lost all appetite for
    pancakes and offered the whole basket of pancakes to Maha Moggallana. The Chief Disciple
    then delivered a discourse on charity to the rich man and his wife. He also told the
    couple about how the Buddha was waiting with five hundred bhikkhus at the Jetavana
    monastery in Savatthi, forty-five yojanas away from Rajagaha. Maha Moggallana, by his
    supernormal power, then took both Kosiya and his wife together with their basket of
    pancakes, to the presence of the Buddha. There, they offered the pancakes to the Buddha
    and the five hundred bhikkhus. At the end of the meal, the Buddha delivered a discourse on
    charity, and both Kosiya and his wife attained Sotapatti Fruition.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Next evening, while the bhikkhus were talking in praise of
    Maha Moggallana, the Buddha came to them and said, &quot;Bhikkhus, you should also dwell
    and act in the village like Maha Moggallana, receiving the offerings of the villagers
    without affecting their faith and generosity, or their wealth.&quot;</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A lay disciple named Chattapani who was an Anagami lived
    in Savatthi [<em>Anagami: one who has attained the third Magga</em>]. On one occasion,
    Chattapani was with the Buddha at the Jetavana monastery respectfully and attentively
    listening to a religious discourse, when King Pasenadi also came to the Buddha. Chattapani
    did not stand up because he thought that by standing up, it might mean that he was paying
    respect to the king, but not paying due respect to the Buddha. The king took that as an
    insult and was very much offended. The Buddha knew exactly how the king was feeling; so he
    spoke in praise of Chattapani, who was well-versed in the Dhamma and had also attained the
    Anagami Fruition. On hearing this, the king was impressed and favourably inclined towards
    Chattapani.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the king next met Chattapani he said, &quot;You are
    so learned; could you please come to the palace and give lessons of the Dhamma to my two
    queens?&quot; Chattapani declined but he suggested that the king should request the Buddha
    to assign a bhikkhu for this purpose. So, the king approached the Buddha in connection
    with this, and the Buddha directed the Venerable Ananda to go regularly to the palace and
    teach the Dhamma to queen Mallika and queen Vasabhakhattiya. After some time, the Buddha
    asked the Venerable Ananda about the progress of the two queens. The Venerable Ananda
    answered that although Mallika was learning the Dhamma seriously, Vasabhakhattiya was not
    paying proper attention. On hearing this the Buddha said that the Dhamma could be of

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Pubbarama monastery in Savatthi, the
    Buddha uttered Verse (53) of this book, with reference to Visakha, the famous donor of the
    Pubbarama monastery.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Visakha was the daughter of a rich man of Bhaddiya, named
    Danancaya, and his wife Sumanadevi, and the granddaughter of Mendaka, one of the five
    extremely wealthy men of' King Bimbisara's dominions. When Visakha was seven years old,
    the Buddha came on a tour to Bhaddiya. On that occasion, the rich man Mendaka took Visakha
    and her five hundred companions with him to pay homage to the Buddha. After hearing the
    discourse given by the Buddha, Visakha, her grandfather and all her five hundred
    companions attained Sotapatti Fruition.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Visakha came of age, she married Punnavadahana, son
    of Migara, a fairly rich man from Savatthi. One day, while Migara was having his meal, a
    bhikkhu stopped for alms at his house; but Migara completely ignored the bhikkhu. Visakha,
    seeing this, said to the bhikkhu, &quot;I am sorry, your reverence, my father-in-law only
    eats leftovers.&quot; On hearing this, Migara flew into a rage and told her to leave his
    house. But Visakha said she was not going away, and that she would send for the eight
    elderly rich men who were sent by her father to accompany her and to advise her. It was
    for them to decide whether she was guilty or not. When the elders came, Migara said to
    them, &quot;While I was having my rice-with-milk in a golden bowl, Visakha said that I was
    taking only dirt and filth. For this offence, I'm sending her away.&quot; Thereupon,
    Visakha explained as follows: &quot;When I saw my father-in-law completely ignoring the
    bhikkhu standing for alms-food, I thought to myself that my father-in-law was not doing
    any meritorious deed in this existence. he was only eating the fruits of has past good
    deeds. So, I said, 'My father-in-law only eats leftovers.' Now Sirs, what do you think, am
    I guilty?&quot; The elders decided that Visakha was not guilty. Visakha then said that she
    was one who had absolute and unshakable faith in the Teaching of the Buddha and so could
    not stay where the bhikkhus were not welcome; and also, that if she was not given
    permission to invite the bhikkhus to the house to offer alms-food and make other
    offerings, she would leave the house. So permission was granted her to invite the Buddha
    and his bhikkhus to the house. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next day, the Buddha and his disciples were invited to
    the house of Visakha When alms-food was about to be offered, she sent word to her
    father-in-law to join her in offering food; but he did not come. When the meal was over,
    again she sent a message, this time requesting her father-in-law to join her in hearing
    the discourse that would soon be given by the Buddha. Her father-in-law felt that he
    should not refuse for a second time. But his ascetic teachers, the Niganthas, would not
    let him go; however, they conceded that he could listen from behind a curtain. After
    hearing the Buddha's discourse Migara attained Sotapatti Fruition. He felt very thankful
    to the Buddha and also to his daughter-in-law. Being so thankful, he declared that
    henceforth Visakha would be like a mother to him, and Visakha came to be known as
    Migaramata.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Visakha gave birth to ten sons and ten daughters, and ten
    sons and ten daughters each were born to everyone of her children and grand-children.
    Visakha possessed an immensely valuable gem-encrusted cloak given by her father as a
    wedding present. One day, Visakha went to the Jetavana monastery with her entourage. On
    arrival at the monastery, she found that her bejeweled cloak was too heavy. So, she took
    it off, wrapped it up in her shawl, and gave it to the maid to hold it and take care of
    it. The maid absentmindedly left it at the monastery. It was the custom for the Venerable
    Ananda to look after the things left by any one of the lay disciples. Visakha sent the
    maid back to the monastery saying, &quot;Go and look for the bejeweled cloak, but if the
    Venerable Ananda had already found it and kept it in a place do not bring it back; I
    donate the bejeweled clock to the Venerable Ananda.&quot; But the Venerable Ananda did not
    accept her donation. So Visakha decided to sell the bejeweled cloak and donate the sale
    proceeds. But there was no one who could afford to buy that bejeweled cloak. So Visakha
    bought it back for nine crores and one lakh. With this money, she built a monastery on the
    eastern side of the city; this monastery came to be known as Pubbarama.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the libation ceremony she called all her family to
    her and on that night she told them that all her wishes had ken fulfilled and that she had
    nothing more to desire. Then reciting five verses of exultation she went round and round
    the monastery. Some bhikkhus hearing her, thought she was singing and reported to the
    Buddha that Visakha was not like before, and that she was going round and round the
    monastery, singing. &quot;Could it be that she had gone off her head?&quot; they asked the
    Buddha. To this question, the Buddha replied, &quot;Today, Visakha had all her wishes of
    the past and present existences fulfilled and on account of that sense of achievement, she
    was feeling elated and contented; Visakha was just reciting some verses of exultation; she
    certainly had not gone off her head. Visakha, throughout her previous existences, had
    always been a generous donor and an ardent promoter of the Doctrine of successive Buddhas.
    She was most strongly inclined to do good deeds and had done much good in her previous
    existences, just as an expert florist makes many garlands from a collection of flowers.</font></p>

    evening, the problem relating to scents and perfumes came to his mind and he pondered:
    &quot;The scent of wood, the scent of flowers, and the scent of roots all spread with the
    current of wind but not against it. Is there no scent which would spread with the current
    of wind as well as against it? Is there no scent which would pervade every part of the
    world?&quot; Without answering the question himself, the Venerable Ananda approached the
    Buddha and solicited an answer from him. The Buddha said, &quot;Ananda, supposing, there
    is one who takes refuge in the Three Gems (the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Samgha), who
    observes the five moral precepts, who is generous and not avaricious; such a man is truly
    virtuous and truly worthy of praise. The reputation of that virtuous one would spread far
    and wide, and bhikkhus, brahmins and laymen all alike would speak in praise of him,

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Arising from<i> nirodhasamapatti</i>*, Thera Mahakassapa
    entered a poor section of the city of Rajagaha for alms-food. His intention was to give a
    poor man an opportunity of gaining great merit as a result of offering alms-food to one
    who had just come out of <i>nirodhasamapatti</i>. Sakka, king of the devas, wishing to
    take the opportunity of offering alms-food to Thera Mahakassapa, assumed the form of a
    poor old weaver and came to Rajagaha with his wife Sujata in the form of an old woman.
    Thera Mahakassapa stood at their door; the poor old weaver took the bowl from the thera
    and filled up the bowl with rice and curry, and the delicious smell of the curry spread
    throughout the city. Then it occurred to the thera that this person must be no ordinary
    human being, and he came to realize that this must be Sakka himself. Sakka admitted the
    fact and claimed that he too was poor because he had had no opportunity of offering
    anything to anyone during the time of the Buddhas. So saying, Sakka and his wife Sujata
    left the thera after paying due respect to him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha, from his monastery, saw Sakka and Sujata
    leaving and told the bhikkhus about Sakka offering alms-food to Theha Mahakassapa. The
    bhikkhus wondered how Sakka knew that Thera Mahakassapa had just come out of <i>nirodhasamapatti</i>,
    and that it was the right and auspicious time for him to make offerings to the thera. This
    question was put up to the Buddha, and the Buddha answered, <i>&quot;Bhikkhus, the
    reputation of a virtuous one as my son, Thera Mahakassapa, spreads far and wide; it
    reaches even the deva world. On account of his good reputation, Sakka himself has come to

    uttered Verse (57) of this book, with reference to Thera Godhika.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thera Godhika was, on one occasion, diligently practising
    Tranquillity and Insight Development, on a stone slab on the side of Isigili mountain in
    Magadha. When he had achieved one-pointedness of the mind (jhana) he became very ill; that
    impaired the effectiveness of his practice. In spite of his sickness, he kept on striving
    hard; but every time he was making some progress he was overcome by sickness. He was thus
    inflicted for six times. Finally, he made up his mind to overcome all obstacles and attain
    arahatship even if he were to die. So, without relaxing he continued to practise
    diligently; in the end he decided to give up his life by cutting his throat; at the point
    of death he attained arahatship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Mara learned that Thera Godhika had died, he tried to
    find out where the thera was reborn but failed to find him. So, assuming the likeness of a
    young man, Mara approached the Buddha and enquired where Thera Godhika was. The Buddha
    replied to him,<i> &quot;It will be of no benefit to you to learn of the destination of
    Thera Godhika; for having been freed of moral defilements he became an arahat. One like
    you, Mara, for all your power will not be able to find out where such arahats go after
    death.&quot;</i></font></p>

    The Story of <a NAME="Garahadinna">Garahadinna</a></b></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verses (58) and (59) of this book, with reference to a rich man named Garahadinna
    and the miracle of the lotus flowers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There were two friends named Sirigutta and Garahadinna in
    Savatthi. Sirigutta was a follower of the Buddha and Garahadinna was a follower of the
    Niganthas, the ascetics who were hostile to the Buddhists. At the instance of the
    Niganthas, Garahadinna often said to Sirigutta, &quot;What benefit do you get by following
    the Buddha? Come, be a follower of my teachers.&quot; Having been told thus many times,
    Sirigutta said to Garahadinna, &quot;Tell me, what do your teachers know?&quot; To this,
    Garahadinna replied that his teachers knew everything; with their great power they knew
    the past, the present and the future and also the thoughts of others. So, Sirigutta
    invited the Niganthas to his house for alms-food.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sirigutta wanted to find out the truth about the
    Niganthas, whether they really possessed the power of knowing other people's thoughts,
    etc. So he made a long, deep trench and filled it up with excreta and filth. Seats were
    then placed precariously over the trench; and big empty pots were brought in and covered
    up with cloth and banana leaves to make them appear as if they were full of rice and
    curries. When the Niganthas arrived, they were requested to enter one by one, to stand
    near their respective seats, and to sit down simultaneously. As all of them sat down, the
    flimsy strings broke and the Niganthas fell into the filthy trench. Then Sirigutta taunted
    them, &quot;Why don't you know the past, the present and the future? Why don't you know
    the thoughts of others?&quot; All the Niganthas then fled in terror.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Garahadinna naturally was furious with Sirigutta and
    refused to talk to him for two weeks. Then, he decided that he would have his revenge on
    Sirigutta. He pretended that he was no longer angry, and one day asked Sirigutta to
    invite, on his behalf, the Buddha and his five hundred disciples to partake of alms-food.
    So Sirigutta went to the Buddha and invited him to the house of Garahadinna. At the same
    time, he told the Buddha about what he had done to the Niganthas, the teachers of
    Garahadinna. He also expressed his fear that this invitation might be a reprisal and so
    the invitation should be accepted only after due consideration.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha, with his supernormal power, knew that this
    would be the occasion for the two friends to attain Sotapatti Fruition, and therefore
    accepted the invitation. Garahadinna made a trench, filled it with live coals and covered
    it with mats. He also kept some empty pots covered with cloth and banana leaves to make
    them appear as if filled with rice and curries. The next day, the Buddha came followed by
    five hundred bhikkhus in single file. When the Buddha stepped on the mat over the trench,
    the mat and live coals miraculously disappeared, and five hundred lotus flowers, each as
    large as a cart wheel, sprang up for the Buddha and his disciples to sit upon.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Seeing this miracle, Garahadinna was very much alarmed and
    he said rather incoherently to Sirigutta, &quot;Help me, dear friend. Out of my desire for
    revenge, I have truly done a great wrong. My bad designs have had no effect at all on your
    Teacher. The pots in my kitchen are all empty. Please help me.&quot; Sirigutta then told
    Garahadinna to go and look at the pots. When Garahadinna found all the pots filled with
    food he was astounded and at the same time very much relieved and very happy. So the food
    was offered to the Buddha and his disciples. After the meal, the Buddha expressed his
    appreciation (anumodana) of the meritorious act and then said, &quot;Ignorant worldlings,
    lacking in knowledge, do not know the unique qualities of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the
    Samgha and so they are like the blind; but the wise, having knowledge, are like people
    with sight.&quot;</font></p>
