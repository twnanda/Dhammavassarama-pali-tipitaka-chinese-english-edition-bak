    The Story of the <a name="235238">Son of a Butcher</a> </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verses (235) to (238) of this book, with reference to the son of a butcher.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once in Savatthi, there was a man who had been a butcher
    for fifty-five years. All this time, he slaughtered cattle and sold the meat and everyday
    he took meat curry with his rice. One day, he left some meat with his wife to cook it for
    the family, and then left for the riverside to have his bath. During his absence, a friend
    coaxed his wife to sell that particular piece of meat to him. As a result, there was no
    meat curry for the butcher on that day. But as the butcher never took his meal without
    meat curry, he hurriedly went to the back of his house, where an ox was standing. He
    promptly cut off the tongue of the ox and baked it over a fire. When having his meal, the
    butcher had a bite of the tongue of the ox, but as he did so his own tongue was cut off
    and fell into his plate of rice. Thus the ox and the butcher were in the same plight, both
    of them having had their tongues cut off. The butcher was in great pain and agony, and he
    went about agitatedly on his knees, with blood dripping profusely from his mouth. Then the
    butcher died and was reborn in the Avici Niraya.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The butcher's wife was greatly disturbed and she was
    anxious for her son to get away to some other place, lest this evil should befall him too.
    So she sent her son to Taxila. At Taxila, he acquired the art of a goldsmith. Later, he
    married the daughter of his master and some children were born to them. When their sons
    came of age he returned to Savatthi. The sons were endowed with faith in the Buddha and
    were religiously inclined. They were anxious about their father, who had grown old with no
    thought of religion or of his future existence. So one day, they invited the Buddha and
    the bhikkhus to their house for alms-food. After the meal they said to the Buddha, <font>&quot;Venerable
    Sir, we are making this offering to you today on behalf of our father. Kindly give a
    discourse specially for him.&quot;</font> So the Buddha said, <i>&quot;My disciple! You
    are getting old; but you have not made any provisions of merit for your journey to the
    next existence; you should now find a support for yourself.&quot;</i></font></p>

    The Story of a <a name="239">Brahmin</a></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (239) of this book, with reference to a brahmin.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, a brahmin saw a group of bhikkhus re-arranging their
    robes as they were preparing to enter the city for alms-food. While he was looking, he
    found that the robes of some of the bhikkhus touched the ground and got wet because of dew
    on the grass. So he cleared that patch of ground. The next day, he found that as the robes
    of the bhikkhus touched bare ground, the robes got dirty. So he covered that patch of
    ground with sand. Then again, he observed that the bhikkhus would sweat when the sun was
    shining and that they got wet when it was raining. So finally, he built a rest house for
    the bhikkhus at the place where they gathered before entering the city for alms-food.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the building was finished, he invited the Buddha and
    the bhikkhus for alms-food. The brahmin explained to the Buddha how he had performed this
    meritorious deed step by step. To him the Buddha replied <i>&quot;O Brahmin! The wise
    perform their acts of merit little by little, and gradually and constantly they remove the
    impurities of moral defilements.&quot;</i></font></p>

    The Story of <a name="240">Thera Tissa </a></strong></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the
    Buddha uttered Verse (240) of this book, with reference to Thera Tissa.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Once there was a thera named Tissa in
    Savatthi. One day, he received a set of fine robes and was very pleased. He intended to
    wear those robes the next day. But that very night he died and because he was attached to
    the fine set of robes, he was reborn as a louse and lived within the folds of the robes.
    As there was no one to inherit his belongings, it was decided that this particular set of
    robes should be shared by other bhikkhus. When the bhikkhus were preparing to share out
    among themselves, the louse was very much agitated and cried out, <i>&quot;They are
    destroying my robes!&quot;</i> This cry was heard by the Buddha by means of his divine
    power of hearing. So he sent someone to stop the bhikkhus and instructed them to dispose
    of the robes only at the end of seven days. On the eighth day, the set of the robes which
    belonged to Thera Tissa was shared out by the bhikkhus.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Later, the Buddha was asked by the bhikkhus
    why he had told them to wait for seven days before sharing out the robes of Thera Tissa.
    To them the Buddha replied,<i> &quot;My sons, Tissa had his mind attached to this
    particular set of robes at the time of his death, and so he was reborn as a louse and
    stayed in the folds of the robes. When you all were preparing to share out the robes,
    Tissa the louse was very much in agony and was running about to and fro in the folds of
    the robes. If you had taken the robes at that time Tissa the louse would have felt very
    bitter against you and he would have to go to niraya. But now, Tissa has been reborn in
    the Tusita deva world, and that is why I have allowed you to take the robes. Indeed,
    bhikkhus, attachment is very dangerous; as rust corrodes iron from which it is formed, so
    also, attachment destroys one and sends one to niraya. A bhikkhu should not indulge too
    much in the use of the four requisites or be very much attached to them.&quot;</i></font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Savatthi, people coming back after hearing the
    discourses given by Thera Sariputta and Thera Maha Moggallana were always full of praise
    for the two Chief Disciples. On one occasion, Laludayi, hearing their praises, said to
    those people that they would be saying the same about him after listening to his
    discourses. So Laludayi was asked to deliver a discourse; he climbed on to the platform
    but he could not say anything. So he asked the audience to let another bhikkhu take the
    turn first and that he would take the next turn. In this way, he put off three times.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The audience lost patience with him and shouted, <font>&quot;You
    big fool! When we praised the two Chief Disciples you were vainly boasting that you could
    preach like them. Why don't you preach now ?&quot;</font> So Laludayi ran away and the
    crowd chased him. As he was frightened and was not looking where he was going, he fell
    into a latrine pit.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the Buddha was told about this incident, he said, <i>&quot;Laludayi
    had learned very little of the Dhamma; he does not recite the religious texts regularly;
    he has not memorized anything. Whatever little he has learned gets rusty by not
    reciting.&quot;</i></font></p>

    his absence, the Buddha said, <i>&quot;My disciple, women are just like a river, or a

    Sariputta to accept some of the food from him. Thera Sariputta did not say anything to him
    but continued on his way. Thera Sariputta refused to accept food from that bhikkhu because
    that bhikkhu had transgressed the law prohibiting bhikkhus from practising medicine. Other
    bhikkhus reported about this to the Buddha and he said to them, <i><font>&quot;Bhikkhus! A
    bhikkhu who is shameless is coarse in thought, word and deed. He is arrogant like a crow,

    Buddha was expounding the Dhamma at the Jetavana monastery. One of them was asleep while
    sitting, the second one was drawing lines with his fingers on the ground, the third was
    trying to shake a tree, the fourth was looking up at the sky. The fifth was the only one

    Buddha, &quot;Venerable Sir! While you were expounding the Dhamma like big drops of rain
    falling from the sky, only one out of those five people were listening

    &quot;Ananda, these people could not get rid of their old habits. In their past
    existences, the first one was a snake; as a snake usually coils itself up and goes to
    sleep, so also, this man goes to sleep while listening to the Dhamma. The one who was
    scratching the earth with his hand was an earthworm, the one who was shaking the tree was
    a monkey, the one who was gazing up at the sky was an astronomer and the one who was
    listening attentively to the Dhamma was a learned astrologer. In this connection, Ananda,
    you must remember that one must be attentive to be able to understand the Dhamma and that
    there are many people who cannot follow what was being said.&quot;</font></i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thera Ananda then asked the Buddha, &quot;Venerable Sir!
    What are the things that prevent people from being able to take in the Dhamma?&quot; And
    the Buddha replied, <i><font>&quot;Ananda, passion (raga), ill will (dosa) and ignorance

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, during his tour of Anga and Uttara regions, the
    Buddha saw in his vision that time was ripe for Mendaka, his wife, his son, his
    daughter-in-law, his granddaughter and his servant, to attain Sotapatti Fruition. Seeing
    the prospect of these six people attaining Sotapatti Fruition, the Buddha went to the town
    of Baddiya.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mendaka was an extremely rich man. It was said that he
    found a large number of life-size golden statues of goats in his backyard. For this
    reason, he was known as Mendaka (a goat) the rich man. Again, it was also said that during
    the time of Vipassi Buddha he had donated a monastery for Vipassi Buddha and a
    congregation hall complete with a platform for the preacher. On completion of these
    buildings he made offerings of alms-food to Vipassi Buddha and the bhikkhus for four
    months. Then, in yet another of his past existences, when he was a rich man in Baranasi,
    there was a famine throughout the region. One day, they had cooked a meal just enough for
    the members of the family when a paccekabuddha stood at the door for alms-food. Then and
    there he offered all the food. But due to his great faith and generosity, the rice pot was
    later found to be miraculously filled up again; so also were his granaries.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mendaka and his family, hearing that the Buddha was coming
    to Baddiya, went to pay homage to him. After hearing the discourse given by the Buddha,
    Mendaka, his wife Candapaduma, his son Danancaya, his daughter-in-law Sumanadevi, his
    granddaughter Visakha and the servant Punna attained Sotapatti Fruition. Mendaka then told
    the Buddha how on his way, some ascetics had spoken ill of the Buddha and had tried to
    dissuade him from coming to see him. The Buddha then said, <i><font>&quot;My disciple, it
    is natural for people not to see one's own faults, and to exaggerate other people's faults

    he felt that only the Buddha could answer his questions. So, he hurried off to the Sal
    Grove, but the Venerable Ananda did not allow him to see the Buddha, because the Buddha
    was by that time very weak. The Buddha overheard their conversation and consented to see
    Subhadda. Subhadda asked three questions. They are: <font>(1) Are there any tracks in the
    sky? (2) Are there any ariya bhikkhus (samanas) outside the Teaching of the Buddha? and

    he would exhort others to listen to the Dhamma, and he himself would recite the one stanza
    he knew. Every time he had finished his recitation, the guardian spirits (devas) of the
    forests praised him and applauded him resoundingly. On one sabbath day, two learned
    theras, who were well-versed in the Tipitaka, accompanied by five hundred bhikkhus came to

    Ekudana. But Ekudana insisted that the guardian spirits used to come and always applauded
    at the end of each discourse. The two theras then pressed Ekudana to do the preaching
    himself. Ekudana held the fan in front of him and recited the usual stanza. At the end of
    the recitation, the guardian spirits applauded as usual. The bhikkhus who had accompanied
    the two learned theras complained that the devas inhabiting the forests were very partial.</font></p>

    danger, may you prosper and get rich, may you live long,&quot;</font> etc. At that time,
    the followers of the Buddha did not say anything after receiving something from their
    lay-disciples. This was because during the first twenty years after the Buddha's
    attainment of Buddhahood they were instructed to remain silent on receiving offerings.
    Since the followers of the Buddha were silent when ascetics of other doctrines were saying
    things which were pleasing to their disciples, people began to compare the two groups.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the Buddha heard about this, he permitted the
    bhikkhus to say words of blessing to their disciples after receiving offerings. As a
    result of that, more and more people invited the followers of the Buddha for alms. Then,
    the ascetics of other doctrines remarked with disdain:<font> &quot;We adhere to the
    practice of the muni and keep silent, whereas the followers of Samana Gotama go about
    talking exuberantly in the eating places.&quot; </font>On hearing those disparaging
    remarks, the Buddha said, <i>&quot;Bhikkhus! There are some who keep silent because they
    are ignorant and timid, and some who keep silent because they do not want to share their
    profound knowledge with others. Only one who has overcome evil is to be called a

    did not say anything. Back at the monastery, Thera Maha Moggallana, in the presence of the

    said that he himself had seen that very peta soon after his attainment of Buddhahood, but
    that he did not say anything about it because people might not believe him and thus they
    would be doing wrong to him. Then the Buddha proceeded to relate the story about the

    to him that it would be even better if he could make the other two bhikkhus leave the
    place and have the monastery all to himself. Thus, he tried to set one against the other.
    The two bhikkhus quarrelled and left the monastery in different directions. On account of
    this evil deed, that bhikkhu was reborn in Avici Niraya and he was serving out the
    remaining part of his term of suffering as a swine-peta with its mouth swarming with
    maggots. Then the Buddha exhorted,<i> &quot;A bhikkhu should be calm and well-restrained

    put him on the right path. So, whenever Potthila came to pay obeisance, the Buddha would
    address him as '<i>Useless Potthila</i>'. When Potthila heard these remarks, he pondered
    over those words of the Buddha and came to realize that the Buddha had made those unkind
    remarks because he, Potthila, had not made any serious effort to practise meditation and
    had not achieved any of the Maggas or even any level of mental absorption (jhana).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, without telling anyone Thera Potthila left for a
    monastery at a place twenty yojanas away from the Jetavana monastery. At that monastery

    him to be his mentor; but the thera, wishing to humble him, asked him to go to the next
    senior bhikkhu, who in his turn sent him on to the next. In this way, he was sent from one
    to the other until he came to a seven year old arahat samanera. The young samanera
    accepted him as a pupil only after ascertaining that Potthila would obediently follow his
    instructions. As instructed by the samanera, Thera Potthila kept his mind firmly fixed on
    the true nature of the body; he was very ardent and vigilant in his meditation.</font></p>

    (9) The Story of a Thera who had been a <a name="285">Goldsmith</a></b></b></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (285) of this book, with reference to a bhikkhu, a pupil of Thera Sariputta.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, a young, handsome son of a goldsmith was admitted
    into the Order by Thera Sariputta. The young bhikkhu was given loathsomeness of the dead
    body as the subject of meditation by Thera Sariputta. After taking the subject of
    meditation he left for the forest and practised meditation there; but he made very little
    progress. So he returned twice to Thera Sariputta for further instructions. Still, he made
    no progress. So Thera Sariputta took the young bhikkhu to the Buddha, and related
    everything about the young bhikkhu.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha knew that the young bhikkhu was the son of a
    goldsmith, and also that he had been born in the family of goldsmiths during his past five
    hundred existences. Therefore the Buddha changed the subject of meditation for the young
    bhikkhu; instead of loathsomeness, he was instructed to meditate on pleasantness. With his
    supernormal power, the Buddha created a beautiful lotus flower as big as a cart-wheel and
    told the young bhikkhu to stick it on the mound of sand just outside the monastery. The
    young bhikkhu, concentrating on the big, beautiful, fragrant lotus flower, was able to get
    rid of the hindrances. He was filled with delightful satisfaction (piti), and step by step
    he progressed until he reached as far as the fourth level of mental absorption (jhana).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha saw him from his perfumed chamber and with his
    supernormal power made the flower wither instantly. Seeing the flower wither and change
    its colour, the bhikkhu perceived the impermanent nature of the flower and of all other
    things and beings. That led to the realization of the impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and
    the insubstantiality of all conditioned things. At that instant, the Buddha sent forth his
    radiance and appeared as if in person to the young bhikkhu and instructed him to get rid
    of craving (tanha).</font></p>

    uttered Verse (286) of this book, with reference to Mahadhana, a merchant from Baranasi.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, a merchant from Baranasi came to a festival in
    Savatthi with five hundred carts fully loaded with textiles and other merchandise. When he
    reached a river bank near Savatthi the river was in spate; so he could not cross the
    river. He was held up for seven days as it was raining hard and the water did not subside.
    By that time, he was already late for the festival, and there was no need for him to cross
    the river.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since he had come from a long distance he did not want to
    return home with his full load of merchandise. So he decided to spend the rainy season,
    the cold season and the hot season in that place and said so to his assistants. The Buddha
    while going on an alms-round knew the decision of the merchant and he smiled. Ananda asked
    the Buddha why he smiled and the Buddha replied,<i> &quot;Ananda, do you see that
    merchant? He is thinking that he would stay here and sell his goods the whole year. He is
    not aware that he would die here in seven days' time. What should be done should be done
    today. Who would know that one would die tomorrow? We have no date fixed with the King of
    Death. For one who is mindful by day or by night, who is not disturbed by moral
    defilements and is energetic, to live for just one night is a well-spent life.&quot; </i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the Buddha sent Ananda to Mahadhana, the merchant.
    Ananda explained to Mahadhana that time was running out for him, and that he should
    practise mindfulness instead of being negligent. On learning about his impending death,
    Mahadhana was alarmed and frightened. So, for seven days, he invited the Buddha and other
    bhikkhus for alms-food. On the seventh day, the Buddha expounded a discourse in
