Having applied himself<BR>
to what was not his own task,<BR>
and not having applied himself<BR>
to what was,<BR>
having disregarded the goal<BR>
to grasp at what he held dear,<BR>
he now envies those<BR>
who kept after themselves,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; took themselves<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to task.

Don't ever -- regardless -- <BR>
be conjoined with what's dear<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or undear.<BR>
It's painful<BR>
not to see what's dear<BR>
or to see what's not.<BR>
<P>
<a name="211"></a>So don't make anything dear,<BR>
for it's dreadful to be far<BR>
from what's dear.<BR>
No bonds are found<BR>
for those for whom<BR>
there's neither dear<BR>
nor undear.

From what's dear is born grief,<BR>
from what's dear is born fear.<BR>
For one freed from what's dear<BR>
there's no grief<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- so how fear?<BR>
<P>
<a name="213"></a>From what's loved is born grief,<BR>
from what's loved is born fear.<BR>
For one freed from what's loved<BR>
there's no grief<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- so how fear?<BR>
<P>
<a name="214"></a>From delight is born grief,<BR>
from delight is born fear.<BR>
For one freed from delight<BR>
there's no grief<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- so how fear?<BR>
<P>
<a name="215"></a>From sensuality is born grief,<BR>
from sensuality is born fear.<BR>
For one freed from sensuality<BR>
there's no grief<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- so how fear?<BR>
<P>
<a name="216"></a>From craving is born grief,<BR>
from craving is born fear.<BR>
For one freed from craving<BR>
there's no grief<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- so how fear?

One consummate in virtue &amp; vision,<BR>
judicious,<BR>
speaking the truth,<BR>
doing his own task:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the world holds him dear.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If<br>
you've given birth to a wish<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for what can't be expressed,<BR>
are suffused with heart,<br>
your mind not enmeshed<BR>
in sensual passions:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you're said to be<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the up-flowing stream.

A man long absent<BR>
comes home safe from afar.<BR>
His kin, his friends, his companions,<BR>
delight in his return.<BR>
<P>
<a name="220"></a>In just the same way,<BR>
when you've done good<BR>
&amp; gone from this world<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the world beyond,<BR>
your good deeds receive you -- <BR>
as kin, someone dear<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; come home.
