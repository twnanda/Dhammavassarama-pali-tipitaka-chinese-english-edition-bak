Blessed One, worshipped and sat on side. The Blessed One said to him:- 
Householder, wealth should be made use of in these five ways. What five? </P>
<P>Here, householder, with the wealth the noble disciple has rightfully gained 
with aroused effort and with his own hands, while sweat dripped, he should 
please and maintain himself, his wife and children and workmen pleasantly. This 
is the first use he makes of wealth </P>
<P>Again, householder, with the wealth the noble disciple has rightfully gained 
with aroused effort and with his own hands, while sweat dripped, he should 
please and maintain his friends and co-associates pleasantly. This is the second 
use he makes of wealth </P>
<P>Again, householder, with the wealth the noble disciple has rightfully gained 
with aroused effort and with his own hands, while sweat dripped, he should put 
away something as surety for a misfortune or an accident -such as from fire, 
water, the king, robbers or from unwanted inheritors This is the third use he 
makes of wealth </P>
<P>Again, householder, with the wealth the noble disciple has rightfully gained 
with aroused effort and with his own hands, while sweat dripped, he should make 
the five offerings to relations, strangers, the dead, the king and gods. This is 
the fourth use he makes of wealth </P>
<P>Again, householder, with the wealth the noble disciple has rightfully gained 
with aroused effort and with his own hands, while sweat dripped, he should make 
offerings to recluses and Brahmins. who abstain from intoxicating and brewd 
drinks, are patient and humble. It is heavenly bliss, a certain one tames the 
self, another appeases the self and another extinguishes This is the fifth use 
he makes of wealth Householder, wealth should be put to use of in these five 
ways. </P>
<P>Householder, in these five ways the noble disciple's wealth gets used up and 
it decreases and it occurs to him:- I make use of my wealth and it decreases, I 
have no regrets. When the noble disciple's wealth gets used up in these five 
ways, it increases and it occurs to him:- When I make use of my wealth it 
increases. I have no regrets. In either case he has no regrets. </P>
<P>Wealth is partaken, those to be supported are supported </P>
<P>And something is put away for misfortune</P>
<P>The virtuous, restrained ones leading a holy life are attended to,</P>
<P>For whatever reason the wise householders earn wealth,</P>
<P>It is satisfied. The human being established in the noble Teaching </P>
<P>Recollecting thus is delighted here and now and later in heaven.

heavenly bliss or take pleasure in heavenly bliss, rather he should fall to the 
method conducive to heavenly bliss in heaven.</P>

<P>Fondly aspiring these, they are gained of the most excellent kind, 
repeatedly. </P>
