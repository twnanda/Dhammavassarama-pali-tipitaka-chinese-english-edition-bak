<hr>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in <a name="campa">Campa</a>, on the shore of <a name="gaggara">Gaggara Lake</a>. Then <a name="bahuna">Ven. Bahuna</a> went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "Lord, freed, dissociated, &amp; released from how many things does the Tathagata dwell with unrestricted awareness?"
<p>
"Freed, dissociated, &amp; released from ten things, Bahuna, the Tathagata dwells with unrestricted awareness. Which ten? Freed, dissociated, &amp; released from form, the Tathagata dwells with unrestricted awareness. Freed, dissociated, &amp; released from feeling...Freed, dissociated, &amp; released from perception...Freed, dissociated, &amp; released from fabrications...Freed, dissociated, &amp; released from consciousness...Freed, dissociated, &amp; released from birth...Freed, dissociated, &amp; released from aging...Freed, dissociated, &amp; released from death...Freed, dissociated, &amp; released from stress...Freed, dissociated, &amp; released from defilement, the Tathagata dwells with unrestricted awareness.
<p>
"<A NAME="lotus">Just as</A> a red, blue, or white lotus born in the water and growing in the water, rises up above the water and stands with no water adhering to it, in the same way the Tathagata -- freed, dissociated, &amp; released from these ten things -- dwells with unrestricted awareness."
