<P>72. At one time The Blessed One was abiding in the gabled hall in the Great 
forest in Vesali with many well known elder, disciple bhikkhus such as 
venerables Cala, Upacala, Kukkuta, Kalimbha, Nikata, Katissa and other well 
known elder bhikkhus. </P>
<P>At that time many well known Licchavis in completely full chariots were 
coming to the Great forest to see The Blessed One, making much noise. Then it 
occured to those venerable ones:- `These well known Licchavis in completely full 
chariots, are coming to the Great forest to see The Blessed One, making much 
noise. The Blessed One has said that sound is a thorn to the higher states of 
the mind. What if we go to the Gosinga forest reserve. It has less noise, not so 
crowded, we will have a pleasant abiding Then those venerable ones went to the 
Gosinga forest reserve which had less noise, was less crowded and had a pleasant 
abiding. </P>
<P>The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:- ßBhikkhus, where are the elder 
bhikkhus, Cala, Upacala, Kukkuta, Kalimbha, Nikata, Katissà. Where are these 
elder bhikkhus gone? </P>
<P>ßHere, venerable sir, it occured to those venerable ones:- These well known 
Licchavis in completely full chariots, are coming to the Great forest to see The 
Blessed One, making much noise. The Blessed One has said that sound is a thorn 
to the higher states of the mind. What if we go to the Gosinga forest reserve. 
It has less noise, not so crowded, we will have a pleasant abiding Then those 
venerable ones went to the Gosinga forest reserve which has less noise, is less 
crowded and has a pleasant abiding. </P>
<P>ßBhikkhus, the great elders have said it correctly! Rightly saying sound is a 
thorn for the higher states of the mind. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these ten are thorns. What ten?</P>
<P>To one who wants seclusion, company is a thorn. To one developing the sign of 
loathsomeness, an agreeable sign is a thorn. To one protected in the mental 
faculties, sight seeing is a thorn. To one leading a holy life the behaviour of 
a woman is a torn. To one in the first higher state of the mind, sounds are a 
thorn. To one in the second higher state of the mind, thoughts and discursive 
thoughts are a thorn. To one in the third higher state of the mind, joy is a 
thorn. To one in the fourth higher state of the mind, in breathing and out 
breathing is a thorn. To one attaining the cessation of perceptions and 
feelings, perceptions and feelings are a thorn. Greed is a thorn. Hate is a 
thorn and delusion is a thorn. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, live without thorns, free from thorns. Bhikkhus, the worthy ones 
are without thorns, free from thorns. </P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+

happiness. Venerable sir, my father's brother Isidatta lived a household life 
satisfied with his wife and children When he died The Blessed One declared that
