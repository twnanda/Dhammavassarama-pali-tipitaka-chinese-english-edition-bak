<p>
"Sensuality should be known. The cause by which sensuality comes into play should be known. The diversity in sensuality should be known. The result of sensuality should be known. The cessation of sensuality should be known. The path of practice for the cessation of sensuality should be known.

<b>[<A NAME="1">1</A>]</b> "'Sensuality should be known. The cause by which sensuality comes into play...The diversity in sensuality...The result of sensuality...The cessation of sensuality...The path of practice for the cessation of sensuality should be known.' Thus it has been said. In reference to what was it said?
<p>
"There are these five strands of sensuality. Which five? Forms cognizable via the eye -- agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing; sounds cognizable via the ear...aromas cognizable via the nose...flavors cognizable via the tongue...tactile sensations cognizable via the body -- agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing. But these are not sensuality. They are called strands of sensuality in the discipline of the noble ones.
<blockquote>
<A NAME="passion">The</A> passion for his resolves is a man's sensuality,<br>
not the beautiful sensual pleasures<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; found in the world.<br>
The passion for his resolves is a man's sensuality.
<p>
The beauties remain as they are in the world,<br>
while the wise, in this regard,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; subdue their desire.
</blockquote>
"And what is the cause by which sensuality comes into play? Contact is the cause by which sensuality comes into play.
<p>
"And what is the diversity in sensuality? Sensuality with regard to forms is one thing, sensuality with regard to sounds is another, sensuality with regard to aromas is another, sensuality with regard to flavors is another, sensuality with regard to tactile sensations is another. This is called the diversity in sensuality.
<p>
"And what is the result of sensuality? One who wants sensuality produces a corresponding state of existence, on the side of merit or demerit. This is called the result of sensuality.
<p>
"And what is the cessation of sensuality? From the cessation of contact is the cessation of sensuality; and just this noble eightfold path -- right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration -- is the way leading to the cessation of sensuality.
<p>
"Now when a disciple of the noble ones discerns sensuality in this way, the cause by which sensuality comes into play in this way, the diversity of sensuality in this way, the result of sensuality in this way, the cessation of sensuality in this way, &amp; the path of practice leading to the cessation of sensuality in this way, then he discerns this penetrative holy life as the cessation of sensuality.
