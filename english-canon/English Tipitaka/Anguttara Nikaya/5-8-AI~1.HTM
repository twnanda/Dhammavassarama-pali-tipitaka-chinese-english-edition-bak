<P>Venerable sir, it is said living according to the Teaching. How does a 
bhikkhu live according to the Teaching? </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhu, the bhikkhu learns the Teaching in the discourses, in prose 
and verse, in expositions giving questions and answers, in four lines, in solemn 
utterances, thus said sayings, birth stories, in wonderful things, in a series 
of questions and answers. He spends the time learning them, neglects seclusions, 
does not develop internal appeasement. Bhikkhu, to this is said the bhikkhu 
learns much, does not live according to the Teaching. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhu the bhikkhu explains the Teaching to others in detail as he 
has learnt and understood it. He spends the time teaching others, neglects 
seclusions, does not develop internal appeasement. Bhikkhu, to this is said the

<P>Bhikkhu, I have taught you how, much learning is done, much teaching is done, 
much reciting is done, much thinking is done and the living according to the

<P>008.05. Bhikkhus, these five soldiers are evident in the world. What five? 
</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain soldier sinks seeing a heap of dust and dejected 
cannot keep firm and cannot go to the battle field. Bhikkhus, such a soldier is 
evident. This is the first soldier evident in the world. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, a certain soldier does not sink seeing a heap of dust. Yet 
seeing the top of the banner he sinks and dejected cannot keep firm and cannot 
go to the battle field. Bhikkhus, such a soldier is evident. This is the second 
soldier evident in the world. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, a certain soldier does not sink seeing a heap of dust or the 
top of the banner. Yet he sinks seeing the tumult and dejected cannot keep firm 
and cannot go to the battle field. Bhikkhus, such a soldier is evident. This is 
the third soldier evident in the world. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, a certain soldier neither sinks seeing a heap of dust, the 
top of the banner or the tumult. Yet is killed and troubled in the battle. 
Bhikkhus, such a soldier is evident. This is the fourth soldier evident in the 
world. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, a certain soldier neither sinks seeing a heap of dust, the 
top of the banner, the tumult or even the impact and winning the battle abides 
in the battle field. Bhikkhus, such a soldier is evident. This is the fifth 
soldier evident in the world. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in the same manner five bhikkhus comparable to these five soldiers 
are evident among bhikkhus. What five? </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu seeing a heap of dust sinks, dejected is unable 
to bear the holy life and manifesting a weakness to keep the precepts comes to 
the lower life</P>
<P>What is the dust there? The bhikkhu hears, in such a village or hamlet there 
is a woman or a girl endowed with the highest beauty. Hearing this he sinks and 
dejected is unable to bear the holy life and manifesting a weakness to keep the 
precepts he comes to the lower life This is the dust. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, like the soldier who sinks seeing a heap of dust and dejected 
cannot keep firm and cannot go to the battle field. Bhikkhus, I say this person 
is comparable to him. This person evident among bhikkhus, is comparable to the 
first soldier. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu does not sink seeing a heap of dust. Yet seeing 
the top of the banner he sinks and dejected cannot keep firm and cannot lead the 
holy life and manifesting a weakness to keep the precepts he comes to the lower 
life. What is the top of the banner there? The bhikkhu does not hear, in such a 
village or hamlet there is a woman or a girl endowed with the highest beauty. 
But he himself sees a woman or girl with the highest beauty. Seeing her he sinks 
and dejected is unable to bear the holy life and manifesting a weakness to keep 
the precepts he comes to the lower life This is the top of the banner. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, like the soldier who does not sink seing a heap of dust but sinks 
seeing the top of the banner and dejected cannot keep firm and go to the battle 
field. Bhikkhus, I say this person is comparable to him. This person evident 
among bhikkhus, is comparable to the second soldier. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu does not sink seeing a heap of dust or the top 
of the banner Yet he sinks hearing the tumult and dejected cannot keep firm and 
cannot lead the holy life and manifesting a weakness to keep the precepts he 
comes to the lower life. What is the tumult? </P>
<P>Here, a woman approaches the bhikkhu gone to the forest, to the root of a 
tree or to an empty house and she laughs, calls out and makes fun of him. He 
laughed at, called out and made fun by the woman sinks and dejected and unable 
to bear the holy life manifests a weakness to keep the precepts and omes to 
lower life. This is the tumult. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, like the soldier who does not sink seeing a heap of dust or the top 
of the banner. Yet sinks hearing the tumult and dejected cannot keep firm and 
cannot go to the battle field. Bhikkhus, such a person is evident. This is the 
third peron comparable to the third soldier evident in the world. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu does not sink seeing a heap of dust or the top 
of the banner or hearing the tumult yet is killed and troubled. What is killing 
and troubling? </P>
<P>Here a woman approaches the bhikkhu gone to the forest, to the root of a tree 
or to an empty house and sits by him, encroaches him and submerges him. He 
submerged and overcome without giving up the holy life has sexual intercourse 
with her This is killing and troubling. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, like the soldier who neither sinks seeing a heap of dust, the top 
of the banner or hearing the tumult. Yet is killed and troubled in the battle. 
Bhikkhus, such a person is evident. This is the fourth person comparable to the 
fourth soldier evident in the world. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu does not sink seeing a heap of dust or the top 
of the banner or hearing the tumult and is not killed. He goes to the battle, 
wins the battle and abides in the battle field. What is his winning the battle? 
</P>
<P>Here a woman approaches the bhikkhu gone to the forest, to the root of a tree 
or to an empty house and sits by him, encroaches him and submerges him. He 
encroached and submerged by her disentangles himself and releases himself and 
goes wherever he desires. Abides in a solitary dwelling, a forest, the root of a 
tree, a mountain grotto, a mountain cave, a cemetery, a jungle forest, some open 
space or a heap of straw. </P>
<P>Gone to the forest, root of a tree or to an empty house, sits cross legged, 
placing his body straight and mindfulness established in front of him. He 
dispels covetousness for the world purifies the mind of covetousness and abides 
with a non coveting mind. Dispelling anger abides with a non-angry mind. He 
purifies the mind with compassion for all the world. Dispelling sloth and torpor 
abides with a mind free of sloth and torpor, abides mindful and aware of the 
perception of light. Dispelling restless and worry abides undisturbed and 
internally appeased. Dispelling doubts abides without doubts about meritorious 
things that should be done and not done. </P>
<P>Dispelling these five obstructions of the mind and wisely making the minor 
defilements of the mind weak, he secludes the mind from sensual desires. . . . 
re. . . . . with equanimity to joy and disenchantment abides mindful and aware 
and experiences pleasantness with the body too and attains to the third higher 
state of the mind. To this the noble ones say `abiding in pleasantness with 
equanimity. ' Dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness and earlier having 
overcome pleasure and displeasure, purifying the mind with equanimity so that 
there is not unpleasantness or pleasantness and abides in the fourth higher 
state of mind. </P>
<P>When the mind is concentrated, pure, without blemish and when the minor 
defilelments are removed, when the mind is workable and pliable and made 
immovable, he directs the mind for the destruction of desires. He knows as it 
really is, this is unpleasant, this its arising, this its cessation and this is 
the path leading to the cessation of unpleasantness. He knows, as it really is, 
these are desires, this is the arising of desires, this is the cessation of 
desires and he knows as it really is this is the path leading to the cessation 
of desires. When he knows and sees in this manner, his mind finds release from 
sensual desires, from desires `to be' and finds release from ignorant desires. 
When released knowledge arises birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived to the 
end, what should be done is done, there is nothing more to wish. This is his 
victory at the battle. . </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, like the soldier neither sinking seeing a heap of dust, the top of 
the banner, the tumult or even the impact, has won the battle and abides in the 
battle field. Bhikkhus, such a person is evident. This person evident in the

<P>Bhikkhus, in the same manner these five persons comparable to these five

lives relying on a certain village or hamlet. He puts on robes in the morning 
and taking bowl and robes wanders for morsel food, with unprotected body, words 
and mind, mindfulness not established and mental faculties unrestrained. There

<P>Here, bhikkhus the forest bhikkhu reflects:- In the forest, now I live alone. 
If a serpent or a centipede stings me, I would die and it would be dangerous for 
me. Therefore I will arouse effort for the attainment of the not yet attained, 
for the realization of the not yet realized Bhikkhus, seeing this first future 
fear the bhikkhu living in the forest should abide diligent to dispel, for the 
attainment of the not yet attained and the realization of the not yet realized. 
</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus the forest bhikkhu reflects:- In the forest, now I live 
alone. If I trip and fall or if the food I eat give trouble, or if the bile is 
disturbed, or if the phlegm is disturbed or if I experience a cutting pain, then 
I would die and it would be dangerous for me. Therefore I will arouse effort for 
the attainment of the not yet attained, for the realization of the not yet 
realized Bhikkhus, seeing this second future fear the bhikkhu living in the 
forest should abide diligent to dispel, for the attainment of the not yet 
attained and the realization of the not yet realized. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus the forest bhikkhu reflects:- In the forest, now I live 
alone. If I be approached by wilds beasts such as a lion, a tiger, a leopard, a 
bear or any other animal they will kill me and it would be dangerous for me. 
Therefore I will arouse effort for the attainment of the not yet attained, for 
the realization of the not yet realized Bhikkhus, seeing this third future fear 
the bhikkhu living in the forest should abide diligent to dispel, for the 
attainment of the not yet attained and the realization of the not yet realized. 
</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus the forest bhikkhu reflects:- In the forest, now I live 
alone. If I be approached by young men owing to some action done earlier or not 
and if they kill me, it would be dangerous for me. Therefore I will arouse 
effort for the attainment of the not yet attained, for the realization of the 
not yet realized Bhikkhus, seeing this fourth future fear the bhikkhu living in 
the forest should abide diligent to dispel, for the attainment of the not yet 
attained and the realization of the not yet realized. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus the forest bhikkhu reflects:- In the forest, now I live 
alone. There are malicious non-humans in the forest if they kill me, it would be 
dangerous for me. Therefore I will arouse effort for the attainment of the not 
yet attained, for the realization of the not yet realized Bhikkhus, seeing this 
fifth future fear the bhikkhu living in the forest should abide diligent to 
dispel, for the attainment of the not yet attained and the realization of the 
not yet realized. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, seeing these five future fears the bhikkhu living in the forest 
should certainly abide diligent to dispel, for the attainment of the not yet 
attained and the realization of the not yet realized. </P></FONT><B><FONT

<P>008.08. Bhikkhus, seeing these five future fears the bhikkhu should certainly 
abide diligent to dispel, for the attainment of the not yet attained and the 
realization of the not yet realized. What five?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu reflects, now I'm young, youthful, in the prime 
of life, with black hair. There will be a time when I decay, overcome by decay, 
it is difficult to think of the dispensation of the enlightened ones. It is not 
easy to dwell in jungle forests when decayed. Before that undesirable, 
disagreeable thing comes, I should quickly arouse effort for the attainment of 
the not yet attained and the realization of the not yet realized. When I have 
attained it and realized it, even if decayed, I will have a pleasant abiding 
Bhikkhus, seeing this first future fear the bhikkhu should certainly abide 
diligent to dispel, for the attainment of the not yet attained and the 
realization of the not yet realized. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu reflects, now I'm with few ailments, healthy, 
with a balanced digestive system, not too cold, nor too hot. There will be a 
time when this body will ail, overcome by ailments, it is difficult to think of 
the dispensation of the enlightened ones. It is not easy to dwell in jungle 
forests when ailing. Before that undesirable, disagreeable thing comes, I should 
quickly arouse effort for the attainment of the not yet attained and the 
realization of the not yet realized. When I have attained it and realized it, 
even if I had ailments, I will have a pleasant abiding Bhikkhus, seeing this 
second future fear the bhikkhu should certainly abide diligent to dispel, for 
the attainment of the not yet attained and the realization of the not yet 
realized. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu reflects, now there is no shortage of food, 
there is plenty of grains, and morsel food is not rare, there are no doubts 
about scraps. There will be a time of famine, with little grains and morsel food 
rare there would not be scraps. In times of famine people move to areas where 
there is food. When they move, there is crowding. Living in a crowded 
surrounding, it is difficult to think of the dispensation of the enlightened 
ones. It is not easy to dwell in jungle forests either. Before that undesirable, 
disagreeable thing comes, I should quickly arouse effort for the attainment of 
the not yet attained and the realization of the not yet realized. When I have 
attained it and realized it, even if there be a famine, I will have a pleasant 
abiding Bhikkhus, seeing this third future fear the bhikkhu should certainly 
abide diligent to dispel, for the attainment of the not yet attained and the 
realization of the not yet realized. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu reflects, now people live united without a 
dispute, mixing like milk and water, looking at each other with pleasant eyes 
There will be a time of disturbance when pleople from the states go about 
mounting chariots. When there is such fear, people migrate to places where there 
is peace. When they move, there is crowding. Living in a crowded surrounding, it 
is difficult to think of the dispensation of the enlightened ones. It is not 
easy to dwell in jungle forests either. Before that undesirable, disagreeable 
thing comes, I should quickly arouse effort for the attainment of the not yet 
attained and the realization of the not yet realized. When I have attained it 
and realized it, even when there is fear, I will have a pleasant abiding 
Bhikkhus, seeing this fourth future fear the bhikkhu should certainly abide 
diligent to dispel, for the attainment of the not yet attained and the 
realization of the not yet realized. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu reflects, now the Community of bhikkhus are 
united, without a dispute, abiding pleasantly, reciting a single set of rules. 
There will be a time when the Community splits. When the Community of bhikkhus 
split, it is difficult to think of the dispensation of the enlightened ones. It 
is not easy to dwell in jungle forests either. Before that undesirable, 
disagreeable thing comes, I should quickly arouse effort for the attainment of 
the not yet attained and the realization of the not yet realized. When I have 
attained it and realized it, even if the Community splits, I will have a 
pleasant abiding Bhikkhus, seeing this fifth future fear the bhikkhu should 
certainly abide diligent to dispel, for the attainment of the not yet attained 
and the realization of the not yet realized. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, seeing these five future fears the bhikkhu should certainly abide 
diligent to dispel, for the attainment of the not yet attained and the 
realization of the not yet realized. </P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>

<P>008.09. Bhikkhus, these five are future fears, not yet arisen, they will 
arise in the future. You should be wakeful to them and make effort to dispel 
them. What five? </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in the future there will be bhikkhus, bodily undeveloped, in 
virtues undeveloped, mentally undeveloped and in wisdom undeveloped. They will 
give the higher ordination to others, but would not be able to discipline them 
in higher virtues, mind, and wisdom. Then those bhikkhus too would be bodily 
undeveloped, in virtues undeveloped, mentally undeveloped and in wisdom 
undeveloped They too will give the higher ordination to others, but would not be 
able to discipline them in higher virtues, mind, and wisdom. Then those bhikkhus 
too would be bodily undeveloped, in virtues undeveloped, mentally undeveloped 
and in wisdom undeveloped. Thus bhikkhus, it is pollution in the Teaching and as 
a result pollution in the Discipline, when there is pollution in the 
Disccipline, there is pollution in the Teaching. Bhikkhus, this is the first 
future fear, not yet arisen, it will arise in the future. You should be wakeful 
to them and make effort to dispel them. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, in the future there will be bhikkhus, bodily undeveloped, in 
virtues undeveloped, mentally undeveloped and in wisdom undeveloped. They will 
give protection to others, but would not be able to discipline them in higher 
virtues, mind, and wisdom. Then those bhikkhus too would be bodily undeveloped, 
in virtues undeveloped, mentally undeveloped and in wisdom undeveloped They too 
will give a protection to others, but would not be able to discipline them in 
higher virtues, mind, and wisdom. Then those bhikkhus too would be bodily 
undeveloped, in virtues undeveloped, mentally undeveloped and in wisdom 
undeveloped. Thus bhikkhus, it is pollution in the Teaching and as a result 
pollution in the Discipline, when there is pollution in the Disccipline, there 
is pollution in the Teaching. Bhikkhus, this is the second future fear, not yet 
arisen, it will arise in the future. You should be wakeful to them and make 
effort to dispel them. </P>
<P>Again,bhikkhus, in the future there will be bhikkhus, bodily undeveloped, in 
virtues undeveloped, mentally undeveloped and in wisdom undeveloped. When they 
explained the deeper meanings answering questions coming to dark evil actions, 
they would not understand them. Thus bhikkhus, it is pollution in the Teaching 
and as a result pollution in the Discipline, when there is pollution in the 
Disccipline, there is pollution in the Teaching. Bhikkhus, this is the third 
future fear, not yet arisen, it will arise in the future. You should be wakeful 
to them and make effort to dispel them. </P>
<P>Again,bhikkhus, in the future there will be bhikkhus, bodily undeveloped, in 
virtues undeveloped, mentally undeveloped and in wisdom undeveloped. They would 
not listen to the discourses with deep meanings dealing about the void and 
beyond this world, would not arouse effort to realize them. Would not think to 
learn them or practise them. They would listen to discourses in verse form, in 
decorative language and decorative words. They will think to understand such 
teachings of other disciples. Thus bhikkhus, it is pollution in the Teaching and 
as a result pollution in the Discipline, when there is pollution in the 
Disccipline, there is pollution in the Teaching. Bhikkhus, this is the fourth 
future fear, not yet arisen, it will arise in the future. You should be wakeful 
to them and make effort to dispel them. </P>
<P>Again,bhikkhus, in the future there will be bhikkhus, bodily undeveloped, in 
virtues undeveloped, mentally undeveloped and in wisdom undeveloped. Bhikkhus, 
the elder bhikkhus bodily undeveloped, in virtues undeveloped, mentally 
undeveloped and in wisdom undeveloped will be lethargic not arousing effort to 
develop seclusions for the attainment of the not yet attained and the 
realization of the not yet realizedòhe later generation too will follow them. 
They too will become lethargic not arousing effort to develop seclusions for the 
attainment of the not yet attained and the realization of the not yet realized. 
Thus bhikkhus, it is pollution in the Teaching and as a result pollution in the 
Discipline, when there is pollution in the Disccipline, there is pollution in 
the Teaching. Bhikkhus, this is the fifth future fear, not yet arisen, it will 
arise in the future. You should be wakeful to them and make effort to dispel 
them. Bhikkhus, these five are future fears, not yet arisen, they will arise in 
the future. You should be wakeful to them and make effort to dispel them.

<P>008.10. Bhikkhus, these five are future fears, not yet arisen, they will 
arise in the future. You should be wakeful to them and make effort to dispel 
them. What five? </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in the future there will be bhikkhus, desiring good robes and as a 
result they would give up looking out for robes cloth in a heap of dirt or 
outside a shop. They would give up dwelling in jungle forests and would recede 
to hamlets, villages and kingdoms and would make dwellings in them. For the 
reason of robes, they would do various improper activities. Bhikkhus, this is 
the first future fear, not yet arisen, it will arise in the future. You should 
be wakeful and make effort to dispel it. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, in the future there will be bhikkhus, desiring good morsel 
food and as a result they would give up going out to collect morsel food. They 
would give up dwelling in jungle forests and would recede to hamlets, villages 
and kingdoms and would make dwellings in them. For the reason of tasty food they 
would do various improper activities. Bhikkhus, this is the second future fear, 
not yet arisen, it will arise in the future. You should be wakeful and make 
effort to dispel it. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, in the future there will be bhikkhus, desiring good 
dwellings and as a result they would give up abiding under roots of trees and 
jungle forests. They would give up dwelling in jungle forests and would recede 
to hamlets, villages and kingdoms and would make dwellings in them. For the 
reason of dwellings, they would do various improper activities. Bhikkhus, this 
is the third future fear, not yet arisen, it will arise in the future. You 
should be wakeful and make effort to dispel it. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, in the future there will be bhikkhus, living together with 
novice bhikkhunis. When this is so, the holy life will be led with disinterest 
or would come to some defilement. Or would decrease from the holy life and come 
to lay life. Bhikkhus, this is the fourth future fear, not yet arisen, it will 
arise in the future. You should be wakeful and make effort to dispel it. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, in the future there will be bhikkhus, living together with 
monastery attendants. When this is so, this should be expected. They will live 
accumulating various things for their partaking. They would even do rough things 
to the greenery on the earth. Bhikkhus, this is the fourth future fear, not yet 
arisen, it will arise in the future. You should be wakeful and make effort to 
dispel it. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these five are future fears, not yet arisen, they will arise in the 
future. You should be wakeful to them and make effort to dispel them.
