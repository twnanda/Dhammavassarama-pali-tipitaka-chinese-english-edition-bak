<P>002.01.Bhikkhus, these six things are for inner gladness. What six?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is established in bodily thoughts of loving 
kindness [1] towards the co-associates in the holy life, openly and secretly. 
This is for inner gladness. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is established in verbal thoughts of loving

This is also for inner gladness. </P>

</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these six things are for inner gladness.</P>
<P>Notes. [1]. Bodily thoughts of loving kindness. `mettaü kàyakammaü' In the 
body are the six doors of mental contact. It is through them that all activity 
start, such as through seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touch and the mind. 
[2] When thoughts arise on account of these activities they should be with 
loving kindness `mettaü vacikammaü' Thoughts are words. [3] On account of this 
procedure, there are feelings and perceptions which are related to `mettaü 
manokammaü' And those feelings and perceptions should be with loving kindness. 
Feelings and perceptions are connected with the mind.</P>

<P>002.03. Bhikkhus, these six are elements to be driven out. What six? </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu would say, `The release of mind in loving kindness 
is developed in me, made a habit, thoroughly practiced, experienced, scrutinized 
and well undertaken, yet anger overwhelms my mind and stays.' He should be 
advised: Venerable one, do not say that. Do not accuse The Blessed One. It is 
not good to accuse The Blessed One. He has not said that. It is impossible 
friend, that the mind released in loving kindness, developed, made a habit, 
thoroughly practiced, experienced, scrutinized and well undertaken should be 
overwhelmed with anger. Friend, anger is driven out when the mind is released in 
loving kindness. </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu would say, `The release of mind in compassion is 
developed in me, made a habit, thoroughly practiced, experienced, scrutinized 
and well undertaken, yet annoyance overwhelms my mind and stays.' He should be 
advised: Venerable one, do not say that. Do not accuse The Blessed One. It is 
not good to accuse The Blessed One. He has not said that. It is impossible

<P>Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu would say, `The release of mind in intrinsic joy is 
developed in me, made a habit, thoroughly practiced, experienced, scrutinized 
and well undertaken, yet aversion overwhelms my mind and stays.' He should be 
advised: Venerable one, do not say that. Do not accuse The Blessed One. It is

overwhelmed with aversion. Friend, aversion is driven out when the mind is 
released in intrinsic joy. </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu would say, `The release of mind in equanimity is 
developed in me, made a habit, thoroughly practiced, experienced, scrutinized 
and well undertaken, yet greed overwhelms my mind and stays.' He should be 
advised: Venerable one, do not say that. Do not accuse The Blessed One. It is 
not good to accuse The Blessed One. He has not said that. It is impossible 
friend that the mind released in equanimity, developed, made a habit, thoroughly 
practiced, experienced, scrutinized and well undertaken should be overwhelmed

</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu would say, `The release of mind in no sign is 
developed in me, made a habit, thoroughly practiced, experienced, scrutinized 
and well undertaken, yet consciousness arises on account of a sign and 
overwhelms my mind and stays.' He should be advised: Venerabale one, do not say 
that. Do not accuse The Blessed One. It is not good to accuse The Blessed One. 
He has not said that. It is impossible friend, that the mind released in no 
sign, developed, made a habit, thoroughly practiced, experienced, scrutinized 
and well undertaken should follow up a sign consciously. Friend, all signs are 
driven out when the mind is released in signlessness.</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu would say, `To me `I am' has disappeared. It does 
not occur to me, this is me and mine. Yet doubtful thoughts of what should and 
should not be done overwhelm my mind and stay ' He should be advised: Venerabale 
one, do not say that. Do not accuse The Blessed One. It is not good to accuse 
The Blessed One. He has not said that. It is impossible friend, that when `I be' 
has disappeared and when there is no me and mine, that doubts should arise, 
about what should and should not be done. Friend, doubts are driven out when `I 
be' is driven out. .</P>

<P>002.06. At one time The Blessed One was living in the deer park in the 
Bhesakala forest among the Sumsumara peaks. At that time the householder Nakula 
was gravely ill. Then the householder's wife told him thus: </P>

Blessed One has blamed death with wishes. </P>
<P>Householder, it might occur to you, after my demise my wife will not desire

bhikkhus more often, after your demise. Therefore, householder do not die with 
wishes. Death is unpleasant to one with wishes. The Blessed One has blamed death 
with wishes. </P>
<P>Householder, it might occur to you, after my demise my wife will not be 
complete in her virtues. It should not be thought in that manner. Among the 
female lay disciples who wear white clothes, am one. If you have any doubts 
about that, there is The Blessed One, worthy and rightfully enlightened in the 
deer park in the Bhesakala forest among the Sumsumara peaks. You should approach 
and dispel doubts. Therefore, householder do not die with wishes. Death is

<P>Householder, it might occur to you, my wife is not a gainer of internal 
appeasement. Householder it should not be thought in that manner. Among the

better momentarily. Then the householder Nakula soon after that illness subsided 
with the help of a walking stick approached The Blessed One. He worshipped The 
Blessed One and sat on a side, then The Blessed One said to him:</P>

Mahamoggallana, Mahakassapa, Mahkaccana, Mahakotthita, Mahacunda, Mahakappina, 
Anuruddha, Revata and Ananda. The Blessed One sat there deep into the night and 
getting up late in the night entered the monastery. Those venerable ones too, 
soon after The Blessed One had left got up and went into their dwellings. As for 
the novice bhikkhus, who had come to the dispensation recently were groaning and 
sleeping. The Blessed One with his purified heavenly eye, beyond human saw those 
bhikkhus groaning and sleeping until day break and approached the attendance 
hall, and sat on the prepared seat and addressed them: </P>

Mahakappina, where is Anuruddha, where is Revata and where is Ananda? Where have 
those elders gone? </P>
<P>Venerable sir, those venerable ones, soon after The Blessed One went away to 
the dwelling went to their dwellings. Then you elders and novices did you sleep

<P>No, venerable sir. </P>
<P>Good! Bhikkhus, I too have not heard of a head anointed warrior king, who ate

unprotected, not knowing the right amount to partake, not yoked to wakefulness, 
not reflective of meritorious things, not developing enlightenment factors in

as a result it becomes impossible that they go on the back of elephants, horses

chewed and partook four or five morsels, lead a life of negligence and their 
mindfulness on death is slow</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the one who said, if I live until I chewed and swollowed one morsel 
and the one who said, if I lived until I breathed in and breathed out or 
breathed out and breathed in are diligent and develop sharp mindfulness of death 
for the destruction of desires. Therefore bhikkhus, you should train thus: </P>
<P>We should abide diligently, develop sharp mindfulness of death for the 
destruction of desires. </P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>

<P>002.10. At one time The Blessed One lived in Nadika in a dwelling of bricks. 
The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from there:</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, mindfulnes of death developed and made much is very beneficial and 
ends in deathlessness. Bhikkhus, how does mindfulness of death developed and 
made much become beneficial and end up in deathlessness? </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, when the day is over and the night is falling, the bhikkhu 
reflects, my death may come about owing to may reasons, a serpent might sting 
me, a scorpion might sting me or a centepede might sting me, if I die on account 
of it, it would be dangerous for me; or I might slip and fall, or the food I eat 
would disagree, or my bile or phglem would get disordered, or a cutting pain 
would hurt me by that I would meet death and that would be dangerous to me. Then 
that bhikhu should reflect thus: Are there any evil things not dispelled in me, 
which would be a danger if I die tonight. When the bhikkhu reflects if he knows, 
there are evil demerit not dispelled in me, which would be a danger if I die 
tonight. Then that bhikkhu should arouse a lot of interest, effort, strength and 
unhindered exertion and mindful awareness to dispel them. Bhikkhus, like one 
with head or clothes on fire would arouse a lot of interest, effort, strength 
and unhindred exertion and mindful awareness to put out that fire. If the 
bhikkhu reflecting knows, I have no evil demerit in me, even if I die tonight 
there would be no danger. Then that bhikkhu should abide in joy and delight, 
engaged day and night in those same meritorious things </P>
