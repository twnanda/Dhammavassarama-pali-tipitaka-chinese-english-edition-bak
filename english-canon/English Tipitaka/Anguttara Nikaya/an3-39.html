<b>Translator's note:</b>
The Pali Text Society editions treat this discourse as two discourses -- III.38 &amp; III.39 -- divided at the <A HREF="#asterisk">triple asterisk</A>. Asian editions treat it as one, numbered III.39. The autobiographical verse at the end of the second half -- which is identical with the verse concluding <A HREF="an5-57.html">AN V.57</A> -- fits neatly with the autobiographical first half of the discourse, suggesting that the two halves were meant to go together.

"Monks, I lived in refinement, utmost refinement, total refinement. My father even had lotus ponds made in our palace: one where red-lotuses bloomed, one where white lotuses bloomed, one where blue lotuses bloomed, all for my sake. I used no sandalwood that was not from Varanasi. My turban was from Varanasi, as were my tunic, my lower garments, &amp; my outer cloak. A white sunshade was held over me day &amp; night to protect me from cold, heat, dust, dirt, &amp; dew.
<p>
"I had <A NAME="3palaces">three palaces</A>: one for the cold season, one for the hot season, one for the rainy season. During the four months of the rainy season I was entertained in the rainy-season palace by minstrels without a single man among them, and I did not once come down from the palace. Whereas the servants, workers, &amp; retainers in other people's homes are fed meals of lentil soup &amp; broken rice, in my father's home the servants, workers, &amp; retainers were fed wheat, rice, and meat.
<p>
"Even though I was endowed with such fortune, such total refinement, the thought occurred to me: 'When an untaught, run-of-the-mill person, himself subject to aging, not beyond aging, sees another who is aged, he is horrified, humiliated, &amp; disgusted, oblivious to himself that he too is subject to aging, not beyond aging. If I -- who am subject to aging, not beyond aging -- were to be horrified, humiliated, &amp; disgusted on seeing another person who is aged, that would not be fitting for me.' As I noticed this, the [typical] young person's intoxication with youth entirely dropped away.

And if I -- who am subject to illness, not beyond illness -- were to be horrified, humiliated, &amp; disgusted on seeing another person who is ill, that would not be fitting for me.' As I noticed this, the healthy person's intoxication with health entirely dropped away.

And if I -- who am subject to death, not beyond death -- were to be horrified, humiliated, &amp; disgusted on seeing another person who is dead, that would not be fitting for me.' As I noticed this, the living person's intoxication with life entirely dropped away.

"Monks, <A NAME="3forms">there are these</A> three forms of intoxication. Which three? Intoxication with youth, intoxication with health, intoxication with life.
<p>
"Drunk with the intoxication of youth, an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person engages in bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, &amp; mental misconduct. Having engaged in bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, &amp; mental misconduct, he -- on the break-up of the body, after death -- reappears in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell.

"Drunk with the intoxication of youth, a monk leaves the training and returns to the lower life. Drunk with the intoxication of health, a monk leaves the training and returns to the lower life. Drunk with the intoxication of life, a monk leaves the training and returns to the lower life."
<blockquote>
<a name="rest">'Subject</a> to birth, subject to aging,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; subject to death,<br>
run-of-the-mill people<br>
are repelled by those who suffer<br>
from that to which they are subject.<br>
And if I were to be repelled<br>
by beings subject to these things,<br>
it would not be fitting for me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; living as they do.'
<p>
As I maintained this attitude -- <br>
knowing the Dhamma<br>
without acquisitions -- <br>
I overcame all intoxication<br>
with health, youth, &amp; life<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as one who sees<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; renunciation as rest.
<p>
For me, energy arose,<br>
Unbinding was clearly seen.<br>
There's now no way<br>
I could partake of sensual pleasures.<br>
Having followed the holy life,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not return.
