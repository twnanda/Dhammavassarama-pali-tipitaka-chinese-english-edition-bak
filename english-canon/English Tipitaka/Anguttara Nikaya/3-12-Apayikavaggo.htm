hell</P></B>
<P>1. Apàyikasuttaü - Hell.</P>
<P>114. Bhikkhus, without dispelling these three, it is loss, it is hell. What 
three? </P>
<P>With a promise to lead the holy life, breaking it, falsely degrading one who 
lives the pure holy life, and he that falls for it, upholding the view that 
there is nothing wrong in sensual desires.Bhikkhus, without dispelling these 
three, it is loss, it is hell.</P>
<P>2. Dullabhasuttaü- Rare arisings</P>
<P>115. Bhikkhus, the arising of three things are rare in the world. What three? 
The arising of the Thus Gone One, worthy and rightfully enlightened is rare the 
world. A person who preaches the Teaching and Discipline declared by the Thus 
Gone One is rare in the world. A person who has gratitude and returns it, is 
rare in the world. Bhikkhus, the arising of these three things are rare in the 
world.</P>
<P>3. Appameyyasuttaü - Immeasurable</P>
<P>116. Bhikkhus, these three kinds of persons are in the world What three? The 
one easily measured, the one measured with difficulty, and the immeasurable one. 
</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, who is the easily measured one? </P>
<P>Here bhikkhus, a certain person is excited, muddled in mind, puffed up and 
vain, is forgetful with loose talk is confused not aware with uncontrolled mentl 
faculties. Bhikkhus, such a person is easily measured. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, who is measured with difficulty? </P>
<P>Here bhikkhus, a certain person is not excited, not muddled in mind, puffed 
up or vain, not forgetful without loose talk mindfulness established is aware 
with controlled mentl faculties and the mind concentrated Bhikkhus, such a 
person is measured with difficulty. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, who is immeasurable? </P>
<P>Here bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is worthy, with desires destroyed. Bhikkhus, such 
a person is immeasurable. </P>
<P>4. ~Ane¤jasuttaü - Immovable states.</P>
<P>117. Bhikkhus, these three persons are evident in the world. What three? </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain person overcoming all perceptions of matter and 
going beyond perceptions of anger, not attending to various perceptions, [1] 
With boundless space attains to the sphere of space. He becomes fully satisfied 
in it, strives after it and prospers in it. Becoming intent on it and making 
much of it, without falling away from it, he dies and is born with the gods of 
the sphere of space. The gods of the sphere of space have a life span of twenty 
thousand forward world cycles. An ordinary person having completed that life 
span would go even to hell, the animal world or be born with the ghosts. As for 
the disciples of the Blessed One, completing that life span would extinguish in 
that same birth. Bhikkhus, this is the difference and the peculiarity in the 
course of action, birth and conscience of the noble disciple and the ordinary 
person. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, a certain person overcoming all the sphere of space With 
boundless consciousness attains to the sphere of consciousness. He becomes fully 
satisfied in it, strives after it and prospers in it. Becoming intent on it and 
making much of it, without falling away from it, he dies and is born with the 
gods of the sphere of consciousness. The gods of the sphere of consciousness 
have a life span of forty thousand forward world cycles. An ordinary person 
having completed that life span would go even to hell, the animal world or be 
born with the ghosts. As for the disciples of the Blessed One, completing that 
life span would extinguish in that same birth. Bhikkhus, this is the difference 
and the peculiarity in the course of action, birth and conscience of the noble 
disciple and the ordinary person. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, a certain person overcoming all the sphere of consciousness, 
with there is nothing attains to the sphere of no-thingness. He becomes fully 
satisfied in it, strives after it and prospers in it. Becoming intent on it and 
making much of it, without falling away from it, he dies and is born with the 
gods of the sphere of no thingness. The gods of the sphere of no-thingness have 
a life span of sixty thousand forward world cycles. An ordinary person having 
completed that life span would go even to hell, the animal world or be born with 
the ghosts. As for the disciples of the Blessed One, completing that life span 
would extinguish in that same birth. Bhikkhus, this is difference and the 
peculiarity in the course of action, birth and conscience of the noble disciple 
and the ordinary person. Bhikkhus, these three persons are evident in the 
world.</P>
