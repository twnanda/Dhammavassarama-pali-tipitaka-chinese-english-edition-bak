robes entered Savatthi for alms. Then it occured to venerable Sariputta, it is 
too early to go the alms round, what if I go to the monastery of the wandering 
acetics. Venerable Sariputta entered the monastery of the wandering ascetics, 
exchanged friendly greetings with the wandering ascetics of other sects and sat 
on a side. To the wandering ascetics of other sects assembled there, this 
conversation arose. ßFriends, whoever leads the holy life pure and complete for 
twelve years, is the bhikkhu of distinction, without any doubts. </P>
