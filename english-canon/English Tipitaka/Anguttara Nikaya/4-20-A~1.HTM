<P>020.01. Bhikkhus, if those hearing the Teaching were to practice it verbally, 
gather the meaning mentally and straighten the view they could expect four 
benefits. What four?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu learns the Teaching as discourses, verse and 
prose sections, . . . re. . . and series of questions and answers and becomes 
learned in that Teaching, He practices it verbally, mentally gathers the meaning 
and he straightens his view. He dies with confused mindfulness and is born with 
a certain retinue of gods. There he skillfully voices the Teaching, too. 
Mindfulness arises to him slowly and he quickly rises to the next higher 
state.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, this is the first benefit for hearing the Teaching, practicing it 
verbally and mentally gathering the meaning and straightening the view.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu learns the Teaching as discourses, verse and 
prose sections, . . . re. . . and series of questions and answers and becomes 
learned in that Teaching, He practices it verbally, mentally gathers the meaning 
and he straightens his view. He dies with confused mindfulness and is born with 
a certain retinue of gods. There he does not voice the Teaching skillfully, 
becomes successful in teaching the heavenly gathering. Then he recalls isn't it 
in this Teaching and Discipline that I earlier led the holy life. Mindfulness 
arises to him slowly and he quickly rises to the next higher state.</P>
<P>Like a man clever in knowing the sound of drums, gone to the highway hears 
the sound of a drum and he does not doubt, whether it is the sound of a drum or 
not, but concludes it is the sound of a drum. In the same manner the bhikkhu 
learns the Teaching as discourses, verse and prose sections, . . . re. . . and 
series of questions and answers and becomes learned in that Teaching, He 
practices it verbally, mentally gathers the meaning and he straightens his view. 
He dies with confused mindfulness and is born with a certain retinue of gods. 
There he does not voice the Teaching skillfully, becomes successful in teaching 
the heavenly gathering. Then he recalls isn't it in this Teaching and Discipline 
that I earlier led the holy life. Mindfulness arises to him slowly and he 
quickly rises to the next higher state.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, this is the second benefit for hearing the Teaching, practicing it 
verbally and mentally gathering the meaning and straightening the view.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu learns the Teaching as discourses, verse and 
prose sections, . . . re. . . and series of questions and answers and becomes 
learned in that Teaching, He practices it verbally, mentally gathers the meaning 
and he straightens his view. He dies with confused mindfulness and is born with

successful in teaching the heavenly gathering. Then he recalls isn't this the 
Discipline that I earlier led the holy life. Mindfulness arises to him slowly 
and he quickly rises to the next higher state.</P>
<P>Like a man clever in knowing the sound of conches, gone to the highway hears 
the sound of a conch and he does not doubt, whether it is the sound of a conch 
or not, but concludes it is the sound of a conch. In the same manner the bhikkhu 
learns the Teaching as discourses, verse and prose sections, . . . re. . . and 
series of questions and answers and becomes learned in that Teaching, He 
practices it verbally, mentally gathers the meaning and he straightens his view.

heavenly gathering. Then he recalls isn't this the Discipline that I earlier led

higher state.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, this is the third benefit for hearing the Teaching, practicing it 
verbally and mentally gathering the meaning and straightening the view.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu learns the Teaching as discourses, verse and 
prose sections, . . . re. . . and series of questions and answers and becomes 
learned in that Teaching, He practices it verbally, mentally gathers the meaning 
and he straightens his view. He dies with confused mindfulness and is born with 
a certain retinue of gods. There he voices the Teaching skillfully, is not 
successful in teaching the heavenly gathering. Yet a spontaneously arisen one 
recognizes another spontaneously arisen and asks sir, do you remember me? He 
says I remember you Mindfulness arises to him slowly and he quickly rises to the 
next higher state.</P>
<P>Like two friends who had played together in their childhood were to meet each 
other some day. Then he would ask, friend, do you remember meòhen he would ask, 
do you remember this and this, and he would say, yes friend I remember. In the 
same manner the bhikkhu learns the Teaching as discourses, verse and prose 
sections, . . . re. . . and series of questions and answers and becomes learned 
in that Teaching, He practices it verbally, mentally gathers the meaning and 
straightens his view. He dies with confused mindfulness and is born with a

says I remember you Mindfulness arises to him slowly and he quickly rises to the 
next higher state.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, this is the fourth benefit for hearing the Teaching, practicing it 
verbally and mentally gathering the meaning and straightening the view.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these are the four benefits for hearing the Teaching, practicing it

view.</P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>
<P align=center>2. òhànasuttaü- The four instances to 
observe.</P></B></FONT><FONT face=Times_CSX+>
<P>020.02. Bhikkhus, these four, should be known in four instances. What 
four?</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, virtues should be known living together, for a long time, with wise 
consideration, not with a careless glance now and then</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, purity should be known observing verbal activities, for a long 
time, with wise consideration, not with a careless glance now and then</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, stability at difficult times should be tested, for a long time, 
with wise consideration, not with a careless glance now and then</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, wisdom should be tested by conversing, that too for a long time, 
with wise consideration, not with a careless glance now and then</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, why was it said, virtues should be known living together, for a 
long time, with wise consideration, not with a careless glance now and then?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a person living with another person, would know this person 
for a long time was with broken, defective, spotted and inconsistent virtues. He 
would know this venerable one is not virtuous</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a person living with another person, would know this person 
for a long time with unbroken, non defective, not spotted and consistent 
virtues. He would know this venerable one is virtuous</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, if it was said, virtues should be known living together, for a long 
time, with wise consideration, not with a careless glance now and then, it was 
said on account of this.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, why was it said, purity should be known observing verbal 
activities, for a long time, with wise consideration, not with a careless glance 
now and then?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain person talking to another should be known thus. The 
venerable one says something to one person, to another he says something 
different, to the third something quite different and to many he says quite a 
different thing. This venerable one is with impure verbal activity</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain person talking to another should be known thus. The 
venerable one says something to one person, to another he says the same thing, 
to the third he says the same thing and to many he says that same thing. This 
venerable one is with pure verbal activity</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, if it was said, purity should be known observing verbal activities, 
for a long time, with wise consideration, not with a careless glance now and 
then, it was said on account of this.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, why was it said stability in difficult times should be tested, for 
a long time, with wise consideration, not with a careless glance now and 
then?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain person touched by the destruction of relations, 
destruction of wealth or assailed by an illness does not reflect:-</P>
<P>For those living in the world with a gain of self, the eight visicitudes of 
the world roll on and the world rolls on the eight visicitudes of the world, 
such as gain and loss, defame and fame, blame and praise, pleasantness and 
unpleasantness. Touched by the loss of relations, wealth or by illness he 
grieves, wails, the heads droops and he comes to bewilderment of mind</P>

unpleasantness. Touched by the loss of relations, wealth or by illness he does 
not grieve, does not wail, the head does not droop and he does not come to 
bewilderment of mind</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, if it was said, stability in difficult times should be tested, for 
a long time, with wise consideration, not with a careless glance now and then, 
it was said on account of this.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, why was it said, wisdom should be tested by conversing, that too 
for a long time, with wise consideration, not with a careless glance now and 
then?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain person conversing with a person would know: 
According to the manner this venerable one takes a devious path, expresses 
himself, deals with the current topic, this venerable one is not wise. What is 
the reason? The venerable one does not explain the deep meanings that are 
appeasing, exalted, clever, beyond logic and should be understood by the wise. 
It is not possible for him to express, point out, explain, and establish himself 
in short or in detail, the Teaching that he explains. This venerable one is not 
wise. Like a man standing on the bank of a pond, seeing a few fish in the water 
would think, according the manner the fish are moving and according to the waves 
that have arisen and the force of the waves there are only a few fish. In the 
same manner, according to the manner this venerable one takes a devious path, 
expresses himself, deals with the current topic, this venerable one is not wise.

<P>020.03. At one time The Blessed One was living in the gabled hall in the 
great forest in Vesali. The Licchavi Bhaddiya approached The Blessed One, 
worshipped, sat on a side and said:-</P>
<P>Venerable sir, I heard these words. The recluse Gotama is deceptive; he 
entices the disciples of other faiths. He knows the method to entice them 
Venerable sir those who say these words are they talking the fact rightfully or 
are they blaming The Blessed One without a reason?</P>

yourself should know- these thoughts are merit, these thoughts are not faulty, 
these thoughts are not blamed by the wise, these thoughts undertaken and 
accomplished are for welfare, they conduce to pleasantness- Bhaddiya, then you 
should grow them.</P>

wives, does not tell lies, and does not arouse others to do the same. Does this 
conduce to pleasantness for a long time. Yes, venerable sir.</P>

should know- these thoughts are merit, these thoughts are not faulty, these 
thoughts are praised by the wise, these thoughts undertaken and accomplished are 
for the welfare, they conduce to pleasantness- Bhaddiya, then you should grow 
them. If it was said, it was said on account of this.</P>
<P>Bhaddiya, the Great Men in the world discipline their disciples thus:- Come 
good man dispel greed and abide. When you do so, activities by body, words and 
mind born of greed do not arise to you. Dispel anger and abide. When you do so, 
activities by body, words and mind born of anger do not arise to you. Dispel 
delusion and abide. When you do so, activities by body, words and mind born of 
delusion do not arise to you. Dispel imperiousness and abide. When you do so, 
activities by body, words and mind born of imperiousness do not arise to 
you.</P>

<P>Venerable sir, I understand. . . . . re. . . remember me as a lay disciple 
who has taken refuge from today until life lasts.</P>
<P>Yet, Bhaddiya I would not say: Come Bhaddiya, be my disciple, I will be your 
Teacher.</P>
<P>Not so venerable sir.</P>
<P>Bhaddiya, if I said so, a certain recluse or Brahmin would untruthfully blame 
me. The recluse Gotama is deceptive, knows enticements and entices the disciples 
of other faiths.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, the enticement is good, the deception is good. Good if my 
loved ones, and blood relations be enticed and deceived by this enticement. It 
will be for their welfare and pleasantness for a long time. Good if all warriors 
be enticed and deceived by this enticement, it will be for their welfare and 
happiness for a long time. Good if all Brahmins be enticed and deceived by this 
enticement, it will be for their welfare and happiness for a long time. Good if 
all ordinary folk be enticed and deceived by this enticement, it will be for 
their welfare and happiness for a long time.</P>
<P>Bhaddiya, that is so. If all warriors be enticed and deceived by this 
enticement, it will be the dispelling of demerit and amassing of merit, for 
their welfare and happiness for a long time. If all Brahmins be enticed and 
deceived by this enticement, it will be the dispelling of demerit and amassing 
of merit, for their welfare and happiness for a long time. If all ordinary folk 
be enticed and deceived by this enticement, it will be the dispelling of demerit 
and amassing of merit, for their welfare and happiness for a long time. If all 
in the world together with gods, Mara, Brahma and the community of recluses and 
Brahmins be enticed and deceived by this enticement, it will be the dispelling 
of their demerit and amassing of merit, for their welfare and happiness for a 
long time.</P>
<P>Bhaddiya, evem if all these rich householders be enticed and deceived by this 
enticement, it will be the dispelling of demerit and amassing of merit, for 
their welfare and happiness for a long time even if thought. How much good will 
it do to humanity.</P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>

<P>020.05. At one time The Blessed One was living in Nigrodha's monastery in 
Kapilavatthu in the country of the Sakyas. Then Vappa the Sakya, the disciple of 
Niganta approached venerable Mahamoggallana, worshipped and sat on a side. 
Venerable Mahamoggallana said to him:-</P>
<P>Vappa, there is some one bodily, verbally and mentally restrained, ignorance 
dispelled, knowledge arisen. Vappa, do you see in that attainment, unpleasant 
feelings from desires streaming, there after? Venerable sir, I see that 
attainment on account of which unpleasant feelings for desires stream here 
after, when there are results for earlier done demerit not yet finished. .</P>
<P>When this conversation was going on between venerable Mahamoggallana and 
Vappa the Sakyan, The Blessed One got up from his seclusion in the evening and 
approached the attendance hall and sat on the prepared seat and asked venerable 
Mahamoggallana:-</P>
<P>Moggallana, with what talk were you seated and what was the other talk?</P>
<P>Here, venerable sir, I said to Vappa the Sakyan. Vappa, there is some one 
bodily, verbally and mentally restrained, ignorance dispelled, knowledge arisen. 
Vappa, do you see in that attainment, unpleasant feelings from desires streaming 
there after?</P>
<P>Venerable sir, when this was said Vappa the Sakyan said to me. Venerable

<P>When this conversation was going on between me and Vappa the Sakyan, The 
Blessed One arrived.</P>
<P>Then The Blessed One addressed Vappa the Sakyan the disciple of Niganta:- 
Vappa, if you permit me to blame you, when blame is necessary and when you do 
not know the meaning of what I say, if you ask me further questions -Venerable 
sir, what is the meaning of these words, there will be a conversation on 
this.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, I give permission to blame me, when blame is necessary and I 
will ask The Blessed One what is the meaning of these words when I do not know 
its meaning. There should be a conversation on this.</P>
<P>Vappa, on account of some bodily activity, may arise desires, troubles and 
distress, to one abstaining from them desires, troubles and distress would not 
arise, he would not do new actions, earlier actions done, while feeling would be 
destroyed, here and now, causing to decay, not a matter of time, leading

ignorance is dispelled, desires, troubles and distress would not arise, he would 
not do new actions, earlier actions done, while feeling would be destroyed, here 
and now, causing to decay, not a matter of time, leading inwards, to be 
experienced by the wise.</P>
<P>Vappa, do you see that attainment on account of which unpleasant feelings for 
desires stream here after?</P>
<P>No, venerable sir.</P>
<P>Vappa, a bhikkhu with a mind rightfully released is constantly in six 
abidings. Seeing a form he is not pleased nor displeased, abides with equanimity 
mindfull and aware. . . . re. . . . Hearing a sound. . . re. . . . With a touch 
on the body, . . . re. . . and cognizing an idea he is not pleased nor 
displeased, abides with equanimity mindfull and aware. Feeling something that 
ends the body, he knows, this feeling ends my body. Feeling something that ends 
life, he knows, this feeling ends life. He knows before death all these feelings 
that are not pleasant, should be felt and cooled</P>
<P>Vappa, on account of a stump there is a shadow, then a man comes with a hoe 
and basket, cuts the roots of the stump, pulls out all the roots small and 
large. He axes the stump, makes it into small pieces dries them in the sun and 
air and burns them and puts them into a fast flowing river or winnows them in 
the air. Vappa in the same manner the bhikkhu with a mind rightfully released is 
constantly in six abidings. Seeing a form he is not pleased nor displeased, 
abides with equanimity mindfull and aware. . . . re. . . . Hearing a sound. . . 
re. . . . With a touch on the body, . . . re. . . and cognizing an idea he is 
not pleased nor displeased, abides with equanimity mindfull and aware. Feeling 
something that ends the body, he knows, this feeling ends my body. Feeling 
something that ends life, he knows, this feeling ends my life. He knows before 
death all these feelings that are not pleasant, should be felt and cooled.</P>
<P>Then Vappa the Sakyan the disciple of Niganta said to The Blessed One:-</P>
<P>Venerable sir, like a man who wanted to prosper was to supply articles of 
trade and not prospering any more was only troubled. In the same manner, 
venerable sir, I expecting prosperity associated the Nigantas and got into 
trouble. Venerable sir, from today I give up this association with the Nigantas 
as putting it into a fast flowing river or blowing it with the wind.</P>
<P>I understand venerable sir, . . . re. . . . remember me as a lay disciple who 
has taken refuge from today until life lasts.</P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+

<P>020.06. At one time The Blessed One was living in the gabled hall in the 
Great Forest in Vesali. The Licchavis, Salha and Abhaya approached The Blessed 
One, worshipped, sat on a side and said thus to The Blessed One:-</P>
<P>Venerable sir, there are recluses and Brahmins who show the crossing of the 
flood with the two, the purity of virtues and disgust for asceticism. Venerable 
sir, what has The Blessed One to say about this?</P>
<P>Salha, I say that purity of virtues is a certain factor of recluseship. It is 
not possible for the recluses and Brahmins who talk of disgust for asceticism, 
see essence in disgust for asceticism, attached to disgust of asceticism, to 
cross the flood and it is not possible for recluses and Brahmins with impure 
bodily, verbal and mental activity to realize noble knowledge, vision and 
enlightnment.</P>
<P>Like a man desirous of crossing a river would take a sharp knife and enter 
the forest. In the forest seeing a huge, straight, young Sala shoot, he cuts the 
root and the top. Then he cleans the branches and twigs completely with a knife, 
chips it with a hatchet, marking it with a stencil and cleaning it with a stone 
ball puts it into the river. Salha, could he cross the river in it?</P>
<P>No, venerable sir.</P>
<P>What is the reason?</P>
<P>Venerable sir, that Sala shoot is externally well prepared, internally not 
prepared This should be expected from the Sala shoot, it will sink and that 
person will come to destruction. .</P>
<P>In the same manner Salha, it is not possible for the recluses and Brahmins 
who talk of disgust for asceticism, see essence in disgust for asceticism, 
attached to disgust of asceticism, to cross the flood and it is not possible for 
recluses and Brahmins with impure bodily, verbal and mental activity to realize 
noble knowledge, vision and enlightnment.</P>
<P>It is possible for the recluses and Brahmins who do not talk of disgust for 
asceticism, do not see essence in disgust for asceticism, not attached to

Brahmins with pure bodily, verbal and mental activity to realize noble 
knowledge, vision and enlightnment.</P>
<P>Like a man desirous of crossing a river would take a sharp knife and enter 
the forest. In the forest seeing a huge, straight, young Sala shoot, he would 
cut the root and the top. Then would clean the branches and twigs completely 
with a knife, chip it with a hatchet, marking it with a stencil, cleans it, with 
a stone ball and carving with a chisel would make a boat out of it. Then making 
an oar and rudder would put it into the river. Salha, could he cross the river 
in it?</P>
<P>Yes, venerable sir.</P>
<P>What is the reason?</P>
<P>Venerable sir, that Sala shoot is externally well prepared, internally well 
prepared A boat is made, an oar and rudder is built. This should be expected, it 
will not sink and that person will safely cross the flood. . .</P>
<P>In the same manner Salha, it is possible for the recluses and Brahmins who do 
not talk of disgust for asceticism, do not see essence in disgust for 
asceticism, are not attached to disgust of asceticism, to cross the flood and it 
is possible for recluses and Brahmins with pure bodily, verbal and mental 
activity to realize noble knowledge, vision and enlightnment.</P>
<P>Like a soldier skilled at shooting in three instances, becomes royal property 
and royal by the sign. What three?</P>
<P>Shooting from a distance, shooting at the right moment and breaking down a 
huge mass.</P>
<P>Salha, like the soldier shooting from a distance, the noble disciple becomes 
rightfully concentrated. Salha this is right concentration. He sees with right 
insight as it really is, that all matter in the past, future or present, 
internal or external, rough or fine, unexalted or exalted, far or near is not 
mine, am not in it, it's not my self. That all feelings in the past, future or 
present, internal or external, rough or fine, unexalted or exalted, far or near 
are not mine, am not in them, they are not my self. That all perceptions in the 
past, future or present, internal or external, rough or fine, unexalted or 
exalted, far or near are not mine, am not in them, they are not my self. That 
all determinations in the past, future or present, internal or external, rough 
or fine, unexalted or exalted, far or near are not mine, am not in them, they 
are not my self. That all consciousness in the past, future or present, internal 
or external, rough or fine, unexalted or exalted, far or near are not mine, am 
not in them, they are not my self.</P>
<P>Salha, just as the soldier shoots at the right moment the noble disciple 
develops right view. This is his right view. he knows as it really is, this is 
unpleasant, this is the arising of unpleasantness, this is the cessation of 
unpleasantness and this is the path leading to the cessation of 
unpleasantness.</P>
<P>Salha, like a soldier that breaks up a huge mass in the same manner the noble 
disciple gets his rightful release breaking up a huge mass of 
ignorance.</P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>

<P>020.08. Bhikkhus, these four persons are evident in the world. What four?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain person falls to the method of torturing the self. 
Another falls to the method of torturing others. . Another person falls to the 
method of torturing the self and others . And yet another person falls to the 
method of neither torturing the self nor others. He is here and now satisfied, 
extinguished, cooled, experiences a pleasantness like Brahma and abides,</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, who is the person that falls to the method of torturing the self? 
.</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain person goes without clothes, licks the hand without 
manners, does not enter a house, does not wait, does not accept, what is 
brought, what is specially prepared or an invitation. Does not accept from the 
mouth of a pot, a vessel, over a goat, over a stick, over a broom, from where 
two are eating, from a woman bearing child, from woman giving suck, from a woman 
gone with a man, from a soiled woman, from a place where she is supported. or 
from a place where flies abound. Does not accept fish, meat, intoxicating and 
brewed drinks. Is supported with one morsel in one house, two morsels in two 
houses,. . . re. . . . with seven morsels in seven houses. Is supported on what 
is given by one, by two, . . . . re. . . . . by seven. Is supportd on what is 
brought by one, by two . . . . re. . . by seven. He abides on these arranged 
meals for two weeks. Then he is supported on vegetables, millets, raw rice, dark 
rice, broken rice, red rice powder, foam of boiling rice, flour of oil seeds, 
grass, cowdung, forest roots, leaves and fruits or whatever is picked.</P>
<P>He wears clothes made of hemp, garments of coarse cloth interwoven with hemp, 
miserable garments, garments made of the bark of trees, antelope hide, strips of 
antelope hide, strips of wood and owls' wings, garments made of grass, blankets 
made of head hair and blankets made of horses' tail. He engages in pulling out 
hair of head and beard, keeps standing rejecting seats, spends the time 
squatting, pricks the body with thorns and sleeps on a bed of thorns. Ascends 
into water up to three times by the evening. Thus he gives the body various 
kinds of torture. Bhikkhus, this person falls to the method of torturing the 
self.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, which person tortures others?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain person is cruel, a slaughterer of lambs, pigs, 
birds, animals,and destroyer of fish, a robber, a highwayman, a keeper of a 
prison or he does some other kind of cruel activity. Bhikkhus, this person 
tortures others.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, which person tortures himself and others?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain person is either a head anointed warrior king or a 
Brahmin householder. He builds a new hall to the east of the city, shaves head 
and beard and wearing a rough skin garment anoints ghee on himself and pricking 
the horn of a deer on his back` enters the new hall with the queen consort and 
the advisory Brahmin. In the enclosure he lies down on a prepared greenery. Then 
the king drinks the milk out of one of the nipples of a young healthy cow. The 
queen drinks from another nipple and from the third the advisory Brahmin drinks. 
Milk from the fourth nipple is burnt in the sacrificial fire. The rest is left 
for the calf. Then he says, kill this amount of bulls, this amount of young 
calves, this amount of young cows, this amount of goats, this amount of lambs, 
this amount of horses, for the sacrifice. Cut this amount of trees for the 
sacrificial posts, clean this amount of shrubs for easy movement. The servants, 
messengers and workmen do their activities crying with tearful faces. Bhikkhus, 
such a person tortures himself and others.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, which person falls to the method of neither torturing the self nor 
others, is here and now satisfied, extinguished, cooled, experiences a 
plesantness like Brahma and abides?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the Thus Gone One worthy and rightfully enlightened endowed 
with knowledge and conduct, well gone, knower of the worlds, the incomparable 
tamer of those to be tamed, Teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed is 
born in the world. He declares the Teaching to the world together with gods, 
Mara, Brahma and the community of recluses and Brahmins by himself known and 
realized. That Teaching is good at the beginning, in the middle and at the end, 
full of meaning even in the letters and words and declaring the complete and 
pure holy life. A householder or the son of a householder, born to a certain 
family hears that Teaching and gains faith.</P>
<P>Then he reflects, life in the household is troublesome, it is full of 
impurities, going forth is like open space. It is not easy to lead the holy life 
complete and pure, while living in a household. What if I shave head and beard 
wear yellow clothes and go forth. In the meantime he gives up a small mass of 
wealth or a great mass of wealth, a small circle of relations or a large circle 
of relations and shaving head and beard and wearing yellow clothes he goes forth 
and becomes homeless.</P>
<P>Gone forth thus he trains in the precepts, abstains from destroying living 
things, gives up punishing, throwing away weapons, ashamed and with aroused 
compassion, he abides with compassion for all living things. Giving up taking 
the not given, likes the given and becomes pure not stealing. Giving up the 
unholy life, he leads a holy life abstaining from low sexual intercourse. Giving 
up telling lies, he tells the real and the truth and becomes trustworthy in the 
world. Giving up slandering, does not tell there, what he has heard here, to 
split these. Does not tell here, what he had heard there, to split those. Thus 
speaks to join the broken and make firm those joined. Fond of unity, talks words 
for unity. Giving up rough words talks politely and pleasantly, words that go 
straight into the heart. Words accepted by all the populace. Giving up frivolous 
talk, he talks at the right time, the truth, the meaningful, the Teaching and 
the Discipline, limited, appropriate words that could be treasured.</P>
<P>He refrains from destroying seed plants and vegetable plants. Refraining from 
food at night takes one meal a day. Refrains from dancing, music and musical 
shows. Refrains from decorating the self with flowers, scents, ointments. Gives 
up high and stately beds. Refrains from accepting gold, silver and money. Does 
not accept raw grains, raw flesh, women, girls, slaves women or men, goats and 
sheep, cocks and pigs, elephants, cattle, horses and mares. Does not accept 
fields or lands. Abstains from conveying messages, buying and selling, dealing 
matters unfairly in measuring and weighing. Does not take bribes, cheat or do 
insincere things. Does not cut kill or bind and does not collect morsel food 
violently and in roguish ways</P>
<P>Satisfied with robes for the body and morsel food for the stomach, wherever 
he goes, he goes with all his things. Like a bird that flies away, in the same 
manner satisfied with robes and morsel food he goes with all his things. Endowd 
with these virtues of the noble ones he experiences internal happiness without 
faults.</P>
<P>Seeing a form does not take the sign or detail, to one abiding with the 
faculty of the eye uncontrolled, covetous unpleasant demeritorious thoughts 
would stream, he falls to the method of controlling the faculty of the eye. 
Hearing a sound,. . . re. . . Smelling a scent,. . . re. . . Tasting, . . . re. 
. . Experiencing a touch,. . . re. . . Cognizing an idea, does not take the sign 
or detail, to one abiding with the faculty of the mind uncontrolled, covetous 
unpleasant demeritorious thoughts would stream, he falls to the method of 
controlling the faculty of the mind. Endowed with this control of the mental 
faculties, not touched by them he experiences an internal pleasantness.</P>
<P>Approaching and receding, looking on and about, he becomes mindfull and 
aware. Bending and stretching limbs, wearing the three robes and taking the bowl 
he becomes mindfull and aware. Enjoying, drinking, eating and tasting he becomes 
mindfull and aware. Urinating and excreting he becomes mindfull and aware.</P>
<P>Endowed with this mass of virtues of noble ones, control of the mental 
faculties of noble ones, this mindfull awareness of the noble ones he abides in 
a secluded dwelling. A forest, the root of a tree, a mountain grotto, a 
cemetery, a forest jungle, open space or a heap of straw. After the meal is 
over, returning from the alms round he sits in a cross legged position, keeping 
the body straight and mindfulness established in front of him. He abides 
dispelling covetoussness in the mind and cleans it from stains of coveting. 
Dispelling anger he abides with a mind free of anger. Developping compassion to 
all living things he purifies the mind of anger. Mindfull and aware to dispel 
sloth and torpor he abides with the perception of light and cleans the mind from 
sloth and torpor. Dispelling restlessness and worry he abides with a mind 
internally appeased. Dispelling doubts abides putting an end to doubts about 
meritorious things that should be done and not done.</P>
<P>Dispelling these five hindrances and mindfullly making the finner defilements 
weak, secluded from sensual thoughts,. . . re. . . . . abides in the fourth 
higher state of mind.</P>
<P>The mind thus concentrated, made pure, freed from blemish, made workable and 
immoveable he directs for the destruction of desires. He knows as it really is, 
this is unpleasant, . . . . . . re. . . . this is the path leading to the 
cessation of unpleasantness. He knows as it really is, these are desires, this 
is the arising of desires,. . . . re. . . this is the path leading to the 
cessation of desires. Knowing and seeing thus his mind seeks release from 
sensual desires, desires to be and desires on account of ignorance and knowledge 
arises of his release. He knows birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived to 
the end, what should be done is done, there is nothing more to wish.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, this person falls to the method of neither torturing the self nor 
others, is here and now satisfied, extinguished, cooled, and abides experiencing

<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain person is pleasant, appealing to the senses and 
loveable to another. Others too behave towards that object in the same manner It

the arising of hate from love, the arising of love from hate and the arising of 
hate from hate, is not to him.</P>

arising of love from love, is pulled out from the roots, made a palm stump, made

<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu sees matter as self, or a material self, or in 
self matter, or in matter self. Sees feelings as self, or a feeling self, or in
