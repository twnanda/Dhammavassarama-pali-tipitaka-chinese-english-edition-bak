<P>005.01. I heard thus. At one time The Blessed One was living in the monastery 
offered by Anathapindika in Jeta's grove in Savatthi. The Blessed One addressed 
the bhikkhus from there: </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, observing the full moon endowed with eight factors is of great 
fruit, much benefit, an offering which spreads much. Bhikkhus, the full moon 
endowed with eight factors, observed in which manner is of great fruit, much 
benefit and an offering which spreads much? </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflects: As long as life lasts, the noble 
ones, giving up destroying living things, throwing away sticks and weapons 
become ashamed, abide with compassion for all beings. This night and day I too 
giving up destroying living things, throwing away sticks and weapons become 
ashamed, will abide with compassion for all beings. In this I will imitate the 
noble ones, observe the full moon and be endowed with this first factor. </P>
<P>As long as life lasts, the noble ones, giving up taking the not given, 
desiring the given, abide the self made pure free from theft. This night and day 
I too giving up taking the not given, desiring the given will abide the self

full moon and be endowed with this second factor. </P>

removed from low sexual behaviour. This night and day I too giving up the 
non-holy life will abide far removed from low sexual behaviour. In this I will 
imitate the noble ones, observe the full moon and be endowed with this third 
factor. </P>
<P>As long as life lasts, the noble ones, giving up telling lies, abstaining 
from telling lies, abide without a dispute in the world become trustworthy and 
truthful. This night and day I too giving up telling lies, abstaining from 
telling lies will abide without a dispute in the world becoming trustworthy and 
truthful. In this I will imitate the noble ones, observe the full moon and be 
endowed with this fourth factor. </P>
<P>As long as life lasts, the noble ones, giving up taking intoxicating and 
brewed drinks abstain from it. This night and day I too giving up taking 
intoxicating and brewed drinks, will abide abstaining from it. In this I will 
imitate the noble ones, observe the full moon and be endowed with this fifth 
factor. </P>
<P>As long as life lasts, the noble ones abide on one meal per day abstaining 
from food at night and untimely hours. This night and day I too will abide on 
one meal abstaining from food at night and untimely hours. In this I will 
imitate the noble ones, observe the full moon and be endowed with this sixth 
factor. </P>
<P>As long as life lasts, the noble ones abide having given up dance, singing, 
music, sight seeing, decorating the self with flowers, scents and ointments This 
night and day I too will abide giving up dance, singing, music, sight seeing, 
decorating the self with flowers, scents and ointments. In this I will imitate 
the noble ones, observe the full moon and be endowed with this seventh factor. 
</P>
<P>As long as life lasts, the noble ones abide giving up high and lofty seats 
and beds and sleep on a low bed. This night and day I too will abide giving up 
high and lofty seats and beds, will sleep on a low bed or a spread of grass. In 
this I will imitate the noble ones, observe the full moon and be endowed with 
this eighth factor. Bhikkhus, observing the full moon endowed with these eight 
factors is of great fruit, much benefit, an offering which spreads much..

<P>005.06. At one time The Blessed One lived in Gosita's monastery in Kosambi. 
At that time venerable Anuruddha was in seclusion in the day time. Then several 
charming goddesses approached venerable Anuruddha, worshipped, stood on a side 
and said: ßVenerable sir, we are known as charming goddesses, are superior and 
wield power over others in three instances. When we desire a certain colour we 
gain that colour appropriately When we desire a certain sound, 
...re....pleasantness,...re....we gain that pleasantness appropriately. 
Venerable sir, we are known as charming goddesses, are superior and wield power 
over others in these three instances. </P>
<P>Then it occured to venerable Anuruddha: ßAll these goddesses should be blue, 
clothed and decorated in blue. Those goddesses knowing his thought all became 
blue, dressed and decorated in blue </P>
<P>Then it occured to venerable anuruddha- ßAll these goddesses should be 
yellow,...re....red, ...re... white,....re.... clothed and decorated in white. 
Those goddesses knowing his thought, all became white, dressed and decorated in 
white.</P>
<P>One of these goddesses sang, another danced and the other clapped to tune. 
Just as the fivefold music is in conformity to each other well trained and 
struck together and is with lovely words, enticing, capturing the mind and 
intoxicating, the sound of those goddesses were also with lovely words, 
enticing, capturing the mind and intoxicating. Then venerable Anuruddha 
restrained his mental faculties.</P>
<P>Then those goddesses saying venerable Anuruddha does not enjoy, did not sing 
and disappeared from there. Venerable Anuruddha that evening getting up from his 
seclusion approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said to The 
Blessed One: </P>
<P>ßHere, venerable sir, I was in seclusion in the day time. Then several 
charming goddesses approached me, worshipped, stood on a side and said:

after death are born with the charming goddesses? </P>
<P>Anuruddha, women endowed with eight things are born with the goddesses of 
charm after death. What eight? </P>
<P>Here, Anuruddha, the woman when given by her mother and father to whomever

<P>Whatever the husband brings wealth, grains, gold and silver, she protects 
them without a thievish mind, without anger with a non -fondling and 
non-destructive mind.</P>
