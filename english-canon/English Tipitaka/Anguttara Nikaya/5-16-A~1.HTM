<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu does not listen to the Teaching carefully, does 
not practise it carefully, does not keep it in mind carefully, does not examine 
the meanings of the teaching in the mind carefully. Knowing the meanings and the 
Teaching does not fall to the method of practising it carefully. Bhikkhus, these

<P>016.05. Bhikkhus, these five things conduce to the confusion and 
disappearance of the good Teaching. What five?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu does not learn the Teaching in the discourses, in 
verse and prose sections, in answer-explanation expositions, verses, solemn 
utterances, Thus said sayings, birth stories, wonderful things and a series of 
questions and answers. This is the first thing that conduces to the confusion 
and disappearance of the good Teaching. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus the bhikkhu does not teach with explanations to others the 
Teaching that he has heard and understood. This is the second thing that 
conduces to the confusion and disappearance of the good Teaching. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus the bhikkhu does not repeat with explanations to others the 
Teaching that he has heard and understood. This is the third thing that conduces 
to the confusion and disappearance of the good T eaching. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus the bhikkhu does not recite with explanations to others the 
Teaching that he has heard and understood. This is the fourth thing that 
conduces to the confusion and disappearance of the good Teaching. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus the bhikkhu does not think and think discursively and 
penetratingly see the Teaching that he has heard and understood. This is the 
fifth thing that conduces to the confusion and disappearance of the good 
Teaching. Bhikkhus, these five things conduce to the confusion and disappearance 
of the good Teaching. </P>

<P>016.06. Bhikkhus, these five things conduce to the confusion and 
disappearance of the good Teaching. What five?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu learns the misinterpreted discourses, with words 
and letters misplaced. When the words and letters are misplaced the meaning is 
miscarried. Bhikkhus, this is the first thing that conduces to the confusion and 
disappearance of the good Teaching. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is unruly endowed with unruly things is not 
patient to advice and not taking up cleverly what is taught. Bhikkhus, this is 
the second thing that conduces to the confusion and disappearance of the good 
Teaching. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the learned bhikkhus who have inherited the Teaching and the 
Discipline with the headings do not recite the discourses to others carefully 
and at their demise the discourses have their roots cut and without a refuge 
Bhikkhus, this is the third thing that conduces to the confusion and 
disappearance of the good Teaching. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the elder bhikkhus given to abundance are lethargic giving 
up seclusions and the main aim do not arouse effort to attain the not yet 
attained and to realize the not yet realized. By that the later generation 
follow them and given to abundance become lethargic giving up seclusions and the 
main aim do not arouse effort to attain the not yet attained or to realize the 
not yet realized. Bhikkhus, this is the fourth thing that conduces to the 
confusion and disappearance of the good Teaching. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the Community of bhikkhus split. When the Community of 
bhikkhus split they revile and abuse each other, round up a certain one and 
abandon anotheròhen the displeased do not pacify and out of the pleased a 
certain one changes his mind. Bhikkhus, this is the fifth thing that conduces to 
the confusion and disappearance of the good Teaching. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these five things conduce to the long standing, non-confusion and 
non- disappearance of the good Teaching. What five?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu learns the rightly grasped discourses, with words 
and letters rightly placed. When the words and letters are rightly placed the 
meaning is correctly carried. Bhikkhus, this is the first thing that conduces to 
the long standing, non-confusion and non-disappearance of the good Teaching. 
</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is suave endowed with suave things is patient to 
advice and cleverly takes what is taught. Bhikkhus, this is the second thing 
that conduces to the long standing and non-confusion and non-disappearance of 
the good Teaching. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the learned bhikkhus who have inherited the Teaching and the 
Discipline with the headings recite the discourses to others carefully and at 
their demise the discourses do not have their roots cut and are with refuge 
Bhikkhus, this is the third thing that conduces to the long standing 
non-confusion and non-disappearance of the good Teaching. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the elder bhikkhus do not give to abundance are not 
lethargic not giving up seclusions and the main aim arouse effort to attain the 
not yet attained and to realize the not yet realized. By that the later 
generation follow them and do not give to abundance become lethargic not giving 
up seclusions and the main aim arouses effort to attain the not yet attained or 
to realize the not yet realized. Bhikkhus, this is the fourth thing that 
conduces to the long standing, non-confusion and non-disappearance of the good 
Teaching. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the Community of bhikkhus are united, pleasant and without a 
dispute abiding pleasantly reciting a single code of rules When the Community of 
bhikkhus are united they do not revile or abuse each other, or round up a 
certain one or abandon anotheròhen the displeased pacify and out of the pleased 
a certin one becomes more pleased. Bhikkhus, this is the fifth thing that 
conduces to the long standing, non-confusion and non-disappearance of the good
