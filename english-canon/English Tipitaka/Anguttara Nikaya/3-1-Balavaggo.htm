<P>1. Bhayasuttaü-Fear</P>
<P>I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered 
by Anathapindika in Jeta's grove in Savatthi. The Blessed One addressed the 
bhikkhus from there. Bhikkhus, all fear arises from the foolish not the wise. 
All troubles come from the foolish not the wise. All annoyances come from the 
foolish not the wise. A house of reeds or of grass catching fire would burn the 
ridge poles, the flames running up and down would touch the bolts and closed 
windows and would burn them all. In the same manner all fear arises from the 
foolish not the wise. All troubles come from the foolish not the wise. All 
annoyances come from the foolish not the wise. Therefore bhikkhus, the foolish 
are with fear, with troubles and annoyances the wise are not. </P>

by which the fool is known and develop the three things by which the wise man is 
known. </P>

bhikkhus, the fool thinks incorrectly, speaks incorrectly and acts incorrectly. 
If the fool did not think, speak and act incorrectly, how could the wise man

know, this good person is a fool. </P>
