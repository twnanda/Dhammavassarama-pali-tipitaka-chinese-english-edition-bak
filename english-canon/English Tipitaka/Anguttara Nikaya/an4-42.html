"There are these four ways of answering questions. Which four? There are questions that should be answered categorically [straightforwardly yes, no, this, that]. There are questions that should be answered with an analytical (qualified) answer [defining or redefining the terms]. There are questions that should be answered with a counter-question. There are questions that should be put aside. These are the four ways of answering questions."
<blockquote>
First the categorical answer,<br>
then the qualified,<br>
third, the type to be counter-questioned,<br>
&amp; fourth, the one to be set aside.<br>
Any monk who knows which is which,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in line with the Dhamma,<br>
is said to be skilled<br>
in the four types of questions:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hard to overcome, hard to beat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; profound, hard to defeat.<br>
He knows what's worthwhile<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; what's not,<br>
proficient in (recognizing) both,<br>
he rejects the worthless,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grasps the worthwhile.<br>
He's called &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one who has broken through<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to what's worthwhile,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prudent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wise.
