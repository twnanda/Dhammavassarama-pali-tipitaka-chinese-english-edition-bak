<P>007.02. I heard thus. At one time The Blessed One was living in Ambapali's 
mango orchard. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from there: </P>
<P>ßBhikkhus, determinations are impermanent not stable, there is nothing to 
comfort in them, so it is suitable that you should turn away from, get 
disentangled from and be releasd from all determinations. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the highest peak of the Himalayas, is eighty four thousand yojanas 
high from sea level. (a yojana is seven miles) Eighty four thousand yojanas in 
breadth. It is eighty four thousand yojanas deep down in the sea. Bhikkhus, 
after the lapse of many years, many hundreds of thousands of years there comes a 
time when it does not rain. When it does not rain, all seed and vegetation born 
plants such as medicinal grass, plants trees and forests dry up and wither and 
are no more. Bhikkhus, thus determinations are impermanent not stable, there is 
nothing to comfort in them, so it is suitable that you should turn away from, 
get disentangled from and be releasd from all determinations. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, after the lapse of many years, many hundreds of thousands of years 
there comes a time when a second sun rises. When a second sun rises whatever 
streams, rivulets dry up and wither and are no more. Bhikkhus, thus 
determinations are impermanent not stable, there is nothing to comfort in them, 
so it is suitable that you should turn away from, get disentangled from and be 
releasd from all determinations.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, after the lapse of many years, many hundreds of thousands of years 
there comes a time when a third sun rises. When a third sun rises, the great 
rivers such as the Ganges, yamuna, Aciravatie, Sarabhu and Mahi dry up and 
wither. Bhikkhus, thus determinations are impermanent not stable, there is 
nothing to comfort in them, so it is suitable that you should turn away from, 
get disentangled from and be releasd from all determinations. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, after the lapse of many years, many hundreds of thousands of years 
there comes a time when a fourth sun rises. When a fourth sun rises, the great 
ponds mintained by the great rivers such as Anotatta, Sihapapata, Rathakara, 
Kannamunda, Kunala, Chadanta and Mandakini dry up and wither, they become no 
more. Bhikkhus, thus determinations are impermanent not stable, there is nothing 
to comfort in them, so it is suitable that you should turn away from, get 
disentangled from and be releasd from all determinations. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, after the lapse of many years, many hundreds of thousands of years 
there comes a time when a fifth sun rises. When a fifth sun rises, the water in 
the great ocean recedes one hundred yojanas, two hundred yojanas three hundred 
yojanas, five hundred yojanas, six hundred yojanas and seven hundred yojanas. 
The water recedes to the height of seven, six, five, four, three, two palms and 
even one palm. The water recedes to the height of seven, six, five, four, three, 
two men, or even one man. It recedes to half the height of a man. It recedes to 
the knee depth of a man, to the ankle depth of a man. When the fifth sun rises 
there would not be water in the ocean to wet the fingers up to the knots. 
Bhikkhus, thus determinations are impermanent not stable, there is nothing to 
comfort in them, so it is suitable that you should turn away from, get 
disentangled from and be releasd from all determinations. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, after the lapse of many years, many hundreds of thousands of years 
there comes a time when a sixth sun rises. When a sixth sun rises, the great 
earth and the peak of the Himalayas smokes, and gets filled with smoke. Like 
when something made by a potter is cooked. It smokes and gets filled up with 
smoke. In the same manner when a sixth sun rises, the great earth and the peak 
of the Himalayas smokes, and gets filled with smoke. Bhikkhus, thus 
determinations are impermanent not stable, there is nothing to comfort in them, 
so it is suitable that you should turn away from, get disentangled from and be 
releasd from all determinations. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, after the lapse of many years, many hundreds of thousands of years 
there comes a time when a seventh sun rises. When a seventh sun rises, the great 
earth and the peak of the Himalayas blazes and catch fire. When the great earth 
and the peak of the Himalayas blaze and catch fire, flames tossed by the winds 
reach upto the world of Brahma. When the peak of the Himalaya mountain burns, 
peaks as high as a hundred yojanas, two hundred yojanas, three hundred yojanas, 
four hundred yojanas and five hundred yojanas crumble. Bhikkhus, when the earth 
and the Himalaya peak is burning ash or cream of ash is not evident. Bhikkhus, 
thus determinations are impermanent not stable, there is nothing to comfort in 
them, so it is suitable that you should turn away from, get disentangled from 
and be releasd from all determinations. Bhikkhus, when the earth and the 
Himalaya peak is burning, whatever divine sayings and beliefs be, they also get 
burnt and are no more, would attained right view remain?</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in the past, there was a Teacher called Sunetta, one free of greed 
who helped to cross the ford. The Teacher Sunetta had innumerable hundreds of 
disciples .Bhikkhus, this Teacher taught, to be born in the world of Brahma. 
Those who completely knew the dispensation of Sunetta, after death, were born in 
a good state in the world of Brahma. Some of those who did not know the complete 
dispensation of Sunetta, after death, were born with those attached to the 
creation of others. Some attached to creation, soome with the happy ones, some 
with the Titan gods, some with the gods of the thirty three and with the 
guardian gods. Others were born with high clans of warriors, Brahmins and 
householders. </P>
<P>Then it occured to the Teacher Sunetta. `It is not suitable for me to be born 
in the same plane as my disciples, after death, what if I develop loving 
kindness further.' </P>
<P>Then the Teacher Sunetta developed loving kindness for seven years. Having 
developed loving kindness for seven years, he did not come to this world for 
seven forward and backward world cycles. During the forward world cycles he was 
born a radiant god and during the backward world cycles was born in an empty 
Brahma paradise. There he was Brahma the supreme Lord, not conquered with sure 
insight wielding authority </P>
<P>There, he was Brahma, Brahma the great, the unconquered lord and master with 
sure insight, holding authority for seven timesòhirty six times he was Sakka the 
kng of gods. Innumerable hundreds of times he was the righteous universal 
monarch, winning the four directions and establishing states. Bhikkhus, he was 
endowed with these seven jewels, such as the jewel of the wheel, the elephant, 
the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder and the advisor. Bhikkhus, he 
had over a thousand courageous sons with valiant figures, for crushing foreign 
armies. They lived ruling over the earth righteously, without weapons as far as 
the limit of the ocean. Bhikkhus, that Teacher Sunetta with long life and long 
standing was not released from birth, decay, death, grief, lament, 
unpleasantness and displeasure, I say not released from unpleasantness. </P>
<P>What is the reason? For not realizing and experiencing four things.What four? 
</P>
<P>Not realizing and experiencing the virtues, concentration, wisdom and release 
of the noble ones. Now he has realized and experienced the virtues, 
concentration, wisdom and release of the noble ones. The craving to be is 
uprooted, the leader of being is destroyed. Now he has no more birth. The 
Blessed One further said: </P>
<P></P>
<P>Famous Gotama, has realized noble virtues, concentration, wisdom and release 
</P>
<P>And declaring the Teaching to end unpleasantness is mindfully extinguished.

unpleasantness, a lot of worries. You should become wise, should do merit, the 
holy life should be lived, to the born death is inevitable</P>
<P>Brahmin, a mass of flesh when put in an iron pot that was heated through out 
the day quickly shrinks is unable to stand long. Life comparable to a mass of 
flesh,.re.is trifling to humans, very short, has a lot of unpleasantness, a lot 
of worries. You should become wise, should do merit, the holy life should be 
lived, to the born death is inevitable</P>
<P>Brahmin, cattle taken to be slaughtered, with every step they are approaching 
their death Life comparable to cattle to be slaughterd is trifling to humans, 
very short, has a lot of unpleasantness, a lot of worries. You should become 
wise, should do merit, the holy life should be lived, to the born death is 
inevitable</P>
<P>At that time humans enjoyed a life span of sixty thousand years and girls 
lived in their parental home for five hundred years.At that time humans had only 
six ailments, cold, heat, hunger, thirst, and the need to urinate and 
excrete.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, that teacher Araka was teaching humans with such a long life span 
and such long standing and such few ailments. That life is trifling to humans, 
very short, has a lot of unpleasantness, a lot of worries. You should become 
wise, should do merit, the holy life should be lived, to the born death is 
inevitable. Bhikkhus, at this time if someone enjoys long life, it is a hundred 
years or a little more, Someone living a hundred years has three hundred 
seasons, a hundred Winters, a hundred Summers, and a hundred Rains. Bhikkhus, 
someone living a hundred seasons, lives only one thousand two hundred months, 
four hundred months of the Winter, four hundred months of the Summer and four 
hundred months of the Rains. One living one thousand two hundred months has two 
thousand four hundred fortnights. It consists of eight hundred Winter 
fortnights, eight hundred Summer fortnights and eight hundred Rains fortnights. 
Someone living twentyfour thousand fortnights has thirty six thousand nights. 
Consisting of twelve thousand Winter nights, twelve thousand Summer nights and 
twelve thousand Rains nights. One living thirtysix thousand nights eats seventy 
two thousand meals -It comes to twenty four thousand Winter meals, twentyfour 
thousand Summer meals and twenty four thousand Rains meals, together with 
mother's milk drunk and the missed meals.</P>
<P>The missed meals are when having a monkey sleep he does not eat, when unhappy 
he does not eat, when ill he does not eat, and observing the full moon night he 
does not eat.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, I have innumerated the life span, seasons, months, fortnights, 
nights and days the number of meals of a human who lives a hundred years. I have 
done what should be done by the Teacher to the disciples out of compassion. 
These are the roots of trees and empty houses. Concentrate! Do not have remorse 
later. This is our advise to you. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
