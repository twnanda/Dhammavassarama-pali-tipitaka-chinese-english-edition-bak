<P>89. Then the bhikkhu Kokalika approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on 
a side and said:- ßVenerable sir, Sariputta and Moggallana are under the 
influence of evil desires. </P>
<P>ßKokalika, do not say so! Sariputta and Moggallana are well behaved! Arouse 
pleasant thoughts towards them. </P>
<P>For the second time the bhikkhu Kokalika said to The Blessed One, ßVenerable 
sir, whatever The Blessed One says, Sariputta and Moggallana are under the 
influence of evil desires. </P>
<P>ßKokalika, do not say so! Sariputta and Moggallana are well behaved! Arouse 
pleasant thoughts towards them. </P>
<P>For the third time the bhikkhu Kokalika said to The Blessed One, ßVenerable 
sir, however much they may be truthful and trustworthy to The Blessed One, 
Sariputta and Moggallana are under the influence of evil desires. </P>
<P>ßKokalika, do not say so! Sariputta and Moggallana are well behaved! Arouse 
pleasant thoughts towards them. </P>
<P>Then the bhikkhu Kokalika got up from his seat, worshipped, circumambulated 
The Blessed One and went away. Soon afterwards, his body was covered with a rash 
the size of mustard seeds, then the boils became the size of green peas, later 
they became the size of chick peas, then they became the size of the seeds of 
the jujube, later they became the size of the jujube. Then they became the size 
of the fruit emblic myrobalan and the size of the wood apple. Then they burst 
and pus and blood oozed. He slept on banana leaves like festering flesh </P>
<P>Then the independent brahma, Taru approached the bhikkhu Kokalika established 
in space said:- Kokalika, develop pleasant thoughts towards Sariputta and 
Moggallana! They are well behaved. </P>
<P>ßFriend, who are you? </P>
<P>ßI am the independent brahma Taru </P>
<P>ßFriend, weren't you declared a non-returner by The Blessed One? Do you see 
how you intrude here. </P>
<P>Then the independent brahma Taru recited a verse to the bhikkhu 
Kokalika:-</P>
<P>ßTo man a dagger is born in the mouth, saying evil words with it,</P>
<P>The fool destroys himself, by praising the blameworthy,</P>
<P>Blaming the praiseworthy. He choses bad luck and does not feel pleasant. </P>
<P>A gambler losing all his wealth and himself, is nothing compared to </P>
<P>Developing a defiled mind towards well gone ones. </P>
<P>Blaming noble ones, with defiled words and thoughts causes births in,</P>
<P>Hundred thousand Nirabbuda hells and five sixty hundred Abbuda hells. </P>
<P>Bhikkhu Kokalika died from that ailment and was born in the Paduma hell for 
developing a defiled mind towards Sariputta and Moggallana.</P>
<P>Then brahma Sahampati, when the night was far gone, illuminating the whole of 
Jeta's grove approached The Blessed One, worshipped and standing on a side 
said:- </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, the bhikkhu Kokalika has died and is born in the Paduma hell, 
owing to developing a defiled mind towards Sariputta and Moggallana. Then Brahma 
Sahampati worshipped, circumambulated The Blessed One and disappeared from 
there. </P>
<P>At the end of that night The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:- </P>
<P>ßBhikkhus, when the night was far gone, illuminating the whole of Jeta's 
grove Brahma Sahampati approached me, worshipped and standing on a side said:- 
</P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, the bhikkhu Kokalika has died and is born in the Paduma hell, 
owing to developing a defiled mind towards Sariputta and Moggallana. Then Brahma 
Sahampati worshipped, circumambulated me and disappeared from there. </P>
<P>When this was said a certain bhikkhu said to The Blessed One:- ßVenerable 
sir, how long is the life span in the Paduma hell? </P>
<P>ßBhikkhu, the life span in the Paduma hell is difficult to enumerate, as it 
is this amount of years, or this amount of hundred years, or this amount of 
thousand years, or this amount o hundred thousand years. </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, could a comparison be given? </P>
<P>ßBhikkhu, a comparison could be given. Bhikkhu, there is a man with twenty 
cart loads of sesame.by the Kosala measure. He throws out one seed of sesame at 
the end of a hundred years and throws another, at the end of another hundred 
years. In this manner the twenty cart loads of sesame would finish and come to 
an end but not the span of, one Abuda hell. </P>
<P>Bhikkhu, twenty of these Abuda hell spans is equal to one Nirabbuda hell 
span. Bhikkhu, twenty of these Nirabbuda hell spans is equal to one Ababa hell 
span. Bhikkhu, twenty of these Ababa hell spans is equal to one Atata hell span. 
Bhikkhu, twenty of these Atata hell spans is equal to one Ahaha hell span. 
Bhikkhu, twenty of these Ahaha hell spans is equal to one Kumudu hell span. 
Bhikkhu, twenty of these Kumudu hell spans is equal to one Sogandhika hell span. 
Bhikkhu, twenty of these Sogandhika hell spans is equal to one Uppalaka hell 
span. Bhikkhu, twenty of these Uppalaka hell spans is equal to one Pundirika 
hell span. Bhikkhu, twenty of these Pundirika hell spans is equal to one Paduma 
hell span. Bhikkhu, the bhikkhu Kokalika fell into the Paduma hell for 
developing an unpleasant mind towards Sariputta and Moggallana. The Blessed One 
further said:-</P>
<P>ßTo man a dagger is born in the mouth, saying evil words with it,</P>
<P>The fool destroys himself, by praising the blameworthy,</P>
<P>Blaming the praiseworthy. He choses bad luck and does not feel pleasant. </P>
<P>A gambler losing all his wealth and himself, is nothing compared to </P>
<P>Developing a defiled mind towards well gone ones. </P>
<P>Blaming noble ones, with defiled words and thoughts causes births in,</P>
<P>Hundred thousand Nirabbuda hells and five sixty hundred Abbuda hells.

bends, slopes and inclines to reach seclusion, attached to non -sensuality 
destroys those things for which there is a fall for desires. The bhikkhu who has 
destroyed desires with this power acknowledges, my desires are destroyed.</P>
<P>Again, venerable sir, the four establishments of mindfulness are well 
developed in the bhikkhu who has destroyed desires The bhikkhu who has destroyed 
desires with this power acknowledges, my desires are destroyed.</P>
<P>Again, venerable sir, the bhikkhu who has destroyed desires, is thoroughly
