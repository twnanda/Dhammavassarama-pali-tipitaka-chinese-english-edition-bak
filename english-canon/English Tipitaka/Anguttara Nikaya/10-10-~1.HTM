states, am certain of enlightenment.'</P>
<P>Householder, what are the five fears and hostilities appeased? </P>
<P>Householder, one destroying living things, has fear and hostility, in this

<P>93. At one time The Blessed One was abiding in the monastery offered by 
Anathapindika in Jeta's grove in Savatthi. Then the householder Anathapindika 
was daily going to see The Blessed One. One day it occured to the householder 
Anathapindika:- It is not suitable to see The Blessed One at this time, he is in 
his seclusion. It is not suitable to see the bhikkhus who advice on mind 
developement, they also are in seclusion. What if I go to the monastery of the 
wandering ascetics of other sects? </P>
<P>Then the householder Anathapindika approached the monastery of the wandering 
ascetics of other sects. At that time the wandering ascetics of other sects were 
noisy and seated were talking on childish topics in a high pitch. They saw the 
householder Anathapindika coming in the distance and made gestures to each 
other:- ßGood ones, make less noise. Do not make such noise. The householder 
Anathapindika is coming to the monastery. He is a disciple of the recluse 
Gotama, who wears white clothes and lives in Savatthi. He is one who likes 
silence, may be he is approaching thinking the gathering is silent </P>
<P>The wandering ascetics of other sects then became silent and the householder 
Anathapindika approached the wandering ascetics of other sects and exchanging 
friendly greetings sat on a side. Then the wandering sects of other sects 
said:-</P>
<P>ßHouseholder, tell us, of what view is the recluse Gotama? </P>
<P>ßSirs, I do not know everything about the view of The Blessed One </P>
<P>ßHouseholder, since you do not know the view of the recluse Gotama, tell us 
about the view of the bhikkhus. </P>
<P>ßSirs, I do not know about the view of the bhikkhus either </P>
<P>ßHouseholder, since you do not know the view of the recluse Gotama, nor the 
view of the bhikkhus tell us what is your view? .</P>
<P>ßSirs, that is not difficult for me, to declare of what view I am. Yet come 
on! You venerable ones first declare your own views and later it will be easy 
for me to declare my view. </P>
<P>When this was said a certain wandering ascetic said:- householder, `The world 
is eternal! This is the truth, all others are false.' I am of this view. </P>
<P>Another wandering ascetic said:- householder, `The world is not eternal! This 
is the truth, all others are false.' I am of this view. </P>
<P>Another wandering ascetic said:- householder, `The world is limited! This is 
the truth, all others are false.' I am of this view. </P>
<P>Another wandering ascetic said:- householder, `The world is not 
limited,...re..ñhe soul is the body,...re.... the soul is different from the 
body,...re..ñhe Thus Gone One is after death, ...re... the Thus Gone One is not

Thus Gone One neither is nor is not after death! This is the truth, all others 
are false.' I am of this view. </P>
<P>When this was said, the householder Anathapindika said to those wandering 
ascetics:- Sirs, whoever venerable one said -'The world is eternal, this is the 
truth all else is false, householder, am of this view!' This view of the 
venerable one, has arisen on account of unwise attention or on account of 
anothers' words. That view is produced, compounded, is thought out and 
dependently arisen. Whatever is produced, compounded, thought out and 
dependently arisen is impermanent. That which is impermanent is unpleasant. The 
venerable one is sticking to that unpleasantness and reaching up to it. </P>
<P>Sirs, whoever venerable one said -'The world is not eternal, this is the 
truth all else is false, householder, am of this view!' This view of the 
venerable one, has arisen on account of unwise attention or on account of

dependently arisen. Whatever is produced, compounded, thought out and

one, has arisen on account of unwise attention or on account of anothers' words. 
That view is produced, compounded, is thought out and dependently arisen. 
Whatever is produced, compounded, thought out and dependently arisen is 
impermanent. That which is impermanent is unpleasant. The venerable one is 
sticking to that unpleasantness is reaching up to it.</P>
<P>Then the wandering ascetics said:- ßHouseholder we have declared our 
individual views, now tell us your view. </P>
<P>ßSirs, whatever is produced, compounded, is thought out and dependently 
arisen is impermanent. Whatever is impermanent is unpleasant. What is 
unpleaslant is not mine, am not in it. It is not my self. Sirs am of that view 
</P>
<P>ßHouseholder, whatever is produced, compounded, is thought out and 
dependently arisen is impermanent. Whatever is impermanent is unpleasant. 
Whatever is unpleaslant that is you. Householder, you stick to it and reach up 
to it. </P>

really is, with right wwisdom. I know the escape beyond it, as it really is. 
</P>
<P>When this was said the wandering ascetics became silent, confused, with 
drooping bodies turned their faces down became thoughtful and unable to reply. 
When the householder Anathapindika knew that the wandering ascetics had become 
silent, confused, with drooping bodies, turned down faces were thoughtful and 
unable to reply back, got up from his seat and approached The Blessed One, 
worshipped, sat on a side and related the whole conversation with the wandering

<P>95. òhe wandering ascetic Uttiya approached The Blessed One, exchanged 
friendly greetings, sat on a side and said :- </P>
<P>ßDoes good Gotama say, the world is eternal. This is the truth, all else is 
false? </P>
<P>ßUttiya, I have not declared, the world is eternal. This is the truth, all 
else is false. </P>
<P>ßDoes good Gotama say, the world is not eternal. This is the truth, all else

<P>ßUttiya, I have not declared that either, the world is eternal. This is the 
truth, all else is false. </P>
<P>`ßDoes good Gotama say, the world is limited. This is the truth, all else is 
false? </P>
<P>ßUttiya, I have not declared, the world is limited. This is the truth, all 
else is false. </P>
<P>ßDoes good Gotama say, the world is not limited....re...ñhe soul and body is 
the same,...re...ñhe soul is different from the body, ...re..ñhe Thus Gone One

not after death. This is the truth, all else is false? </P>
<P>ßUttiya, I have not declared that either, the Thus Gone One neither is nor is 
not after death. This is the truth, all else is false. </P>
<P>ßGood Gotama, when asked does good Gotama say, the world is eternal, this is 
the truth, all else is false. It was said it is not declared by me, The world is 
eternal, this is the truth all else is false </P>
<P>When asked does good Gotama say, the world is not eternal, this is the truth, 
all else is false. It was said it is not declared by me, The world is not 
eternal, this is the truth all else is false </P>
<P>When asked does good Gotama say, the world is limited,...re...õot limited, 
...re..ñhe soul and the body is the same, ...re.ñhe soul is different from the 
body, ...re.. the Thus Gone One is after death, ...re..ñhe Thus Gone One is not

Thus Gone One neither is nor is not after death. This is the truth, all else is 
false. It was said it is not declared by me either. The Thus Gone One neither is 
nor is not after death, this is the truth all else is false. Then what indeed 
does good Gotama declare? </P>
<P>ßUttiya, I declare the Teaching having realized by meself, to my disciples 
for the purification of beings, for the ending of grief, lament, unpleasantness, 
displeasure and distress for the realization of extinction. </P>
<P>ßWhen good Gotama declares the Teaching having realized by himself to the 
disciples, for the purification of beings, for the ending of grief, lament, 
unpleasantness, displeasure and distress for the realization of extinction, is 
all the world or half the world or one third of it led away? When this was asked 
The Blessed One became silent. </P>
<P>Then it occured to venerable Ananda The wandering ascetic overcome by this 
evil view asks a question from the completely exalted one, the question does not 
go home, it is not explained, it becomes incapable to be answered. It will be 
for Uttiya's unpleasantness for a long time. </P>
<P>Then venerable Ananda said to the wandering ascetic:- ßFriend, I will give 
you a comparison, for some wise ones understand the meaning when a comparison is 
given. </P>
<P>To a neighbouring city there is a deep moat and a high wall with a single 
gate and a wise gate keeper who stops the unknown and allows the known to enter. 
He encircles round the city wall and does not see a single entrance or a hole so 
far as a cat to enter. The knowledge does not arise to him:- This much enters 
the city or this much leaves the city. Yet he knows, all that enter or leave the 
city have to leave or enter through this gate.</P>
<P>In the same manner, the Thus Gone One is not eager whether all are led away 
from the world, half or one third is led away from the world. It occurs to the 
Thus Gone One:-</P>
<P>`Whoever was led away, are led away and will be led away from the world, they 
all dispel the five hindrances, wisely make the finer defilements of the mind 
weak, develop the mind in the four establishments of mindfulness and the seven 
enlightenment factors as it really should be, thus they were led away, are led 
away or will be led away from the world. Friend, the question you asked from The

<P>96. At one time venerable Ananda was abiding in the warm water monastery in 
Rajagaha and waking up during the early hours of the day went to the hot water 
spring to wash the body. Having washed the body and come out was standing in one 
robe until the body was dry, The wandering ascetic Kokunada too had got up 
during the early hours of the day and had come to the hot water spring to wash 
the body</P>
<P>The wandering ascetic Kokunada seeing venerable Ananda said:- Friend, who are 
you? </P>
<P>ßFriend, I am a bhikkhu. </P>
<P>ß Friend, whose bhikkhu are you? </P>
<P>ßFriend, am one of the sons of the Sakyas. </P>
<P>ßI want to ask a question from the venerable one if the venerable one gives 
me permission. </P>
<P>ßAsk friend, we will listen and explain. </P>
<P>The world is eternal, this is the truth. All else is false is the good one of 
this view? </P>
<P>ßFriend, am not of this view, the world is eternal. This is the truth, all

else is false. </P>
<P>ßThe world is not limited....re...ñhe soul and body is the same,...re...ñhe 
soul is different from the body, ...re..ñhe Thus Gone One is after death, 
...re... The Thus Gone One is not after death, ...re..òhe Thus Gone One is and

This is the truth, all else is false, is the good one of this view? </P>
<P>ßFriend, am not of the view, the Thus Gone One neither is nor is not after 
death. This is the truth, all else is false. </P>
<P>ßThen does the good one not know and not see? </P>
<P>ßFriend, I know and I see. </P>
<P>ßGood one, when asked, the world is eternal, this is the truth, all else is 
false. It was said am not of the view, the world is eternal, this is the truth 
all else is false. </P>
<P>When asked, the world is not eternal, this is the truth, all else is false. 
It was said, am not of the view the world is not eternal, this is the truth all

<P>99. Venerable Upali approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on side and 
said:- ßVenerable sir, I desire to live in forest dwellings and jungle paths. 
</P>
<P>ßUpali, life in forest dwellings and jungle paths is difficult to bear. It is 
difficult to be attached to seclusion. The mind of the bhikkhu who is not 
concentrated is carried away by solitude. Upali, if someone says:-I will abide 
in jungle forests to gain concentration. He could expect a sinking down or an 
elation. </P>
<P>Upali, a huge elephant of about seven or seven and half cubits comes to a 
huge pond of water. It occurs to him:- `What if I descend this pond, enjoy 
washing my ears and back, bathe and drink and ascending the pond go where I 
like. 'Then the huge elephant descends to the pond, enjoys washing his ears and 
back, bathes, drinks and ascends from it and goes wherever he likes. What is the 
reason? Upali, he has a huge self, and could withstand that depth and enjoy the 
depth . </P>
<P>Then a hare or a cat comes and it occurs to it:- If the huge elephant can why 
can't I.? What if I ascend the great pond, enjoy washing my ears and back, drink 
and bathe and ascending go where I want to go. Without considering he jumps into 
the great pond, and he should expect this. -Either sinking or being thrown up . 
What is the reason? </P>
<P>Upali the self is small, the pond is deep, it cannot withstand the depth. In 
the same manner, Upali if someone says:-I will abide in jungle forests to gain 
concentration. He could expect a sinking down or an elation. </P>
<P>Upali, a baby boy would play with his own urine and excreta. Isn't it 
completely foolish to do so? </P>
<P>ßIt is, venerable sir. </P>
<P>ßThat boy in the meantime with his developed mental faculties would play 
games played by young boys such as:- Playing with, a toy plough, sticks, turning 
somersaults, a toy windmill, toy measures, a toy cart or a small bow. Isn't this 
more excellent than the game he played earlier? </P>
<P>ßYes, venerable sir. </P>
<P>ßUpali, in the meantime that boy when his mental facuties are developed, 
provided and endowed with the five strands of sensual pleasures would enjoy 
pleasant, agreeable forms cognizable by eye consciousness arousing fondness and 
sensual desires. Would enjoy pleasant, agreeable sounds cognizable by ear 
consciousness....re.... scents cognizable by nose consciousness,...re..... 
tastes cognizable by tongue consciousness, ...re.... and touches cognizable by 
body consciousness. Upali, isn't this more excellent than the games he enjoyed 
earlier? </P>
<P>ßYes, venerable sir. </P>
<P>ßHere, Upali, the Thus Gone One, worthy, rightfully enlightened, endowed with 
knowledge and conduct, well gone, knower of the worlds, incomparable tamer of 
those to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed is born in 
the world. He declares the Teaching, by himself known and realized, to the 
world, together with its gods and men and the community of recluses and 
Brahmins. That Teaching is good at the beginning, middle and end, full of 
meaning even in the letters, declaring the pure and complete holy life. </P>
<P>A householder, or the son of a householder or someone born to a clan hears 
that Teaching and gains faith in the Thus Gone One. With that gain of faith he 
reflects:- </P>
<P>`The household life is full of difficulties and defilements, the going forth 
is like open space. </P>
<P>Living in a household, it is difficult to lead the holy life pure and 
complete. What if I shave head and beard, wear yellow clothes, leave the 
household and go forth.</P>
<P>In the meantime leaving behind a great mass of wealth or a little wealth, a 
large circle of relations or a small circle of relations he shaves head and 
beard, wears yellow clothes and leaving home, becomes homeless.</P>
<P>Become homeless, he trains in the precepts of the bhikkhus. Giving up 
destroying living things, throws away stick and weapon, abides shameful with 
aroused compassion for all beings. </P>
<P>Putting an end to taking the not given, desiring the given, abides without 
theft making the self pure.</P>
<P>Leaving behind the unholy life, abides far removed from low sexuality.</P>
<P>Giving up and abstaining from telling lies, talks the truth become 
trustworthy to the world. </P>
<P>Giving up slandering abstains from telling there, what was heard here to 
disunite these. Or from telling here, what was heard there to disunite those. 
Thus unites the broken, makes firm those united. Desiring and attached to unity 
talks words, for unity to promote unity. </P>
<P>Abstaining from rough talk, talks words that are pleasing to the ears, go 
straight into the heart, noble and good mannered words, desired by the general 
populace. </P>
<P>Abstaining from frivolous talk, talks words that are truthful, meaningful, 
words that accord with the Teaching and discipline. Talks truthful, meaningful 
words at the right time, words that should be treasured. </P>
<P>He abstains from destroying seedlings and vegetation. Partakes one meal per 
day, abstains from food at night and at untimely hours. Abstains from dance, 
singing, instrumental music and sight seeing. Abstains from bearing flowers, 
scents, ointments, wearing ornaments and decorating the self. Abstains from high 
and stately beds and seats. Abstains from accepting gold and silver, uncooked 
grains and uncooked flesh. Abstains from accepting women and girls, slave women 
and men, goats and cows, foul and pigs. Abstains from accepting elephants, 
cattle, horses and mares. Abstains from accepting fields and lands. Abstains 
from taking messages, buying and selling. Abstains from false weighing, false 
coining and false measuring. Abstains from deceit, fraud and insincere 
activities. Abstains from cutting, binding and tying. Abstains from highway 
robbery and various deceptive ways of obtaining morsel food </P>
<P>He is satisfied with the robe to cover the body, with the morsel food to 
please the stomach. Wherever he goes, he goes with all his things. Endowed with 
the virtues of a noble one, he enjoys the pleasantness of being free from 
faults. </P>
<P>Seeing a form, he does not take the sign or the detail. To one abiding with 
the faculty of the eye unprotected, demeritorious things of coveting and 
displeasure may arise. He protects the faculty of the eye. Hearing a sound, 
...re.... Scenting a smell, ...re.... Tasting some food,....re..... Experiencing 
a touch on the body, ...re... Cognizing an idea he does not take the sign or the 
detail. To one abiding with the faculty of the mind unprotected, demeritorious 
things of coveting and displeasure may arise. He protects the faculty of the 
mind. Endowed with this noble ones' control of the mental faculties He enjoys 
the pleasantness of internally not being hurt, . </P>
<P>Approaching and receding he becomes aware. Looking on and about he becomes 
aware. Bending and stretching he becomes aware. Bearing the three robes and bowl 
he becomes aware. Enjoying, drinking, eating and tasting he becomes aware. 
Going, standing, sitting and lying until awake he becomes aware and talking or 
keeping silence he becomes aware. </P>
<P>Endowed with this mass of virtues of the noble ones, the control of the 
mental faculties of the noble ones, the mindful awareness of the noble ones, he 
dwells secluded, at the root of a tree in the forest, a mountain grotto, a 
mountain cave, a cemetery, a jungle path, an open space or a heap of straw/ Gone 
to the forest, to the root of a tree or to an empty house he sits with crossed 
legs and body straight with mindfulness established in front.</P>
<P>Dispelling covetousness for the world he purifies the mind and abides with a 
mind free of covetousness. Dispelling aversion he abides purifying the mind of 
aversion with compassion for all living things. Dispelling sloth and torpor, he 
abides purifying the mind of sloth and torpor mindful and aware of the 
perception of light. Dispelling restlessness and worry, he abides with a 
balanced mind, appeasing the restlessness and worring. Dispelling doubts abides

secluding the mind from sensual thoughts and angry thoughts, with thoughts and 
dicursive thoughts and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion he abides in 
the first higher state of the mind. </P>
