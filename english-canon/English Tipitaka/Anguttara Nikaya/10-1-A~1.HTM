<P>1. I heard thus. At one time The Blessed One was abiding in the monastery 
offered by Anathapindika in Jeta's grove in Savatthi. Venerable Ananda 
approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said:- </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, for what reason and benefits are clever virtues?" </P>
<P>ßAnanda, clever virtues are for the reason and benefit of non-remorse. </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, for what reason and benefits is non-remorse?" </P>
<P>ßAnanda, non-remorse is for the reason and benefit of delight. </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, for what reason and benefits is delight?" </P>
<P>ßAnanda, delight is for the reason and benefit of joy" </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, for what reason and benefits is joy?" </P>
<P>ßAnanda, joy is for the reason and benefit of tranquility. </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, for what reason and benefits is tranquility?" </P>
<P>ßAnanda, tranquility is for the reason and benefit of pleasantness. </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, for what reason and benefits is pleasantness?" </P>
<P>ßAnanda, pleasantness is for the reason and benefit of concentration. </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, for what reason and benefits is concentration?" </P>
<P>ßAnanda, concentration is for the reason and benefit of the vision of things 
as they really are" </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, for what reason and benefits is the vision of things as they 
really are?" </P>
<P>ßAnanda, the vision of things as they really are, is for the reason and 
benefit of turning away and disenchantment" </P>
<P>`ßVenerable sir, for what reason and benefits is turning away and 
disenchantment?" </P>
<P>ßAnanda, turning away and disenchantment is for the reason and benefit of the 
knowledge and vision of release" </P>
<P>Thus Ananda, clever virtues are for the reason and benefit of non-remorse. 
Non-remorse is for the reason and benefit of delight. Delight is for the reason 
and benefit of joy. Joy is for the reason and benefit of tranquility. 
Tranquility is for the reason and benefit of pleasantness. Pleasantness is for 
the reason and benefit of concentration. Concentration is for the reason and 
benefit of knowledge and vision of seeing things as they really are. Knowledge 
and vision of seeing things as they really are, is for the reason and benefit of 
turning away and disenchantment. Turning away and disenchantment is for 
knowledge and vision of release. Thus Ananda, clever virtues lead to the 
highest. </P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>
<P align=center>2. Cetanàkaranãyasuttaü- Intending.</P></B></FONT><FONT 
face=Times_CSX+>
<P>2. ßBhikkhus, someone who has clever virtues, need not intend. `May 
non-remorse come to me.' It is the general rule for non-remorse to arise to a 
virtuous person. Someone who has no remorse, need not intend. `May delight come 
to me.' It is the general rule for delight to arise to one without remorse. 
Someone who is delighted need not intend. `May joy come to me.' It is the 
general rule for joy to arise to a delighted one. Someone who is joyful need not 
intend. `May my body be appeased' It is the general rule for the joyful to 
experience appeasement of the body. Someone with an appeased body need not 
intend. `May I feel pleasant.'It is the general rule for one with an appeased 
body to feel pleasant. A pleasant one, need not intend. `May my mind be 
concentrated.' It is the general rule for the pleasant one to be concentrated. 
Bhikkhus, someone with a concentrated mind need not intend. `May I know and see 
it, as it really is. It is the general rule for the concentrated to know and see 
as it really is. Bhikkhus, someone who knows and sees, as it really is, need not 
intend. `May I turn away and be disenchanted.' It is the general rule for one 
who knows and sees to turn away and be disenchanted. Bhikkhus, the one who has 
turned away and become disenchanted need not intend. `May I realize knowldge and 
vision of release' It is the general rule for one who turned away and is 
disenchanted to realize knowledge and vision of release. </P>
<P>Thus bhikkhus turning away and disenchantment is for knowledge and vision of 
release and its benefits. Knowledge and vision of seeing things as they really 
are, is for turning away and disenchantment and its benefits. Concentration is 
for knowledge and vision of seeing things as they really are, and their 
benefits. Pleasantness is for concentration and its benefits. Tranquility is for 
pleasantness and its benefits. Joy is for tranquility and its benefits. Delight 
is for joy and its benefits. Non-remorse is for delight and its benefits. Clever 
virtues are for non-remorse and its benefits. Thus bhikkhus, thoughts overflow 
from thoughts and get completed by thoughts, while they flow up and down. </P>
<P>3. Pañhama-upanisasuttaü- First that rests on causes </P>
<P>3. Bhikkhus, to the unvirtuous, gone wrong in virtues, the cause for 
non-remorse is destroyed. When there is remorse, gone wrong in non-remorse the 
cause for delight is destroyed. When there is no delight, gone wrong in delight, 
the cause for joy is destroyed. When there is no joy, gone wrong in joy, the

they really are, the cause for turning away and disenchantment is destroyed. 
When there is no turning away and disenchantment, gone wrong in turnng away and 
disenchantment, the cause for knowledge and vision of release is destroyed. 
Bhikkhus, like the shoots, bark, accessory wood and heart wood, of a tree that 
has lost its branches and leaves, would not grow completely, in the same manner 
to the unvirtuous gone wrong in virtues, the cause for non-remorse is destroyed. 
When there is remorse, gone wrong in non-remorse the cause for delight is 
destroyed.......re.......knowledge and vision of release is destroyed. </P>

<P>ß Friend, Ananda, once I was abiding in this same dark forest in Savatthi and 
abode in that concentration. Then in earth I had no perceptions of earth, in 
water I had no perceptions of water, in fire I had no perceptions of fire, in

the sphere of space, in the sphere of consciousness, I had no perceptions of the

<P>ßFriend, Sariputta, of what were you perceptive at the time?" </P>
<P>ßFriend, Ananda, the perception, `Cessation of being is extinction.' arose 
and faded in me with knowledge. Friend, like at the edge of a potsherd the 
splinters rise and fade with knowledge. In the same manner the perception, 
`cessation of being is extinction' arose and faded in me. Friend, at that time I 
was of the perception, `Cessation of being is extinction.'ß </P></FONT><B><FONT
