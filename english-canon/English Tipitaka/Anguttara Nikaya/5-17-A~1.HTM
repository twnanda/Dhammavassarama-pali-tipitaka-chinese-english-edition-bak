<P>017.01. Bhikkhus, these are five ways of repressing anger through which the 
bhikkhu should repress all arisen anger. What five? </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, when anger has arisen towards a certain person, loving kindness 
should be developed towards that person. Thus that anger should be repressed. 
When anger has arisen towards a certain person, compassion should be developed 
towards that person. Thus that anger should be repressed. When anger has arisen 
towards a certain person, equanimity should be developed towards that person. 
Thus that anger should be repressed. When anger has arisen towards a certain 
person, not thinking of him, forgetting him should be developed towards that 
person. Thus that anger should be repressed. When anger has arisen towards a 
certain person, the heridity of actions should be thought of that person- This 
good one is the owner of actions. He is the inheritor, origin, relation and 
refuge of actions. Whatever actions good or bad he does, will be his heritage. 
Thus that anger should be repressed. Bhikkhus, these are five ways of repressing 
anger through which the bhikkhu should repress all arisen anger.

<P>017.02. Then venerable Sariputta addressed the bhikkhus:- </P>
<P>Friends, bhikkhus, these are five ways of repressing anger through which the 
bhikkhu should repress all arisen anger. what five? </P>
<P>Here, friends, a certain person is with impure bodily behaviour and pure 
verbal behaviour, hurtfulness towards such a person should also be repressed. A 
certain person is with impure verbal behaviour and pure bodily behaviour, 
hurtfulness towards such a person should also be repressed. A certain person is 
with impure bodily behaviour and impure verbal behaviour, from time to time he 
gains a rare purity, a brightness,. hurtfulness towards such a person should 
also be repressed. A certain person is with impure bodily behaviour and impure 
verbal behaviour, from time to time he does not gain a rare purity, a 
brightness,. hurtfulness towards such a person should also be repressed A 
certain person is with pure bodily behaviour and pure verbal behaviour, from 
time to time he gains a rare purity, a brightness,. hurtfulness towards such a 
person should also be repressed. Friends, how should the hurtfulness towards a 
person with impure bodily behaviour and pure verbal behaviour be repressed? </P>
<P>Friends, like a rag robe bhikkhu seeing a worn out cloth in the street would 
pull it with the left foot, spread it out with the right foot and tearing the 
essential would take it away. Friends it is like that person's impure bodily 
behaviour and pure verbal behaviour. At such time his impure bodily behaviour 
should not be thought of, his pure verbal behaviour should be thought of. In 
this manner hurtfulness towards this person should be repressed. Friends, how 
should the hurtfulness towards a person with impure verbal behaviour and pure 
bodily behaviour be repressed? </P>
<P>Friends, there is a pond covered with moss and water plants, a man comes to 
it overcome with thirst, faintish. He ascends and removing the moss and the 
water plants with his hands, drinks that water and goes away. Friends it is like 
that person's impure verbal behaviour and pure bodily behaviour. At such time 
his impure verbal behaviour should not be thought of, his pure bodily behaviour 
should be thought of. In this manner hurtfulness towards this person should be 
repressed. Friends, how should the hurtfulness towards a person with impure 
bodily behaviour and impure verbal behaviour and from time to time who gains a 
purity a brightness be repressed? </P>
<P>Friends, in the rut made by the hoof of cattle, there is a little water. Then 
a man tired and overcome by thirst comes and it occurs to him:- What if I drink 
this little water in the cattle rut with my hands, or with a cup. If it is 
shaken or disturbed, it will not be drinkable. What if I go down on my fours, 
drink like cattle and go away. Then he goes down on his fours and drinks the 
water in the cattle rut and goes away. In the same manner friends, it is like 
that person with impure bodily behaviour, impure verbal behaviour, from time to 
time gaining a rare purity, a brightness. At such times his impure bodily 
behaviour should not be thought of, his impure verbal behaviour should not be 
thought of. The rare gain of purity and brightness that rises from time to time 
should be thought of òhe hurtfulness towards that person should be repressed in 
this manner. . . </P>
<P>Friends, how should the hurtfulness towards a person with impure bodily 
behaviour and impure verbal behaviour and who from time to time does not gain a 
purity a brightness be repressed? </P>
<P>Friends, it is like a gravely sick man who has come on the highway. In front 
of him or behind his back a village is far away. He would not get suitable food, 
suitable medicine, a suitable attendant nor a village headman. A certain man 
seeing him on the highway. arouses compassion for him and out of compassion he 
attends on him- Oh! if this person gets the suitable food, medicine, a suitable 
attendant or even a village headman! What is the reason? May this person not 
fall to destruction here itself. Friends, a person like this too should be 
attended to, out of compassion- Oh! this good person should dispel bodily 
misbehaviour, develop bodily good beehaviour. Should dispel verbal misbehaviour, 
develop verbal good behaviour,. should dispel mental misbehaviour, develop 
mental good behaviour. What is the reason? May this good person after death not 
go to loss, to a bad state, be born in hell. The hurtfulness towards that person 
should be repressed in this manner. . . </P>
<P>Friends, how should the hurtfulness towards a person with pure bodily 
behaviour and pure verbal behaviour and who from time to time gains a purity a 
brightness be repressed? </P>
<P>Friends, there is a pond with pure, clear water in a pleasant surrounding 
with several trees bordering it. Then a certain person comes tired and overcome 
by thirst. He descends into the pond, bathes, drinks water and ascending from 
the pond sits or lies under the shadow of the trees. </P>
<P>Friends, in the same manner this person's pure bodily behaviour and pure 
verbal behaviour and from time to time his gains of a purity, a brightnesses 
should be considered thus:- At that time his pure bodily behaviour should be 
thought of, his pure verbal behaviour should be thought of and his gains of 
purity and brightness from tsime to time should be thought of. The hurtfulness 
towards that person should be repressed in this manner. </P>
<P>Friends, an entirely appeased person comes and appeases his mind. Friends, 
bhikkhus, these are five ways of repressing anger through which the bhikkhu 
should repress all arisen anger. </P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>

greetings, sat on a side and venerable Ananda said thus:- </P>
<P>Friend, Bhaddaji, of sights what is the foremost, of sounds what is the 
foremost, of pleasantnesses what is the foremost, of perceptions what is the 
foremost and of the states of being what is the foremost? </P>
<P>Friend, there is brahma the overlord who is not overcome who pervades the 
directions and is the authority. If someone sees that brahma, that is the 
foremost sight. Friends, there are gods emitting streaks of light like 
lightening from their bodies. Overcome and drenched in pleasantness one day or 
other, they utter a solemn utterance:- Ah! this is pleasant! This is pleasant! 
If someone hears that sound, that is the foremost of sounds. Friends, there are 
gods who are drenched in happiness and they abide appeased in the heaven of 
happiness. This is the foremost happiness. Friend, there are gods who abide in 
the sphere, where there is nothing. That is the foremost of perceptions. Friend, 
there are gods in the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception. That is 
the foremost state of being[1]. Does venerable Bhaddaji aggree with this 
explanation as the general populace does? </P>
<P>Venerable Ananda is learned, let venerable Ananda explain. Friend, Bhaddaji, 
then listen and attend carefully:- Friend, when looking on, without an interval, 
desires get destroyed. That is the foremost sight. When listening without an 
interval, desires get destroyed. That is the foremost hearing. When pleasantness 
is without an interval, desires get destroyed. That is the foremost 
pleasantness. When the perception is without an interval, desires get destroyed. 
That is the foremost perception. When being[1] is without an interval, desires 
get destroyed. That is the foremost being. </P>
