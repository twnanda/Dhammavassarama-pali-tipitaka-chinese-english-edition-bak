On one occasion <A NAME="ananda">Ven. Ananda</A> was staying in <A NAME="kosambi">Kosambi</A>, at <A NAME="ghosita">Ghosita's monastery</A>. There he addressed the monks, "Friends!"
<p>
"Yes, friend," the monks responded.
<p>
Ven. Ananda said: "Friends, whoever -- monk or nun -- declares the attainment of arahantship in my presence, they all do it by means of one or another of <A NAME="4paths">four paths</A>. Which four?
<p>
"There is the case where a monk has developed insight preceded by tranquillity. As he develops insight preceded by tranquillity, the path is born. He follows that path, develops it, pursues it. As he follows the path, developing it &amp; pursuing it -- his fetters are abandoned, his latent tendencies abolished.
<p>
"Then there is the case where a monk has developed tranquillity preceded by insight. As he develops tranquillity preceded by insight, the path is born. He follows that path, develops it, pursues it. As he follows the path, developing it &amp; pursuing it -- his fetters are abandoned, his latent tendencies abolished.
<p>
"Then there is the case where a monk has developed tranquillity in tandem with insight. As he develops tranquillity in tandem with insight, the path is born. He follows that path, develops it, pursues it. As he follows the path, developing it &amp; pursuing it -- his fetters are abandoned, his latent tendencies abolished.
<p>
"Then there is the case where a monk's mind has its restlessness concerning the Dhamma [Comm: the corruptions of insight] well under control. There comes a time when his mind grows steady inwardly, settles down, and becomes unified &amp; concentrated. In him the path is born. He follows that path, develops it, pursues it. As he follows the path, developing it &amp; pursuing it -- his fetters are abandoned, his latent tendencies abolished.
<p>
"Whoever -- monk or nun -- declares the attainment of arahantship in my presence, they all do it by means of one or another of these four paths."
