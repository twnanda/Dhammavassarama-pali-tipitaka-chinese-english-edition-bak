Anathapindika in Jeta's grove in Savatthi. Venerable Sariputta approached The 
Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said: ßVenerable sir, I have spent 
the rains in Savatthi and desire to go to the states on a tour." ßSariputta, do 
as you think is suitable." Then venerable Sariputta getting up from his seat 
worshipped and circumambulated The Blessed One and went away. Soon after 
venerable Sariputta had gone, a certain bhikkhu said to The Blessed One: 
ßVenerable sir, venerable Sariputta having hurt me, without a reconciliation has 
left on a tour." Then The Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu: ßCome! 
Bhikkhu, address Sariputta, in my words- `Friend, Sariputta, The Blessed One 
calls you'" That bhikkhu consenting, approached venerable Sariputta and said: 
ßFriend, Sariputta, the Teacher calls you" Venerable Sariputta consented to see 
The Blessed One. By that time venerable Mahamoggallana and venerable Ananda were 
wandering from door to door with a bunch of keys. Saying ßVenerable ones 
approach! There is going to be a lion's roar of venerable Sariputta, in front of 
The Blessed One." Then venerable Sariputta approached The Blessed One, 
worshipped and sat on a side. When seated The Blessed One said: ßHere, 
Sariputta, you have offended a certain co-associate in the holy life and without 
reconciling have left on a tour"</P>

<P>Then that bhikkhu getting up from his seat, and arranging his robe on one 
shoulder, putting his head at the feet of The Blessed One said: ßVenerable sir, 
pardon me, I accused venerable Sariputta with untruthful, un-real accusation 
owing to foolishness and delusion. May The Blessed One pardon me, for future 
restraint. Bhikkhu, as you see your fault and ask for pardon, according to the 
Teaching, I pardon you. Bhikkhu, it is growth in the noble ones' discipline to 
see your fault and ask for pardon, according to the Teaching, for future

<P>ßHouseholder, gifts of coarse or exalted food may be given, that too 
carelessly, without prior thinking, not giving with one's own hand, as though 
throwing away, not appreciating the results of giving, and whenever the results 
of those actions follow, the mind does not tend to enjoy noble food, noble 
wealth, noble conveyances, the noble enjoyment of the five strands of 
sensuality. His wife, children, slaves, messengers and workmen, too are not 
obident to him, do not lend ear to develop the mind. What is the reason?

<P>Householder, in the past there was a Brahmin by the name Velama. He gave 
great gifts like this. He gave eightyfour thousand golden bowls with dipicted 
pictures filled with rupees, eightyfour thousand bowls with depicted pictures 
filled with gold, eightyfour thousand bronze bowls filled with gold. He gave 
eightyfour thousand elephants, decorated in gold and golden flags and covered 
with a golden net, eightyfour thousand chariots with the accessory lion skins, 
tiger skins, deer skins, orange blankets decorated in gold, and golden flags and 
covered with golden nets. He gave eightyfour thousand cows dressing them up in 
fine cloth with bronze pails to milk them. Gave eightyfour thousand maidens 
decorated with jewelled ear-rings. Gave eightyfour thousand cushions, deer skin 
rugs for covering and spreading, deer skin carpets, cannopies, red cushions for 
the two sides. He gave eighty four thousand crores of clothes, of dainty linen 
cloth, of dainty silk coth, of dainty woollen cloth, of daintily spun cloth. 
There is nothing to speak about eatables, drinks, hard food and nourishments, he 
distributed them like the flowing river. </P>
<P>Householder, it might occur to you: `The Brahmin Velama was someone else, who 
gave great gifts at that time. It should not be known like that. I was the 
Brahmin Velama at that time. I gave those great gifts. Householder, at that time 
there was no one suitable to offer gifts. None to purify gifts. </P>
<P>Householder, if the Brahmin Velama when giving those gifts satisfied a single 
one, who had come to righteousness of view, the benefits would have been very 
much more. . . If the Brahmin Velama when giving those gifts satisfied one 
hundred, who had come to righteousness of view or a once returner, the benefits 
would have been very much more. If the Brahmin Velama when giving those gifts 
satisfied one hundred once returners, or a non-returner.....re..... one hundred 
non-returners or a worthy one, ....re... a hundred worthy ones or one self 
enlightened, ...re... a hundred self enlightened ones or the Thus Gone One, 
worthy and rightfully enlightened ....re.... or the Community of bhikkhus headed 
by the Enlightened One ....re.... or constructed a monastery for the Community 
of bhikkhus coming from the four directions ....re.... or with a pleasant mind 
took refuge in the Enlightened One, the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus, 
....re.... or with a pleasant mind observed the precepts - to abstain from, 
destroying living things, taking the not given, wrong sexual behaviour, telling 
lies, intoxicating and brewed drinks, or if the thought of loving kindness was 
developed as long as a smell was prevailing, its benefits would have been very 
much more. . . </P>
