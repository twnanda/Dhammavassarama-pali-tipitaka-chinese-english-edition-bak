wearing robes, offered by someone, to the offerer it brings overflows of merit 
and right conduct, promoting heavenly bliss and happiness and worldly pleasure,

<P>006.02. Bhikkhus, these four are overflows of merit and right conduct, 
promotions of heavenly bliss and happiness and the bringers of worldly pleasure 
agreeability and charm. What four?</P>

Enlightened One. -That Blessed One is worthy, rightfully enlightened endowed 
with knowledge and conduct, well gone, knower of the worlds, the incomparable 
tamer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed.

Teaching, the Blessed One's Teaching is well declared, is here and now, not a 
matter of time, open to inspection, leading inwards and is to be realized by the 
wise by themselves. Bhikkhus, this is the second overflow of merit and right 
conduct, the promotion of heavenly bliss and happiness and the bringer of 
worldly pleasure, agreeability and charm.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the noble disciple is endowed with unwavering faith in the 
Community of bhikkhus. The disciples of the Blessed One have come to the right 
path, the straight path, the wise path, the path of mutual understanding. They 
are the four pairs of eight Great Men. They are suitable for hospitality, 
reverence, gifts and veneration with clasped hands. The noble field of merit for 
the world. Bhikkhus, this is the third overflow of merit and right conduct, the 
promotion of heavenly bliss and happiness and the bringer of worldly pleasure, 
agreeability and charm.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the noble disciple is endowed with the virtues favoured by 
the noble ones. Virtues that are not broken, fissured, blemished or spotted and 
virtues praised by the wise as conducive to concentration.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, this is the fourth overflow of merit and right conduct, the 
promotion of heavenly bliss and happiness and the bringer of worldly pleasure, 
agreeability and charm.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these are the four overflows of merit and right conduct, the 
promotions of heavenly bliss and happiness and the bringers of worldly pleasure,

<P>And if virtues favoured by the noble one's are his,</P>
<P>Establishing faith in the Community if he has rectified his view,</P>
<P>He is neither poor nor is his life useless</P>

<P>And establish themselves in the dispensation of the Enlightened 
One.</P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>

<P>006.03. Once the Blessed One going from Madhura to Vera¤ja had come to that 
path and many householders and their wives going from Madhura to Vera¤ja were 
also on that path. The Blessed One deviating from the path sat on the prepared 
seat under a certain tree. The householders and their wives seeing the Blessed 
One seated under a tree approached the Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a 
side. The Blessed One addressed them.</P>
<P>Householders, there are four kinds of living together. What four?</P>

the not given, misbehaves in sexual desires, tells lies, takes intoxicant and 
brewd drinks, is unvirtuous with evil thoughts of miserliness and selfishness 
and abides scolding and abusing recluses and Brahmins. Householders, thus a dead

too</P>
<P>Lives with an unvirtuous, greedy, abusive wife; a god with a dead female</P>
