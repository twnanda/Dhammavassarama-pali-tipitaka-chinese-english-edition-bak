without aroused effort One with mindfulness established will be successful, not 
without. One concentrated will be successful, not without concentration. A wise

<P>13. At one time The Blessed One was living with the Sakyas, abiding in 
Nigrodha's monastery in Kapilavatthu. The Blessed One had a desire to observe 
the rains in Savatthi.</P>
<P>The Sakya Nandiya heard that The Blessed One had a desire to observe the

desire to observe the rains in Savatthi, what if I too observe the rains in 
Savatthi and attend to the work as well. Then I will get a chance to see The 
Blessed One from time to time. </P>
<P>The Blessed One oberved the rains in Savatthi and the Sakya Nandiya too 
observed the rains in Savatthi. He attended to the work there and also from time 
to time obtained a chance to see The Blessed One. At that time many bhikkhus 
were sewing The Blessed One's robe and The Blessed One was to leave on a tour at 
the end of the three months when the robe was ready. The Sakya Nandiya heard 
that, many bhikkhus are engaged in sewing The Blessed One's robe, and The

<P>ßGood! Nandiya, sons of clansmen like you should approach the Thus Gone One

Nandiya, then you should internally establish the sign of the Thus Gone One in 
your mind. . . </P>
<P>Again, Nandiya, you should recollect the Teaching -'Well proclaimed is the

material food and are born with a certain kind of mental beings. They do not see 
any duties to do, nor any accumulation of the doneöandiya, then you should 
internally establish the sign of the gods in your mind. </P>

dispels demerit and does not seize. Nandiya, just as a pot turned upside down, 
certainly would throw out all the water, does not take in the vomited again. In 
a dried up field what is saved from the fire would indeed get burned, not the 
already burnt. In the same manner, Nandiya, the noble disciple endowed with

<P>14. Then venerable Subhuti approached The Blessed One with bhikkhu Saddha, 
worshipped sat on a side and then The Blessed One said to venerable Subhuti:- 
ßSubhuti, what is the name of this bhikkhu?" </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, his name is Saddha, he is the son of the lay disciple Sudatta 
he has left home and become homeless out of faith" </P>
<P>ßSubhuti, the bhikkhu Saddha , son of the lay disciple Sudatta, has he faith 
in the endeavours?"</P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, this is the time! Well Gone One this is the time to teach the 
faith in the endeavours to the bhikkhu Saddha. Then I will know whether the 
bhikkhu Saddha has faith in the endeavours or not. </P>
<P>ßThen Subhuti, listen, and attend carefully I will tell.</P>
<P>Here, Subhuti, the bhikkhu is virtuous restrained in the higher code of 
rules, seeing fear in the slightest fault...re..Subhuti, the bhikkhu being 
virtuous restrained in the higher code of rules seeing fear in the slightest 
fault, is faith in the endeavours. </P>
<P>Again, Subhuti, the bhikkhu becomes learned, bears the learning and 
accumulates the Teaching which is good at the beginning, middle and end, full of 
meanings in words and letters, declaring the complete and pure holy life. That 
Teaching he repeats and experiences with the mind and penetratingly sees it 
Subhuti, the bhikkhu being learned...re..and penetratingly seeing it, is faith 
in the endeavours.</P>
<P>Again, Subhuti, the bhikkhu becomes a spiritual friend a good friend and 
associate. Subhuti, this too is faith in the endeavours.</P>
<P>Again, Subhuti, the bhikkhu is suave, with gentle and kind ways, patiently 
accepting advice. Subhuti, this too is faith in the endeavours. </P>
<P>Again, Subhuti, the bhikkhu becomes not lazy, clever in whatever work small 
or large that has to be done for the co-associates in the holy life, 
discriminating ways and means to do them and get them done. Subhuti, this too is 
faith in the endeavours.</P>
<P>Again, Subhuti, the bhikkhu is attached to the Teaching, delighted in deep 
matters of the Teaching and Discipline and talks with delight about them. 
Subhuti, this too is faith in the endeavours.</P>
<P>Again, Subhuti the bhikkhu abides with aroused effort to dispel demeritorious 
things and to accumulate meritorious things, firm about meritorious things, with 
the main aim in mind. Subhuti, this too is faith in the endeavours.</P>
<P>Again, Subhuti, the bhikkhu becomes a quick and easy gainer for nothing of 
the four higher states of the mind, the pleasant abidings in this very life. 
Subhuti, this too is faith in the endeavours.</P>
<P>Again, Subhuti, the bhikkhu recollects the manifold previous births, such as 
one birth, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one 
hundred, one thousand, a hundred thousand, innumerable forward world cycles of 
births, innumerable backward world cycles of births, innumerable forward and 
backward world cycles of births-'There I was of such name, clan, disposition, 
supports, experiencing such pleasant and unpleasant feelings and with such a 
life span. Disappearing from there was born there with such name..re...with such 
a life span. Disappearing from there is born here. Thus with all details the 
manifold previous births are recollected. Subhuti, this too is faith in the 
endeavours.</P>
<P>Again Subhuti with the purified heavenly eye, beyond human, sees beings 
disappearing and appearing in unexalted and exalted states, beautiful and ugly, 
in good and evil states. Sees beings born according to their actions -'These 
good beings endowed with bodily, verbal and mental misbehaviour, blaming noble 
ones, with wrong view and the wrong view of actions, after death are born in 
decrease, in a bad state, in loss in hell. As for these good beings endowed with 
bodily, verbal and mental good behaviour, not blaming noble ones, with right 
view and the right view of actions, after death are born in increase, in a good 
state, in gain in heaven. Thus with the heavenly eye purified beyond human sees 
beings born in unexalted and exalted states..re... born according to their 
actions. </P>
<P>Subhuti, this too is faith in the endeavours.</P>
<P>Again, Subhuti, the bhikkhu destroying desires and releasing the mind and 
released through wisdom, here and now by himself realizing abides. The bhikkhu 
destroying deisres, ..re...by himself realizing abiding, Subhuti, this too is 
faith in the endeavours".</P>
<P>When this was said, venerable Subhuti said to The Blessed One:- ßVenerable 
sir, this faith in the endeavours are evident in this bhikkhu. I see them in 
himñhus</P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, this bhikkhu is virtuous, restrained in the higher code of 
rules, abides seeing fear in the slightest fault. </P>
<P>Venerable sir, this bhikkhu is learned, bearing and accumulating the Teaching 
good at the beginning, middle and end, full of meaning even in the letters and 
declaring the complete and pure holy life. He bears it, recites it verbally and 
penetrates it to straighten the view. </P>
<P>Venerable sir, this bhikkhu is a spiritual friend, a companion with good 
friendship.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, this bhikkhu is suave and patiently accepts advice.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, this bhikkhu is not lazy, is clever in doing and getting done 
whatever small and large things that have to be done for the co-associates in 
the holy life.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, this bhikkhu is fond of the Teaching and talks delightedly 
about the deep matters in the Teaching and the Discipline. </P>
<P>Venerable sir, this bhikkhu abides with aroused effort ...re... has not given 
up the main aim in meritorious things.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, this bhikkhu is a quick and easy gainer for nothing of the 
four higher states of the mind, the pleasant abidings in this very life. </P>
<P>Venerable sir, this bhikkhu recollects the manifold previous births, such as

obtained eleven treasures at one and the same time. I was looking for a single 
door to deathlessness was shown eleven doors to deathlessness. A man has a house 
with eleven doors to escape when the house is on fire. Likewise I can enter the 
deathless state through one of these doors and make myself safe. Ascetics of 
other sects give gifts to their Teachers. Why should not I make offerings to 
venerable Ananda!"</P>
<P>The householder Dasama of Atthakanagara assembled the Community of bhikkhus 
of Vesali and Pataliputta and with his own hands offered eatables and nourishing 
food and satisfied them. He gave each one a set of robes and offered venerable 
Ananda the set of three robes He caused five hundred dwellingsño be made for

words to the presence of venerable Sariputta. It is suitable that venerable 
Sariputta himself explain its meaning, hearing it from venerable Sariputta the 
bhikkhus will hear it in mind. Then friends, listen and attend carefully I will 
tell.</P>
<P>Friends, there is that concentration to the bhikkhu, abiding in which, in 
earth he has no perceptions of earth, in water he has no perceptions of water, 
in fire he has no perceptions of fire, in air he has no perceptions of air, in 
the sphere of space, he has no perceptions of the sphere of space, in the sphere 
of consciousness, he has no perceptions of the sphere of consciousness, in the 
sphere of nothingness, he has no perceptions of the sphere of nothingness, in 
the sphere of neither perceptions nor non-perceptions, he has no perceptions of 
the sphere of neither perceptions nor non-perceptions. In this world, he has no
