<P>006.01. I heard thus. At one time The Blessed One was living among the Gijja 
peaks in Rajagaha. At that time venerable Sona lived in the cool forest in 
Rajagaha. This thought and discursive thought arose to venerable Sona in his 
seclusion. `I am one of the disciples of The Blessed One who abide with aroused 
effort. Yet my mind is not released from desires without a hold. There is wealth 
in my family. I could partake that wealth, do merit . What if I give up the holy 
life and come to the lower life, partake my wealth and do merit.' The Blessed 
One knowing the discursive thought in venerable Sona's mind, as a strong man 
would stretch his bent arm or bend his stretched arm, disappeared from the peaks 
of Gijja and appeared before venerable Sona in the cool forest. The Blessed One 
sat on the prepared seat and venerable Sona worshipped The Blessed One and sat 
on a side. The Blessed One said: Sona, did this discursive thought arise to you 
in your seclusion `I am one of the disciples of The Blessed One who abide with 
aroused effort. Yet my mind is not released from desires without a hold. There 
is wealth in my family. I could partake that wealth, do merit . What if I give 
up the holy life and come to the lower life, partake my wealth and do merit.'? 
Yes, venerable sir. </P>
<P>When you were a householder, were you clever at the violin to arouse music? 
Yes, venerable sir.</P>
<P>Sona, when the strings of the violin were too tight, was it workable and did 
it produce the right music? No, venerable sir.</P>
<P>Sona, when the strings of the violin were too loose, was it workable and did 
it produce the right music? No, venerable sir.</P>
<P>Sona, when the strings of the violin were not too tight, nor too loose, and 
adjusted accordingly, was it workable and did it produce the right music? Yes, 
venerable sir.</P>
<P>Sona, in the same manner too much aroused effort conduces to distraction, too 
little aroused effort conduces to laziness. Therefore Sona intend an evenness in 
arousing effort and an evenness of the mental faculties to penetrate and take up 
the sign. Venerable Sona accepted that advice and The Blessed One having advised 
venerable Sona left the cool forest as a strong man would stretch his bent arm 
or bend his stretched arm and appeared among the peaks of Gijja. </P>
<P>Then venerable Sona intended an evenness in arousing effort and an evenness 
of the mental faculties to penetrate and took up the sign. Then venerable Sona 
withdrawing from the crowd and abiding diligent to dispel before long here and 
now by himself realized and abode, the noble end of the holy life for which sons 
of clansmen rightfully leave the household and become homeless. He knew, birth 
is destroyed, the holy life is lived, what should be done is done, there is 
nothing more to wish. Venerable Sona became one of the arahants. Then it occured 
to venerable Sona:What if I approach The Blessed One and declare my attainment. 
Venerable Sona approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on side and said:</P>
<P>Venerable sir, a worthy one, who has destroyed desires, has lived the holy 
life, done what should be done, put down the weight, come to the highest good, 
has destroyed the bond to be and is released rightfully knowing, is inclined to 
six things: He is inclined to non-sensuality, to seclusion, to non-oppression, 
to destruction of craving, to destruction of holdings and non-delusion. </P>
<P>It might occur to a certain venerable one, that the venerable one is inclined 
to non-sensuality completely founded on faith. Venerable sir, it should not be 
known in that manner. Venerable sir, the bhikkhu has destroyed desires, has 
lived the holy life, has done what should be done, has made it such that the 
self is not seen. Much is done for the destruction of greed and on account of 
freedom from greed, is inclined to non-sensuality Much is done for the 
destruction of hate and on account of freedom from hate, is inclined to 
non-sensuality. Much is done for the destruction of delusion and on account of 
freedom from delusion, is inclined to non-sensuality. </P>
<P>It might occur to a certain venerable one, that the venerable one does not 
desire gain honour and fame inclined to seclusion. Venerable sir, it should not 
be known in that manner. Venerable sir, the bhikkhu has destroyed desires, has

self is not seen. Much is done for the destruction of greed and on account of

hate and on account of freedom from hate, is inclined to seclusion. Much is done 
for the destruction of delusion and on account of freedom from delusion, is 
inclined to seclusion.</P>
<P>It might occur to a certain venerable one, that the venerable one is inclined 
to freedom from oppression hemmed in by the observance of virtues. Venerable 
sir, it should not be known in that manner. Venerable sir, the bhikkhu has 
destroyed desires, has lived the holy life, has done what should be done, has 
made it such that the self is not seen. Much is done for the destruction of 
greed and on account of freedom from greed, is inclined to freedom from 
oppression Much is done for the destruction of hate and on account of freedom 
from hate, is inclined to freedom from oppression. Much is done for the 
destruction of delusion and on account of freedom from delusion, is inclined to

of craving.. . </P>

hate and on account of freedom from hate, is inclined to the destruction of

from delusion, is inclined to the destruction of delusion.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, to the bhikkhu with a mind thus rightfully released, even if a 
lot of forms come to the purview of the eye, they do not take hold of the mind 
and stay. They do not get mixed up and the mind stays unmoved and sees how they 
fade.Even if a lot of sounds come to the sphere of the ear, ...re.... even if a 
lot of smells come to the sphere of the nose,...re.... even if a lot of tastes 
come to the range of the tongue,....re....even if a lot of touches come to the 
range of the body, ...re.... even if a lot of ideas come to the purview of the 
mind, they do not take hold of the mind and stay. They do not get mixed up and 
the mind stays unmoved and sees how they fade </P>
<P>Venerble sir, like a huge storm with rain coming from the east, to a rock not 
broken or fissured of equal thickness everywhere, would not shake or move 
....re.... coming from the west, ...re...from the north,...re..... from the 
south. Likewise venerable sir, to the bhikkhu with a mind thus rightfully 
released, even if a lot of forms come to the purview of the eye, they do not

not get mixed up and the mind stays unmoved and sees how they fade </P>
<P></P>
<P>The secluded mind inclined to non-sensuality and non-oppression, </P>
<P>The not deluded mind inclined to destruction of holding and craving. ...</P>
<P>Seeing the non arising of the mental faculties, is released rightfully. </P>
<P>Such a rightfully released bhikkhu has no duties to do or to be done.</P>
<P>A rock of equal thickness would not move with the wind</P>
<P>Likewise forms, tastes, sounds, scents, touches or anything </P>
<P>Agreeable or disagreeable would not change him</P>
<P>The steady released mind, reflects the fading. </P></FONT><B><FONT

<P>006.02. At that time venerable Pagguna was gravely ill and venerable Ananda 
approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said: </P>
<P>Venerable sir, venerable Pagguna is gravely ill, it's good if The Blessed One 
would approach him out of compassion. The Blessed One accepted in silence. The 
Blessed One getting up from his evening seclusion, approached venerable Pagguna. 
Venerable Pagguna seeing The Blessed One coming in the distance, tried to get 
down from the bed, and The Blessed One said, do not move from the bed, there are 
seats prepared in front, I will sit there. The Blessed One sat on the prepared 
seat and said to venerable Pagguna: Pagguna, how are you, are things agreeable, 
would you survive. Are unpleasant feelings receding or proceeding? Is the 
receding end or the proceed end that is evident? </P>
<P>Venerable sir, things are not agreeable, I would not survive. I feel grave 
unpleasant feelings proceeding not receding. The proceeding end is evident not 
the receding end. Venerable sir, it is like a strong man cleaving my top with 
the edge of a sharp knife. In like manner, venerable sir, my top is crushed with 
a lot of air </P>
<P>Venerable sir, things are not agreeable, I would not survive. I feel grave 
unpleasant feelings proceeding not receding. The proceeding end is evident not 
the receding end. Venerable sir, it is like a strong man giving a tight head 
wrap.In like manner, venerable sir, there is a lot of pain in my head.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, things are not agreeable, I would not survive. I feel grave 
unpleasant feelings proceeding not receding. The proceeding end is evident not 
the receding end. Venerable sir, it is like a butcher were cleaving my stomach 
with a butcher's cleaving knife. In like manner, venerable sir, my stomach is 
crushed with a lot of air. </P>
<P>Venerable sir, things are not agreeable, I would not survive. I feel grave 
unpleasant feelings proceeding not receding. The proceeding end is evident not 
the receding end. Venerable sir, it is like two strong men taking a weaker one 
by his limbs and scorching him in a pit of charcoal. In like manner, venerable 
sir, there is a lot of burning in my body. </P>
<P>Venerable sir, things are not agreeable, I would not survive. I feel grave 
unpleasant feelings proceeding not receding. The proceeding end is evident not 
the receding end. Then The Blessed One advising, inciting and making the heart 
light of venerable Pagguna, got up from his seat and went away, </P>
<P>Soon after The Blessed One was gone, venerable Pagguna passed away. At the 
time of his passing away his faculties became bright. Then venerable Ananda 
approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on side and said. Venerable sir, 
soon after The Blessed One had gone, venerable Pagguna passed away. At the time 
of his passing away his faculties became bright. </P>
<P>Ananda, why shouldn't the bhikkhu Pagguna's faculties not brighten up. The 
bhikkhu Pagguna's mind was not released from the five bonds that bound him to 
the sensual world, hearing the Teaching his mind was released from the bonds 
that bound him to the sensual world. Ananda, there are six benefits for hearing 
the Teaching at the correct time, and investigating the meaning. What six? </P>
<P>Here, Ananda the bhikkhu's mind is not released from the five bonds binding 
him to the sensual world. He gets a chance at the time of death to see the Thus 
Gone One. The Thus Gone One teaches him the Teaching good at the beginning, 
middle and end, full of meanings in words and letters, completly stating the 
holy life. Hearing that Teaching his mind is released from the bonds binding him 
to the sensual world. Ananda, this is the first benefit for hearing the Teaching 
at the correct time. </P>
<P>Again, Ananda the bhikkhu's mind is not released from the five bonds binding 
him to the sensual world. He does not get a chance, at the time of death to see 
the Thus Gone One. Yet he sees a disciple of The Thus Gone One who teaches him 
the Teaching good at the beginning, middle and end, full of meanings in words 
and letters, completly stating the holy life. Hearing that Teaching his mind is 
released from the bonds binding him to the sensual world. Ananda, this is the 
second benefit for hearing the Teaching at the correct time.</P>
<P>Ananda the bhikkhu's mind is not released from the five bonds binding him to 
the sensual world. He does not get a chance at the time of death to see the Thus 
Gone One, or a disciple of the Thus Gone One. Yet he discursively thinks about 
the Teaching, he had heard and learnt and touches the meanings When he touches 
the meanings his mind is released from the bonds binding him to the sensual 
world. Ananda, this is the third benefit for hearing the Teaching and 
investigating the Teaching at the correct time.</P>
<P>Ananda the bhikkhu's mind is released from the five bonds binding him to the 
sensual world. His mind is not released with the noble destruction of 
substratum. He gets a chance at the time of death to see the Thus Gone Oneòhe 
Thus Gone One teaches him the Teaching good at the beginning, middle and end, 
full of meanings in words and letters, completly stating the holy life. Hearing 
that Teaching his mind is released, with the noble destruction of substratum. 
Ananda, this is the fourth benefit for hearing the Teaching at the correct 
time.</P>
<P>Again, Ananda the bhikkhu's mind is released from the five bonds binding him 
to the sensual world. Hlis mind is not released with the noble destruction of 
substrutum. He does not get a chance at the time of death to see the Thus Gone 
One. Yet he gets a chance to see a disciple of the Thus Gone One, who teaches 
him the Teaching good at the beginning, middle and end, full of meanings in

mind is released with the noble destruction of substrutum. Ananda, this is the 
fifth benefit for hearing the Teaching at the correct time.</P>

<P>006.03. At one time The Blessed One was living among the Gijja peaks in 
Rajagaha. Venerable Ananda approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side 
and said: </P>
<P>Venerable sir, Purana Kassapa appoints six species, such as the dark species, 
the blue species, the red species, the turmeric species, the pleasant species 
and the highly pleasant species. Venerable sir, Purana Kassapa's dark species 
are the slaughterers of sheep, pigs, killers of birds, hunters, rough fishermen, 
killers of robbers keepers of prisons and any others doing fierce activities. 
Venerable sir, Purana Kassapa's blue species are the bhikkhus inconsistent in 
observing virtues and others with the view of actions and results. Venerable 
sir, Purana Kassapa's red species are the Niganthas and those wearing a single 
robe. Venerable sir, Purana Kassapa's yellow species are the lay disciples 
wearing white clothes and the disciples who do not wear clothes. Venerable sir, 
Purana Kassapa's pure species are the ascetics male and female who make a living 
in a peculiar way. Venerable sir, Purana Kassapa's highest pure species are 
Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Sankicca, Makkhali Gosala. Venerable sir, these are the six 
species appointed by Purana Kassapa. </P>
<P>Ananda, are the six species appointed by Purana Kassapa accepted by the whole 
world? No, venerable sir. </P>
<P>Ananda, like a poor incapable man against his wish is made to observe saying 
`Good man, you should eat flesh and not earn money for it. In the same manner, 
Purana Kassapa without the acknowledgement of these recluses and Brahmins has 
appointed these six species foolishly, not knowing the manner to do it. Ananda, 
I too appoint the six species. Listen carefully and attend to it Yes venerable 
sir. Ananda, what are the six species? </P>
<P>Here, Ananda, a certain one of dark species produces dark things Here, 
Ananda, a certain one of dark species produces pure things. Here, Ananda, a 
certain one of dark species produces the not dark, not pure extinction. Here, 
Ananda, a certain one of pure species produces dark things. Here, Ananda, a 
certain one of pure species produces pure things. Here, Ananda, a certain one of 
pure species produces the not dark, not pure extinction. </P>
<P>Ananda, how does the dark species, produce dark things? . . </P>
<P>Here, Ananda, a certain one is born in a low family, in the family of, an 
outcaste, or a hunter, or a basket weaver, or a chariot maker, or a rubbish 
collector, not easily provided with eatables and drinks and nourishments. Is not 
attractive, not with pleasant looks, is ugly and out of shape, with many 
ailments, blind, lame, or with disabled limbs. He is not a gainer of eatables, 
drinks, clothes, conveyances, flowers, scents, ointments, beds, dwellings and 
lights. He misbehaves by body, words and mind. Having misbehaved by body, words 
and mind, after death he goes to decrease to hell. Thus Ananda, the dark species 
produces dark things. </P>

reverence, hospitality, gifts and for paying homage with clasped hands, the 
incomparable field of merit for the world. What six?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu has dispelled those desires that have to be 
dispelled by restraining by restraining. Has dispelled those desires that have 
to be dispelled by indulging by indulging. Has dispelled those desires that have

<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu wisely thinking abides restrained in the faculty

<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu wisely thinking partakes robes, for the purpose 
of dispelling cold, heat, the sting of gad flies and yellow flies, to ward off 
the heated air, to ward off the touch of creeping things, as a covering to ward 
off shame. Partakes morsel food wisely thinking, it is not for play, not for 
intoxication, not for decoration nor to look beautiful. For the upkeep of this

Thus I give up the earlier feelings and do not arouse new. It will be for my

words which go a long way. And arisen sharp, rough, unpleasant feelings that 
would end life. To the bhikkhu not enduring these, vexation and trouble might 
come. To one enduring these, vexation and trouble would not be. Bhikkhus, these

a pit, a precipice, the pool at the entrance of the village, a dirty pool, 
sitting in unsuitable seats, wandering unsuitably, associating evil friends, and 
putting wise co-associates in the holy life in difficult situations. He should

gives gifts to forest bhikkhus, who are worthy, or those on the way to 
worthiness, they beg for morsel food and wear rag robes.</P>
<P>Householder, it is not possible for you, who live a household life, bearing 
the troubles of wife and children, partaking Kashmire clothes, bearing flowers, 
scents and ointments and earning gold and silver, to know these are the noble 
ones or these are the ones fallen to that path. Householder, there may be forest 
bhikkhus who are unbalanced, sportive, wavering, talkative with loose talk 
without mindful awareness, not concentrated with a scattered mind, with 
disturbed mental faculties, by which they are to be blamed. Householder, there 
may be forest bhikkhus who are balanced, not sportive, unwavering, not talkative 
without loose talk with mindful awareness, concentrated with the mind in one

<P>Householder, there may be bhikkhus living in the outskirts of the village, 
unbalanced, ...re....by which they are to be blamed. Householder, there may be

<P>006.06. At one time The Blessed One was living in the deer park in Isipatana 
in Benares. At that time, many elder bhikkhus were assembled in the circular 
hall after returning from the alms round and discussing the deeper aspects of 
the Teaching. At that time venerable Citta Hatthisariputta was disturbing the 
conversation of the elder bhikkhus with this and other conversation. Then 
venerable Mahakotthita said to Citta Hatthisariputta: Venerable Citta 
Hatthisariputta you should not disturb the elder bhikkhus discussing the deeper 
aspects of the Teaching, with this and other conversation. You should wait until 
the conversation finishes and then talk. </P>
<P>Then the co-associates of venerable Citta Hatthisaraputta said to venerable 
Mahakotthita:: Veneràble Mahakotthita, do not depreciate venerable Citta 
Hatthisariputta, he is wise, it is possible for him to converse on the deeper 
aspects of the Teaching with the elder bhikkhus. </P>
<P>Friend, it is difficult to be known by those who do not know the range of 
thoughts of others.</P>
<P>Here, friend, a certain person would be gentle, obedient and appeased as long 
as under the protection of the Teacher or under the protection of an eminent 
teacher. Withdrawn from the Teacher or an eminent teacher he mixes up with the 
bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, lay disciples male and female. kings and the ministers of 
kings, with those of other faiths and their disciples. Abiding with that 
association, diffused and engaged in talk, the mind touched with greed and 
corrupted he would give up the holy life and come to low life. Like a bull that 
eats the thriving corn, is bound or put in the cattle fold and someone was to 
say, now the bull will not eat the thriving corn. Is it right when you say, now 
the bull will not come to eat the thriving corn? No, venerable sir. There is a 
possibility for the bull to break the bonds, or break the cattlefold and descend 
to eat the thriving corn. In like manner, a certain person would be gentle, 
obedient and appeased as long as under the protection of the Teacher or under 
the protection of an eminent teacher. Withdrawn from the Teacher or an eminent 
teacher he mixes up with the bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, lay disciples male and 
female. kings and the ministers of kings, with those of other faiths and their 
disciples. Abiding with that association, diffused and engaged in talk, the mind 
touched with greed and corrupted he would give up the holy life and come to low 
life. . </P>
<P>Here, friend, a certain person secluded from sensual desires...re..... 
attains to the first higher state of mind. Thinking I am the gainer of the first 
higher state of mind he mixes up with the bhikkhus,...re....he would give up the 
holy life and come to the low life.</P>
<P>Like huge rain drops falling on the four cross roads, would make the mud to 
disappear and someone saying,. now these cross roads would not be muddy any 
more. Is it correctly said? No, venerable sir. There is a possibility that it 
would be made muddy by people passing by, or when cattle and other four footed 
pass by, or by the blowing of the hot wind or with snot it would be made muddy 
again. In like manner, a certain person secluded from sensual desires...re..... 
attains to the first higher state of mind. Thinking I am the gainer of the first 
higher state of mind he mixes up with the bhikkhus,...re....he would give up the 
holy life and come to the low life.</P>
<P>Here, friend, a certain person overcoming thoughts and discursive 
thoughts...re..... attains to the second higher state of mind. Thinking I am the 
gainer of the second higher state of mind he mixes up with the 
bhikkhus,...re....he would give up the holy life and come to the low life.</P>
<P>Like a huge flat land close to a village or hamlet, in which the heavy rain 
has made the stones and pebbles to disappear and someone saying,õow this flat 
land would not be with stones and pebbles any more. Is it correctly said? No, 
venerable sir. There is a possibility that people should come to drink in this 
flat land and cattle and other four footed should come to drink in it, or by the 
blowing of the hot wind or with snot it would be with stone and pebbles again. 
In like manner, a certain person secluded from sensual desires...re..... attains 
to the second higher state of mind. Thinking I am the gainer of the second 
higher state of mind he mixes up with the bhikkhus,...re....he would give up the 
holy life and come to the low life.</P>
<P>Again, a certain person with equanimity to joy and detachment ...re..... 
attains to the third higher state of mind. Thinking I am the gainer of the third 
higher state of mind he mixes up with the bhikkhus,...re....he would give up the 
holy life and come to the low life.</P>
<P>Like a man partaking exalted food would not desire stale food, and someone 
saying,. now this man will not like any other food Is it correctly said? No, 
venerable sir. There is a possibility that when the nourishment of the exalted 
food is absorbed and when it is no more in his body he would like food again. In 
like manner, a certain person with equanimity to joy and detachment...re..... 
attains to the third higher state of mind. Thinking I am the gainer of the third 
higher state of mind he mixes up with the bhikkhus,...re....he would give up the 
holy life and come to the low life.</P>
<P>Here, friend, a certain person dispelling both pleasantness and unpleasantnes 
...re..... attains to the fourth higher state of mind. Thinking I am the gainer 
of the fourth higher state of mind he mixes up with the bhikkhus,...re....he 
would give up the holy life and come to the low life.</P>
<P>In the declivity of a huge rock there is a pond free of winds and waves and 
someone saying,. now there will be no more waves in the pond. Is it correctly 
said? No, venerable sir. There is a possibility that a huge storm with rain 
should come from the east, from the west, ...re.... from the north,..re.... from 
the south. They will arouse waves in the pond. In like manner, a certain person 
secluded from sensual desires...re..... attains to the fourth higher state of 
mind. Thinking I am the gainer of the fourth higher state of mind he mixes up 
with the bhikkhus,...re....he would give up the holy life and come to the low 
life.</P>
<P>Here, friend, a certain person not attending to any sign, attains to the 
signless concentration of the mind. Thinking I am the gainer of the signless 
concentràtion of the mind, mixes up with the bhikkhus,...re....he would give up 
the holy life and come to the low life. </P>
<P>Like the king or the king's chief minister who has come on the highway with 
the fourfold army, stays in the forest for one night and on account of the 
sounds of elephants, horses, chariots, the foot soldiers, the sound of drums 
small and large and the sound of conches. the sound of the crickets have 
vanished. Now the sound of crickets will not be heard in this forest stretch. Is 
it correctly said? No, venerable sir. There is a possibility that when that king 
or the king's chief minister goes away from that forest stretch the sounds of 
the crickets will appear again. In like manner, a certain person not attending 
to any sign, attains to the signless concentration of the mind. Thinking I am 
the gainer of the signless concentràtion of the mind, mixes up with the 
bhikkhus,...re....he would give up the holy life and come to low life. </P>
<P>After that Citta Hatthisariputta giving up the holy life came to the lower 
life. The co-associates of Citta Hatthisariputta approached venerable 
Mahakottita, and asked Did venerable Mahakottita penetratingly know the mind of 
Citta Hatthisariputta, that although Citta Hatthisariputta is a gainer of these 
abidings and attainments, yet he will give up the holy life and come to lay 
life? Friend, I penetratingly saw the mind of Citta Hatthisariputta, as a gainer 
of these abidings and attainments and knew he would give up the holy life and 
come to lower life. Even the gods informed me about this. Then the co-associates 
of Citta Hatthisariputta approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side 
and said to The Blessed One: Venerable sir, Citta Hatthisariputta is a gainer of 
these abidings and attainnments, yet he gave up the holy life and came to the 
lower life. Bhikkhus, before long Citta will come to the non-sensual sphere.</P>
<P>Then before long Citta Hatthisariputta shaved his head and beard and wearing 
yellow clothes left the household and went forth. Then Citta Hatthisariputta 
withdrawing from the crowd and abiding diligent to dispel, before long, in this 
very life by himsself realizing attained the noble end of the holy life, for 
which sons of clansmen rightfully leave the household and become homeless. He 
knew, birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived, what should be done is done, 
there is nothing more to wish. Venerable Citta Hatthisariputta became one of the 
noble ones. </P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>

<P>006.07. At one time The Blessed One was living in the deer park in Isipatana 
in Benares. At that time many elder bhikkhus after the meal and returning from 
the alms round were seated and conversing in the circular hall about this answer 
given by The Blessed One to Metteyya's question in the Parayana Vagga:</P>
<P>`He who knows both ends and has no secret plans in the middle,</P>
<P>Is a Great Man. He has gone beyond the seamstress.'. </P>
<P>Friends, what is one end, what is the second end, what is the middle and who 
is the seamstress?</P>
<P>When this was said a certain bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus. </P>
<P>Friends, contact is one end, the arising of contact is the second end, the 
cessation of contact is the middle. Craving is the seamstress. Craving weaves 
for him to be reborn here and there. Friends, with this much the bhikkhu 
thoroughly knows what should be thoroughly known and experiencing what should be 
experienced here and now makes an end of unpleasantness. </P>
<P>When this was said a certain bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus.</P>
<P>Friends, the past is one end, the future is the second end, the present is 
the middle. Craving is the seamstress. Craving weaves for him to be reborn here 
and there. Friends, with this much the bhikkhu thoroughly knows what should be 
thoroughly known and experiencing what should be experienced, here and now makes 
an end of unpleasantness. </P>
<P>When this was said a certain bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus.</P>
<P>Friends, pleasant feeling is one end, unpleasant feeling is the second end, 
neither unpleasant nor pleasant feeling is the middle. Craving is the 
seamstress. Craving weaves for him to be reborn here and there. Friends, with 
this much the bhikkhu thoroughly knows what should be thoroughly known and 
experiencing what should be experienced, here and now makes an end of 
unpleasantness. </P>
<P>When this was said a certain bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus.</P>
<P>Friends, name is one end, matter is the second end, consciousness is the 
middle. Craving is the seamstress. Craving weaves for him to be reborn here and 
there. Friends, with this much the bhikkhu thoroughly knows what should be 
thoroughly known and experiencing what should be experienced, here and now makes 
an end of unpleasantness. </P>
<P>When this was said a certain bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus.</P>
<P>Friends, the internal spheres is one end, the external spheres is the second 
end, consciousness is the middle. Craving is the seamstress. Craving weaves for 
him to be reborn here and there. Friends, with this much the bhikkhu thoroughly 
knows what should be thoroughly known and experiencing what should be 
experienced, here and now makes an end of unpleasantness. </P>
<P>When this was said a certain bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus.</P>
<P>Friends, self is one end, the arising of self is the second end, the 
cessation of self is the middle. Craving is the seamstress. Craving weaves for 
him to be reborn here and there. Friends, with this much the bhikkhu thoroughly 
knows what should be thoroughly known and experiencing what should be 
experienced, here and now makes an end of unpleasantness. </P>
<P>When this was said a certain bhikkhu said to the elder bhikkhus.</P>
<P>Friends, we have all declared according to our understanding. Let us now 
approach The Blessed One, and declare all this and according to what The Blessed 
One declares about it let us bear in mind. The elder bhikkhus agreed and they 
approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and informed The Blessed 
One all the conversation that took place. Venerable sir, whose words are the 
good words? Bhikkhus, all your words are good words. Yet listen for what reason 
this was told by me to Metteyya's question in the Parayana Vagga.</P>
<P>`He who knows both ends and has no secret plans in the middle,</P>
<P>Is a Great Man. He has gone beyond the seamstress.'</P>
<P>I will tell attend carefully. Those bhikkhus said. Yes, venerable sir and The

<P>006.08. I heard thus. At one time The Blessed One was touring the country of 
Kosala with a large Community of bhikkhus and entered the hamlet Dandakappa. The 
Blessed One deviating from the path sat on the prepared seat at the root of a 
tree. The bhikkhus too entered Dandakappa to make dwellings. Venerable Ananda 
approached river Acirawathie with many bhikkhus to wash their bodies. Having 
washed their bodies in river Acirawathie and coming out of the river were 
standing in one robe until the body got dried.</P>
<P>Then a certain bhikkhu approached venerable Ananda and said:</P>
<P>Friend, Ananda, did The Blessed One consider everything before he declared 
that Devadatta is decreasing, gone to hell, is in serious trouble until the end 
of the world cycle. Or did he declare it in another way. Friend, it was declared 
in that manner. </P>
<P>Then venerable Ananda approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side 
and said:</P>
<P>Here, venerable sir, I approached river Acirawathie with many bhikkhus to 
wash our bodies. Having washed our bodies in river Acirawathie and coming out of 
the river were standing in one robe until the body got dried.</P>
<P>Then a certain bhikkhu approached me and said:</P>
<P>Friend, Ananda, did The Blessed One consider everything before he declared 
that Devadatta is decreasing, gone to hell, is in serious trouble until the end 
of the world cycle. Or did he declare it in another way. Venerable sir I said, 
it was declared by The Blessed One, in that manner. </P>
<P>Ananda, either this bhikkhu is a novice, or a recent elder not learned and 
foolish. How could he contradict, that which I have definitely stated. Ananda, 
there is no other person whom I have so well considered, as this Devadatta. 
Ananda, I did not see any thing pure in him, as much as the tip of a hair. 
Therefore, I declared that Devadatta is decreasing, gone to hell, is in serious 
trouble until the end of the world cycle. Ananda, there is a pit, filled with 
excreta to the height of a man. A man is sunk in it together with his head. To a 
certain man the desire arises for his welfare, to pull him out of the pit of 
excreta to end his unpleasantness. He goes round the pit of excreta yet does not 
see even the tip of a hair by which to pull him out. In like manner Ananda, I 
did not see anything pure in him, as much as the tip of a hair. Therefore, I 
declared that Devadatta is decreasing, gone to hell, is in serious trouble until 
the end of the world cycle. Ananda, would you listen to the classification of 
the Thus Gone One's mental faculties? O! Blessed One! This is the time, to 
declare the classification of the Thus Gone One's mental faculties. Hearing it 
from The Blessed One, the bhikkhus will bear it in mind. Then Ananda, listen and 
attend carefully. I will tell. The Blessed One said:</P>
<P>Here, Ananda, I penetrate and see the mind of a certain person and know, in 
this person are evident meritorious and demeritorious things. After a certain 
time I penetrate and see his mind and know, his meritorious things have 
disappeared and the demeritorious things have come to the forefront. He has some 
roots of merit, which are not cut up, therefore to him merits become evident 
from merits. In this manner, this person will not decrease in the future. </P>

knowledge of knowing the possibility as possibility and the impossibility as 
impossibility and The Blessed One explains to them as it really is, the 
possibility as possibility and the impossibility as impossibility </P>
<P>There bhikkhus, others approach the Thus Gone One to question him, on his 
knowledge of knowing the situational results of actions according to the past,

present; the higher states of the mind, releases, concentrations, attainments 
with their defiling natures, purities and the risings from them; recollecting 
previous births; knowing the disappearing and appearing of beings; and the 
destruction of desires. All these are to the concentrated not to the distracted.
