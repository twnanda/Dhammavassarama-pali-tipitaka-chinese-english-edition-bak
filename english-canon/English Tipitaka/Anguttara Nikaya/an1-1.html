Thus I have heard -- On one occasion the Blessed One was living in
Savatthi at Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery. At that time he
addressed the monks: "Monks!"
<p>
"Yes, venerable sir."
<p>
"Monks, I do not see any other form that is more overpowering to the mind
of a man than a woman's form. Monks, a woman's form is overpowering to the
mind of a man.
<p>
"Monks, I do not see any other voice that is more overpowering to the
mind of a man than a woman's voice. Monks, a woman's voice is overpowering
to the mind of a man.
<p>
"Monks, I do not see any other smell that is more overpowering to the
mind of a man than a woman's smell. Monks, a woman's smell is overpowering
to the mind of a man.
<p>
"Monks, I do not see any other taste that is more overpowering to the
mind of a man than a woman's taste. Monks, a woman's taste is overpowering
to the mind of a man.
<p>
"Monks, I do not see any other touch that is more overpowering to the
mind of a man than a woman's touch. Monks, a woman's touch is overpowering
to the mind of a man.
<p>
"Monks, I do not see any other form that is more overpowering to the
mind of a woman than a man's form. Monks, a man's form is overpowering to
the mind of a woman.
<p>
"Monks, I do not see any other voice that is more overpowering to the
mind of a woman than a man's voice. Monks, a man's voice is overpowering
to the mind of a woman.
<p>
"Monks, I do not see any other smell that is more overpowering to the
mind of a woman than a man's smell. Monks, a man's smell is overpowering
to the mind of a woman.
<p>
"Monks, I do not see any other taste that is more overpowering to the
mind of a woman than a man's taste. Monks, a man's taste is overpowering
to the mind of a woman.
<p>
"Monks, I do not see any other touch that is more overpowering to the
mind of a woman than a man's touch. Monks, a man's touch is overpowering
to the mind of a woman."
