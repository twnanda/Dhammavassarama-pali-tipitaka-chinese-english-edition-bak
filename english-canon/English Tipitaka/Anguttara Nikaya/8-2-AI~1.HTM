<P>002.01. I heard thus. At one time The Blessed One was living in Vera¤ja under 
a Nimba tree raised on reeds. Then a Brahmin of Vera¤ja approached The Blessed 
One, exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side and said: -</P>
<P>Good Gotama, I have heard this. The recluse Gotama does not worship, attend 
on, offer a seat or invite Brahmins who are aged, decayed and have come to the 
end of their lives. Good Gotama, is it the truth. Doesn't good Gotama worship, 
attend on, offer a seat or invite Brahmins who are aged, decayed and have come 
to the end of their lives. Good Gotama, it is not the right conduct. </P>
<P>ßBrahmin, I do not see in this world together with its gods, Mara, Brahma and 
the Community of recluses and Brahmins, any one, to worship, attend on, offer a 
seat or invite. Brahmin, if the Thus Gone One worships, attends on, offers a 
seat or invites someone his head would split." </P>
<P>ßGood Gotama does not enjoy matter!."</P>
<P>Brahmin, there is a method, according to which, is said the recluse Gotama 
does not enjoy matter. Brahmin, the enjoyments of forms, sounds, smells, tastes 
and touches are dispelled to the Thus Gone One, pulled out from the roots, made 
a palm stump, made a thing that would not rise again. Brahmin, this is the 
method according to which, it is rightfully said the recluse Gotama does not 
enjoy matter. This is not told about you."</P>
<P>ßGood Gotama does not possess wealth!."</P>
<P>ßBrahmin, there is a method, according to which, is said the recluse Gotama 
does not possess wealth. Brahmin, the possessions of forms, sounds, smells, 
tastes and touches are dispelled to the Thus Gone One, pulled out from the 
roots, made a palm stump, made a thing, that would not rise again. Brahmin, this 
is the method according to which, it is rightfully said the recluse Gotama does 
not possess wealth. This is not told about you."</P>
<P>ßGood Gotama teaches non-doing!"</P>
<P>Brahmin, there is a method, according to which, is said the recluse Gotama 
teaches non-doing. Brahmin, I teach non-doing of bodily misbehaviour, verbal 
misbehaviour and mental misbehaviour and the non-doing of various kinds of 
demerit. Brahmin, this is the method according to which, it is rightfully said 
the recluse Gotama teaches non-doing. This is not told about you."</P>
<P>ßGood Gotama teaches annihilation!"</P>
<P>Brahmin, there is a method, according to which, is said the recluse Gotama 
teaches annihilation. Brahmin, I teach the annihilation of greed, hate and 
delusion and the annihilation of various kinds of demerit. Brahmin, this is the 
method according to which, it is rightfully said the recluse Gotama teaches 
annihilation. This is not told about you."</P>
<P>ßGood Gotama teaches loathing!"</P>
<P>Brahmin, there is a method, according to which, is said the recluse Gotama 
teaches loathing. Brahmin, I teach the loathing of bodily misbehaviour, verbal 
misbehaviour and mental misbehaviour and the loathing of various kinds of 
demerit. Brahmin, this is the method according to which, it is rightfully said 
the recluse Gotama teaches loathing. This is not told about you."</P>
<P>ßGood Gotama is a disciplinarian!"</P>
<P>Brahmin, there is a method, according to which, is said the recluse Gotama is 
a disciplinarian. Brahmin, I teach to discipline greed, hate and delusion and to 
disscipline the various kinds of demerit. Brahmin, this is the method according 
to which, it is rightfully said the recluse Gotama is a disciplinarian. This is 
not told about you."</P>
<P>ßGood Gotama exercises self control!"</P>
<P>ßBrahmin, there is a method, according to which, is said the recluse Gotama 
exercises self control. Brahmin, I teach exercising control over of various 
kinds of demerit of bodily misbehaviour, verbal misbehaviour and mental 
misbehaviour. The Thus Gone One.exercising control over various kinds of 
demerit, they are dispelled, pulled out from the roots, made a palm stump, made 
a thing that would not rise again Brahmin, this is the method according to 
which, it is rightfully said, the recluse Gotama exercises self control. </P>
<P>This is not told about you </P>
<P>ßThe recluse Gotama is unobtrusive!"</P>
<P>ßBrahmin, there is a method, according to which, it is rightfully said the 
recluse Gotama is unobtrusive Brahmin, I do not search a womb for the future, 
for rebirth in the future. It is dispelled, pulled out from the roots, made a 
palm stump, made a thing that would not rise again. Therefore I am unobtrusive. 
Brahmin, to the Thus Gone One lying in a womb, and future rebirth are dispelled 
pulled out from the roots, made a palm stump, a thing that would not rise again. 
Brahmin, this is the method according to which, it is rightfully said the 
recluse Gotama is unobtrusive. This is not told about you </P>
<P>Brahmin, the hen sits on the eggs in eight or ten or twelve places so that 
they are well sat on, made ripe and treated and the life in the adled eggs break 
the shell of the egg with the nails of the feet or the beak and breaking the 
shell are reborn healthily. What is it, is it senior or junior? Good Gotama, it 
is senior</P>
<P>Brahmin, in the same manner I who was with the ignorant populace shrouded in 
darkness, have broken the shell of ignorance by myself realized, noble rightful 
enlightenment. Brahmin, I am the senior and the foremost in the world. My effort 
is aroused not shaken, mindfulness is established, unconfused, the body is 
appeased and without anger, the concentrated mind is in one point </P>
<P>Brahmin, then I secluding the mind from sensuality and demeritorious things, 
with thoughts and discursive thoughts and with joy and pleasantness born of 
seclusion abide in the first higher state of the mind. Overcoming thoughts and 
discursive thoughts, the mind internally appeased in one point I abide in the 
second higher state of the mind without thoughts and discursive thoughts. With 
equanimity to joy and disenchantment I experience pleasantness with the body too 
and abide in the third higher state of the mind. To this the noble ones say 
abiding in pleasantness being mindful of equanimity. Dispelling pleasantness and 
unpleasantness, earlier having dispelled pleasure and displeasure I abide in the 
fourth higher state of the mind purifying the mind with equanimity so that it is 
without unpleasantness and pleasantness. </P>
<P>When the mind is thus concentrated, purified, without blemish, workable and 
imperturbable I direct the mind to recollect the manifold previous births. Such 
as one birth, two three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a 
hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, innumerable 
forward world cycles, innumerable backward world cycles and innumerable forward 
and backward world cycles of births. There I was with such name, clan, 
disposition, supports, experiencing such pleasant and unpleasant feelings and 
with such a life span. Disappearing from there I was born here. Thus I 
recollected with all details the manifold previous births. </P>
<P>Brahmin, this is my first arising of knowledge in the first watch of the 
night, darkness vanished and light arose, when abiding diligent with aroused 
effort to dispel. As it happened to the arisen life in the egg shell </P>
<P>When the mind is thus concentrated, purified, without blemish, workable and 
imperturbable I direct the mind to know the disappearing and appearing of 
beings. With the heavenly eye purified beyond human I see beings disappearing 
and appearing in unexalted and exalted states, beautiful and ugly, in good and 
evil states, I know beings according their actions -"These good beings endowed 
with bodily, verbal and mental misconduct blaming noble ones and bearing wrong 
view after death are born in loss, in a bad state in decrease is born in hell. 
These good beings endowed with bodily, verbal and mental good conduct not 
blaming noble ones bearing right view. After death are born in gain, in a good 
state in increase is born in heaven, I know beings according to their actions. 
</P>
<P>Brahmin, this is my second arising of knowledge in the second watch of the 
night, darkness vanished and light arose, when abiding diligent with aroused 
effort to dispel. As it happened to the arisen life in the egg shell </P>
<P>When the mind is thus concentrated, purified, without blemish, workable and 
imperturbable I direct the mind for the destruction of desires. I know as it 
really is, this is unpleasant, this is the arising of unpleasantness, this is 
the cessation of unpleasantness and this is the path to the cessation of 
unpleasantness: I know as it really is, these are desires, this is the arising 
of desires, this the cessation of desires and this is the path to the cessation 
of desires, as it really is. When I knew and saw thus my mind was released from 
sensual desires, from desires to be, and from desires of ignorance. When 
released knowledge arose my mind is released. `Birth is destroyed, the holy life 
is lived, what should be done is done, I knew, there is nothing more to wish. 
</P>
<P>Brahmin, this is my third arising of knowledge in the last watch of the 
night, darkness vanished and light arose, when abiding diligent with aroused 
effort to dispel. As it happened to the arisen life in the egg shell </P>
<P>When this was said the Brahmin of Vera¤ja said thus to The Blessed One: ßGood 
Gotama is the foremost! Good Gotama is the most superior! I understand good 
Gotama. It is like something overturned is reinstated. Something covered is made 
manifest. As though the path is shown to someone who had lost his way. Thus in 
many ways the Teaching is declared. Now I take refuge in good Gotama, in the 
Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. I am a lay disciple from today until 
life lasts. </P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>

<P>002.02. At one time The Blessed One was living in the gabled hall in the 
Great Forest in Vesali. At that time many well known Licchavis assembled and 
seated in the assembly hall were talking in praise of The Blessed One, the 
Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus.</P>
<P>The general Siha was also seated in that gathering and it occurred to Siha 
ßWithout doubts The Blessed One should be worthy and rightfully enlightened that 
these well known Licchavis assembled and seated talk the praise of The Blessed 
One, the Teaching and the Community in various ways." Then the general Siha 
approached Nigantha Nataputta and said to him:"Venerable sir, I desire to 
approach the recluse Gotama."</P>
<P>ßSiha, you a man of action, why do you want to see the recluse Gotama of 
non-action? Siha, the recluse Gotama, teaches non-action and disciplines, 
disciples for non-action. Then general Siha's intentions of going to see The 
Blessed One subsided </P>
<P>For the second time many well known Licchavis assembled and seated in the 
assembly hall were talking in praise of The Blessed One, the Teaching and the 
Community of bhikkhus.</P>
<P>The general Siha was also seated in that gathering and it occurred to Siha

ßWithout doubts The Blessed One should be worthy and rightfully enlightened that 
these well known Licchavis assembled and seated talk the praise of The Blessed

general Siha: ßWhat is the use of the consent of these Niganthas? I will 
approach to see The Blessed One worthy and rightfully enlightened.". </P>
<P>Then the general Siha with about five hundred carriages went to Vesali during 
the daytime to see The Blessed One. Approaching as far as the carriages could 
go, descended from the carriages and went on foot. The general Siha approached 
The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said to The Blessed One: </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, I have heard this said:'The recluse Gotama teaches non-action 
and disciplines his disciples for non action. Venerable sir, those who said `the 
recluse Gotama teaches non-action and disciplines disciples for non-action' How 
far are they saying the words of The Blessed One and not accusing The Blessed 
One falsely. Are they saying it according to the Teaching and not falsely 
accusing The Blessed One? We do not like to accuse The Blessed One for what he 
has not said"</P>

<P>Siha, rightly saying there is a method of mine according to it -the recluse 
Gotama is not destined to another birth and disciplines his disciples not to be 
destined for another birth.</P>
<P>Siha, rightly saying there is a method of mine according to it -the recluse 
Gotama gives comfort disciplines his disciples to gain comfort</P>
<P>Siha, what is that method of mine, which rightfully says the recluse Gotama 
teaches non-action and disciplines disciples for non-action? Siha, I tell 
non-doing of bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct and mental misconduct and 
various demeritorious things. </P>

<P>Siha, what is that method of mine, which rightfully says the recluse Gotama 
teaches self control and disciplines disciples for self control? Siha, I tell 
the self control of demeritorious things of bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct 
and mental misconduct. Siha, whosever demeritorious things are dispelled by self 
control, pulled out from the root, made a palm stump, made a thing that would 
not grow again. I tell he is self controlled. </P>

</P>
<P>Siha, this is the method of mine, which rightfully says the recluse Gotama 
teaches comfort and disciplines disciples for comfort". </P>
<P>When this was said the general Siha said to The Blessed One: -"Venerable sir, 
I understand!....re... venerable sir, bear me as a lay disciple who has taken 
refuge from today until life lasts". </P>
<P>ßSiha, make a thorough investigation. It's suitable for well known people 
like you" </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, on account of this too I am very much satisfied with The 
Blessed One, that The Blessed One says to me `Siha, make a thorough 
investigation. It's suitable for well known people like you'" </P>
<P>`Venerable sir if my discipleship was gained by those of other faiths, they 
would have taken me throughout Vesali under their banner saying `The general 
Siha has come to our faith. Here The Blessed One says Siha, make a thorough 
investigation. It's suitable for well known people like you.' Now I take refuge 
in The Blessed One, the teaching and the Community of bhikkhus for the second 
time. I am a disciple who has taken refuge from today until life lasts". </P>
<P>ßSiha, for a long time your clan has been a welling spring to the Niganthas'. 
You should think to offer them morsel food at their arrival." </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, on account of this too I am very much satisfied with The 
Blessed One, that The Blessed One says to me `Siha, for a long time your clan 
has been a welling spring to the Niganthas'. You should think to offer them 
morsel food at their arrival.'" </P>
<P>`Venerable sir I have heard it said-' The recluse Gotama said it- Offerings 
should be made to me. Offerings should be made to my disciples only. The highest 
benefits are for offerings given to me and my disciples..Here The Blessed One 
makes arrangements for offerings to be made to the Niganthas' Here, venerable 
sir, we should know the right time to offer. Now I take refuge in The Blessed 
One, the teaching and the Community of bhikkhus for the third time. I am a 
disciple who has taken refuge from today until life lasts." </P>
<P>Then The Blessed One gave a graduated sermon to the general Siha such as 
talking on giving gifts, virtues, heavenly bliss, the dangers of sensuality, the 
defiling nature of folly and vanity and the benefits of giving up. When The 
Blessed One knew that the mind of the general Siha was ready, tender, free from 
obstructions, exalted and pleased, he gave the special message of the 
enlightened ones such as unpleasantness, the arisisng of unpleasantness, the 
cessation of unpleasantness and the path leading to the cessation of 
unpleasantness. </P>
<P>Just as a pure cloth free of any impurity would take the dye evenly, in the 
same manner the pure stainless eye of the Teaching appeared to the general Siha 
seated there itself- ßWhatever arisen thing has the nature of ceasing". . </P>
<P>Then the general Siha then and there mastered the Teaching, knew the 
teaching, penetrated it, dispelled doubts and becoming confident did not want a 
another teacher in the dispensation and said to The Blessed One- ßVenerable sir, 
accept tomorrow's meal from me together with the Community bhikkhus." The 
Blessed One accepted in silence.</P>
<P>The general Siha knowing that The Blessed One had accepted the invitation, 
worshipped, circumambulated The Blessed One and went away. The general Siha then 
addressed a certain man and said:Go and find what meat there is in the market! 
The general Siha at the end of that night prepared various kinds of nourishing 
eatables and drinks in his home and informed The Blessed One: - ßVenerable sir, 
the food is ready, it is the right time."</P>
<P>Then The Blessed One putting on robes in the morning, and taking bowl and 
robes approached the house of the general Siha together with the Community of 
bhikkhus and sat on the prepared seats. At that time many Niganthas were walking 
from street to street and from junction to junction with raised hands saying 
ßToday the general Siha has killed fat cattle and has prepared food for the 
recluse gotama. The recluse Gotama knowing the meat is prepared on account of 
him partakes it." </P>
<P>Then a certain man approached the general Siha and whispered in his ear: 
ßSir, know that many Niganthas are walking from street to street and from 
junction to junction with raised hands saying ßToday the general Siha has killed 
fat cattle and has prepared food for the recluse gotama. The recluse Gotama 
knowing the meat is prepared on account of him partakes it. Sir, from a long 
time these venerable ones depreciate The Blessed One, the Teaching and the 
Community of bhikkhus. Accusing The Blessed One with unreal false statements, 
these venerable ones cannot destroy the fame of The Blessed One in this manner. 
We would not destroy the life of any living thing knowingly!." </P>
<P>The general Siha offered nourishing eatables and drinks to the Community of 
bhikkhus headed by The Blessed One with his own hands and satisfied them. 
Knowing The Blessed One had finished taking the meal the general Siha sat on a 
side. The Blessed One advised him incited him and made his heart light giving a 
talk and getting up went away.</P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>

<P>002.04. I will tell the eight inferior horses and the eight defects of 
horses. The eight inferior men and the eight defects of men. Listen and attend 
to it carefully Those bhikkhus agreed and The Blessed One said: </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, who are the eight inferior horses and what are the eight defects of 
a horse? </P>
<P>A certain inferior horse when said `Go!' As though struck by the charioteer 
draws the chariot backwards. There is such an inferior horse. This is the first 
defect of horses. . </P>
<P>Again a certain inferior horse when said `Go!' As though struck by the 
charioteer pulls the chariot backwards, lightly and swiftly destroying the pole 
of the carriage and breaking the threepod pole. There is such an inferior horse. 
This is the second defect of horses. </P>
<P>Again, a certain inferior horse when said `Go!' As though struck by the 
charioteer raising the carriage pole with his thighs crushes down with the 
carriage pole. There is such an inferior horse. This is the third defect of 
horses. . . </P>
<P>Again a certain inferior horse when said `Go!' As though struck by the 
charioteer, goes in the wrong direction and turns the carriage in the wrong 
direction. There is such an inferior horse. This is the fourth defect of horses. 
. </P>
<P>Again, a certain inferior horse when said `Go!' As though struck by the 
charioteer swiftly moves the forepart of the body and stretches forth the 
forefeet. There is such an inferior horse. This is the fifth defect of horses. 
</P>
<P>Again, a certain inferior horse when said `Go!' As though struck by the 
charioteer, not heeding the charioteer or the goad stick, throwing out the bit 
of the briddle goes where it likesòhere is such an inferior horse. This is the 
sixth defect of horses.</P>
<P>Again, a certain inferior horse when said `Go!' As though struck by the 
charioteer would not proceed or turn back would stand there itself like a post. 
There is such an inferior horse. This is the seventh defect of horses. </P>
<P>Again, a certain inferior horse when said `Go!' As though struck by the 
charioteer firmly planting his forefeet and hind feet stands on all fours there 
itself. There is such an inferior horse. This is the eighth defect of 
horses.Bhikkhus, these are the eight inferior horses and the eight defects of 
horses. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, who are the eight inferior men and the eight defects of men?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhus accuse a bhikkhu of an ecclesiastical offence, 
that bhikkhu saying I do not recall disowns it Like the inferior horse when said 
`Go!' As though struck by the charioteer draws the chariot backwards. Bhikkhus, 
this inferior man is like him. There is an inferior man comparable to him.. This 
is the first defect of men.. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhus accuse a bhikkhu of an ecclesiastical offence, 
that bhikkhu retorts -'What is the use of your words. You are foolish and not 
learned. We should think to speak to you! Like the inferior horse when said 
`Go!' As though struck by the charioteer moves back swiftly and lightly 
destroying the carriage pole and tripod pole. Bhikkhus, this inferior man is 
like him. There is an inferior man comparable to him.. This is the second defect 
of men.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhus accuse a bhikkhu of an ecclesiastical offence, 
the offending bhikkhu accuses him in return. You have fallen to this 
eccelesiastcal offence. You should make amends first Like the inferior horse 
when said `Go!' As though struck by the charioteer raising the carriage pole

is like him. There is an inferior man comparable to him.. This is the third 
defect of men.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhus accuse a bhikkhu of an ecclesiastical offence, 
the offending bhikkhu evades the question and turns the conversation in some 
other direction and shows anger and aversion. Like the inferior horse when said 
`Go!' As though struck by the charioteer goes in the wrong direction and turns 
the carriage in the wrong direction. Bhikkhus, this inferior man is like him. 
There is an inferior man comparable to him.. This is the fourth defect of 
men.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhus accuse a bhikkhu of an ecclesiastical offence, 
the offending bhikkhu makes confused movements of his limbs in the midst of the 
Community.Like the inferior horse when said `Go!' As though struck by the 
charioteer swiftly moves the forepart of the body and stretches forth the 
forefeet. Bhikkhus, this inferior man is like him. There is an inferior man 
comparable to him.. This is the fifth defect of men.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhus accuse a bhikkhu of an ecclesiastical offence, 
the offending bhikkhu not heeding the Community of bhikkhus and not heeding the 
accusing bhikkhu goes away as he likes with his bowl. Like the inferior horse 
when said `Go!' As though struck by the charioteer not heeding the charioteer or 
the goad stick, throwing out the bit of the briddle goes where it 
likes.Bhikkhus, this inferior man is like him. There is an inferior man 
comparable to him.. This is the sixth defect of men.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhus accuse a bhikkhu of an ecclesiastical offence, 
the offending bhikkhu neither saying I have fallen for the offence nor saying I 
have not fallen for the offence, becoming silent troubles the Community of 
bhikkhus Like the inferior horse when said `Go!' As though struck by the 
charioteer does not proceed or receed but stands there as a post. Bhikkhus, this 
inferior man is like him. There is an inferior man comparable to him.. This is 
the seventh defect of men.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhus accuse a bhikkhu for an ecclesiastical offence, 
the offending bhikkhu says-'You venerable one is very much younger than me. You 
are adorned. I will return to lay life.' He gives up robes, returns to lay life 
and says- Venerable ones now be happy. Like the inferior horse when said `Go!' 
As though struck by the charioteer firmly planting his forefeet and hind feet 
stands on all fours there itself. Bhikkhus, this inferior man is like him. There 
is an inferior man comparable to him.. This is the seventh defect of men.</P>

incline, leading, slope and it not falling abruptly the Titans delight in the

<P>Again, venerable sir, the great ocean does not live with the dead, with 
corpses. On account of the ocean not living with the dead and corpses the Titans 
delight in the ocean. This is the third wonderful and surprising thing in the 
ocean, seeing which the Titans delight in it.</P>
<P>Again, venerable sir, the great rivers- such as the Ganges, Yamuna, 
Aciravathie, Sarabhu and Mahi having come to the great ocean dispel their name 
and clan. On account of the great rivers Ganges, Yamuna, Aciravathie, sarabhu 
and Mahi coming to the great ocean and dispelling their names and clans the 
Titans delight in the ocean. This is the fourth wonderful and surprising thing 
in the ocean seeing which the Titans delight in it.</P>
<P>Again, venerable sir, whatever rivers in the world and all the rain that 
falls from the sky rushing to the great ocean does not make the ocean less or 
more. On account of all the rivers in the world and the rain that falls from the 
sky rushing to the great ocean, not making the ocean less or more the Titans

hundred yojanas, three hundred yojanas, four hundred yojanas and five hundred

of gradual instructions, gradual performance and a gradual means of attaining 
the goal. It is not a sudden realization of knowledge. This is the first 
wonderful and surprising thing in this dispensation of the Teaching seeing which

appointed instructions even for the cause of life. My disciples not exceeding 
the limit of the appointed instructions even for the cause of life, is the 
second wonderful and surprising thing in this dispensation of the Teaching 
seeing which the bhikkhus delight in it. </P>
<P>Paharada, just as the great ocean does not live with the dead, with corpses. 
It quickly throws it on shore. In the same manner whoever person is unvirtuous, 
with evil misbehaviour like excreta and dirt, with undercover actions, with only 
a promise for recluseship, not living the holy life, internally putrid and filth 
oozing. The Community does not live with them, all get together to throw him 
out. Wherever he is seated with the Community, he is far away from them. The 
Community too is far removed from himòhis is the third wonderful and surprising 
thing in this dispensation, seeing which the bhikkhus delight in it.</P>
<P>Paharada, just as, the great rivers- such as the Ganges, Yamuna, Aciravathie, 
Sarabhu and Mahi having coming to the great ocean dispel their names and clans. 
Coming to the great ocean they give up their earlier names and is known as the 
`great ocean' In the same manner whoever leaves home, becomes homeless coming to 
the dispensation of the Thus Gone One from these four clans of warriors, 
Brahmins, householders or outcastes, they dispel their earlier names and clans 
and become `recluses the sons of the Sakya' This is the fourth wonderful and 
surprising thing in this dispensation, seeing which the bhikkhus delight in 
it.</P>
<P>Paharada, just as, whatever rivers in the world and all the rain that falls 
from the sky rushing to the great ocean, does not make the ocean less or more. 
In the same manner many bhikkhus entering the element of extinction, does not 
show decrease or increase. This is the fifth wonderful and surprising thing in 
this dispensation seeing which the bhikkhus delight in it.</P>
<P>Paharada, just as the great ocean has one taste, the taste of salt In the 
same manner this dispensation of the Teaching has one taste, the taste of

as the four establishments of mindfulness, the four endeavours, the four psychic 
attainments, the five mental faculties, the five powers, the seven enlightenment 
factors and the Noble Eightfold Path. This is the seventh wonderful and 
surprising thing in this dispensation seeing which the bhikkhus delight in

<P>002.10. At one time The Blessed One was living in the Pubba monastery, in the 
palace of Migara's mother. The Blessed One was seated surrounded by the 
Community of bhikkhus on that full moon day. Then venerable Ananda when the 
first watch of the night was over got up from his seat, arranged the robe on one 
shoulder and clasping hands towards The Blessed One said: ßVenerable sir, the 
night has gone out, the first watch of the night is over. The Community of 
bhikkhus have sat long. May The Blessed One recite the Full moon day recital for 
confession." </P>
<P>When this was said the Blessed became silent. For the second time, venerable 
Ananda when the second watch of the night was over got up from his seat, 
arranged the robe on one shoulder and clasping hands towards The Blessed One 
said: ßVenerable sir, the night has gone out, the second watch of the night is 
over. The Community of bhikkhus have sat long. May The Blessed One recite the 
Full moon day recital for confession." For the third time, venerable Ananda when 
the third watch of the night was over got up from his seat, arranged the robe on 
one shoulder and clasping hands towards The Blessed One said: ßVenerable sir, 
the night has gone out, the third watch of the night is over. The day has dawned 
with a happy face. The Community of bhikkhus have sat long. May The Blessed One 
recite the Full moon day recital for confession." </P>
<P>ßAnanda, the gathering is impure."</P>
<P>Then it occured to venerable Mahamoggallana: `On account of which person did 
The Blessed One say, Ananda, the gathering is impure.?" Then venerable 
Mahamoggallana penetrating with his mind cognized the complete Community of 
bhikkhus and saw that unvirtuous person with evil things and misbehaviour like 
excreta and dirt, with undercover actions, with only the promise of a recluse, 
with only a promise to lead a holy life, internally rotten and filth oozing, 
seated in the midst of the Community of bhikkhus. Venerable Mahamoggallana got 
up from his seat and approached that person and told him: ßVenerable one, get 
up! You are seen by The Blessed One. You cannot live with the Community." </P>
<P>When this was said, that person kept silent. For the second time venerable 
Mahamoggallana told him: ßVenerable one, get up! You are seen by The Blessed 
One. You cannot live with the Community." </P>
<P>For the second time, that person kept silent. For the third time venerable 
Mahamoggallana told him: ßVenerable one, get up! You are seen by The Blessed 
One. You cannot live with the Community." For the third time, that person kept 
silent. </P>
<P>Then venerable Mahamoggallana taking him by the arm led him out of the hall 
and closed the door. Then venerable Mahamoggallana approached The Blessed One 
and said: ßVenerable sir, that person is sent away. The gathering is now pure 
May The Blessed One recite the Full moon day recital for confession." </P>
<P>ßMoggallana, it is wonderful and surprising. Until he was led out held by the 
arm the foolish man was here." </P>
<P>Then The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: ßBhikkhus, from today you recite 
the Full moon day recital for confession. From today I will not recite the Full 
moon day recital for confession. It is not possible for the Thus Gone One to 
recite the Full moon day recital to an impure gathering." </P>
