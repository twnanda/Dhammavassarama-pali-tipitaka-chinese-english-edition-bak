<P>005.04. At that time the Brahmin with a lofty body was going to offer a great 
sacrifice. So five hundred bulls, five hundred young bulls, five hundred young 
cows, five hundred goats, five hundred sheep, were brought to the sacrificial 
post to be sacrificed. Then the Brahmin with the lofty body approached The 
Blessed One exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side and said to The Blessed 
One: </P>
<P>Good Gotama, I have heard that setting fire and raising the sacrificial post 
is of much benefit and with good results. </P>
<P>Brahmin, I too have heard that, setting fire and raising the sacrificial post 
is of much benefit and with good results. </P>
<P>For the second time the Brahmin with the lofty body said, .re. for the third 
time the Brahmin with the lofty body said. Good Gotama, I have heard that 
setting fire and raising the sacrificial post is of much benefit and with good 
results. </P>
<P>Brahmin, I too have heard that, setting fire and raising the sacrificial post 
is of much benefit and with good results. Then good Gotama, our ideas agree, 
yours and mine.</P>
<P>When this was said venerable Ananda said to the Brahmin with a lofty body-" 
Brahmin, that is not how you should question the Thus Gone One. You should do it 
thus.</P>
<P>Good Gotama, I have heard that setting fire and raising the sacrificial post 
is of much benefit and with good results. I too have a desire to set fire and 
raise the sacrificial post. Venerable sir, advise me on this, so that it would 
be for my welfare and pleasantness for a long time.</P>
<P>Then the Brahmin with a lofty body said to The Blessed One Good Gotama, I 
have heard that setting fire and raising the sacrificial post is of much benefit 
and good results. I too have a desire to set fire and raise the sacrificial 
post. Venerable sir, advise me on this, so that it would be for my welfare and 
pleasantness for a long time.</P>
<P>Brahmin, the one who lights the fire and raises the sacrificial post, even 
before the sacrifice, raises three weapons, three demerits, three yielders of 
unpleasantness with unpleasant results. What three? </P>
<P>The bodily weapon, the verbal weapon and the mental weapon. </P>
<P>Brahmin, the one who lights the fire and raises the sacrificial post, even 
before the sacrifice, arouses the mind -Kill this amount of bulls for the 
sacrifice! Kill this amount of young bulls for the sacrifice! Kill this amount 
of cows for the sacrifice! Kill this amount of goats for the sacrifice! Kill 
this amount of sheep for the sacrifice! Thinking I do good, he does evil. . </P>
<P>Thinking I do merit, he does demerit. Thinking I search the path to heaven, 
he searches the path to hell. Brahmin, the one who lights the fire and raises 
the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, raises three weapons, three 
demerits, three yielders of unpleasantness with unpleasant results. .</P>
<P>Again, Brahmin, the one who lights the fire and raises the sacrificial post, 
even before the sacrifice, says such words -Kill this amount of bulls for the 
sacrifice! Kill this amount of young bulls for the sacrifice! Kill this amount 
of cows for the sacrifice! Kill this amount of goats for the sacrifice! Kill 
this amount of sheep for the sacrifice! Thinking I do good, he does evil. 
Thinking I do merit, he does demerit. Thinking I search the path to heaven, he 
searches the path to hell. Brahmin, the one who lights the fire and raises the 
sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, raises three weapons, three 
demerits, three yielders of unpleasantness with unpleasant results.</P>
<P>Again, Brahmin, the one who lights the fire and raises the sacrificial post, 
even before the sacrifice himself makes endeavour -Kill the bulls for the 
sacrifice! Kill the young bulls for the sacrifice! Kill the cows for the 
sacrifice! Kill the goats for the sacrifice! Kill the sheep for the sacrifice! 
Thinking I do good, he does evil. Thinking I do merit, he does demerit. Thinking 
I search the path to heaven, he searches the path to hell. Brahmin, the one who 
lights the fire and raises the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, 
raises three weapons, three demerits, three yielders of unpleasantness with 
unpleasant results.</P>
<P>Brahmin, these three fires should be dispelled, avoided, should not be 
followed after. What three? The fire of lust, the fire of hatred and the fire of 
delusion. </P>
<P>Brahmin, why should the fire of lust be dispelled, avoided and should not be 
followed after? Brahmin, with lust, overcome by lust one misbehaves by body, 
speech and mind. Having misbehaved by body, speech and mind, after death a 
certain one goes to decrease, to loss, to hell. Therefore the fire of lust 
should be dispelled, avoided and should not be followed after. </P>
<P>Brahmin, why should the fire of hatred be dispelled, avoided and should not 
be followed after? Brahmin, with hatred, overcome by hatred one misbehaves by 
body, speech and mind. Having misbehaved by body, speech and mind, after death a 
certain one goes to decrease, to loss, to hell. Therefore the fire of hatred 
should be dispelled, avoided and should not be followed after. </P>
<P>Brahmin, why should the fire of delusion be dispelled, avoided and should not 
be followed after? Brahmin, deluded and overcome by delusion one misbehaves by 
body, speech and mind. Having misbehaved by body, speech and mind, after death a 
certain one goes to decrease, to loss, to hell. Therefore the fire of delusion 
should be dispelled, avoided and should not be followed after. </P>
<P>Brahmin, these three fires should be revered, esteemed, honoured and fostered 
with rightful pleasantness. What three? </P>
<P>The fire worthy of offerings, the household fire and the fire worthy of 
gifts.</P>
<P>Brahmin, what is the fire worthy of offerings? </P>
<P>Brahmin, mother or father is the fire worthy of offerings. What is the 
reason? Brahmin, I am adored and produced from them. Therefore mother and father 
are the fire worthy of offeringsòhey should be revered, esteemed, honoured and 
fostered with rightful pleasantness. </P>
<P>Brahmin, what is the fire of the household? </P>
<P>Brahmin, sons, wife, slaves, messengers and workmen are the household fire. 
Therefore the household fire should be revered, esteemed, honoured and fostered 
with rightful pleasantness. </P>
<P>Brahmin, what is the fire worthy of gifts? </P>
<P>Here, Brahmin, of those recluses and Brahmins who have given up false 
teachers, some train to be patient and gentle, a certain one tames himself, a 
certain one appeases himself, a certain one extinguishes. Brahmin, this is the 
fire worthy of gifts. The fire worthy of gifts should be revered, esteemed, 
honoured and fostered with rightful pleasantness. </P>
<P>Brahmin, as for the fire of firewood, from time to time it should be lighted, 
attended to, put out and put aside. </P>
<P>When this was said the Brahmin with the lofty body said thus: I understand 
good Gotama. Remember me as a lay disciple who has taken refuge from today until 
life lasts. Now I will release the five hundred bulls, the five hundred young 
bulls, the five hundred cows, the five hundred goats and the five hundred sheep 
I will bestow their lives, may they eat green grass, may they drink cool water, 
may they feel the cool air blowing.</P>

<P>005.07. The Brahmin Jànussoni approached The Blessed One, exchanged friendly 
greetings, sat on a side and said: </P>
<P>Good Gotama, do you acknowledge leading a holy life? </P>
<P>Brahmin, saying it correctly, The holy life should be lead pure and complete 
without a break, defects, spots and consistently. I live the holy life pure and 
complete, without a break, without defects, spots and consistently. - Good 
Gotama, what are the breaks, defects, spots and inconsistencies in the holy 
life?</P>
<P>Here, Brahmin, a certain recluse or Brahmin promising to live the holy life 
rightfully, does not enter into a secret association with a woman but enjoys 
rubbing, massaging, shampooing and other negligences. He enjoys them, strives 
for them and prospers with them. Brahmin, these are interruptions, defects, 
spots and inconsistencies of the holy life. Brahmin, to this I say, leading an 
impure holy life enjoying sexuality not released from birth, decay, death, 
grief, wailing, unpleasantness displeasure and distress. </P>
<P>Again, Brahmin, a certain recluse or Brahmin promising to live the holy life

not see a householder or the son of a householder endowed and attended with the 
five strands of sense pleasures. Yet leads the holy life aspiring birth in a 
certain clan of gods. With my virtues, observances, austerities, and leading of 
the holy life I should be a god, or a certain god. He enjoys, strives and 
prospers in it. Brahmin, these are interruptions, defects, spots and 
inconsistencies of the holy life. Brahmin, to this I say, leading an impure holy 
life enjoying sexuality not released from birth, decay, death, grief, wailing, 
unpleasantness displeasure and distress. </P>
<P>Brahmin, as long as these seven ways of enjoying sexuality were not dispelled 
in me I did not declare my rightful attainment of noble enlightenment to the 
world, together with gods and men, Mara, Brahma recluses and Brahmins and the 
Community of recluses and Brahmins. Knowledge and vision arose to me, unshakable 
is my release, this sis my last birth, now there is no more rebirth. </P>

listen and attend carefully. Bhikkhus, what is the method of association and 
dissociation? </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the woman with her internal femininity attends to her womanly 
charm, deportment, ways, interests, sounds and decorations. Arousing lust for 
it, she attends to an external masculinity with manly charm, deportment, ways, 
interests, sounds and decorations Arousing lust for it she desires an external 
association. She desires some pleasantness and pleasure on account of that 
association. Bhikkhus, women attached to femininity and united to men do not go 
beyond femininity. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the man with his internal masculinity attends to his manly charm,

womanly charm, deportment, ways, interests, sounds and decorations. Not arousing 
lust for it, she does not attend to an external masculinity with manly charm, 
deportment, ways, interests, sounds and decorations Not arousing lust for it she 
does not desire an external association some pleasantness and pleasure on 
account of that association. Bhikkhus, women not attached to femininity and not 
united to men go beyond femininity. </P>

pond in Campa. Then many disciples of Campa approached venerable Sariputta, 
worshipped, sat on a side and said: Venerable sir, it is long since that we 
heard the Teaching from The Blessed One </P>

<P align=center>10. Nandamàtàsuttaü- The female lay disciple 
Nanda.</P></B></FONT><FONT face=Times_CSX+>
<P>005.10. I heard thus. At one time venerable Sariputta and venerable 
Mahamoggallana were touring the southern hilly region with a large Community of 
bhikkhus. At that time the female lay disciple Velukantaki Nanda having got up 
in the last watch of the night was reciting loudly the Parayana Vagga</P>
<P>At that time Vessavana the great king of gods heard the female lay disciple 
Nanda reciting the Parayana Vagga loudly and waited till it finished. </P>
<P>The female lay disciple Nanda finished reciting the Parayana Vagga and became 
silent. Knowing that the female lay disciple Nanda had finished reciting, 
applauded her saying ßGood sister!" Then she asked. ßWho is this good one?" </P>
<P>ßSister I am Vessavana the great king of gods"</P>
<P>ßGood one, you have thievishly listened to my recitation"</P>
<P>ßGood! Sister, then this will be another theft. Tomorrow the Community of 
bhikkhus headed by Sariputta and Moggallana without taking the morning meal are 
coming to Velukandaka, offering food to that Community of bhikkhus, make it my 
offering. May that also be a theft of mine." </P>
<P>The female lay disciple Nanda at the end of that night prepared nourishing 
eatables and drinks in her home.</P>
<P>Then the Community of bhikkhus headed by Sariputta and Moggallana without 
having the morning meal entered Velukandaka. The female lay disciple Nanda 
addressed a certain man and said: Good one, go to the monastery and tell the 
Community of bhikkhus that the meal is ready at the female lay disciple Nanda's 
home."</P>
<P>He agreed and going to the monastery informed the Community of bhikkhus: 
Venerable sirs, the meal is ready at the female lay disciple Nanda's home. The 
Community of bhikkhus headed by Sariputta and Moggallana putting on robes in the 
morning and taking bowl and robes approached the house of the female lay 
disciple Nanda and sat on the prepared seats</P>
<P>Then the female lay disciple Nanda with her own hands offered nourishing 
eatables and drinks to the Community of bhikkhus headed by Sariputta and 
Moggallana and satisfied them. </P>
<P>Then knowing venerable Sariputta had finished taking the meal and had put 
aside the bowl, the female lay disciple Nanda sat on a side and venerable 
Sariputta said: ßNandamata, who informed you about the arrival of the Community 
of bhikkhus?" </P>
<P>ßHere, venerable sir, I got up in the last watch of the night and reciting 
loudly the Parayana Vagga became silent</P>
<P>Then Vessavana the great king of gods knowing that I had finished reciting 
the Parayana Vagga applauded me, saying ßGood! Sister!" Then I asked. ßWho is 
this good one?" </P>
<P>and he said: ßSister I am Vessavana the great king.of gods"</P>
<P>ßGood one, you have thievishly listened to my recitation"</P>
<P>ßGood! Sister, then this will be another theft. Tomorrow the Community of 
bhikkhus headed by Sariputta and Moggallana without taking the morning meal are 
coming to Velukandaka, offering food to that Community of bhikkhus, make it my 
offering. May that also be a theft of mine." </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, whatever merit be the outcome of this gift may it be for the 
pleasantness of Vessavana the great king of gods ß</P>
<P>ß It is wonderful and surprising Nandamata, that you have spoken face to face 
with such a powerful majestic son of gods!"</P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, that is not all, there is another wonderful and surprising 
thing. Venerable sir, I had a single loved son Nanda, for some reason or other 
the king pulled him away, oppressed him and killed him. Venerable sir, when my 
child was pulled away, oppressed, and killed, I do not recall of the least 
change in my mind". </P>
<P>ß It is wonderful and surprising Nandamata, your development and purity of 
mind." </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, that is not all, there is another wonderful and surprising 
thing. Venerable sir, my husband died and was born with a certain clan of 
demons. Now he appears to me as he was in his last birth. On account of that, I 
do not recall of the least change in my mind". </P>
<P>ß It is wonderful and surprising Nandamata, your development and purity of 
mind." </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, that is not all, there is another wonderful and surprising 
thing. Venerable sir, from the day I was brought by my husband as a child, I do 
not recall of an instance of going beyond his mental state, I have never 
searched outside bodily pleasures". . </P>
<P>ß It is wonderful and surprising Nandamata, your development and purity of 
mind." </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, that is not all, there is another wonderful and surprising 
thing. Venerable sir, from the day I confessed to be a female lay disciple I do 
not recall of trespessing the least of the precepts. . </P>
<P>ß It is wonderful and surprising Nandamata, your development and purity of 
mind." </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, that is not all, there is another wonderful and surprising 
thing. Venerable sir, when I desire, secluding my mind from sensual desires and 
demeritorious things, with thoughts and discursive thoughts and with joy and 
pleasantness born of seclusion I abide in the first higher state of mind. 
Overcoming thoughts and discursive thoughts, the mind in one point, internally 
appeased with joy and pleasantness born of concentration I abide in the second 
higher state of mind. With equanimity to joy and disenchantment, I experience 
pleasantness and mindful awareness with the body and attain to the third higher 
state of mind, to this the noble ones say, mindfully abiding in pleasantness 
with equanimity. Dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness and earlier having 
dispelled pleasure and displeasure, cleaning the mind so that it is without 
unpleasantness and pleasàntness I attain to the fourth higher state of mind" 
</P>
<P>ß It is wonderful and surprising Nandamata, your development and purity of 
mind." </P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, that is not all, there is another wonderful and surprising 
thing. Venerable sir, I do not see a single of these bonds binding to the 
sensual world in me, according to the way declared by The Blessed One.". </P>
<P>ß It is wonderful and surprising Nandamata, your development and purity of 
mind." </P>
<P>Then venerable Sariputta advising, inciting and making the heart light of the 
female lay disciple Nanda with a talk got up and went away.
