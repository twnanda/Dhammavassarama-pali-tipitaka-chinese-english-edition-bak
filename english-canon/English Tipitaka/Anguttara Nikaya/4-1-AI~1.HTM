<P>001.01. I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was living in Bandagama in 
the country of the Vajji's. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:- Bhikkhus, 
not comprehending and not enlightened on four things you and I too have been 
traversing and transmigrating for a very long time. What four? </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, not comprehending and not enlightened on the virtues of the noble 
ones, you and I too have been traversing and transmigrating for a very long 
time.Bhikkhus, not comprehending and not enlightened on the concentration of the 
noble ones, you and I too have been traversing and transmigrating for a very 
long time. Bhikkhus, not comprehending and not enlightened on the wisdom of the 
noble ones, you and I too have been traversing and transmigrating for a very 
long time. Bhikkhus, not comprehending and not enlightened on the release of the 
noble ones, you and I too have been traversing and transmigrating for a very 
long time.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, now I am enlightened penetratingly seeing the virtues, 
concentration, wisdom and release of the noble ones. I have pulled out the roots 
of being, destroyed the leader of being, there is no more birth now. </P>
<P>The blessed One saying this further said:- </P>

<P>Virtues, concentration, wisdom and release.</P>
<P>The Blessed One realizing, declared it to the bhikkhus</P>

<P>001.05. Bhikkhus, these four persons are evident in the world. What four? 
</P>
<P>The one going with the stream, the one going against the stream, the one self 
controlled and the one crossed over stands on hard ground, the brahmin. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, which person goes with the stream? </P>
<P>Here bhikkhus, a certain person indulges in sensual pleasures and does 
demeritorious actions. Bhikkhus, he goes with the stream</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, which person goes against the stream? </P>
<P>Here bhikkhus, a certain person does not indulge in sensual pleasures and 
does no demeritorious actions. Unpleasantly and displeased with tearing eyes he 
leads the complete and pure holy life. Bhikkhus, he goes against the stream</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, which person is self controlled? </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain person exhausting the five bonds binding him to the 
sensual world takes spontaneous rebirth and extinguishes from that world not 
going further any more. Bhikkhus, he is the self controlled person. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, which person crossed over, stands on hard ground, the brahmin?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain person, destroying desires and releasing the mind 
from desires, and released through wisdom, realizing it here and now 
abides.Bhikkhus, this person crossed over, stands on hard ground, the brahmin. 
</P>
<P>Sentient beings partaking sensual pleasures unrestrained,</P>
<P>Come to birth and decay again and again, </P>
<P>They are the victims of craving going with the stream.</P>
<P>Therefore the wise with aroused mindfulness,</P>
<P>Do not practise sensuality or demerit,</P>
<P>Unhappily giving up sensual pleasures, go against the stream.</P>
<P>Giving up the five lower bonds and become a trainer </P>
<P>Not failing he controls his mind and the mental faculties,</P>
<P>He is the self controlled one, it is said.</P>
<P>Seeing no essence he gives up all things that continue to the beyond, </P>
<P>He knows it correctly, has lived the holy life.</P>
<P>It is said, he has gone to the end.</P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+
