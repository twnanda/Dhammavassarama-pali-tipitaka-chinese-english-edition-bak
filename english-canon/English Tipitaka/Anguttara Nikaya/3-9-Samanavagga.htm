<P>1. Samanasuttaü-Recluses</P>
<P>82.Bhikkhus, these three are the activities of a recluse. What three? 
Training in higher virtues, [1]training the mind to a higher degree and training 
for the higher wisdom. Bhikkhus, these three are the activities of a recluse. 
Therefore bhikkhus, you should train thus:- Our interest will be keen, to train 
in higher virtues, to train the mnd to a higher degree and for a higher training 
in wisdom. </P>
<P>Notes. 1 Training in higher virtues. `adhisãla sikkhà samàdànaü. It is the 
control of the mental faculties. All observed virtues aim at the control of the 
mental faculties and the ultimate end of the holy life is the complete control 
of the mental faculties. The Blessed One explains that `a¤¤àvimutti' is the 
release that one experiences when his mental faculties are in complete control. 
</P>
<P>&nbsp;2. Gadrabhasuttaü- A donkey</P>
<P>83.Bhikkhus, a donkey follows after the cattle, saying I'm one of you. He 
hasn't the colour, the calling and the feet of the cattle, yet he follows after 
the cattle saying I'm one of you. Bhikkhus, in like manner a certain bhikkhu 
follows after the Community of bhikkhus, thinking I'm also a bhikkhu. He hasn't 
that interest for training in higher virtues, for training the mnd to a higher 
degree and training in higher wisdom, as the other bhikkhus do have. He follows 
after the Community of bhikkhus thinking I'm also a bhikkhu </P>
<P>Therefore bhikkhus, you should train thus:- Our interest will be keen to 
train in higher virtues, for training the mnd to a higher degree and for 
training in higher wisdom.</P>
<P>3. Kassakasuttaü -A farmer</P>
<P>84. Bhikkhus, these three activities should be done earlier by the farmer. 
What three? </P>
<P>Here bhikkhus, the farmer should first prepare the field, then harrow it well 
carefully and embed the seeds at the right time. At the right time he should 
lead the water in and at the right time lead it out. Bhikkhus, these three are 
the activities that should be done earlier by the farmer</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in the same mnner these three activities should be done earlier by 
the bhikkhu. What three? Training in thehigher virtues, training the mind to a 
higher degree and training for higher wisdom. Bhikkhus, these three are the 
activities of a recluse. Therefore bhikkhus, you should train thus:- Our 
interest will be keen for training in the higher virtues, for training the mnd 
to a higher degree and for a higher training in wisdom</P>
<P>4. Vajjiputtasuttàü</P>
<P>85. I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was living in the gabled hall 
in the Great Forest in Vesali. Then a certain bhikkhu of the Vajjiputtaka's 
approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said:- Venerable sir, 
the two hundred and fifty rules are beyond capacity, and the coming for the 
recital every fortinight. Venerable sir, it is not possible for me to train in 
them. </P>
<P>Bhikkhu, is it possible for you to train in three precepts- .Observing the 
precept for higher virtues, training the mind to a higher degree and training 
for higher wisdom?</P>
<P>Venerable sir, it possible for me to train in three precepts- .Observing the 
precept for higher virtues, training the mind to a higher degree and training 
for higher wisdom.</P>
<P>Then bhikkhu you train in these three precepts- .Observing the precept higher 
virtues, training the mind to a higher degree and training for higher wisdom. 
Bhikkhu, when you train in these three observing the precept for higher virtues, 
training the mind to a higher degree and training for higher wisdom, your greed 
will fade, hate will fade and delusion will fade. With the fading of greed, hate 
and delusion, you will not do </P>
<P>demerit and will not practise any evil. </P>
<P>In the meantime that bhikkhu trained in these three observing the precept for 
higher virtues, training the mind to a higher degree and training for higher 
wisdom, then his greed faded, hate faded and delusion faded. With the fading of 
greed, hate and delusion, he did no demerit and practised no evil.</P>
<P>5. Sekhasuttaü- The Trainer.</P>
<P>86. Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a 
side and said:- Venerable sir, it is said a trainer. How is one a trainer? </P>
<P>Bhikkhu, one trains, therefore he is called a trainer. </P>
<P>In what does he train? He trains in higher virtues, training the mind to a 
higher degree and training for higher wisdom.</P>
<P>The trainer who trains himself, going on the direct path </P>
<P>Sees destruction first and knowledge comes without a break</P>
<P>To those released knowing,[1] that becomes the knowledge</P>
<P>When the bond being [2] is destroyed, he knows my release is unshakeable.</P>
<P>Notes.1. To those released knowing `a¤¤à vimuttassa' This is one of the 
releases that the Blessed One tells about. It is the complete control of the six 
mental faculties. That is no feelings arise on account of any contacts at one or 
the other of the doors of mental contact. This is said to be the bliss of 
extinction here and now. </P>
<P>2. When the bond being.is destroyed `bhavasa¤¤ojanakkhaye' Bhava is thinking 
and for unshakeable release thinking has to stop.</P>
<P>6. Pañhamasikkhàsuttaü -The first on precepts</P>
<P>87. Bhikkhus, the two hundred and fifty rules are beyond capacity, and the 
coming for the recital every fortinight, the sons of clansmen seeking their own 
good, observe them</P>
<P>In these three precepts all those get included. What three? </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu becomes complete, observing the virtues and 
complete to a lesser degree in concentration and wisdom. He transgresses certain 
minor precepts and eventually emerges from them. What is the reason? Bhikkhus, 
saying it correctly it would happen. Of the main precepts dealing with the holy 
life and conducive to the holy life he is fixed and firm. He destroys the three 
bonds and enters the stream of the Teaching, becoming one who does not fall from 
that, directly aims extinction. </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu becomes complete, observing the virtues and 
complete to a lesser degree in concentration and wisdom. He transgresses certain 
minor precepts and eventually emerges from them. What is the reason? Bhikkhus,

life and conducive to the holy life he is fixed and firm. He destroys the three 
bonds and reducing his greed, hate and delusion becomes one who returns to this 
world once more to make an end of unpleasantness. </P>

complete in concentration and wisdom. He transgresses certain minor precepts and 
eventually emerges from them. What is the reason? Bhikkhus, saying it correctly

to the holy life he is fixed and firm. Destroying the five bonds of the sensual 
world he takes sponteneous birth and would extinguish in that same birth, 
without a fall from there.</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu becomes complete, observing the virtues and 
complete in concentration and wisdom. He transgresses certain minor precepts and 
eventually emerges from them. What is the reason? Bhikkhus, saying it correctly 
it would happen. Of the main precepts dealing with the holy life and conducive 
to the holy life he is fixed and firm. He will destroy desires, release the 
mind, and released through wisdom here and now realize and abide</P>
<P>Thus bhikkhus, one becomes successful little by little, and complete little 
by little I declare the precepts in that manner, without making a mistake.</P>
<P>7. Dutiyasikkhàsuttaü -The Second on precepts</P>

men makes an end of unpleasantness. Destroying three bonds, he goes from clan to 
clan, being born in two or three clans makes an end of unpleasantness. He

unpleasantness. He destroys three bonds and reducing his greed, hate and 
delusion, returns once more to this world to make an end of unpleasantness. </P>

virtues [1] To this is called observing the precept for higher virtues.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is training the mind for a higher degree? </P>
<P>Here, bhikikhus the bhikkhu secluding the mind from sensual and evil 
thoughts, with thoughts and thought processes and with joy and pleasantness born 
of seclusion attains to the first jhana. Allaying thoughts and thought processes 
and the mind internally appeased and brought to one point, without thoughts and 
thought processes and with joy and pleasantness born of concentration attains to 
the second jhana. With detachment to joy abides in equanimity. Mindful and aware 
experiences pleasantness too with the body. This is the third jhana, to this the 
noble ones say mindfully abiding in pleasantness with equanimity. Giving up 
pleasantness and unpleasantness and earlier gone beyond pleasure and displeasure 
and experiencing neither the pleasant nor the unpleasant by purifying 
mindfulness with equanimity attains to the forth jhana. To this is called 
training the mind to a higher degree. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is training for higher wisdom?. </P>

as it really is, this is the arising of unpleasantness. Knows as it really is, 
this is the cessation of unpleasantness and knows as it really is, this is the 
path to the cessation of unpleasantness. Bhikkhus, to this is called training 
for higher wisdom. Bhikkhus, these three are the precepts. </P>

<P>Beneath and above, as far as the directions, day and night.</P>
<P>This is the trainer's method, and the best method</P>

<P>With the cessation of consciousness, there is destruction of craving and 
release</P>
<P>With the light of emancipation is the release of mind. </P>
<P>Notes. 1. The precept for higher virtues. `adhisãlasikkhàsamàdànaü' It is the 
control of the six mental faculties which when controlled all other precepts get 
included in it. </P>
<P>11. Saõkavàsuttaü -In Sankava</P>
<P>92. At one time the Blessed One was touring the country of Kosala with a 
large Community of bhikkhus and entered the hamlet Sankava in Kosala and lived 
there. </P>
<P>At that time a bhikkhu named Kassapagotta lived in Sankava, the Blessed One 
was advising, insighting and gladening the bhikkhus on the arrangement of 
precepts. The bhikkhu Kassapagotta was displeased and discontented hearing the 
teaching on the arrangement of precepts given to the bhikkhus, thinking I am 
also a recluse practising the higher austerities.</P>
<P>The Blessed One living in Sankava as long as he pleased, left for Rajagaha 
and coming to Rajagaha lived among the Gijjha peaks.</P>
<P>Soon after the Blessed One had gone away the bhikkhu Kassapagotta became 
remorseful and regretful It is no gain for me, I have lost much, for I was 
displeased and discontented hearing the advise, incite and gladness given to the 
bhikkhus in arranging precepts, thinking I was also a recluse practising the 
higher austerities. What if I approach the Blessed One to wherever he is and ask 
pardon for my offence?</P>
<P>The bhikkhu Kassapagotta arranged his dwelling, took his bowl and robes and 
went to Rajagaha and eventually came to the presence of the Blessed One among 
the Gijjha peaks. He worshipped the Blessed One sat on a side and said:- </P>
<P>Venerable sir, at one time the Blessed One was living in Sankva, a hamlet of 
Kosala the Blessed One was advising, inciting and gladening the bhikkhus on the 
arrangement of precepts. Then I was displeased and discontented hearing the 
teaching on the arrangement of precepts given to the bhikkhus, thinking I am 
also a recluse practising the higher austerities.</P>
<P>The Blessed One lived in Sankava as long as he pleased, left for Rajagaha and 
coming to Rajagaha lived among the Gijjha peaks.</P>
<P>Soon after the Blessed One had gone away I became remorseful and regretful It 
is no gain for me, I have lost much, for I was displeased and discontented 
hearing the advise, incite and gladness given to the bhikkhus in arranging 
precepts, thinking I was also a recluse practising the higher austerities. Then 
the thought occured to me. What if I approached the Blessed One to wherever he 
is and ask pardon for my offence. May the Blessed One pardon my offence, it was 
demerit done owing foolishness and delusion, may it be for future restraint. 
</P>
<P>There Kassapa, you have done an offence, it's demerit done owing to 
foolishness and delusion that you were displeased and discontented hearing the 
teaching on the arrangement of precepts given to the bhikkhus, thinking I am 
also a recluse practising the higher austerities. Kassapa, since you ask for 
pardon seeing your fault according to the Teaching, we pardon you, it is for 
future restraint. </P>
<P>Kassapa, there may be an elder bhikkhu who does not like the training and 
does not talk in praise of the training and not inciting other bhikkhus to like 
the training and to observe it. He would not praise truthfully other bhikkhus 
who like the training carefully watching as time goes. Kassapa, I do not talk 
praise of even such an elder bhikkhu. What is the reason? Hearing the Teacher 
praise him other bhikkhus copy him, and imitating him fall into unpleasantness 
for a long time. Therefore Kassapa, I do not talk in praise of such an elder 
bhikkhu</P>
<P>Kassapa, there may be a middling bhikkhu...re..... a novice bhikkhu who does 
not like the training and does not talk in praise of the training and not 
inciting other bhikkhus to like the training and to observe it. He would not 
praise truthfully other bhikkhus who like the training carefully watching as 
time goes. Kassapa, I do not talk praise of even such a novice bhikkhu. What is 
the reason? Hearing the Teacher praise him other bhikkhus copy him, and 
imitating him fall into unpleasantness for a long time. Therefore Kassapa, I do 
not talk in praise of such a novice bhikkhu</P>
<P>Kassapa, there may be an elder bhikkhu who likes the training and talks in 
praise of the training and inciting other bhikkhus to like the training and to

carefully watching as time goes. Kassapa, I talk praise of such an elder 
bhikkhu. What is the reason? Hearing the Teacher praise him other bhikkhus copy 
him, and imitating him come to welfare and pleasantness for a long time.
