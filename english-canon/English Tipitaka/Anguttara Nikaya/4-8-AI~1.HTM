<P>008.04. Bhikkhus, from the night or day, that a young wife is brought along, 
her shame and remorse should be well established towards the father-in-law, 
mother-in-law, her husband and even towards slaves and workmen. -In the 
meantime, living together and won over their confidence, she would tell the 
father-in-law, the mother-in-law or her husband, -leave that alone, what do you 
know about that.</P>
<P>In the same manner bhikkhus, from the night or day a certain bhikkhu left the 
household and became homeless, his shame and remorse should be well established 
towards bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, lay disciples male and female and as far as the 
novices in the monastery -In the meantime, living together and won over their 
confidence, he would tell, his teacher, or even his preceptor, -leave that 
alone, what do you know about that.</P>
<P>Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train thus:- We should abide with the mind of 
a recently brought young wife.</P>

<P>008.06. At the time the Blessed One was about to pass into final extinction 
in Kusinara, he was between two Sal trees in the historic Sala forest of the 
Mallas.</P>
<P>Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus and said:- Bhikkhus, if there is 
any doubt or consternation to a single one of the bhikkhus, about Enlightenment, 
the Teaching, the Community of bhikkhus, the path or method ask it now, do not 
have remorse later. O! we came face to face with the Teacher and could not ask 
this, from the Teacher himself. When this was said, the bhikkhus were 
silent.</P>
<P>For the second time the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus and said:- 
Bhikkhus, if there is any doubt or consternation to a single one of you 
bhikkhus, about Enlightenment, the Teaching, the Community of bhikkhus, the path 
or method ask it now, do not have remorse later. O! we came face to face with 
the Teacher and could not ask this, from the Teacher himself. When this was 
said, the bhikkhus were silent for the second time.</P>
<P>For the third time the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus and said:- 
Bhikkhus, if there is any doubt or consternation to a single one of you 
bhikkhus, about Enlightenment, the Teaching, the Community of bhikkhus, the path 
or method ask it now, do not have remorse later. O! we came face to face with 
the Teacher and could not ask this, from the Teacher himself. When this was 
said, the bhikkhus were silent for the third time.</P>
<P>Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:-</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it might be out of respect for the Teacher, that you do not speak, 
inform your associates about your doubts. Even when this was said, the bhikkhus 
were silent.</P>
<P>Then venerable Ananda said:- Venerable sir, it is wonderful and surprising. I 
am delighted with this Community of bhikkhus there are no doubts or 
consternation to a single one of these bhikkhus, about Enlightenment, the 
Teaching, the Community of bhikkhus, the path</P>
<P>or method</P>
<P>Ananda, you talk of delight, I know that out of these five hundred bhikkhus, 
there is not a single who has doubts or consternation about Enlightenment, the 
Teaching, the Community of bhikkhus, the path or method. Ananda, the least out 
of these five hundred bhikkhus is a stream winner who aims enlightenment and 
would not fall from there.</P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>

<P>008.07. Bhikkhus, these four should not be thought. Someone thinking about 
them falls into trouble and a mental lapse. What four?</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the Enlightened One's sphere of enlightenment should not be thought 
of, someone thinking about it falls into trouble and a mental lapse. Bhikkhus, 
of one in a higher state of mind, the sphere of his state of mind should not be 
thought of, someone thinking about it falls into trouble and a mental lapse. 
Bhikkhus, the results of action should not be thought of, someone thinking about 
it, falls into trouble and a mental lapse. Bhikkhus, sepculations about the 
world should not be thought of, someone thinking about them falls into trouble 
and a mental lapse.</P>

receiver, there is an offering pure by the receiver and not pure by the giver, 
there is an offering neither pure by the giver nor by the receiver and there is 
an offering pure by the giver as well as the receiver.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, how is an offering pure by the giver and not pure by the 
receiver?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the giver is virtuous with the right conduct. The receivers 
are unvirtuous with wrong conduct. Thus the offering becomes pure by the giver 
and not pure by the receivers.</P>

<P>008.09. Venerable Sariputta approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a 
side and said to the Blessed One:-</P>
<P>Venerable sir, for what reason does someone's well established trade even 
while devoted to it, go to destruction? Venerable sir, for what reason does 
someone's well established trade even while devoted to it, does not increase as 
intended? Venerable sir, for what reason does someone's well established trade, 
when devoted to it, go to increase as intended? Venerable sir, for what reason 
does someone's well established trade even while devoted to it, someone else's 
intention come true?</P>
<P>Here, sariputta, a certain one approaches a single recluse or Brahmin and 
invites for a meal pleasantly, does not give it. He disappearing from there, is 
born here in this form. He devotes himself to some trade, and it goes to 
destruction.</P>

<P>Here, sariputta, a certain one approaches a single recluse or Brahmin and

disappearing from there, is born here in this form. He devotes himself to some 
trade, and it is another's intention that gets fulfilled.</P>
<P>Sariputta, this is the reason, for a certain one's well established trade to 
go to destruction, another's well established trade not to thrive as intended, 
yet another's well established trade to thrive as intended and the well 
established trade should thrive according to another's 
intention.</P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>

<P>008. 10. At one time the Blessed One was living in Gosita's monastery in 
Kosambiya. Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a 
side and said:-</P>
<P>Venerable sir, what is the reason that women neither come to the limelight, 
nor doing an industry see its benefits?</P>
<P>Ananda, women are hateful, jealous, miserly and lack wisdom, as a result they 
neither come to the limelight, nor do an industry and see its 
benefits.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
