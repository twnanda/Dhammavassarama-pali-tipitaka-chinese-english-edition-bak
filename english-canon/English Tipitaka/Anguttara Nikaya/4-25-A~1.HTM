<P align=center>025. âpattibhayavaggo- Fear to do faults</P>
<P align=center>1. Saïghabhedasuttaü- Split in the 
Community.</P></B></FONT><FONT face=Times_CSX+>
<P>025.01. At one time The Blessed One was abiding in Gosita's monastery in 
Kosambi. Venerable Ananda approached The Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a 
side and The Blessed One said:-</P>
<P>So then, Ananda, is the dispute settled?</P>
<P>Venerable sir, how could the dispute be settled, venerable Anuruddha's 
co-associate Bahiya, organizes a complete split of the Community and venerable 
Anuruddha does not think to say a word about it.</P>
<P>Ananda, when will Anuruddha settle disputes in the Community? Isn't it that 
you should settle whatever disputes that arise together with Sariputta and 
Maggallana</P>
<P>Ananda, the evil bhikkhu seeing four reasons for his benefit delights in a 
split in the Community. What four?</P>
<P>Here, Ananda, to the evil bhikkhu, with impure, under cover activity, with 
merely a promise to lead the holy life and with evil thoughts streaming, it 
occurs :- If the bhikkhus come to know that I am with evil under cover activity, 
they will together decide not to associate me. When disssociated it would not be 
that they will never come to see me. . Seeing this first reason for his benefit, 
the evil, impure bhikkhu rejoices in a split in the Community.</P>
<P>Again, Ananda, to the evil bhikkhu with wrong views, holding an extremist 
view it occurs- If the bhikkhus come to know that I am with wrong views holding 
an extremist view, they will together decide not to associate me. When 
dissociated it would not be that they will never come to me. Seeing this second 
reason for his benefit, the evil, impure bhikkhu rejoices in a split in the 
Community.</P>
<P>Again, Ananda, the evil bhikkhu leads a wrong livelihood and it occurs to him 
thus:- If the bhikkhus come to know that I lead a wrong livelihood, they will 
together decide not to associate me. When dissociated it would not be that they 
will never come to see me. Seeing this third reason for his benefit, the evil, 
impure bhikkhu rejoices in a split in the Community.</P>
<P>Again, Ananda, the evil bhikkhu, desires gain and fame in wrong ways and it 
occurs to him:- If the bhikkhus come to know that I desire gain and fame in 
wrong ways, they will not revere, honour and esteem me, separated, I will be 
revered, honoured and esteemed Seeing this fourth reason for his benefit, the 
evil, impure bhikkhu rejoices in a split in the Community.</P>
<P>Ananda, the evil bhikkhu seeing these four reasons for his benefit delights 
in a split in the Community</P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>
<P align=center>2. Aapattibhayasuttaü- Fear for offences.</P></B></FONT><FONT 
face=Times_CSX+>
<P>025.02. Bhikkhus, these four are the fears for offences. What four?</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, a robber, a highwayman is shown to the king- Lord, this is a robber 
a highwayman, mete the suitable punishment to him:- Good ones bind this man's 
hands tightly behind his back, shave him closely and with the rough sound of a 
cymbal take him from street to street and from junction to junction, then 
impressively entering the city through the southern gate, to the south of the 
city cut his neck. Then the king's men bind that man's hands tightly behind his 
back, shave him closely and with the rough sound of a cymbal take him from 
street to street and from junction to junction, then impressively entering the 
city through the southern gate, to the south of the city they cut his neck. Then 
to a sensible on looker it occurs:- This man has done some serious offence, and 
death is the punishment. The king's people binding his hands tightly behind his 
back, shaving him closely and with the rough sound of a cymbal taking him from 
street to street and from junction to junction have entered the city through the 
southern gate impressively, to the south of the city, they cut his neck. He will 
not do such an evil thing in this life; the penalty is death. In the same 
manner, bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu or bhikkhuni has the perception of fear for grave 
offences, this should be expected - I will not fall to a grave offence, that I 
have not yet fallen and I will do the suitable remedy for the offence I have 
already fallen to, according to the Teaching.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, like a man taking a black piece of cloth and tying the hair down 
and holding a mortar against his body, would approach the crowds and would tell 
them:- Sirs, I have done some evil, blame the mortar. I will do whatever to 
please the venerable one. Then to a sensible on looker it occurs:- This man has 
done some serious offence, the punishment is to the mortar. Since he takes a 
black piece of cloth and tying the hair down and holding a mortar against his 
body, approaches the populace and says: Venerable sirs, I did some demerit, 
blame the mortar. I will do whatever to please the venerable ones. I will not do 
such demeritorious actions. The blame should be to the mortar. In the same 
manner, bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu or bhikkhuni has the perception of fear for 
offences that need a chapter of bhikkhus to be redressed, this should be 
expected - I will not fall for offences that need a chapter of bhikkhus to be 
redressed, (that I have not yet fallen} and I will do the suitable remedy for 
the offence I have already fallen to, according to the Teaching.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, like a man taking a black piece of cloth and tying the hair down 
and bearing a knapsack on his back, would approach the crowds and would tell 
them:- Sirs, I have done some evil, blame the knapsack. I will do whatever to 
please the venerable ones. Then to a sensible on looker it occurs:- This man has 
done some serious offence, the punishment is to the knapsack. Since he takes a 
black piece of cloth and tying the hair down and bearing a knapsack on his body, 
approaches the populace and says: Venerable sirs, I did some demerit, blame the 
knapsack. I will do whatever to please the venerable ones. I will not do such 
demeritorious actions. The blame should be to the knapsack. In the same manner, 
bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu or bhikkhuni has the perception of fear for offences that 
need recalling mindfulness for expiation, this should be expected - I will not 
fall for offences that need recalling mindfulness for expiation that I have not 
yet fallen and I will do the suitable remedy for the offence I have already 
fallen to, according to the Teaching.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, like a man taking a black piece of cloth and tying the hair down 
would approach the crowds and would tell them:- Sirs, I have done some evil, 
blame the blameworthy. I will do whatever to please the venerable ones. Then to 
a sensible on looker it occurs:- This man has done some offence, the punishment 
is to the blameworthy. Since he takes a black piece of cloth and tying the hair 
down approaches the populace and says: Venerable sirs, I did some demerit, blame 
the blameworthy. I will do whatever to please the venerable ones. I will not do 
such demeritorious actions. The blame should be to the blameworthy. In the same 
manner, bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu or bhikkhuni has the perception of fear for 
offences that need a confession for redress, this should be expected - I will 
not fall for offences that need confession to be redressed, that I have not yet 
fallen and I will do the suitable remedy for the offence I have already fallen 
to, according to the Teaching.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these are the four fears for offences.</P></FONT><B><FONT

<P align=center>3. Sikkhànisaüsasuttaü- The benefit of the 
precepts.</P></B></FONT><FONT face=Times_CSX+>
<P>025.03. Bhikkhus, the holy life is led for the benefit of the precepts, for 
highest wisdom, for the essence of release and for dominating with 
mindfulness.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the benefit of the precepts?</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, I have pointed out the lower ethics to my disciples, to please 
those not pleased, and for greater pleasure of those pleased. The respective 
precepts should be taken upon and observed without a break, without defects, 
without spots and consistently</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, I have pointed out the higher precepts for the rightful 
destruction of all unpleasantness to my disciples. The respective precepts 
should be taken upon and observed without a break, without defects without spots 
and consistently</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, this is the benefit of the precepts</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the highest wisdom?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, I have declared the Teaching for the rightful destruction of 
all unpleasantness to my disciples. The Teaching is declared in this and other 
respective instance for the rightful destruction of all unpleasantness, for wise 
consideration.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, this is the highest in wisdom.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the essence of release?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, I have declared the Teaching for the rightful destruction of 
all unpleasantness to my disciples. The Teaching is declared in this and other 
respective instance for the rightful destruction of all unpleasantness and 
through the Teaching release is to be realized.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, this is the essence of release.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is dominating mindfulness?</P>
<P>In this manner, I will complete, the incomplete lower ethics, on account of 
the completed lower ethics I will be wisely satisfied then and there. I will 
complete the incomplete higher precepts of the holy life, and on account of the 
completed higher precepts of the holy life, I will be wisely satisfied then and 
there. Mindfulness well established internally. I will wisely consider those 
things not yet considered and on account of those things well considered I will 
be wisely satisfied then and there. Mindfulness well established. I will 
experience those things not yet experienced and on account of the things 
experienced I will be satisfied then and there. Bhikkhus, this is dominating 
mindfulness.</P>
<P>If it was said, bhikkhus, the holy life is led for the benefit of the 
precepts, for highest wisdom, for the essence of release and for dominating with 
mindfulness, it was said on account of this.</P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+

<P>025.04. Bhikkhus, there are four lying positions. What four?</P>
<P>The lying position of ghosts, of one enjoying sensuality, of a lion and the 
lying position of the Thus Gone One.</P>

<P>For most of the time, ghosts lie upside on their back. To this, is said the 
lying position of ghosts.</P>

<P>For most of the time, those enjoying sexuality lie turning to their left 
flank. To this, is said the lying position of those enjoying sexuality .</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the lying position of the lion?</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the king of animals lies turning to his right flank, placing one 
foot over the other, fixing the tail between his thights. Thoughtfully he 
straightens the fore part of the body and looks at the hind part of the body and 
if he notices any parts of the body thrown about or widened he is not happy if 
he notices that no parts of the body are thrown about or widened he is happy. 
This is the lying position of the lion.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the lying position of the Thus Gone One?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu secluded from sensual desires. . . . . re. . . . 
. abides in the fourth higher state of mind. To this is called the lying 
position of the Thus Gone One.</P>
