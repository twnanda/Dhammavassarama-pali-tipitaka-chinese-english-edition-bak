<P>003.01. At one time The Blessed One was living at the pond in the village 
Samagama in the country of the Sakyas. Then a certain deity, when the night was 
waning illuminating the whole of the pond with a resplendent light approached 
The Blessed One, worshipped, stood on a side and said to The Blessed One: 
Venerable sir, these three things conduce to the decrease of the bhikkhu. What 
three? </P>
<P>Becoming fond of activity, becoming fond of talk and becoming fond of sleep. 
Venerable sir, these three things conduce to the decrease of the bhikkhu. Saying 
it stood, waiting for the approval. Knowing that The Blessed One has approved, 
worshipped and circumambulated The Blessed One and vanished. </P>
<P>The Blessed One at the end of that night addressed the bhikkhus: </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, last night a certain deity, when the night was waning illuminating 
the whole of the pond with a resplendent light approached me, worshipped, stood 
on a side and said to me: Venerable sir, these three things conduce to the 
decrease of the bhikkhu. What three? </P>
<P>Becoming fond of activity, becoming fond of talk and becoming fond of sleep. 
Venerable sir, these three things conduce to the decrease of the bhikkhu. Saying 
it she stood, waiting for my approval. Knowing that I approved, she worshipped 
and circumambulated me and vanished.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it is no gain for you, it is rare, even the gods know these 
decreasing things. Bhikkhus, I will give three other decreasing things listen 
carefully and attend. What are the three things? </P>
<P>Fondness of company, unruliness and evil friendship. Bhikkhus, these three 
are decreasing things. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, if any bhikkhus decreased in meritorious things, in the past, they 
did so on account of these six things. If any bhikkhus, decrease in meritorious 
things in the future, they will do so, on account of these six things. If any 
bhikkhus, decrease in meritorious things at present, they do so on account of 
these six things. </P>

<P>003.02. Bhikkhus, I will tell the six not decreasing things, listen and 
attend carefully. Bhikkhus, what are the six not decreasing things? </P>
<P>Not fond of activity, not fond of talk, not fond of sleep, not fond of 
company, suave and associating good friends. Bhikkhus, these six are not 
decreasing things </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, if bhikkhus increased in meritorious things, in the past, they did 
so on account of these six things. If bhikkhus, increase in meritorious things 
in the future, they will do so, on account of these six things. If bhikkhus,

<P>003.03.Bhikkhus, fear is a synonym for sensuality, unpleasantness is a 
synonym for sensuality, sickness is a synonym for sensuality, a knot is a 
synonym for sensuality, clinging is a synonym for sensuality and mud is a 
synonym for sensuality.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, why is fear a synonym for sensuality?</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, someone burning with sensual greed, bound with interest and greed, 
is not free from fear here and now, nor is he free from fear here after. 
Therefore fear is a synonym for sensuality. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, why is unpleasantness,...re.... sickness, ...re.... a knot, 
...re... clinging,...re....and why is mud a synonym for sensuality?</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, someone burning with sensual greed, bound with interest and greed, 
is not free from mud here and now, nor is he free from greed here after. 
Therefore mud is a synonym for sensuality. </P>
<P>Fear, unpleasantness, sickness, knot, clinging and mud,</P>
<P>These are called sensuality, in which the ordinary folk cling.</P>
<P>They that are appeased see fear in birth, death and being </P>
<P>And are released with the destruction of birth, death and being</P>
<P>They are pleasant here and now, having overcome anger and fear</P>
<P>They have put an end to all unpleasantness. </P>

recollects the Thus Gone One, his mind is not prepossessed by greed, hate or 
delusion, his mind is directly bent on the Thus Gone One. When the noble

<P>Again, the noble disciple recollects the Community of bhikkhus: The Community 
of bhikkhus of The Blessed One have fallen to the right path, the straight path, 
the wise path, the path of mutual understanding. Such as the four pairs of eight 
Great Men. They are the disciples of The Blessed One that are worshipful, 
suitable for hospitality gifts and veneration with clasped hands. The 
incomparable field of merit for the world. At the time the noble disciple

that I having given up stains of miserliness abide released and benevolent with 
open hands attached to giving up and making arrangements to give to the needy.

guardian gods, with the thirty three gods, with the Titanic gods, with those of 
happiness, those attached to creation, those attached to the creation of others, 
with Brahma, and gods even above them. With whatever faith, virtues, learning, 
benevolence and wisdom, they disappeared from here and appeared there, that same 
faith, virtues, learning, benevolence and wisdom is evident in me. At the time

<P>003.07. Then a certain bhikkhu approached The Blessed One, worshipped and sat 
on side and said: Venerable sir, how many instances are there to approach the 
bhikkhu who advises for mental development? </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these six are the instances on which the bhikkhu should approach 
the bhikkhu who advises for mental development. What six?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu abides with a mind overwhelmed with sensual 
greed, not knowing as it really should be, the escape from sensual greed, he 
should approach the bhikkhu who advises for mental development and advice should 
be asked in this manner: Friend, I abide with a mind overwhelmed with sensual 
greed and I do not know the escape from the arisen sensual greed as it really 
should be. Good! if the venerable one teach me how to dispel sensual greed. Then 
the bhikkhu who advises for mental development advises him, as to how he should 
dispel sensual greed. Bhikkhus, this is the first instance to approach the 
bhikkhu who advises for mental development. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu abides with a mind overwhelmed with hate, 
not knowing as it really should be, the escape from arisen hate, he should 
approach the bhikkhu who advises for mental development and advice should be 
asked in this manner: Friend, I abide with a mind overwhelmed with hate and do 
not know the escape from arisen hate as it really should be. Good! if the 
venerable one teach me how to dispel hate Then the bhikkhu who advises for 
mental development advises him, as to how he should dispel hate. Bhikkhus, this 
is the second instance to approach the bhikkhu who advises for mental 
development.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu abides with a mind overwhelmed with sloth 
and torpor, not knowing as it really should be, the escape from arisen sloth and 
torpor, he should approach the bhikkhu who advises for mental development and 
advice should be asked in this manner: Friend, I abide with a mind overwhelmed 
with sloth and torpor and I do not know the escape from the arisen sloth and 
torpor, as it really should be. Good! If the venerable one teach me how to 
dispel sloth and torpor. Then the bhikkhu who advises for mental development 
advises him, as to how he should dispel sloth and torpor. Bhikkhus, this is the 
third instance, to approach the bhikkhu who advises for mental development.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu abides with a mind overwhelmed with 
restlessness and worry, not knowing as it really should be, the escape from 
arisen restlessness and worry, he should approach the bhikkhu who advises for 
mental development and advice should be asked in this manner: Friend, I abide 
with a mind overwhelmed with restlessness and worry and do not know the escape 
from the arisen restlessness and worry as it really should be. Good! If the 
venerable one teach me how to dispel restlessness and worry Then the bhikkhu who 
advises for mental development advises him, as to how he should dispel 
restlessness and worry. Bhikkhus, this is the fourth instance to approach the 
bhikkhu who advises for mental development.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu abides with a mind overwhelmed with doubts, 
not knowing as it really should be, the escape from arisen doubts, he should 
approach the bhikkhu who advises for mental development and advice should be 
asked in this manner: Friend, I abide with a mind overwhelmed with doubts and do 
not know the escape from the arisen doubts as it really should be. Good! If the 
venerable one teach me how to dispel doubts. Then the bhikkhu who advises for

this is the fifth instance to approach the bhikkhu who advises for mental 
development.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu does not know or see the sign to attend to, 
without an interval for the destruction of desires, he should approach the 
bhikkhu who advises for mental development and advice should be asked in this 
manner: Friend, I do not know or see the sign to attend to, without an interval 
for the destruction of desires, Good! If the venerable one teach me for the 
destruction of desires. Then the bhikkhu who advises for mental development 
advises him for the destruction of desires. Bhikkhus, this is the sixth instance

<P>003.08. At one time, many elder bhikhus were residing in Benares in the deer 
park in Isipathana. Those elder bhikkhus were gathered and seated in the 
circular hall after the meal was over, on returning from the alms round, this 
was their topic of conversation. Friends, what is the correct time to approach 
the bhikkhu who advises for mental development?</P>
<P>A certain elder bhikkhu said, friends, when the advisroy bhikkhu had had his 
meal, returning from the alms round, having washed his feet is seated legs 
crossed, body straight and mindfulness established in front of him, that is the 
right time to see the advisory bhikkhu for mental development. </P>
<P>When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said friends, when the advisory bhikkhu 
had had his meal, returning from the alms round, having washed his feet is 
seated legs crossed, body straight and mindfulness established in front of him, 
that is not the right time to see the advisory bhikkhu for mental development. 
At that time, he is lazy on account of fullness and it is not the correct time 
to see the advisory bhikkhu for mental development. Friends, when the advisory 
bhikkhu for mental development gets up from his seclusion in the evening and 
sits in the shadow of the monastery, legs crossed, body straight and mindfulness 
established in front of him, that is the right time to approach him. </P>
<P>When this was said, another bhikkhu said, friends, when the advisory bhikkhu 
for mental development gets up from his seclusion in the evening and sits in the 
shadow of the monastery, legs crossed, body straight and mindfulness established 
in front of him, that is not the right time to approach him. At that time he 
attends to the sign of concentration for the daytime, therefore it is not the 
right time to approach the advisory bhikkhu for mental development. Friends, 
when the advisory bhikkhu for mental development sits cross legged, the body 
straight and mindfulness established in front of him in the last watch of the 
night, that is the right time to approach the advisory bhikkhu for mental 
development. </P>
<P>When this was said another bhikkhu said, friends, when the advisory bhikkhu 
for mental development sits cross legged, the body straight and mindfulness 
established in front of him in the last watch of the night, that is not the 
right time to approach the advisory bhikkhu for mental development. At that time 
his strength has decreased and is likely that he could recollect The Blessed 
One. Therefore it is not the right time to approach the advisory bhikkhu for 
mental development. </P>
<P>When this was said, venerable Mahakaccana said to the elder bhikkhus: 
Friends, I have heard this from The Blessed One himself and The Blessed One 
acknowledges them. </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu abides with a mind overwhelmed with sensual 
greed, not knowing as it really should be, the escape from sensual greed, he 
should approach the bhikkhu who advises for mental development and advice should 
be asked in this manner: Friend, I abide with a mind overwhelmed with sensual 
greed and do not know the escape from the arisen sensual greed as it really 
should be. Good! If the venerable one teach me how to dispel sensual greed. Then

is the second instance to approach the bhikkhu who advises for mental

<P>Again, venerable sir the bhikkhu attends to the sign of light, the sign of 
day, as the day, so also the night. Thus with an open mind not encompassed 
develops the mind of radiance. When they are made much they conduce to gain of 
knowledge and vision. </P>
<P>Again, venerable sir, the bhikkhu reflects this same body up, from the feet 
and down from the hairs of the head, surrounded by the skin as full of 
impurities. There's in this body, hairs of the head and body, nails, teeth, 
skin, flesh, nerves, bones, bone marrow, bladder, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, 
lungs, intestines, small intestines, stomach, excreta, bile, phelgm, pus, blood, 
sweat, oil of the body, tears, fat, spit, snot, synovic fluid and urine. When 
reflected and made much it conduce to dispel seusual greed. </P>
<P>Again, venerable sir, the bhikkhu reflects a body thrown in the charnel 
ground, when dead, after one day, or two days, or three days, or swollen, or 
turned blue, or festering and reflects, it will be the same with this body too. 
This body has not gone beyond that. Or he looks at a body thrown in the charnel 
ground eaten by, crows, hawks, vultures, dogs, foxes, or eaten by various living 
things and reflects it will be the same with this body too. This body has not 
gone beyond that. Or he looks at a body thrown in the charnel ground, a skeleton 
with flesh, smeared with blood and bound with veins, a skeleton without flesh 
smeared with blood and bound with veins, a skeleton without flesh not smeared 
with blood and bound with veins, a skeleton with disconnected bones, thrown here 
and there, the bones of the hand in one place, of the feet in another place, of 
the knee in another place, of the thigh in one place, of the hips in another 
place, the backbone in one place and scull in another place and reflects it will 
be the same with this body too. This body has not gone beyond that. Or he 
reflects a body thrown in the charnel ground the bones turned white, like white 
pearls, decayed bones, bones decayed for three years, turned to dust and 
reflects it will be the same with this body too. This body has not gone beyond 
that. When reflected and made much it conduces to root out the conceit `I am' 
</P>
<P>Again, venerable sir, dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness ...re.... 
abides in the fourth higher state of mind. When reflected and made much it 
conduces for the realization of various elements. Venerable sir, these five are 
to be recollected.</P>
<P>Good! Ananda, bear in mind these six recollections too. The bhikkhu proceeds 
mindfully, recedes mindfully, stands mindfully, sits mindfully, lies mindfully, 
intends activity mindfully. Ananda, when these are recollected it conduces to 
mindful awareness.</P>

<P>Bhikkhus, what is the most excellent sight? </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain one goes to see the jewel of elephants, the jewel 
of horses, the jewel of jewels, goes to see high and low things. Goes to see 
recluses or Brahmins or those of wrong view and taken the wrong path. Bhikkhus, 
are they sights? I do not say, they are not, they are low, vile and for the non 
noble, not conducive to turning away, for disenchantment, for cessation, for 
appeasement, for knowledge, for enlightenment and extinction. If they go to see 
the Thus Gone One or the disciples of the Thus Gone One, get established in 
faith, get established in them, directly in favour, bhikkhus that is the most 
excellent sight for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of grief and 
lament for the ending of unpleasantness and displeasure, for realization of 
knowledge and extinction. Such as to see the Thus Gone One or the disciples of 
the Thus Gone One.and get established in faith, get established in them directly 
pleasantly. Bhikkhus this is the most excellent sight. What is the most 
excellent hearing? </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain one goes to hear the sound of drums, the sound of 
the violin, sougs, and other high and low sounds. They go to hear from recluses 
or Brahmins or those of wrong view and taken the wrong path. Bhikkhus, is there 
such a hearing,? I do not say, there isn't. They are low, vile and for the non 
noble, not conducive to turning away, for disenchantment, for cessation, for 
appeasement, for knowledge, for enlightenment and extinction. If they go to hear 
the Teaching from Thus Gone One or the disciples of the Thus Gone One, get

for realization of knowledge and extinction. Such as listening to the Teaching 
from the Thus Gone One or the disciples of the Thus Gone One and get established

<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain one becomes a gainer of sons, a wife, wealth and 
becomes a gainer of high and low things. Or gains faith in recluses or Brahmins 
with wrong view and taken the wrong path. Bhikkhus, is that a gain? I do not

training as a charioteer, in shooting and trains in the study of stars, and gets 
trained in high and low things. Or gets a training from recluses or Brahmins or 
those of wrong view and taken the wrong path. Bhikkhus, is it a training? I do 
not say, they are not, they are low, vile and for the non noble ones, not 
conducive to turning away, for disenchantment, for cessation, for appeasement, 
for knowledge, for enlightenment and extinction. If they train in the higher 
virtues, higher mind and higher wisdom in the Teaching and Discipline declared 
by the Thus Gone One and get established in faith, get established in them 
pleasantly, directly in favour, bhikkhus that is the most excellent training for 
the purification of beings, for the overcoming of grief and lament for the
