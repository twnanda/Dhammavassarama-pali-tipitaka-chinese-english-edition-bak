concentration.</P></B></FONT><FONT face=Times_CSX+>
<P>005.01. Bhikkhus, these four are the developments of concentration. What 
four?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a concentration developped and made much conduces to a 
pleasant abiding here and now. A concentration developped and made much conduces 
to gain of knowledge and vision. A concentration developped and made much 
conduces to mindfull awareness. and a concentration developped and made much 
conduces to the destruction of desires.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the concentration developped and made much would conduce to 
a pleasant abiding here and now?.</P>
<P>Here bhikkhus, the bhikkhu secluding the mind from sensual desires. . . re. . 
. . . attains to the fourth higher state of mind. Bhikkhus, this concentration 
developped and made much would conduce to a pleasant abiding here and now</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the concentration developped and made much would conduce to 
a gain of knowledge and vision?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu attends to the perception of light and intends 
the perception of daylight. In the day time, intends night and in the night, 
intends day. Thus with an open mind develops the uncovered mind, full of 
light.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, this concentration developped and made much would conduce to a gain 
of knowledge and vision.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the concentration developped and made much would conduce to 
mindfull awareness?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, to the bhikkhu feelings arise, persist and fade knowingly,. 
perceptions arise, persist and fade knowingly and thoughts arise, persist and 
fade knowingly.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, this concentration developped and made much conduces to mindfull 
awareness.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what concentration developped and made much would conduce to the 
destructin of desires?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu abides reflecting the arising and fading of the 
five holdling masses. This is matter, this its arising and this its fading. This 
is feeling, this its arising and this its fading. This is perception, this its 
arising and this its fading. These are determinations, this its arising and this 
its fading. This is consciousness, this its arising and this its fading. 
Bhikkhus, these four are the developments of concentration. On account of this 
it was stated as follows in the Parayana Vagga in reply to Puõõa's quest.</P>
<P>Discriminatingly considering this world and the beyond, not seeing any 
vacillations,</P>
<P>I say he has crossed over, is appeased, emancipated and without 
desires.</P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>

question.</P></B></FONT><FONT face=Times_CSX+>
<P>005.02. Bhikkhus, these four are the ways of answering a question. What 
four?</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, there is a question to be replied directly, there is a question to 
be replied with counter questions, there is one to be put aside and another to 
be classsified and explained.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these four are the ways of answering a question.</P>
<P>One needs a direct reply, another an explanatory one,</P>
<P>The third should be counter questioned and the fourth put aside.</P>
<P>The bhikkhu tackling a question in these four ways is clever.</P>
<P>Approaches the difficult to see, by way of words and phrases</P>
<P>Clever in the useless and essential, penetrating the question</P>
<P>The wise avoid the useless and take the essential.</P></FONT><B><FONT

<P>005.05. At one time the Blessed One was abiding in the monastery offered by 
Anathapindika in Jeta's grove in Savatthi. When the night was far spent, 
Rohitassa the son of the gods illuminated the complete Jeta's grove with a 
resplendent light, approached the Blessed One, worshipped, stood on a side and 
said:-</P>
<P>Venerable sir, is it possible to know, see or achieve that state which has no 
birth, decay, death, disappearing and appearing by going to the end of the 
world?</P>
<P>Friend, I do not say that the state that has no birth, decay, death, 
disappearing and appearing could be known, seen or achieved by going to the end 
of the world.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, it is wonderful and surprising, these good words of the 
Blessed One- Friend, I do not say that the state that has no birth, decay, 
death, disappearing and appearing could be known, seen or achieved by going to 
the end of the world. Venerable sir, in the past there was a sage, the son of a 
villager, with psychic powers to go through the air. Venerable sir, then I had 
such a speed, a trained, proficient archer, with deft hands, would put down a 
standing palm in a very short time and without difficulty, such was my speed. 
Venerable sir my stride was such, putting one foot on the eastern ocean the 
other I put on the western ocean. Endowed with that speed and that stride, this 
desire arose to me. I will reach the end of the world. I travelled for a hundred 
years, through out my life span stopping only to eat, drink taste and enjoy. For 
urinating, excreting, to expel sleepiness and exhaustion and not coming to the 
end of the world I died on the way. Venerable sir, wonderful and surprising are 
these good words of the Blessed One- Friend, I do not say that the state that 
has no birth, decay, death, disappearing and appearing could be known, seen or 
achieved by going to the end of the world.</P>
<P>Friend, I do not say that the state that has no birth, decay, death, 
disappearing and appearing could be known, seen or achieved by going to the end 
of the world, nor do I declare the ending of unpleasantness without coming to 
the end of the world. Yet friend, I appoint the arising, cessation and the path 
leading to the cessation of the world in this fathom long body, which is 
conscious and perceptive</P>
<P>The end of the world can never be attained.</P>
<P>Neither is there release from unpleasantess, without coming to the end of the 
world</P>
<P>The wise knower of the worlds reached the end of the world leading the holy 
life.</P>
<P>Gone to the end of the world and quieted himself, does not desire this or the

and the thither shore is the second, where the sun rises and where it sets and 
the Teaching of the mind and the teaching not concerning the mind is the

<P>Bhikkhus, these four things are far apart.</P>
<P>The sky and earth are far removed, so too the two shores of the great 
ocean,</P>
<P>The sun rises and sets far away, the Teaching of the mind is different from 
other teachings.</P>
<P>The association with the mind is stable and stays as long as life lasts.</P>
<P>The Teaching not associated with the mind wanes quickly</P>

of the bhikkhus in the attendence hall talking in polite language without

<P>Bhikkhus, seeing permanence in impermanence is a distortion of perceptions, 
thoughts and views. Seeing pleasantness in unpleasantness is a distortion of
