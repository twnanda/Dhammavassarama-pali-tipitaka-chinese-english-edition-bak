<P>Bhikkhus, one intends bodily intentions for oneself and on account of them, 
arises internal pleasant and unpleasant feelings. Others intend bodily 
intentions for him, and on account of them, arises internal pleasant and

<P>018.02. Bhikkhus, these four are the gains of a self. What four?</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in one gain of self, one's own intentions take effect not other's 
intentions. In another gain of self, other's intentions take effect not one's 
own intentions. In one gain of self, one's own intention as well as other's 
intentions take effect. In another gain of self, neither one's own intentions 
nor another's take effect.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these four are the gains of a self.</P>
<P>When this was said, venerable Sariputta said thus to The Blessed One:-</P>
<P>Venerable sir, I know the detailed exposition of this short exposition given 
by The Blessed One- There, venerable sir, in the gain of a self where one's own 
intentions take effect not another's, they themselves intend the disappearance 
from that body. There venerable sir, in the gain of a self where other's 
intentions take effect not one's own, others ãntend his disappearance from that 
body. There, venerable sir, in the gain of a self where one's own intentions and 
other's intentions take effect they, themselves as well as others intend the 
disappearance from that body. Venerable sir, in the gain of a self where neither 
one's own intentions nor another's intentions take effect - how should those 
gods be known?</P>
<P>Sariputta, they should be known as the gods reaching the sphere of neither 
perception nor non-perception.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, what is the reason that a certain sentient being disappearing 
from that body to return here and another sentient being disappearing from that 
body not to return here?</P>
<P>Here, Sariputta, a certain person not abandoning the bonds that bind him to 
the sensual world, here and now abides in the sphere of neither perception nor 
non-perception. He enjoys it, longs for it and prospers in it. Intent on it and 
abiding much in it dies not decreasing from it and is born with the gods of the 
sphere of neither perception nor non-perception. Disappearing from there he 
returns here.</P>
