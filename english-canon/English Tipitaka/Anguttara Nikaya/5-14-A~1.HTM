<P>Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu become an endurer? </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu endures cold, heat, hunger, thirst, the sting of 
gad flies and yellow flies, the heat and the hot air the touch of roughly 
enunciated words. Endures disagreeable rough sharp bodily feelings that ends 
life. Thus the bhikkhu becomes an endurer. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu become a goer? </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu quickly goes in that direction, not yet gone in 
this long line of existences, such as the appeasing of all determinations, 
giving up all substratum, destroying craving, disenchantment, cessation and 
extinction. Thus the bhikkhu becomes a goer. Bhikkhus, endowed with these five 
things the bhikkhu becomes suitable for veneration, hospitality, gifts and to be 
venerated with clasped hands, the incomparable field of merit for the world.
