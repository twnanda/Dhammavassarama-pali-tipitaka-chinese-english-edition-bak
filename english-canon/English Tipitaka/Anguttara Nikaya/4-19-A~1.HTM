<P>019.01. Bhikkhus, endowed with four things the soldier becomes royal property 
and royal by the sign. What four?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the soldier becomes skilled in taking the right position, 
shooting from a distance, shooting at the right moment and breaking down a huge 
mass.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, endowed with these four things the soldier becomes royal property 
and royal by the sign.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in the same manner the bhikkhu endowed with four things becomes 
reverential, . . . . re. . . . the field of merit for the world. What four?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu becomes skilled in taking the right position, 
shooting from a distance, shooting at the right moment and breaking down a huge 
mass.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu become skilled in taking the right 
position?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu becomes virtuous . . . . re. . . . observing the 
restraints. Thus the bhikkhu becomes skillled in taking the right position.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu shoot from a distance?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu sees with right insight as it really is, that all 
matter in the past, future or present, internal or external, rough or fine, 
unexalted or exalted, far or near is not mine, am not in it, it's not my self. 
That all feelings in the past, future or present, internal or external, rough or 
fine, unexalted or exalted, far or near are not mine, am not in them, they are 
not my self. That all perceptions in the past, future or present, internal or 
external, rough or fine, unexalted or exalted, far or near are not mine, am not 
in them, they are not my self. That all determinations in the past, future or 
present, internal or external, rough or fine, unexalted or exalted, far or near 
are not mine, am not in them, they are not my self. That all consciousness in 
the past, future or present, internal or external, rough or fine, unexalted or 
exalted, far or near are not mine, am not in them, they are not my self. Thus 
the bhikkhu shoots from a distance.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu shoot at the right moment?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu knows as it really is, this is unpleasant, this 
is the arising of unpleasantness, this is the cessation of unpleasantness and 
this is the path leading to the cessation of unpleasantness. Thus the bhikkhu 
shoots at the right moment.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu break up a huge mass?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu breaks open a huge mass of ignorance. Thus the 
bhikkhu breaks up a huge mass.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu endowed with these four things becomes reverential, . . 
. . re. . . . the field of merit for the world.</P></FONT><B><FONT

thus to The Blessed One:-</P>
<P>Good Gotama, am of this view and say it; if someone seeing a form, says I saw

these words, there is nothing wrong in it. If someone cognizing a smell, taste 
or touch says I cognized this touch, there is nothing wrong in it. If someone 
cognizing an idea says I cognized this idea, there is nothing wrong in it.</P>
<P>Brahmin, I do not say that you should talk about all that you see, nor do I 
say that you should not talk about all that you see. Brahmin, I do not say that

<P>Brahmin, when you talk of what you saw if demeritorious things increase and 
meritorious things decrease that seen, should not be told. Brahmin, when you 
talk of what you saw if demeritorious things decrease and meritorious things 
increase that seen should be told. Brahmin, when you talk of what you heard if

<P>Brahmin, which one fears and trembles death?</P>
<P>Here, Brahmin, a certain one with not dispelled greed, interest, love, thirst

him:- I will have to give up my sensual pleasures. He grieves, worries, wails,

<P>019.05. At one time The Blessed One was living among the Gijja peaks in 
Rajagaha. At that time many well known wandering ascetics were living in the 
monastery of the wandering ascetics on the bank of river Sappinie. Some of them 
were Annabhara, Varadhara and Sakuludayi,</P>
<P>The Blessed One getting up from his seclusion in the evening, approached the 
monastery of the wandering ascetics. At that time the wandering ascetics were 
assembled and seated and discussing the truths of the Brahmins.</P>
<P>The Blessed One approached the wandering ascetics, sat on the prepared seat 
and addressed the wandering ascetics:-</P>
<P>Wandring ascetics, with what talk were you, assembled and seated here and 
what were the alternate topics?</P>
<P>Good Gotama, we assembled and seated here, were talking about the truths of 
Brahmins.</P>
<P>Wandering ascetics, these four are the truths of Brahmins by me realized and 
declared. What four?</P>
<P>Here, wandering ascetics the Brahmins said thus:- All living things are not 
to be destroyed These words of the Brahmins are true and real. By that one 
should not think, am a recluse, a Brahmin, or am superior, there is no compare 
to me, there is no inferior one to me. Yet realizing that truth he should fall 
to the method of showing loving kindness and compassion to living things.</P>
<P>Again, wandering ascetics the Brahmins said thus:- All sensuality is 
impermanent, unpleasant, changing thingsòhese words of the Brahmins are true and 
real. By that one should not think, am a recluse, a Brahmin, or am superior, 
there is no compare to me, there is no one inferior to me. Yet realizing that 
truth he should fall to the method of turning away from, disenchantment from and 
cessation of sensuality.</P>
<P>Again,wandering ascetics the Brahmins said thus:- All being is impermanent, 
unpleasant, changing things These words of the Brahmins are true and real. By

<P>Again, wandering ascetics the Brahmins said thus:- I have no bonds towards 
anyone, and have no attachments to anything. These words of the Brahmins are

<P>019.06. Then a certain bhikkhu approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on 
a side and said:- Venerable sir, how is the world led on? By what is the world 
worried? Where is the authority born?</P>
<P>Bhikkhu, your devious path is good, intelligence is good the question is 
excellent. Bhikkhu do you ask, venerable sir, how is the world led on? By what 
is the world worried? And where is the authority born?</P>
<P>Yes, venerable sir.</P>
<P>Bhikkhu, the world is led on by the mind. By the mind it is worried. And the 
authority is born in the mind.</P>
<P>He appreciated and agreed with the words of The Blessed One and asked a 
further question. Venerable sir, it is said a learned bearer of the Teaching. 
Venerable sir, who is a learned bearer of the teaching?</P>
<P>Bhikkhu, your devious path is good, intelligence is good the question is 
excellent. Bhikkhu do you ask, who is a learned bearer of the Teaching?</P>
<P>Yes, venerable sir.</P>
<P>Bhikkhu, I have declared a lot of the Teaching -discourses, prose and verse 
sections, question and answer explanations, verses, solemn utterances, thus said 
sayings, birth stories, wonderful things and series of questions and answers. 
Bhikkhu, even a verse of four lines is enough to know the meaning and the 
Teaching, and living accordingly to become a learned bearer of the Teaching, 
quite appropriate to the words.</P>
<P>He appreciated and agreed with the words of The Blessed One and asked a 
further question. Venerable sir, it is said, the learned one with penetrating 
wisdom. How is one learned and with penetrating wisdom?</P>
<P>Bhikkhu, your devious path is good, intelligence is good the question is 
excellent. Bhikkhu do you ask, how is the learned one with penetrating 
wisdom?</P>
<P>Yes, venerable sir.</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhu, the bhikkhu has heard, this is unpleasant, he penetratingly 
sees its meaning with wisdom. He has heard, this is the arising of 
unpleasantness. He penetratingly sees its meaning with wisdom. He has heard this 
is the cessation of unpleasantness. He penetratingly sees its meaning with 
wisdom. He has heard, this is the path leading to the cessation of 
unpleasantness. He penetratingly sees its meaning with wisdom. Thus the bhikkhu 
becomes a learned one with penetrating wisdom.</P>
<P>He appreciated and agreed with the words of The Blessed One and asked a 
further question. Venerable sir, it is said, the wise one with great wisdom. How 
is one wise and with great wisdom?</P>
<P>Bhikkhu, your devious path is good, intelligence is good the question is 
excellent. Bhikkhu do you ask, how is the wise one with great wisdom?</P>
<P>Yes, venerable sir.</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhu, the wise one with great wisdom does not think to oppress 
himself, to oppress others, or oppress either. Thinks with compassion towards 
all the world. Bhikkhu, thus the wise one is with great 
wisdom.</P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>

<P>Good Gotama, at one time the associates of the Brahmin Todeyya aroused a 
hostility to king Eleyya. King Eleyya is foolish that he is pleased with the 
recluse Ramaputta. He reveres the recluse Ramaputta in the form of worshipping, 
attending on, clasping the hands in veneration and maintaining a mutual 
understanding. The attendants of king Eleyya, Yamaka Moggalla, Ugga Navindaki, 
and Gandhabba Aggivessa too are foolish that they are pleased with the recluse 
Ramaputta. They revere the recluse Ramaputta in the form of worshipping,

<P>The Brahmin Todeyya leads the hostility thus- Good ones, do you think king 
Eleyya is wise in the management of his affairs, in the way he expresses 
himself, and in the way he attends to royal matters?</P>

<P>Upaka, someone arousing a hostility does not produe it and he becomes

<P>Venerable sir, it is like someone even while emerging is caught in a big

words.</P>
<P>Upaka, I have shown what is demerit, in innumerable words and letters and the

<P>Bhikkhus, this Community of bhikkhus is not neglectful, free from prattle,

reverential, suitable for hospitality, gifts and for reverence with clasped

a Community of bhikkhus is of much value, and more valuable when a bigger gift 
is given. It is good to go a long distance with provisions for the journey to 
see such a Community of bhikkhus. Bhikkhus, this is such a Community of

<P>Bhikkhus, in this Community there are bhikkhus who partake, heavenly bliss,
