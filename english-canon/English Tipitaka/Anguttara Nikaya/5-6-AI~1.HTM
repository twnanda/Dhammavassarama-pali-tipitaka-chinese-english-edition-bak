<P>006.01. I heard thus. At one time The Blessed One was living in the monastery 
offered by Anathapindika in Jeta's grove in Savatthi and The Blessed One 
addressed the bhikkhus. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these five are obstacles, over growths the things that weaken 
wisdom. What five? </P>
<P>Sensual desires, anger, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry and doubts 
are obstacles, mental over growths, the things that weaken wisdom. . </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, that the bhikkhu should know his own good, the good of others or 
the good of both or will know and realize something noble above human without 
dispelling without making weak wisely considering the danger, of the obstacles 
sensual desires, anger, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry and doubts is 
not a possibility. Like a man opening the forrowed mouths of the ploughed field 
to a river with a long course from the top of the mountain, moving swiftly, with 
a weight. Then bhikkhus, in the middle, the stream gets scattered and disturbed 
and does not go far, move fast or take much weight. In the same manner the 
bhikkhu should know his own good, the good of others or the good of both or will 
know and realize something noble above human without dispelling without making 
weak without wisely considering the danger, of the obstacles sensual desires, 
anger, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry and doubts is not a possibility.

<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu has faith, in the enlightenment of the Thus Gone

sicknesses, has a good digesting order, not too hot nor too cold, suitable for 
making endeavour, is not crafty or deceitful, manifests to the Teacher or

<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is decayed and overcome by decay. This is the

<P>Again, bhikkhus,the bhikkhu is ill and is overcome by illness. This is the 
second time not suitable to make effort</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus there is a famine and grains become rare and it becomes 
impossible to collect even scraps. This is the third time not suitable to make 
effort</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus there is a time of fear from invading forest tribes on 
wheels. This is the fourth time not suitable to make effort </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the Community of bhikkhus break up. When the Community of 
bhikkhus break up, they blame each other, debase each other and get enclosed in 
small sections and reject certain sections. The displeased do not become 
pleased, some of those pleased go away. This is the fifth time not suitable to 
make effort</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these five are the suitable times to make effort. What five?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is young, in the prime of youth with black hair. 
This is the first time, suitable to make effort</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus,the bhikkhu is with few ailments, endowed with a good 
digestive system, not too cold, nor too hot, a suitable one to make endeavour 
This is the second time suitable to make effort</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus there is a time with plenty of food and grains and it becomes 
possible to collect food no doubts about scraps. This is the third time suitable 
to make effort</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus the people live united seeing each other with friendly eyes, 
mixing like milk and water. This is the fourth time suitable to make effort </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the united Community of bhikkhus live in concord not blaming 
each other, not debasing each other and not in small sections rejecting each 
other. The displeased become pleased and the pleased become more pleased. This

<P>006.05. At one time The Blessed One abode in the monastery offered by 
Anathapindika in Jeta's grove in Savatthi. At that time both mother and son a 
bhikkhu and bhikkhuni had observed the rains in Savatthi. They constantly 
desired each others sight. The mother desired to see the son and the son desired 
to see the mother. The two seeing each other constantly, a relationship began 
and with the relationship confidence got established and they approached each 
other Fallen in love for each other without giving up robes, they secretly had 
sexual intercourse. </P>
<P>Then many bhikkhus approached The Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side 
and those bhikkhus said to The Blessed One:- Here venerable sir, a mother and 
son a bhikkhu and bhikkhuni had observed the rains in Savatthi. They constantly 
desired each others sight. The mother desired to see the son and the son desired 
to see the mother. The two seeing each other constantly, a relationship began 
and with the relationship confidence got established and they approached each 
other Fallen in love for each other without giving up robes, they secretly had 
sexual intercourse. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, does the foolish man think the mother would not crave for the son 
or the son for the mother? Bhikkhus, I do not know of any other form so 
enticing, desirable, intoxicating, binding and causing infatuation and so 
dangerous for the noble ending of unpleasantness as the form of the woman. 
Bhikkhus, sentient beings, attached, swooned, bound, infatuated and clinging to 
the form of the woman come to grief for a long time become subjective Bhikkhus, 
I do not know of any other sound, . . . re. . . any other smell,. . . re. . . 
any other taste,. . . re. . . any other touch so enticing, desirable, 
intoxicating, binding and causing infatuation and so dangerous for the noble 
ending of unpleasantness as the touch of the woman. Bhikkhus, sentient beings, 
attached, swooned, bound, infatuated and clinging to the touch of the woman come 
to grief for a long time having become subjective. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, when the woman is going, she takes hold of the man's mind, when 
standing, . . . re. . . when sitting, . . . re. . . . when lying, . . . re. . . 
. . when laughing, . . . re. . . when talking, . . . re. . . when singing, . . . 
re. . . . when crying, . . . re. . . when struck,. . . . re. . . and even when 
dead she takes hold of the man's mind. Bhikkhus, saying it correctly, the woman 
is an all round snare of Death. Bhikkhus, I do not know of any other form so 
enticing, desirable, intoxicating, binding and causing infatuation and so 
dangerous for the noble ending of unpleasantness as the form of the woman.

<P>The woman talks to one with sword in hand and even to a sprite,</P>
<P>Gets mixed up even with snake poison, which if stings would die. </P>
<P>A woman does not speak with only one, </P>
<P>Gets hold of the confused with a glance and smile,</P>
<P>Or showing the body or with charming words</P>
<P>Even the very pure are struck and fall</P>
<P>The five strands of sense pleasures are seen in the woman,</P>
<P>As forms, sounds, tastes, smells and touches,</P>
<P>And someone is unknowingly carried away by the floods of sensuality </P>
<P>To go on in existences, in time, in births being and not being </P>
<P>Those who thoroughly know sensuality abide without fear,</P>
<P>They have gone beyond this world, destroying desires. </P></FONT><B><FONT

<P>006.06. A certain bhikkhu approached his preceptor and said:- Venerable sir, 
now my body is out of control, the directions are not clearly visible to me. The 
Teaching does not occur to me. My mind is overcome by sloth and torpor. I lead 
the holy life discontented and I have doubts about the Teaching. </P>
<P>Then that bhikkhu took his associate bhikkhu to The Blessed One, worshipped 
sat on a side and said to The Blessed One:- Venerable sir, this bhikkhu says:- 
Venerable sir, now my body is out of control, the directions are not clearly 
visible to me. The Teaching does not occur to me. My mind is overcome by sloth 
and torpor. I lead the holy life discontented and I have doubts about the 
Teaching. </P>
<P>Bhikkhu, it is so. To one with uncontrolled mental faculties, to one who does 
not know the right amount to eat, not yoked to wakefulness, not insightful of 
meritorious things and to one who abides not yoked to development of mind in the 
enlightenment factors in the late and early hours of the night, it so happens. 
His body goes out of control, directions do not become clearly visible to him. 
The Teaching does not occur to him and his mind overcome with sloth and torpor, 
he leads the holy life discontented and he has doubts. Therefore, bhikkhu you 
should train thus:- I will control my mental faculties. I will know the right 
amount to eat. I will yoke myself to wakefulness, will be insightful of 
meritorious things and I will abide yoked to development of mind in the 
enlightenment factors in the late and early hours of the night. </P>
<P>That bhikkhu thus advised by The Blessed One, got up from his seat, 
worshipped and circumambulated The Blessed One and went away. Then that bhikkhu 
secluded and withdrawing from the crowd abode diligently to dispel. Before long 
he here and now by himself knew and realized the noble end of the holy life for 
which sons of clansmen rightfully leave the household and become homeless. He 
thoroughly knew birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived, what should be done 
is done, there is nothing more to wish. That bhikkhu became one of the arahants. 
</P>
<P>Then that bhikkhu, an arahant approached his preceptor and said:- Venerable 
sir, now my body is not out of control, the directions are clearly visible to 
me. The Teaching occurs to me. My mind is not overcome by sloth and torpor. I 
lead the holy life contented and I have no doubts about the Teaching. </P>
<P>Then that bhikkhu took his associate bhikkhu to The Blessed One, worshipped

visible to me. The Teaching occurs to me. My mind is not overcome by sloth and

</P>
<P>Bhikkhu, it is so. To one with controlled mental faculties, to one who knows 
the right amount to eat, to one yoked to wakefulness, is insightful of 
meritorious things and to one who abides yoked to development of mind in the 
enlightenment factors in the late and early hours of the night, it so happens. 
His body does not go out of control, directions become clearly visible to him. 
The Teaching occurs to him and his mind not overcome with sloth and torpor, he 
leads the holy life contented and he has no doubts. Therefore, bhikkhus you 
should train thus:- We will control our mental faculties. We will know the right 
amount to eat. We will yoke ourselves to wakefulness, we will be insightful of 
meritorious things and will abide yoked to development of mind in the 
enlightenment factors in the late and early hours of the night.

forth? </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, to sentient beings there's interest and greed for near and dear 
ones, delighted by which they misbehave by body, words and mind. To one
