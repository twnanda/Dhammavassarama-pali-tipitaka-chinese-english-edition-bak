<P align=center>9. Sãvathikasuttaü- A cemetery.</P></B></FONT><FONT 
face=Times_CSX+>
<P>025.09. Bhikkhus, these five are the dangers of a cemetery. What five? </P>
<P>It is impure, has evil smells, it is with fear, it is the dwelling of 
troublesome non-humans, it is the wailing place for many. Bhikkhus, these five 
are the dangers of a cemetery. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in the same manner these are the five dangers of a person 
comparable to a cemetery. What five? </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain person is endowed with impure bodily, verbal and 
mental activity. This I say, is his impurity. Bhikkhus, just as that cemetery is 
impure, so also is this person. </P>
<P>Ill fame spreads of that person who has impure bodily, verbal and mental 
activity. This I say, is his evil smell. As the cemetery smells, so too this 
person. </P>
<P>The well behaved bhikkhus avoid this one endowed with impure bodily, verbal 
and mental activities from a distance, to that I say he is with fear. As the 
cemetery is with fear, so also this person. </P>
<P>This person with impure bodily, verbal and mental activity associates a 
person, of the same category. This I say, is the troublesome living together. As 
the cemetery is dwelling of troublesome non-humans, so also this person's 
dwelling. </P>
<P>The well behaved bhikkhus, seeing this person with impure bodily, verbal and 
mental activities turn away from him -thinking O! it is unpleasant to live with 
such a person. That I say, is the wailing. Bhikkhus, just as the cemetery is the 
wailing place of many, so also is this person. Bhikkhus, these five are the 
dangers of a person comparable to a cemetery. </P></FONT><B><FONT

face=Times_CSX+>
<P>025.10. Bhikkhus, these five are the dangers for favouring a person. What 
five? </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, if a certain person is favoured by a person he falls to a certain 
ecclesiastical offence, on account of which the Community has to suspend him. 
Then it occurs to him:- That person favoured by us, is suspended by the 
Community. Displeasure arises among the bhikkhus and they do not associate other 
bhikkhus. As a result they do not hear the Teaching and they deteriorate in the 
Teaching. Bhikkhus, this is the first danger in favouring a person. . . </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, if a certain person is favoured by a person he falls to a 
certain ecclesiastical offence, on account of which the Community makes him sit 
at the end. Then it occurs to him:- That person favoured by us, is suspended by 
the Community. Displeasure arises among the bhikkhus and they do not associate 
other bhikkhus. As a result they do not hear the Teaching and they deteriorate 
in the Teaching. Bhikkhus, this is the second danger in favouring a person. </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, if a certain person is favoured by a person and he becomes 
unsteady, . . . re. . . confused in mind,. . . re. . . . or diesòhen it occurs:- 
That person favoured by us, has died. Displeasure arises among the bhikkhus and 
they do not associate other bhikkhus. As a result they do not hear the Teaching 
and they deteriorate in the Teaching. Bhikkhus, this is the fifth danger in 
favouring a person. Bhikkhus, these five are the dangers for favouring a person.
