friendly greetings, sat on a side and said:- Friend, Ananda, you appoint the 
dispelling of greed, dispelling of hate and the dispelling of delusion. We too 
appoint the dispelling of greed, dispelling of hate and the dispelling of 
delusion. Friend, Ananda, seeing what danger in greed, do you appoint its 
dispelling. Seeing ..re....in hate...re... and seeing what danger in delusion do 
you appoint its dispelling? </P>
<P>Friend, a greedy person, overcome by greed, consumed by greed thinks to harm 
himself, thinks to harm others Thinks to harm both and feeling displeased 
becomes unpleasant. When the greed fades does not think to harm himself, to harm 
others, or to harm either and does not feel displeased or unpleasant.</P>
<P>Friend, a greedy person, overcome by greed, consumed by greed misbehaves by 
body, speech and mind, when the greed fades does not misbehave by body, speech 
or mind.</P>
<P>Friend, a greedy person, overcome by greed, consumed by greed, does not know 
his own good, does not know the good of another and does not know the good of 
either. When the greed fades, he knows his own good as it really is. Knows the 
good of others as it really is and knows the good of both as it really is </P>
<P>Friend, greed is darkness, blindness, foolishness. It ceases wisdom, it's 
destructive and not conducive to extinction. </P>
<P>Friend, an angry person, overcome by anger, consumed by anger thinks to harm 
himself, thinks to harm others Thinks to harm both and feeling displeased 
becomes unpleasant. When the anger fades does not think to harm himself, to harm 
others, or to harm either and does not feel displeased or unpleasant.</P>

his own good, does not know the good of another and does not know the good of 
either. When the anger fades, he knows his own good as it really is. Knows the 
good of others as it really is and knows the good of both as it really is </P>
<P>Friend, anger is darkness, blindness, foolishness. It ceases wisdom, it's 
destructive and not conducive to extinction. </P>
<P>Friend, a deluded person, overcome by delusion, consumed by delusion thinks 
to harm himself, thinks to harm others Thinks to harm both and feeling 
displeased becomes unpleasant. When the delusion fades does not think to harm 
himself, to harm others, or to harm either and does not feel displeased or 
unpleasant.</P>
<P>Friend, a deluded person, overcome by delusion, consumed by delusion 
misbehaves by body, speech and mind, when the delusion fades does not misbehave

is </P>
<P>Friend, delusion is darkness, blindness, foolishness. It ceases wisdom, it's

<P>Friend, seeing these dangers in greed I appoint the dispelling of greed, 
seeing these dangers in hate I appoint the dispelling of hate, seeing these 
dangers in delusion, I appoint the dispelling of delusion.</P>
<P>Friend, is there a path and method for the dispelling of greed, hate and 
delusion? </P>
<P>Friend, there is a path and method for the dispelling of greed, hate and 
delusion.</P>
<P>Friend, what is the path and method for the dispelling of greed, hate and 
delusion?</P>
<P>Friend, it is this same noble eightfold path such as right view, right 
thoughts, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right endeavour, right 
mindfulness and right concentration.</P>
<P>Friend, the path and method is good and it is suitable to be diligent.</P>
<P>2. ~Ajãvakasuttaü- A disciple who lead a peculiar livelihood</P>
<P>73.At one time venerable Ananda was living in Gosita's monastery in Kosambi. 
Then a certain householder a disciple of a sect that live a pecular livelihood 
approached venerable Ananda, worshipped, sat on a side and said to venerable 
Ananda:- </P>
<P>Venerable sir, Ananda, how is the Teaching well declared, in the world, who 
are those fallen to the right method and who are the well gone? </P>
<P>Householder, I will cross question you on this and you may reply as it 
pleases you. -Householder, there is the Teaching for dispelling greed, for 
dispelling hatred and for dispelling delusion. Householder, is that Teaching, 
for the dispelling of greed, hate and delusion well declared or not or how does 
it occur to you? </P>
<P>Venerable sir, the Teaching, for the dispelling of greed, hate and delusion 
is well declared it occurs to me thus. </P>
<P>Householder, those fallen to the method of dispelling greed, hate and 
delusion, have they fallen to the right method, or not or how does it occur to 
you? </P>
<P>Venerable sir, those fallen to the method of dispelling greed, hate and 
delusion have fallen to the right method, it occurs to me thus. </P>
<P>Householder, if their, greed is dispelled, pulled out with the roots, made 
palm stumps, made things that would not rise again, hate is dispelled, pulled 
out with the roots, made palm stumps, made things that would not rise again, 
delusion is dispelled, pulled out with the roots, made palm stumps, made things 
that would not rise again, are they well gone in this world or not or how does 
it occur to you?</P>
<P>Venerable sir, those whose greed is dispelled, pulled out with the roots, 
made palm stumps, made things that would not rise again, hate is dispelled, 
pulled out with the roots, made palm stumps, made things that would not rise 
again, delusion is dispelled, pulled out with the roots, made palm stumps, made 
things that would not rise again, they are well gone in this world, it occurs to 
me thus. </P>
<P>Thus, you yourself has said -Venerable sir, the Teaching, for the dispelling 
of greed, hate and delusion is well declared. Venerable sir, those fallen to the 
method of dispelling greed, hate and delusion have fallen to the right 
method.Venerable sir, those whose greed is dispelled, pulled out with the roots, 
made palm stumps, made things that would not rise again, hate is dispelled, 
pulled out with the roots, made palm stumps, made things that would not rise 
again, delusion is dispelled, pulled out with the roots, made palm stumps, made 
things that would not rise again, are well gone in this world</P>
<P>Venerable sir, it is wonderful and surprising, neither the teaching was 
praised nor another teaching debased, the teaching with the meaning was given in 
the right setting and the essential was carried across.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, your teaching is for dispelling greed, dispelling hatred and 
dispelling delusion and it is well declared. You have fallen to the method of 
dispelling greed, dispelling hate and dispelling delusion and have fallen to the 
right method. Your greed is dispelled, pulled out with the roots, made palm 
stumps, made things that would not grow again. Hate is dispelled ...re... 
Delusion is dispelled, pulled out with the roots, made palm stumps, made things 
that would not grow again and you are well gone in the world.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, I understand. It is like something overturned is reinstated. 
As the path is told to someone who has lost his way. As an oil lamp is lighted 
for the darkness for those have sight to see forms. Venerable sir, Ananda, now I 
take refuge in the Blessed One, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. I 
am a lay disciple who has taken refuge from today until life lasts. </P>
<P>3. Mahanama Sakkasuttaü -To Mahanama the Sakya.</P>
<P>74.At one time the Blessed One lived in Nigrodha's monastery in the country 
of the Sakyas. At that time the Blessed One had just recovered from an illness. 
Mahanama the Sakya approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and 
said to the Blessed One:-Venerable sir, a long time ago, I remember the Blessed 
One saying, knowledge is to the concentrated, not to the distracted. Venerable 
sir, is concentration first and then knowledge, or knowledge first and then 
concentration?</P>
<P>Then it occured to venerable Ananda:- The Blessed One has just recovered from 
an illness and the Sakya Mahanama is asking a very deep question. What if I lead 
the Sakya Mahanama aside and explain it to him?</P>
<P>Venerable Ananda, held the Sakya Mahanama by the arm and led him away and 
said to him:-Mahanama, the Blessed One has told the virtues of a trainer and the 
virtues of one gone beyond the training. Has told the concentration of a trainer 
and the concentration of one gone beyond the training. Has told the wisdom of a 
trainer and the wisdom of one gone beyond the training. </P>
<P>Mahanama, what are the virtues of a trainer?</P>
<P>Here Mahanama, the bhikkhu becomes virtuous observing the higher code of 
rules..re {II. 4&amp;5} These are the virtues of a trainer. </P>
<P>Mahanama, what is the concentration of a trainer? </P>
<P>Here Mahanama the bhikkhu secluded from sensual thoughts....re... attains to 
the fourth jhana Mahanama, this is the concentration of a trainer. </P>
<P>Mahanama, what is the wisdom of a trainer? </P>
<P>Mahanama, the trainer knows as it really is, this is 
unpleasant....re.....knows as it really is, this is the path to the cessation of 
unpleasantness. Mahanama, this is the wisdom of the trainer.</P>
<P>Mahanama, the noble disciple become virtuous in this manner, concentrated in 
this manner and become wise in this manner destroys desires, releasing the mind 
and released through wisdom, here and now realizes the deep knowledge by himself 
and abides. Thus Mahanama, the Blessed One has told the virtues of a trainer and 
the virtues of one gone beyond the training. Concentration of a trainer and the 
concentration of one gone beyond the training. The wisdom of a trainer and the 
wisdom of one gone beyond the training. </P>
<P>4. Niganñasuttaü-To the Nigantas</P>
<P>75.At one time venerable Ananda was living in the gabled hall in the great 
forest in Vesali. The Licchavi Abhaya and the Licchavi Paõóitakumara approached 
venerable Ananda, worshipped, sat on side and the Licchavi Abhaya said:- 
Venerable sir, Nigaõñanataputta acknowledges he is all knowing and all seeing 
and acknowledges his knowledge and vision is complete- and says my knowledge and 
vision is always arranged and established whether walking, standing, lying or 
awake. He appoints the finishing of earlier done actions with austerities, and 
the breaking down of the bridge, not doing new actions. Thus with the 
destruction of action, the destruction of unpleasantness. With the destruction 
of unpleasantness, the destruction of feelings. With the destruction of feelings 
the destruction of all unpleasantness. Thus the decay which is here and now is 
transcended by purity. Venerable sir, what does the Blessed One say about this? 
</P>
<P>Abhaya, these three are the purities through decay, rightfully announced by 
the Blessed One who knows and sees, is worthy and rightfully enlightened. It is 
for the purity of beings, for overcoming grief and lament, for going beyond 
unpleasantness and displeasure and for gaining knowledge and realizing 
extinction. What three? </P>
<P>Here, Abhaya, the bhikkhu becomes virtuous observing the higher code of 
rules. He does no new action and while feeling he finishes actions done earlier, 
here and now causing them to decay. [1] It is not a matter of time, inviting to 
inspection, leading inwards and to be realized by the wise by themselves. </P>
<P>Abhaya, the bhikkhu become thus virtuous secludes the mind from sensual and 
evil thoughts, with thoughts and thought processes and with joy and pleasantness 
born of seclusion attains to the first jhana. Allaying thoughts and thought 
processes and the mind internally appeased and brought to one point, without 
thoughts and thought processes and with joy and pleasantness born of 
concentration attains to the second jhana. With detachment to joy abides in 
equanimity. Mindful and aware experiences pleasantness too with the body. This 
is the third jhana, to this the noble ones say mindfully abiding in pleasantness 
with equanimity. Giving up pleasantness and unpleasantness and earlier gone 
beyond pleasure and displeasure and experiencing neither the pleasant nor the 
unpleasant by purifying mindfulness with equanimity attains to the forth jhana. 
He does no new action and while feeling he finishes actions done earlier, here 
and now causing them to decay. [1] It is not a matter of time, inviting to 
inspection, leading inwards and to be realized by the wise by themselves. </P>
<P>Abhaya, the bhikkhu become thus virtuous and thus concentrated pursues the 
destruction of desires. He knows as it really is, this is unpleasant. Knows as 
it really is, this is the arising of unpleasantness. Knows as it really is, this 
is the cessation of unpleasantness and knows as it really is, this is the path 
to the cessation of unpleasantness. He knows, these are desires, this is the 
arising of desires, this is the cessation of desires and he knows as it really 
is, this is the path leading to the cessation of desires. When he knows and sees 
thus his mind is released, from sensual desires, from desires to be, and from 
delusionóestroying desires and the mind released, and released through wisdom 
abides He does no new action and while feeling he finishes actions done earlier, 
here and now causing them to decay. [1] It is not a matter of time, inviting to 
inspection, leading inwards and to be realized by the wise by themselves. 
Abhaya, these three are the purities through decay, rightfully announced by the 
Blessed One who knows and sees, is worthy and rightfully enlightened. It is for 
the purity of beings, for overcoming grief and lament, for going beyond 
unpleasantness and displeasure and for gaining knowledge and realizing 
extinction.</P>
<P>When this was said the Licchavi Paõóitakumara said to the Licchavi Abhaya:- 
Friend, Abhaya, do you not appreciate the good words of venerable Ananda?</P>
<P>Friend, how could I not appreciate the good words of venerable Ananda, if I 
do even my head would split. </P>
<P>Notes. 1. He does no new action and while feeling finishes actions done 
earlier, here and now causing them to decay. `so nava¤ca kammaü na karoti 
purànaü ca kammaü phussa phussa vyantikaroti sandiññhikà nijjarà' That is, with 
whatever circumstances he meets, he knows that they are the results of earlier 
done actions, whether pleasant or un-pleasant, so without making any new 
intentions for future action. he mindfully feels whatever circumstances he meets 
with and sees an end to all actions. </P>
<P>5öivesakasuttaü - Helping to get established</P>
<P>76.Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side. 
The Blessed One said thus to him:- Ananda, have compassion towards them who 
think should listen, whether, friends, co-associates, relations or blood 
relations. Ananda, in these three, they should be made to settle and get 
established. What three? </P>
<P>They should be settled and established in unwavering faith in the Enlightened 
One- That Blessed One is worthy, rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge 
and conduct, well gone, knower of the worlds, the incomparable tamer of those to 
be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed. Should be settled 
and established in unwavering faith in the Teaching- The Blessed One's Teaching 
is well declared, here and now, not a matter of time, inviting to inspection, 
leading inwards, is to be realized by the wise by themselves. Should be settled 
and established in unwavering faith in the Community of bhikkhus- The disciples 
of the Blessed One have come to the right method, straight method, the wise 
method and the method of mutual understanding. They are the four pairs of eight 
Great Men. These disciples of the Blessed One are worthy of hospitality, 
reverence, gifts and reverential saluation with clasped hands, the incomparable 
field of merit for the world</P>
<P>Ananda, there comes a change in the four great elements of earth, water, fire 
and air but there is no change to the noble disciple about his unwavering faith 
in the Blessed One. Therefore Ananda, there is no possibility that a noble 
disciple who has unwavering faith in the Blessed One should be born in hell, in 
the animal world or with ghosts, </P>
<P>Ananda, there comes a change in the four great elements of earth, water, fire 
and air but there is no change to the noble disciple about his unwavering faith 
in the Teaching. Ananda, ...re.... in the Community of bhikkhus. Therefore 
Ananda, there is no possibility that a noble disciple who has unwavering faith 
in the Community of bhikkhus should be born in hell, in the animal world or with 
ghosts.</P>
<P>Ananda, have compassion towards them who think should listen, whether, 
friends, co-associates, relations or blood relations. Ananda, in these three, 
they should be made to settle and get established.</P>
<P>6. Pañhamabhavasuttaü -The first on thinking </P>
<P>77.Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side. 
Then venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One:- Venerable sir, it is said, 
`being' what is its meaning? </P>
<P>Ananda, when the sensual element is mature if there will be no action, is `a 
senual being'[1] evident? </P>
<P>No, venerable sir.</P>
<P>Thus Ananda, in the field of action, the seed consciousness, moistened with 
craving of a sentient being shrouded by ignorance, the bond craving establishes 
consciousness in the lower element. Thus comes future rebirth. Ananda, this is 
being. </P>
<P>Ananda, when the material element is mature if there will be no action, is `a 
material being'[2] evident? </P>
<P>No, venerable sir. </P>
<P>Thus Ananda, in the field of action, the seed consciousness, moistened with 
craving of a sentient being shrouded by ignorance, the bond craving establishes 
consciousness in the middle element. Thus comes future rebirth. Ananda, this is 
being. </P>
<P>Ananda, when the immaterial element is mature if there will be no action, is 
`an immaterial being'[3] evident? </P>
<P>No, venerable sir.</P>
<P>Thus Ananda, in the field of action, the seed consciousness, moistened with 
craving of a sentient being shrouded by ignorance, the bond craving establishes 
consciousness in the exalted element. Thus comes future rebirth. Ananda, this is 
being.</P>
<P>Notes. 1. a sensual being `kàmabhavo' Being is to be with a thought. 
Kàmabhavo is to be with a sensual thought. The mature sensual element is a 
sentient being with his sensual elements matured. Ie his sight, hearing, smell, 
taste, and touch are mature to experience the world around him. Perhaps a 
toddler is capable of it. So if a sentient being is with a thought concerned 
with seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting or touching it is to be.with a sensual 
thought </P>
<P>2. a material being `råpabhavo' Råpabhavo is to be with a material thought. 
That is whatever he experiences through his mature sensual element, [observe 
note 1]üatters to him and he perceives in various ways A sentient being with a 
material thought has various, contacts, perceptions, feelings, intentions and 
attentions and they change his ways of thinking, speaking and acting</P>
<P>3. An immaterial being `aråpabhavo' It is an immaterial thought. Observe 
notes 1 &amp; 2 the sentient being finds the world around him overwhelmingly 
stressful and he seeks for some quietitude. May be in the jhanas which are very 
momentary or the four divine abidings which are also momentary. What he should 
seek are the paths and fruits. of the entry into the stream of the Teaching. The 
path and fruit, of returning once. The path and fruit of not returning, and the 
path and fruit of extinction. . </P>
<P>7. Dutiyabhavasuttaü -The second on thinking.</P>
<P>78.Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side. 
Then venerable Ananda said to the Blessed One:- Venerable sir, it is said, 
`being' what is its meaning? </P>
<P>Ananda, when the sensual element is mature if there will be no action, is `a 
senual being'evident? </P>
<P>No, venerable sir.</P>
<P>Thus Ananda, in the field of action, the seed consciousness, moistened with 
the craving of a sentient being shrouded by ignorance, the bond craving 
establishes intention and aspirations in the lower element. Thus comes future 
rebirth. Ananda, this is being. </P>
<P>Ananda, when the material element is mature if there will be no action, is `a 
material being' evident? </P>
<P>No, venerable sir. </P>
<P>Thus Ananda, in the field of action, the seed consciousness, moistened with 
craving of a sentient being shrouded by ignorance, the bond craving establishes 
intention and aspirations in the middle element. Thus comes future rebirth. 
Ananda, this is being. </P>
<P>Ananda, when the immaterial element is mature if there will be no action, is 
`an immaterial being' evident? </P>
<P>No, venerable sir.</P>
<P>Thus Ananda, in the field of action, the seed consciousness, moistened with 
craving of a sentient being shrouded by ignorance, the bond craving establishes 
intentions and aspirations in the exalted element. Thus comes future rebirth. 
Ananda, this is being. . </P>
<P>8 Sãlabbatasuttaü- The bond in virtues.</P>
<P>79. The same origin....re...... approached the Blessed One, worshipped and 
sat on a side. Then the Blessed One said to venerable Ananda:-Ananda, is the 
holy life bound with all its virtues attended to, bring fruitful results? </P>
<P>Venerable sir, it is not so, in a certain way.</P>
<P>If so Ananda, explain yourself..</P>
<P>Venerable sir, when practising the virtues in the holy life, if demeritorious 
thoughts increase and meritorious thoughts decrease practising such virtues are 
not fruitful.Venerable sir, when practising the virtues in the holy life, if 
demeritorious thoughts decrease and meritorious thoughts increase practising 
such virtues are fruitful. Saying it, venerable Ananda waited for the approval 
of the Teacher. </P>
<P>Then venerable Ananda knowing I am approved got up from his seat worshipped 
the Blessed One and circumambulating the Blessed One went away. </P>
<P>Soon after venerable Ananda had gone away, the Blessed One addressed the 
bhikkhus:- Bhikkhus, Ananda is a trainer.a comparison for his wisdom is rare. 
</P>
<P>9. Gandhajàtasuttaü -Scents.</P>
<P>80. Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side 
and said to the Blessed One:- Venerable sir, these three are the scents which go 
with the wind and not against the wind. What three? Nasty scents, the scent of 
the heart of trees and the scent of flowers. Venerable sir, these scents go with 
the wind and not against the wind. Venerable sir, is there a scent which goes 
with the wind and against the wind, a scent which goes both ways with and 
against the wind?</P>
<P>Ananda, there is a scent which goes with the wind and against the wind, a 
scent which goes both ways with and against the wind</P>
<P>Venerable sir, what is that scent which goes with the wind and against the 
wind, the scent which goes both ways with and against the wind?</P>
<P>Ananda, in a certain village or hamlet, there is a woman or man, who has 
taken refuge in the Enlightened One, in the Teaching and the Community of 
bhikkhus. He abstains from destroying living things, taking the not given, in 
misbehaving sexually, telling lies, and taking intoxicating drinks. He is 
virtuous, of good conduct, lives having put an end to the blemish of 
miserliness. He is benevolent, with ready hands to give to the needy, making 
arrangements to give gifts. Recluses and brahmins in all directions praise him:-

<P>Ananda, this is the scent which goes with the wind and against the wind, the 
scent which goes both ways with and against the wind.</P>
<P>The scents of flowers do not go against the wind, not of chandana, tagara or 
mallika</P>
<P>The scent of Great Beings go against the wind, it pervades all directions. 
</P>
<P>10. Cålanikàsuttaü-The thousandfold world system</P>
<P>81. Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side 
and said to the Blessed One:- Venerable sir, these words I heard from the 
Blessed One and are acknowledged by the Blessed One:- Ananda, Abhibhå, a 
disciple of the Blessed One Siki makes announcements to the thousandfold world 
systems at one and same time from the world of Brahma. Venerable sir, the 
Blessed One worthy and rightfully enlightened, making an announcement how far 
could you be heard?</P>
<P>Ananda, he is a disciple of an immeasurable number of Thus Gone Ones.</P>
<P>For the second time venerable Ananda said:-Venerable sir, these words I heard 
from the Blessed One and are acknowledged by the Blessed One:- Ananda, Abhibhå, 
a disciple of the Blessed One Siki makes announcements to the thousandfold world 
systems at one and same time from the world of Brahma. Venerable sir, the 
Blessed One worthy and rightfully enlightened, making an announcement how far 
could you be heard?</P>
<P>Ananda, he is a disciple of an immeasurable number of Thus Gone Ones.</P>
<P>For the third time venerable Ananda said :- Venerable sir, these words I 
heard from the Blessed One and are acknowledged by the Blessed One:- Ananda, 
Abhibhå, a disciple of the Blessed One Siki makes announcements to the 
thousandfold world systems at one and same time from the world of Brahma. 
Venerable sir, the Blessed One worthy and rightfully enlightened, making an 
announcement how far could you be heard?</P>
<P>Ananda, have you heard of the Cålanika thousandfold world system? </P>
<P>Venerable sir, Blessed One, Well Gone One, now is the time to hear it. The 
bhikkhus hearing it from the Blessed One will bear it . </P>
<P>Then Ananda, listen and attend carefully, I will tell</P>
<P>The Blessed One said:- Ananda, as long as the moon and sun illuminate the 
directions, till then the thousandfold world systems will prevail, with a 
thousand, moons, suns, Mahameru mountains, Indian peninsulars, Aparagoyanas, 
Uttarakurus, Pubhavidehas, fourfold oceans, fourfold rulers, fourfold guardian 
kings, heavens of the thirty three, heavens of Titan gods, heavens of happiness, 
heavens of the gods of creation, heavens of the gods who create others, worlds 
of Brahma. Ananda, to this is called the thousandfold Cålanika world system. 
Ananda, as long as the thousandfold Cålanika world system prevails till then the 
thousandfold world system, calls this the two thousandfold middle world system. 
Ananda, as long as the two thousandfold middle world element prevails till then 
the thousandfold world system calls this the three thousandfold and the great 
thousandfold world system. Ananda, if the Thus Gone One desires, he announces to 
the three thousandfold and the great thousandfold world system </P>
<P>Venerable sir, how does the Blessed One, if he desires announce to the three 
thousandfold and the great thousandfold world system? </P>
<P>Here Ananda, the Thus Gone One pervades the three thousandfold and the great 
thousandfold world system with an effulgent light, so that those sentient beings 
see it, then the Thus Gone One makes a sound. In this manner an announcement is 
made to the three thousandfold and the great thousandfold world system if he 
desires. </P>
<P>When this was said venerable Ananda said to venerable Udayi:- It is great 
gain for me that my Teacher is so powerful</P>
<P>When this was said venerable Udayi said:- Friend Ananda, what does it matter 
to you, when your Teacher is so powerful?</P>
<P>Udayi, do not say so. If Ananda passes away without freeing his mind from 
greed, on account of that pleasant mind, he will be ruler of gods for a hundred

will extinguish in this same life. </P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
