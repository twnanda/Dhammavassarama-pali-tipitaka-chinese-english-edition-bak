<P>16. A certain brahmin approached the Blessed One, exchanged friendly 
greetings and sat on a side. Then he said to the Blessed One:- Good Gotama, why 
are certain ones born in decrease, in a bad state in hell after death? Brahmin, 
on account of not adhering to the Teaching and misconducting themselves a 
certain one is born in decrease, in a bad state, in hell. Why are certain ones 
born in increase, in a good state in heaven after death? Brahmin, on account of 
adhering to the Teaching and conducting themselves a certain one is born in 
increase, in a good state, in heaven </P>
<P>Good Gotama, I understood, it is like something overturned is reinstated, it 
is like something is disclosed. It is like the path was told to someone who has 
lost his way, or like a lamp lighted for the darkness for those who have eyes to 
see forms. Good Gotama has explained the Teaching in various ways. Now I take 
refuge in the Blessed One in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus.
