<P>157. Bhikkhus, these three are the methods. What three? </P>
<P>The strong hard method, the method of wasting away, and the way of the middle 
path.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the hard method? </P>
<P>Here bhikkhus, a certain one holds this view and says- There is nothing wrong 
in indulging in sensual pleasures and they fall for sensual pleasures. Bhikkhus, 
this isthe hard method.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the wasting away method? </P>
<P>Here bhikkhus a certain one goes without clothes, without good manners licks 
the hand, does not invite anyone, or offer a meal, or accept what is brought. 
Does not accept a special preparation, or an invitation. Does not accept a 
serving from a pot, a cooking vessel, over a goat, a stick, or a broom. Does not 
accept when two are eating, from a woman bearing a child, giving suck, gone with 
a man, a soiled woman, a place where she is supported, or from a place where 
flies settle. Does not accept fish, meat, intoxicating drinks, brewd drinks and 
gruel. He supports himself going to one house, two houses, three houses, four 
houses, five houses, six houses or seven houses. He supports himself with what 
is brought by one, two, three, four, five, six or seven. He supports himself, 
thus arranged for two weeks. Then he eats vegetables, millets, raw rice, a kind 
of dark rice, a kind of water plant, finely broken rice, rice foam, sesamum 
flour, grass, cowdung, roots and fruits from the forest and whatever is picked. 
He wears garments of hemp, garments of coarse cloth interwoven with hemp, 
miserable garments, garments made of, the bark of trees, antelope hide, strips 
of antelope hide, strips of wood and owls' wings. He wears garments made of 
grass, blankets made of head hair and blankets made of horses' tail. He 
practises, pulling out hairs of the head and beard, standing as penance, 
rejecting seats and squatting as penance. He tortures himself with thorns, 
sleeping on thorns. He bathes up to the third time in the evening to make the 
water ablution. Thus he gives various kinds of torture to the body. This is the 
method of wasting away. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the middle path? </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu abides reflecting the body in the body mindful 
and aware to dispel covetousness and displeasure in the world. The bhikkhu 
abides reflecting the feelings in feelings mindful and aware to dispel 
covetousness and displeasure in the world. The bhikkhu abides reflecting the 
mental states in the mind mindful and aware to dispel covetousness and 
displeasure in the world. The bhikkhu abides reflecting thoughts in thoughts 
mindful and aware to dispel covetousness and displeasure in the world. Bhikkhus, 
this is the middle path. Bhikkhus, these are the three methods. </P>
<P>158. Bhikkhus, these three are the methods. What three? </P>
<P>The hard method, the method of wasting away, and the way of the middle 
path.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the hard method? </P>
<P>Here bhikkhus, a certain one holds this view and says- There is nothing wrong 
in indulging in sensual pleasures and they fall for sensual pleasures. Bhikkhus, 
this is the hard method.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the wasting away method? </P>

This is the method of wasting away. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the middle path? </P>
<P>Here bhikkhus, the bhikkhu arouses interest and effort and strains the mind 
for the non arising of not arisen demeritorious thoughts, arouses interest and

meritorious thoughts and the bhikkhu arouses interest and effort and strains the 
mind for the non confused establishment, development and completion of arisen 
meritorious thoughts. He develops the psychic power endowed with interest,

determinations. He develops the faculty of faith, the faculty of effort, the 
faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration and the faculty of wisdom..
