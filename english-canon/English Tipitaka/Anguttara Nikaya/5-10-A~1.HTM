pasture. He gives a careful blow to a horse, a buffalo, a cow, a leopard, even 
to a very small living thing, such as a hare. he gives a blow. What is the 
reason? May my purview not be destroyed. </P>

Bhikkhus, if the Thus Gone One teaches a gathering, it becomes his lion's roar. 
When the Thus Gone One teaches the bhikkhus, he does it with careful attention

attention. When the Thus Gone One teaches the male lay disciples he does it with 
careful attention. When the Thus Gone One teaches the female lay disciples he 
does it with careful attention. When the Thus Gone One teaches the ordinary folk 
he does it with careful attention. The Thus Gone One teaches even those carrying 
loads or waiting to hunt, even then he does it, with careful attention. What is 
the reason? Bhikkhus, the Thus Gone One reveres the Teaching and it is out of 
reverence for the Teaching. </P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>

<P>010.10. I heard thus. At one time The Blessed One was living in Gosita's 
monastery in Kosambi. At that time a son of the Koliyas named Kakudha attended 
on venerable Mahamoggallana and he had passed away recently. He was reborn as a 
spiritual being in the form of two or three Magadhan farmers in a field. With 
that spiritual form he does not trouble himself or others </P>
<P>Kakudha the son of gods approached venerable Mahamoggallana, worshipped and 
stood on a side and said to venerable Mahamoggallana:- This desire arose to 
Devadatta. `I will conduct the Community of bhikkhus. ' Venerable sir, as soon 
as that desire arose to him his psychic powers vanished. Saying this Kakudha the 
son of the gods worshipped venerable Mahamoggallana, circumambulated him and 
vanished. Then venerable Manamoggallana approached The Blessed One, worshipped 
and sat on a side and said to The Blessed One:- Venerable sir, the son of the 
Koliyas named Kakudha who attended on me passed away recently. He was reborn as 
a spiritual being in the form of two or three Magadhan farmers in a field. With 
that spiritual form he does not trouble himself or others </P>
<P>Kakudha the son of gods approached me, worshipped and stood on a side and 
said - This desire arose to Devadatta. `I will conduct the Community of 
bhikkhus. ' Venerable sir, as soon as that desire arose to him his psychic 
powers vanished. Saying this Kakudha the son of the gods worshipped me 
circumambulated me and vanished. Moggallana, have you penetrated and seen the 
mind of Kakudha, the son of the gods with your mind, and are his words the truth 
or is it different? ß Venerable sir, I have penetrated and seen the mind of 
Kakudha the son of the gods, and his words are real and not false. </P>
<P>Moggallana, be careful of those words. Here, the foolish man makes himself 
manifest. Moggallana, these five teachers are evident in the world. What five? 
</P>
<P>Here Moggallana, a certain Teacher is not virtuous and he acknowledges `I am 
virtuous, of pure virtues. His disciples know him thus our good teacher is not 
virtuous but he acknowledges, I am virtuous, my virtues are not blemished. We 
too will inform this to the lay people without destroying his pleasure. If he be 
displeased, how shall we abide? How will we get robes, morsel food, dwellings 
and requisites when ill. Whatever he does, he will be manifested by that. 
Moggallana, the disciples of such a teacher protect the virtues of the teacher. 
Such a teacher desires the protection of his virtues through his disiples. </P>
<P>Again, Moggallana, a certain Teacher is of impure livelihood and he 
acknowledges `My livelihood is pure and unblemished. His disciples know him thus 
our good teacher is not of right livelihood but he acknowledges, I am of right 
livelihood, it is not blemished. We too will inform this to the lay people 
without destroying his pleasure. If he be displeased, how shall we abide? How 
will we get robes, morsel food, dwellings and requisites when ill. Whatever he 
does, he will be manifested by that. Moggallana, the disciples of such a teacher 
protect the livelihood of the teacher. Such a teacher desires the protection of 
his livelihood through his disciples. </P>

acknowledges `My teaching is pure. His disciples know him thus our good 
teacher's way of teaching is impure, he acknowledges, my way of teaching is not 
impure and not blemished. We too will inform this to the lay people without 
destroying his pleasure. If he be displeased, how shall we abide? How will we 
get robes, morsel food, dwellings and requisites when ill. Whatever he does, he 
will be manifested by that. Moggallana, the disciples of such a teacher protect 
his way of teaching. Such a teacher desires the protection of his way of 
teaching through his disiples. </P>
<P>Again, Moggallana, a certain Teacher's explanations are wrong and he 
acknowledges `My explanations are correct and pure. His disciples know him thus 
our good teacher's explanations are wrong but he acknowledges, my explanations 
are correct. We too will inform this to the lay people without destroying his 
pleasure. If he be displeased, how shall we abide? How will we get robes, morsel 
food, dwellings and requisites when ill. Whatever he does, he will be manifested 
by that. Moggallana, the disciples of such a teacher protect the teacher's 
explanations. Such a teacher desires the protection of his explanations through

acknowledges `My knowledge and vision is pure. His disciples know him thus our 
good teacher's knowledge and vision is incorrect but he acknowledges, my 
knowledge and vision are not incorrect not blemished. We too will inform this to 
the lay people without destroying his pleasure. If he be displeased, how shall 
we abide? How will we get robes, morsel food, dwellings and requisites when ill. 
Whatever he does, he will be manifested by that. Moggallana, the disciples of 
such a teacher protect the teacher's knowledge and vision. Such a teacher 
desires the protection of his knowledge and vision through his disiples. </P>
<P>Moggallana, as for me, my virtues are pure, I acknowledge that my virtues are 
pure and unblemished. I am not protected for my virtues by my disciples and I do 
not expect that protection of virtues from my disciples. My livelihood is pure, 
I acknowledge that my livelihood is pure and unblemished. I am not protected for 
my livelihood by my disciples and I do not expect that protection of livelihood 
from my disciples. My method of teaching is pure, I acknowledge that my method 
of teaching is pure and unblemished. I am not protected for my method of 
teaching by my disciples and I do not expect that protection of the method of 
teaching from my disciples. My explanations are pure, I acknowledge that my 
explanations are pure and unblemished. I am not protected for my explanations by 
my disciples and I do not expect that protection from my disciples. My knowledge 
and vision is pure, I acknowledge the purity and unblemished nature of my 
knowledge and vision. I am not protected for my knowledge and vision by my 
disciples and I do not expect that protection from my disciples. </P>
