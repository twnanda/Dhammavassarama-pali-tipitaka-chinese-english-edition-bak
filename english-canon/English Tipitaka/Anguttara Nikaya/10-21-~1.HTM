<P>216. Bhikkhus, I will tell you the creeping low, listen and attend carefully. 
Bhikkhus, what is the Teaching wihich tells of creeping low?</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, beings are the owners, the inheritors, the origins, the relations 
and the refuges of their actions, whatever action done, good or evil- will be 
their inheritance. </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain one destroys living things, is cruel with bloody 
hands engaged in destroying living things. He creeps low with the body, with 
words and with the mind. His bodily actions are crooked, verbal actions are 
crooked and mental actions are crooked, he has a crooked course of actions and a 
crooked birth. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, I declare one of these two courses of actions to one with a crooked 
birth, either birth in hell with only unpleasantness, or birth as creeping 
things in the animal world. Who are the creeping things in the animal world? 
Snakes, scorpions, centipedes, mungooses, cats, mice and other small fourfooted 
animals who creep away seeing humans. Thus bhikkhus, the product causes birth to 
the producer. Whatever is done by that is born. To one born, those actions bring 
contacts. Therefore, bhikkhus, I say, beings are the inheritors of their 
actions. </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain one takes the not given, ...re...üisbehaves in 
sexual conduct, ...re...ñells lies, ....re... slanders, ...re...ñalks roughly, 
....re... talks frivolously, ....re.. covets, ...re... bears an angry mind,

by thenselves realizing declare it to this world. He creeps low with the body, 
with words and with the mind. His bodily actions are crooked, verbal actions are 
crooked and mental actions are crooked, he has a crooked course of actions and a 
crooked birth. </P>

<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain one abstains from destroying living things, 
shamefully throwing away stick and weapon abides with compassion for all living 
things.He does not creep low with the body, with words and with the mind. His 
bodily actions are straightforward, verbal actions are straightforward and 
mental actions are straightforward. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, I declare one of these two courses of actions to one with a 
straightforward birth, either birth in heaven with only pleasantness, or birth 
in a high clan of the warriors, Brahmins or householders with much wealth, 
resources grains and money Thus bhikkhus, the product causes birth to the 
producer. Whatever is done by that is born. To one born, those actions bring 
contacts. Therefore, bhikkhus, I say, beings are the inheritors of their 
actions. </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain one does not take the not given, ...re...óoes not 
misbehave sexually, ...re...óoes not tell lies, ....re... does not slander, 
...re...óoes not talk roughly, ....re... does not talk frivolously, ....re..
