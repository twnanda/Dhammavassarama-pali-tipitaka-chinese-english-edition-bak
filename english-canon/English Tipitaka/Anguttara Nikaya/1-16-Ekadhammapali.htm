<P>2. Dutiya Vagga</P>
<P>298. Bhikkhus, I do not know of any other thing that arouses non arisen 
demeritorious thoughts and develops arisen demeritorious thoughts as wrong view. 
Bhikkhus, to one with wrong view, not arisen demeritorious thoughts arise and 
arisen demeritorlious thoughts develop and get completed. </P>
<P>299. Bhikkhus, I do not know of any other thing that arouses non arisen 
meritorious thoughts and develops arisen meritorious thoughts as right view. 
Bhikkhus, to one with right view, not arisen meritorious thoughts arise and 
arisen meritorlious thoughts develop and get completed.</P>
<P>300. Bhikkhus, I do not know a single thing on account of which non arisen 
meritorious thoughts do not arise and arisen meritorious thoughts fade as wrong 
view. Bhikkhus to one with wrong view non arisen meritorious thoughts do not 
arise and arisen meritorious thoughts fade. .</P>
<P>301. Bhikkhus, I do not know a single thing on account of which non arisen 
demeritorious thoughts do not arise and arisen demeritorious thoughts fade as 
right view. Bhikkhus to one with right view non arisen demeritorious thoughts do 
not arise and arisen demeritorious thoughts fade. </P>
<P>302.Bhikkhus, I do not know a single thing on account of which non arisen 
wrong view arises and arisen wrong view develops as unwise thinking. Bhikkhus to 
one thinking unwisely non arisen wrong view arises and arisen wrong view 
develops</P>

<P>304. Bhikkhus, I do not know a single thing on account of which a person with 
wrong view, after death is born in decrease, in an evil birth, in hell, as wrong

in hell </P>

right view, after death is born in increase, in a good birth, in heaven, as 
right view. Bhikkhus a person with right view is born in increase, in a good 
birth, in heaven. </P>
<P>306. Bhikkhus, to a person with wrong view his bodily, verbal and mental 
actions would be guided according to the standard of attainment of his view, so 
too his intentions, wishes, aspirations and determinations. They would be 
unsuitable, disagreeable, and conducive to unpleasantness. What is the reason? 
It is because of his wrong view. Bhikkhus, just as a nimba seed, a kosataki seed 
or a bitter goad seed [1] embedded in wet soil would draw the essence in the 
soil and water and all that essence would be bitter. In the same manner the 
bodily, verbal, mental actions, intentions, wishes, aspirations and 
determinations of a person with wrong view, would be guided according to the 
standard of attainment of his view and they would be unsuitable, disagreeable 
and conducive to unpleasantness.</P>
<P>[1] nimba is a kind of tree and kosataki a kind of creeper, they both 
produces bitter tastes </P>

actions would be guided according to the standard of attainment of his view, so

suitable, agreeable, and conducive to pleasantness. What is the reason? It is 
because of his right view. Bhikkhus, just as a sugar cane seed, a paddy seed or 
a grape vine seed embedded in wet soil would draw the essence in the soil and 
water and all that essence would be unmixed and sweet. In the same manner the 
bodily, verbal, mental actions, intentions, wishes, aspirations and 
determinations of a person with right view, would be guided according to the 
standard of attainment of his view and they would be suitable, agreeable and 
conducive to pleasantness..</P>
<P>3. Tatiya vagga.</P>
<P>308. Bhikkhus, a certain person is born in the world for the harm, bad luck 
and unpleasantness of many gods and men. Who is it? It is one with wrong and 
perverted view. He pulls out many from right view and establishes them in wrong 
view. He is born in the world for the harm, bad luck and unpleasantness of many 
gods and men.</P>
<P>309.Bhikkhus, a certain person is born in the world for the welfare, good

and unperverted view. He pulls out many from wrong view and establishes them in 
right view. He is born in the world for the welfare, good luck and pleasantness 
of many gods and men. </P>
<P>310. Bhikkhus, I do not know of anything so seriously bad as wrong view. Of 
bad things, the worst is wrong view. </P>
<P>311. Bhikkhus, I do not know of any other person born in the world to cause 
such harm, unpleasantness and evil to many gods and men as this foolish man 
Makkhali. Just as a net cast at the mouth of a river is for the harm, bad luck 
and destruction of many fish, even so, I think he is born in the world for the 
harm, unpleasantness and bad luck of many gods and men.</P>
<P>312. Bhikkhus, if the Teaching and Discipline is incorrectly interpreted and 
caused to be observed much demerit is accrued both by the interpreter and those 
who observe it on account of the incorrct interpretation of the Teaching. </P>
<P>313. Bhikkhus, if the Teaching and Discipline is correctly interpreted and 
caused to be observed much merit is accrued both by the interpreter and those 
who observe it on account of the corrct interpretation of the Teaching. </P>
<P>314. Bhikkhus, when the Teaching and Discipline is incorrectly interpreted, 
the teacher should know the measure and not the listener, because of the 
incorrect interpretation of the teaching </P>
<P>315 Bhikkhus, when the Teaching and Discipline is correctly interpreted the 
listener should know the measure and not the teacher, because of the correct 
interpretation of the teaching</P>
<P>316.Bhikkhus, when the Teaching and Discipline is incorrectly interpreted, 
one with aroused effort abides in unpleasantness, because of the incorrcct 
interpretation of the teaching.</P>

<P>320. Bhikkhus, just as a little bit of excreta smells and should be got rid 
of, I do not specify thinking even for the fraction of a second.</P>
<P>321. Bhikkhus, just as a little bit of urine,…re… saliva,…re… pus,…re… blood 
smells and should be got rid of, I do not specify thinking{1) even for the 
fraction of a second. </P>
<P>Notes.</P>
<P>( 1) I do not specify thinking even for a short second. <I>`appamattakaüpi 
bhavaü na vaõõemi</I>' Always thoughts seek connections in the past, for the 
future or in the present. The bhikkhu who aims extinction should not advocte 
thinking, as thoughts prolong the journey in existence. </P>

<P>4. CatutthavaggaVagga. </P>
<P>322..Bhikkhus, in the peninsular of India there are a few pleasant orchards, 
forests, outstanding sites, stretches of water but many irregular blocks of 
land, irregular rivers flowing disorderly, forming uneven shapes. Even so, a few 
are born on land and many in the watery bed. </P>
<P>323. Bhikkhus, in the same manner a handful are born human and many more 
below humanity.</P>
<P>324. Bhikkhus, a few are born in the states imminent to where the Teaching is 
heard and many away from the knowledgeable atmosphere. </P>
<P>325. Bhikkhus, a few are born wise with powers to understand what is taught 
and to eliminate the not essential. Bhikkhus, in the same manner there are a 
handful endowed with the noble one's wisdom, the rest are ignorant and lack that 
wisdom. </P>
<P>326. Bhikkhus, a few are lucky enough to see the Blessed One, the others are 
not so lucky. </P>
<P>327. Bhikkhus, a few hear the Blessed One's Teaching. The rest are not so 
lucky. </P>
<P>328.Bhikkhus, a handful hear the Teaching and bear it in mind, the rest 
forget it.</P>
<P>329.Bhikkhus,a few hearing the Teaching peruse it, many others do not tarry 
to think about what they heard. </P>
<P>330. Bhikkhus, a few learn the Teaching and fall to the method of living 
according to it, many others do not care to do it. </P>
<P>331.Bhikkhus, a few are shaken with religious emotion in a circumstance many 
others do not stir whatever the circumstance may be. </P>
<P>332.Bhikkhus, a few stirred by religious emotion, make effort to overcome 
unpleasantness, there are many others who do nothing about it. </P>
<P>333.Bhikkhus, a few change their object of concentration and gain one point 
of mind. There are others who do not reach one point of mind when they change 
the object of concentration. </P>
<P>334. In the same way bhikkhus, a few are fed on the most excellent food and 
the rest feed on whatever available crumbs. </P>
<P>335.Bhikkhus, a few find access to the meanings of the Teaching and the bliss 
of release, others do not experience release. Therefore bhikkhus, you should 
train to see the meanings in the Teaching to experience the bliss of release. 
</P>
<P>336. Bhikkhus, in the peninsular of India there are a few pleasant orchards, 
forests, outstanding sites, stretches of water but many irregular blocks of 
land, irregular rivers flowing disorderly, forming uneven shapes. In the same 
manner a few humans who leave the human corpse are born among humans many more 
are reborn in hell, in the animal world and as ghosts. </P>
<P>337. In the same manner a few gods that leave divinity are reborn among gods 
many more are reborn in hell, in the animal world and as ghosts. </P>
<P>338. In the same manner a few gods that leave divinity are reborn as humans, 
many more are reborn in hell, in the animal world and as ghosts. </P>
<P>339.Bhikkhus, in the same manner a few released from hell are reborn human, 
many more are reborn in hell, in the animal world and as ghosts. </P>
<P>340.Bhikkhus, a few released from hell are reborn with the gods, many more 
are reborn in hell, in the animal world and as ghosts. In the same manner a few 
who leave behind the animal world are reborn as humans, many more are reborn in 
hell, in the animal world and as ghosts. In the same manner a few who leave 
behind the animal world are reborn as gods, many more are reborn in hell, in the 
animal world and as ghosts. In the same manner a few ghosts are reborn among 
humans, many more are reborn in hell, in the animal world and as ghosts. In the 
same manner a few ghosts are reborn among gods, many more are reborn in hell, in 
the animal world and as ghosts.</P>

<P>Notes.</P>
<P>[1] Mindfulness of the body `kàyagatàsati' In this sutta, mindfulness of the 
body is equated to deathlessness. Mindfulness of the body is nothing other than 
the control of the six mental faculties. The Blessed One has explained that the 
release with knowing `a¤¤àvimutti' is the release that one experiences when his 
six spheres of mental contact do not arouse feelings in any circumstance. So 
this is explained as deathlessness `amatapadaü' or arahanship here and now.
