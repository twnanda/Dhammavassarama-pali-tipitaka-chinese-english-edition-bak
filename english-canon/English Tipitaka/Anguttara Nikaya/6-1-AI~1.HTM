worshipfulness</P></B></FONT><FONT face=Times_CSX+>
<P></P>
<P>001.01. I heard thus. At one time The Blessed One was living in the monastery 
offered by Anathapindika in Jeta's grove in Savatthi. The Blessed One addressed 
the bhikkhus: </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu endowed with these six things is worshipful, suitable 
for hospitality, gifts and to honour with clasped hands the incomparable field 
of merit for the world. What six? </P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu seeing a form is neither pleased or displeased 
abides mindful and aware with equanimity. Hearing a sound, ....re... scenting a 
smell, ...re..ñasting a taste, ...re... cognizing a touch with the body, 
...re... and cognizing an idea, is neither pleased nor displeased, abides 
mindful and aware with equanimity. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu endowed with these six things is worshipful, suitable 
for hospitality, gifts and to honour with clasped hands, the incomparable field 
of merit for the world. The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted 
in the words of The Blessed One.</P></FONT><B><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=4>
<P align=center>2. Dutiya-àhuneyyasuttaü- Second on 
worshipfulness.</P></B></FONT><FONT face=Times_CSX+>
<P>001.02. Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu endowed with these six things is worshipful, 
suitable for hospitality, gifts and to honour with clasped hands, the 
incomparable field of merit for the world. What six?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu partakes various psyshic powers. One becomes many 
and many becomes one. Evidently goes across walls, embankments, rocks without 
obstructions as though going in space. Dives in and comes out of earth as though 
in water. Goes unbroken on water as though on earth. Sits in a cross legged 
position, in space as birds large and small do. He touches the moon and sun, as 
powerful as they are and wields power with the body as far as the world of 
Brahma. </P>
<P>With the purified ear element beyond human, hears sounds both human and 
heavenly, far and near. Penetrating the minds of other beings, other persons he 
knows and sees the mind with greed, without greed, with anger and without anger, 
with delusion, and without delusion, the contracted mind and the distracted 
mind, the mind that has grown great and the mind that has not grown great, the 
mind with a compare, and the mind without a compare, the concentrated mind and 
the unconcentrated mind, the released mind and the not released mind.</P>
<P>He recollects manifold previous births such as one birth, two, three, four, 
five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred 
thousand, an innumerable forward cycle of births, an innumerable backward cycle 
of births and an innumerable forward and backward cycle of births. There I was 
of such name, clan, disposition, supports, experiencing such pleasant and 
unpleasant feelings and such a life span. Disappearing from there I was born 
here. Thus with all details the manifold previous births are recollected. </P>
<P>With the purified heavenly eye beyond human sees beings disappearing and 
appearing unexalted and exalted, in good and evil states, knows how beings are 
born according to their actions. These good beings endowed with bodily, verbal 
and mental misbehaviour, rebuking noble ones, with wrong view and with the wrong 
view of actions, after death are born in loss, in a bad state in hell. As for 
these good beings endowed with bodily, verbal and mental good behaviour, not 
rebuking noble ones, with right view and the right view of actions, after death 
are born in increase, in a good state in heaven. </P>
<P>With the purified heavenly eye beyond human sees beings disappearing and 
appearing unexalted and exalted, in good and evil states, knows how beings are 
born according to their actions. Destroying desires, releasing the mind from 
desires and released through wisdom, here and now abides having known and 
realized. </P>

<P align=center>10. Mahànàmasuttaü- Mahanama, the Sakya.</P></B></FONT><FONT

<P>001.10. At one time The Blessed One was living in Nigrodha's monastery in 
Kapilavatthu in the country of the Sakyas. Then Mahanama the Sakya approached 
The Blessed One worshipped, sat a on side and said to The Blessed One: Venerable 
sir, in what abiding should the noble disciple who has come to fruition and 
knows the dispensation abide mostly? </P>
<P>Mahanama, the noble disciple who has come to fruition and knows the 
dispensation abides in this abiding mostly:</P>
<P>Here, Mahanama, the noble disciple recollects the Thus Gone One: The Blessed 
One is worthy, rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well 
gone, knows the worlds, is the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, the 
Teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed. Mahanama, at the time the 
noble disciple recollects the Thus Gone One, his mind is not prepossessed by 
greed, hate or delusion, his mind is directly bent on the Thus Gone One. When 
the noble disciple's mind is straightforward, he realizes the meanings, realizes 
the Teaching and gains joy on account of understanding the Teaching. To the 
joyful there is delight. The delighted mind appeases the body. The appeased body 
experiences pleasantness. The pleasant mind concentrates. </P>
<P>Mahanama, to this is said the noble disciple abides successfully with the 
disharmonious populace. With the troubled populace, lives untroubled, entering 
the stream of the Teaching developing recollections of the Enlightened One. </P>
<P>Again, Mahanama, the noble disciple recollects the Teaching: The Teaching of 
The Blessed One is here and now, not a matter of time, inviting to inspection, 
leading inwards and to be realized by the wise by themselves. Mahanama, at the 
time the noble disciple recollects the Teaching, his mind is not prepossessed by 
greed, hate or delusion, his mind is directly bent on the Teaching. When the 
noble disciple's mind is straightforward, he realizes the meanings, realizes the 
Teaching and gains joy on account of understanding the Teaching. To the joyful 
there is delight. The delighted mind appeases the body. The appeased body 
experiences pleasantness. The pleasant mind concentrates. </P>
<P>Mahanama, to this is said the noble disciple abides successfully with the 
disharmonious populace. With the troubled populace, lives untroubled, entering 
the stream of the Teaching developing recollections of the Teaching </P>
<P>Again, Mahanama, the noble disciple recollects the The Community of bhikkhus: 
The Community of bhikkhus of The Blessed One have fallen to the right path, the 
straight path, the wise path, the path of mutual understanding; Such as the four 
pairs of eight Great Men. They are the disciples of The Blessed One that are 
worshipful, suitable for hospitality, gifts and veneration with clasped hands; 
the incomparable field of merit for the world. Mahanama, at the time the noble 
disciple recollects the Community of bhikkhus, his mind is not prepossessed by 
greed, hate or delusion, his mind is directly bent on the Community of bhikkhus. 
When the noble disciple's mind is straightforward, he realizes the meanings, 
realizes the Teaching and gains joy on account of understanding the Teaching. To 
the joyful there is delight. The delighted mind appeases the body. The appeased 
body experiences pleasantness. The pleasant mind concentrates. </P>
<P>Mahanama, to this is said the noble disciple abides successfully with the 
disharmonious populace. With the troubled populace, lives untroubled, entering 
the stream of the Teaching developing recollections of the Community of 
bhikkhus. </P>
<P>Again, Mahanama, the noble disciple recollects his virtues- That are not 
broken, not defective, not spotted, consistent free from slavery and praised by 
the wise as not corrupted and conducive to concentration. Mahanama, at the time 
the noble disciple recollects his virtues, his mind is not prepossessed by 
greed, hate or delusion, his mind is directly bent on his virtues. When the 
noble disciple's mind is straightforward, he realizes the meanings, realizes the 
Teaching and gains joy on account of understanding the Teaching. To the joyful 
there is delight. The delighted mind appeases the body. The appeased body 
experiences pleasantness. The pleasant mind concentrates. </P>
<P>Mahanama, to this is said the noble disciple abides successfully with the 
disharmonious populace. With the troubled populace, lives untroubled, entering 
the stream of the Teaching developing recollections of his virtues.</P>
<P>Again, Mahanama, the noble disciple recollects his benevolence: It is great 
gain for me that I abide in a home having given up stains of miserliness. I 
abide released and benevolent with open hands attached to giving up and making 
arrangements to give to the needy. Mahanama, at the time the noble disciple 
recollects his benevolence, his mind is not prepossessed by greed, hate or 
delusion, his mind is directly bent on benevolence. When the noble disciple's 
mind is straightforward, he realizes the meanings, realizes the Teaching and 
gains joy on account of understanding the Teaching. To the joyful there is 
delight. The delighted mind appeases the body. The appeased body experiences 
pleasantness. The pleasant mind concentrates. </P>
<P>Mahanama, to this is said the noble disciple abides successfully with the 
disharmonious populace. With the troubled populace, lives untroubled, entering 
the stream of the Teaching developing recollections of his benevolence.</P>
<P>Again,Mahanama, the noble disciple recollects the gods: There are gods born 
with the guardian gods, with the thirty three gods, with the Titanic gods, with 
those of happiness, those attached to creation, those attached to the creation 
of others, with Brahma, and gods even above them. With whatever faith, virtues, 
learning, benevolence and wisdom, they disappeared from here and appeared there, 
that same faith, virtues, learning, benevolence and wisdom is evident in me. 
Mahanama, at the time the noble disciple recollects the gods, his mind is not 
prepossessed by greed, hate or delusion, his mind is directly bent on the gods. 
When the noble disciple's mind is straightforward, he realizes the meanings, 
realizes the Teaching and gains joy on account of understanding the Teaching. To 
the joyful there is delight. The delighted mind appeases the body. The appeased 
body experiences pleasantness. The pleasant mind concentrates. </P>
<P>Mahanama, to this is said the noble disciple abides successfully with the 
disharmonious populace. With the troubled populace, lives untroubled, entering 
the stream of the Teaching developing recollections of the gods.. . . . </P>
<P>Mahanama, the noble disciple who has come to fruition and knows the 
dispensation abides in this abiding mostly:</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
