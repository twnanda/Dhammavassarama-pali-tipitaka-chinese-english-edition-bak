<P>33.Bhikkhus, I will tell you the non Great Man and the Great Man, listen and 
attend carefully. Bhikkhus, who is the non Great Man? He is ungrateful and lacks 
consideration. Bhikkhus, it should be thoroughly known that ungratefulness and 
lack of consideration is low. It is completely the sphere of the non Greàt Man 
Bhikkhus, who is the Great Man? He is grateful and has consideration for others. 
Bhikkhus, it should be thoroughly known that being grateful and consideration 
for others is noble. It is completely the sphere of the Greàt Man </P>
<P>34. Bhikkhus, I say, you cannot repay two persons. Who are the two? It is 
mother and father. Bhikkhus, if you had borne your father and mother on your 
shoulders and lived a hundred years and meanwhile rubbed and massaged their 
bodies and they let loose urine and excreta, yet you have not returned the 
gratitude shown to you. Even if you offer them all the wealth and make them 
rulers of the earth, even then you have not returned the gratitude shown to you, 
because they have done much more. They fed you when you could not walk and 
showed you the world.</P>
<P>If your mother and father did not have faith and you instilled faith in them, 
if they did not have virtues instilled virtues in them, if they were miserly, 
made them benevolent and if they were not wise, made them wise, you have shown 
gratitude to your mother and father, it is more than enough. </P>
<P>35. A certain brahmin approached the Blessed One, exchanged friendly 
greeting, sat on a side and said:-</P>
<P>What is good Gotama’s faith and what does he preach?</P>
<P>Brahmin, I preach doing and not doing. How does good Gotama preach doing and 
not doing?</P>
<P>Brahmin, I say do not do misconduct by body, words and mind and I say do no 
demeritorious thinking in any of the various spheres, develop good conduct by 
body, words and mind and I say do meritorious thinking in any of the various 
spheres. Brahmin, thus I say I preach doing and not doing.</P>
<P>Good Gotama, I understood, it is like something overturned is reinstated, it 
is like something is disclosed. It is like the path was told to someone who has 
lost his way, or like a lamp lighted for the darkness for those who have eyes to 
see forms. Good Gotama has explained the Teaching in various ways. Now I take 
refuge in the Blessed One in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. 
Remember me as a lay disciple, from today until life lasts. </P>
<P>36. Then the householder Anathapindika approached the Blessed One, 
worshipped, sat on a side and said:-Venerable sir, how many are there in the 
world to receive gifts and to whom should gifts be given?</P>
<P>Householder, there are two groups to receive gifts, they are the trainers and 
those who have gone beyond the training. Householder, gifts should be given to 
them. Then the Blessed One further said:-</P>
<P>The trainers and those gone beyond the training are suitable for gifts</P>
<P>They are straightforward in body, speech and mind</P>
<P>And are a field of merit for those making sacrifices. </P>
<P>37. I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery 
offered by Anathapindika in Jeta’s grove in Savatthi. At that time venerable 
Sariputta was living in the Pubba monastery offered by the mother of Migara, in 
Savatthi. Then venerable Sariputta addressed the bhikkhus:- Friends, bhikkhus, 
who is the person with internal bonds? Here bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is virtuous 
observing the higher code of rules and practising good conduct seeing fear in 
the slightest fault. After death he is born with a certain company of gods. 
Disappearing from there he returns here, to be born. Bhikkhus, this is the 
person with internal bonds who is a returner. </P>
<P>Friends, bhikkhus, who is the person with external bonds? Here bhikkhus, the 
bhikkhu is virtuous observing the higher code of rules and practising good 
conduct seeing fear in the slightest fault. </P>
<P>He abides enjoying a certain peaceful release of mind. After death he is born 
with a certain company of gods. Disappearing from there does not return here. 
Bhikkhus, this is the person with external bonds who is a non returner. </P>
<P>Again, friends, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is virtuous observing the higher code 
of rules and practising good conduct seeing fear in the slightest fault. He 
follows the method of getting wearied, detaching and ceasing from sensual 
desires and from thinking. He follows the method of putting an end to craving. 
After death he is born with a certain company of gods. Disappearing from there, 
he does not return here. Bhikkhus, this is the person with external bonds he is 
a non returner. </P>
<P>Then many gods who had developed equanimity approached the Blessed One, 
worshipping the and standing on a side they said to the Blessed One :-</P>
<P>Venerable sir, venerable Sariputta in the Pubba monastery is explaining to 
the bhikkhus, the person with internal bonds and the person with external bonds. 
The gathering is excited. Good, if the Blessed One would approach venerable 
Sariputta out of compassion. The Blessed One accepted in silence</P>
<P>Then the Blessed One, like a strong man who would stretch his bent arm or 
bend his stretched arm disappering from Jeta’s grove appeared before venerable 
Sariputta in the Pubba monastery. Then the Blessed One sat on the prepared seat 
and venerable Sariputta too worshipped the Blessed One and sat on a side The 
Blessed One said:- Sariputta, many gods who have developed equanimity approached 
me worshipped me and standing on a side they said:- Venerable sir, venerable 
Sariputta in the Pubba monastery is explaining to the bhikkhus, the person with 
internal bonds and the person with external bonds. The gathering is excited. 
Good, if the Blessed One would approach venerable Sariputta out of compassion. 
Sariputta, those gods stand as though fixed to the tip of a sword clustered 
together in tens, twenties, thirties, forties, fifties, sixties and seventies. 
They do not hurt each other thus standing. </P>
<P>Sariputta, that training should be done here itself. Our mental faculties 
should be pacified and our mind should be appeased. Our bodily, verbal, and 
mental actions will be appeasing towards co-associates in the holy life. 
Sariputta, you should train in this manner. Sariputta, those gone forth in other 
faiths should not hear this discourse, if they have not heard it. </P>
<P>38. I heard thus.at one time venerable Mahakaccayana was living in Benares on 
the bank of river Kaddamadaha. Then the brahmin Aramamadaõóa approached 
venerable Mahakaccayana exchanged friendly greetings sat on a side and 
said:-Good Kaccayana what is the reason and cause that warriors dispute with 
warriors, brahmins with brahmins and householders with householders and even 
recluses with recluses. On account of a conceited, bonded attachment to sensual 
craving, warriors dispute with warriors, brahmins with brahmins and householders 
with householders. </P>
<P>Good Kaccayana what is the reason and cause that recluses dispute with 
recluses? On account of a conceited, bonded attachment craving for a doctrinal 
view recluses dispute with recluses.</P>
<P>Good Kaccayana, in this world is there anyone who has overcome this 
conceited, bonded attachment to sensual craving and the conceited bonded 
attachment craving for a doctrinal view? </P>
<P>Brahmin, there is a person who has overcome this conceited, bonded attachment 
to sensual craving and the conceited bonded attachment, craving for a doctrinal 
view.</P>
<P>Good Kaccayana, who is it, that has overcome this conceited, bonded 
attachment to sensual craving and the conceited bonded attachment craving, for a 
doctrinal view </P>
<P>Brahmin, in the eastern state there is a city called Savatthi, there the 
Blessed One, worthy and rightfully enlightened now lives. He has overcome this 
conceited, bonded attachment to sensual craving and the conceited bonded 
attachment craving, for a doctrinal view.</P>
<P>When this was said the brahmin Aramadaõóa got up from his seat, arranged his 
shawl on one shoulder putting his right knee on the ground and clasping his 
hands towards the direction in which the Blessed One was, made this solemn 
utterance thrice. `I worship the Blessed One, worthy and rightfully enlightened’ 
He has overcome this conceited, bonded attachment to sensual craving and the 
conceited bonded attachment craving, for a doctrinal view.</P>
<P>Good Kaccayana, I understood, it is like something overturned is reinstated, 
it is like something is disclosed. It is like the path was told to someone who 
has lost his way, or like a lamp lighted for the darkness for those who have 
eyes to see forms. Good Kaccayana has explained the Teaching in various ways. 
Now I take refuge in the Blessed One in the Teaching and the Community of 
bhikkhus. Good Kaccayana, remember me as a lay disciple, from today until life 
lasts.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>39. At one time venerable Mahakaccayana was living in the Gunóa forest in 
Madhura. Then the brahmin Kaõóarayana approached venerable Mahakaccayna 
exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side and said:- </P>
<P>Good Kaccayana, I hear that the recluse Kaccayana does not welcome, attend or 
give a seat to brahmins decayed, aged and come to the end of the life span. Good 
Kaccayana, is it the right conduct?</P>
<P>Brahmin, the Blessed One who knows and sees, is worthy and rightfully 
enlightened has shown an elder and a young one. Brahmin there may be an aged 
one, eighty, ninety, or even a hundred years from birth. If he enjoys sensual 
pleasures, surrounded by them, burning with sensual worries, thinking sensual 
thoughts and feverish about sensual searchings, on that he is reckoned a young 
one </P>
<P>Brahmin, there may be a young one with dark black hair, young in the first 
stage of life, in prime of youth If he does not enjoy sensual pleasures, 
surrounded by them, not burning with sensual worries, not thinking sensual 
thoughts and not feverish about sensual searchings, on that he is reckoned a 
wise elder.</P>
<P>When this was said, the brahmin Kaõóarayana got up from his seat, arranged 
his shawl on one shoulder and putting his head at the feet of the young bhikkhus 
and said `Good ones, you are elderly, we are young ones.’ </P>
<P>Good Kaccayana, I understood, it is like something overturned is reinstated, 
it is like something is disclosed. It is like the path was told to someone who 
has lost his way, or like a lamp lighted for the darkness for those who have 
eyes to see forms. Good Kaccayana has explained the Teaching in various ways. 
Now I take refuge in the Blessed One in the Teaching and the Community of 
bhikkhus. Good Kaccayana, remember me as a lay disciple, from today until life 
lasts.</P>
<P>40. Bhikkhus, at a time when robbers are strong, kings become weak and live 
unpleasantly not able to go to or come from the bordering states to get any work 
done there. The brahmin householders too at such times live unpleasantly not 
able to go to or come in to find some external work. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in the same manner, when unvirtuous bhikkhus become strong the good 
bhikkhus become weak and they get to the bordering states. Bhikkhus, it is for 
the harm, ill luck and unpleasantness of many gods and men. </P>
<P>41. Bhikkhus, I do not appreciate two wrong methods, whether of the 
householders or of those gone forth.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, householders or those gone forth on account of the wrong method do 
not become accomplished.</P>
<P>Walking in the correct path is meritorious </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, I appreciate two right methods, whether of the householders or of 
those gone forth.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, householders or those gone forth on account of the right method 
become accomplished.</P>
<P>Walking in the correct path is meritorious </P>
<P>42.Bhikkhus, those bhikkhus who misunderstand the suttas with similar letters 
misunderstand the meaning and the Teaching. It is for the harm and 
unpleasantness of many gods and men. They accure much demerit and work for the 
disappearance of this good Teaching. </P>
<P>.Bhikkhus, those bhikkhus who understand the suttas with similar letters 
understand the meaning and see the Teaching directly. It is for the welfare and 
unpleasantness of many gods and men. They accure much merit and work for the 
stabilization of this good Teaching.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
