<P>Accàyikasuttaü - Pressing work</P>
<P>93. Bhikkhus, these three are pressing work for the cultivating householder. 
What three? </P>
<P>Here bhikkhus, the cultivating householder prepares the field quickly, 
furrows it quickly, embeds the seeds and quickly leads water in and out. 
Bhikkhus, he has to do these three things quickly. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, to the cultivating householder, there is not that power to think 
today the seeds will be born, or tomorrow they will be pregnant or the day after 
they will thrive. Yet at the right time the seedlings germinate, grow and bear 
fruit. </P>
<P>In the same manner bhikkhus, these three are pressing work for the bhikkhu. 
What three? Precepting for higher virtues, for higher concentration and for 
higher wisdom. These three has to be done quickly by the bhikkhu. He has no 
power to think today, my mind will be released from holding to desires, or 
tomorrow or the day after it will be released from holding to desires. Yet there 
comes a time to the bhikkhu who precepts himself for higher virtues, higher 
concentration and higher wisdom, when his mind will be released from holding to 
desires.</P>
<P>Therefore bhikkhus, you should train thus:-We will be with firm interest for 
higher virtues, higher concentration and higher wisdom. </P>
<P>&nbsp;2. Pavivekasuttaü- Seclusions </P>
<P>94. Bhikkhus, these three are seclusions of the wandering ascetics of other 
sects. What three? Seclusion in robes, morsel food and dwellings. </P>
<P>Here bhikkhus, for the wandering ascetics of other sects this is the 
seclusion in robes. They wear garments of hemp, garments of coarse cloth 
interwoven with hemp, miserable garments, garments made of, the bark of trees, 
antelope hide, strips of antelope hide, strips of wood and owls' wings. They 
wear garments made of grass, blankets made of head hair and blankets made of 
horses' tail. This is the seclusion of robes to the wandering ascetics of other 
sects.</P>
<P>Here bhikkhus, for the wandering ascetics of other sects this is the 
seclusion in morsel food.- They eat vegetables, millets, raw rice, a kind of 
dark rice, a kind of water plant, finely broken rice, rice foam, sesamum flour, 
grass, cowdung, roots and fruits from the forest and whatever is picked. This is 
the seclusion in morsel food for the wandering ascetics of other sects. </P>
<P>Here bhikkhus, for the wandering ascetics of other sects this is the 
seclusion in dwellings:- They dwell in forests, at the root of trees, cemeterys, 
forest paths, open space, on a heap of straw or in a hay stack. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in this discipline of the Teaching these are the three seclusions 
for the bhikkhu. What three? Here bhikkhus, the bhikkhu becomes virtuous, 
dispels wrong virtues and departs from wrong virtues. Becomes one of right view 
dispels wrong view and departs from wrong view. Becomes one who destroys 
desires, dispels desires and he departs from desires- Bhikkhus, to this is 
called the bhikkhu has attained the highest, the essence and is established in 
the purely essential. Bhikkhus, these three are seclusions for the bhikkhus in 
this discipline of the Teaching. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, like the cultivating householder when the field is successfully 
ripe would quickly cause it, to be cut, collected and carried away and collected 
in a heap. Then it would be quickly crushed, the straw shaken and thrown away 
and chaff blown away. Quickly carrying it away would cause it to be husked and 
the essence would be taken. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the cultivating householder has attained the highest, the essence 
and is established in the purely essential.of those grains. In the same manner 
bhikkhus, the bhikkhu becomes virtuous, dispels wrong virtues and departs from 
wrong virtues. Becomes one of right view dispels wrong view and departs from 
wrong view. Becomes one who destroys desires, dispels desires and he departs 
from desires- Bhikkhus, to this is called the bhikkhu has attained the highest, 
the essence and is established in the purely essential.</P>
<P>3. Saradasuttaü- In Autumn.</P>
<P>95.Bhikkhus, in Autumn when there is a clear sky, without a single cloud and 
the sun rising high up in the sky destroys all the darkness and burns and 
scorches every thing. In the same manner to the noble disciple there arises the 
eye of the Teaching and together with that arising, three bonds get dispelled, 
the view of a self, doubts and taking virtues as the ultimate end of the holy 
life. After that the leading is by covetousness and hatred. He secluding the 
mind from sensual and demeritorious thoughts, with thoughts and thought 
processes and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion abides in the first 
jhana. If the noble disciple dies at that time he has no bonds on account of 
which he is to be born in this world . </P>
<P>4. Parisàsuttaü </P>
<P>96.Bhikkhus, these three are the gatherings. What three? The eminent 
gathering, the divided gathering and the united gathering. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the eminent gàthering? </P>
<P>Here bhikkhus, in a gathering the elder bhikkhus do not live in abundance 
given to lethargyóeviating from the main aim. They give the first place to 
seclusion putting forth effort to attain the not yet attained and to realize the 
not yet realized- The later generation imitate them and they too do not live in 
abundance given to lethargyóeviating from the main aim. They give the first 
place to seclusion putting forth effort to attain the not yet attained and to 
realize the not yet realized. Bhikkhus, this is the eminent gathering. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the divided gathering? </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in a gathering the bhikkhus quarrel and dispute among themselves 
with the weapon in the mouths. To this is called a divided gathering. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is a united gathering? . </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in a gathering the bhikkhus are united and combined, without a 
dispute get mixed like milk and water and abide looking at each other with 
pleasant eyes. To this is called the united gathering.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, at a time when the bhikkhus are united and combined, without a 
dispute get mixed like milk and water and abide looking at each other with 
pleasant eyes, at such time merit is accured, at such times the bhikkhus are in 
divine abiding- such as the release of mind in intrinsic joy. To the greatly 
pleased joy arises and the body of one with a joyful mind appeases. The appeased 
body feels pleasant and the pleasant mind becomes one pointed </P>
<P>When large drops of rain fall on the higher altitudes of the rock, that water 
sloping down the valleys fill up the small streams and bigger streams and fill 
up the small ponds. They in turn fill up the larger ponds and the rivulets and 
then they fill up the rivers and the great rivers òhe great rivers fill the 
ocean. In the same manner bhikkhus at a time when the bhikkhus are united and 
combined, without a dispute get mixed like milk and water and abide looking at 
each other with pleasant eyes, at such times merit is accured, at such time the 
bhikkhus are in divine abiding- such as the release of mind in intrinsic joy. To 
the greatly pleased joy arises and the body of one with a joyful mind appeases. 
The appeased body feels pleasant and the pleasant mind becomes one pointed. </P>

becomes, the king's possession and becomes royal with the sign. What three? </P>

speed. The king's thoroughbred endowed with these three characteristics becomes, 
the king's possession and becomes royal with the sign. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in the same manner the bhikkhu endowed with three things becomes 
suitable for, hospitality, reverence, gifts and for reverential salutation with 
clasped hands, the field of merit for the world. What three? </P>

<P>Here bhikkhus, the bhikkhu abides with aroused effort to dispel demeritorious 
thoughts and to arouse meritorious thoughts becoming firm with aroused effort 
for meritorious thoughts and not putting off the single aim. Thus the bhikkhu 
becomes powerful.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu become endowed with speed?</P>

<P>8. Potthakasuttaü- The book</P>
<P>100. Bhikkhus, even a new book may be not comely, attractive to touch and be 
of low value, even a middling book may be not comely, attractive to touch and be 
of low value</P>
<P>or even a decayed book may be not comely, attractive to touch and be of low 
value</P>
<P>The decayed book will be taken to wipe something or would be thrown into the 
rubbish heap.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in the same manner<I> </I>even if a novice bhikkhu is with evil 
thoughts, I say he is not attractive. I compare him to the not comely book.</P>
<P>They that serve him, associate him and imitate him will be mentally unwell 
and fall into unpleasantness for a long time. I say this is his unpleasant 
touch. I compare this to the not attractive touch of the book.</P>
<P>They that offer him robes, morsel food, dwellings and requisites when ill are 
not well rewarded. I say, it is owing to his low value. I compare it to the low 
value of the book. </P>

think you have to be spoken to. He would be displeased and angry and would speak 
displeased words. The Community would throw him out as the book that is thrown 
as rubbbish. .</P>

high value, even a middling Kashmire cloth is comely, attractive to touch and of 
high value</P>
<P>or even a decayed Kashmire cloth is comely, attractive to touch and of high 
value</P>
<P>The decayed Kashmire cloth will be taken to cover jewels or would be put in 
the scented casket.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in the same manner<I> </I>even if a novice bhikkhu is virtuous and 
with good conduct , that I say is his attractive looks. I compare him to the

pleasant for a long time. I say this is his pleasant touch. I compare this to

well rewarded. I say, it is owing to his high value. I compare it to the high 
value of the Kashmire cloth.</P>
<P>If such an elder bhikkhu speaks in the midst of the Colmmunity of bhikkhus, 
it would be told :- Venerable ones, make no noise an elder is speàking on the 
Teaching and Discipline. His words would be well treasured, either put in the 
scented casket or wrapt up in the Kashmire cloth.òherefore bhikkhus you should 
train, we should be like the Kashmire cloth and not like the book. </P>

<P>Notes. 1. Undevelopped body.'abhàvita kàyo' Take a child who has not yet 
reached its teen age. To him the six doors of mental contact are a constant 
source of pleasure. He would be tossing about, laughing running about and happy. 
He would be overwhelmed with pleasure. This is an example for an undevelopped 
body. </P>
<P>2. Undevelopped virtues. `abhàvitasãlo' It is the uncontrolled mental 
faculties. That is seeing a form would be either attached to it or averse to it. 
Which is closely followed up with a train of unpleasant things such as 
displeasure, pleasure, happiness unhappiness, distress, worry and 
unpleasantness. So also hearing a sound, smelling a scent, tasting, with a body 
contact and an idea would be either attached to it or averse to it. Which is 
closely followed up with a train of unpleasant things such as displeasure, 
pleasure, happiness unhappiness, distress, worry and unpleasantness. The control 
of the six doors of mental contact is the ultimate end of observing all virtues. 
</P>
<P>3. Undevelopped mind `abhàvitacitta' Soon after any pleasant feeling, there 
is an unpleasant feeling, on account of losing the pleasant feeling. Follow note 
1. From that same child, all of a sudden you might hear a sudden yell, with 
tears streaming down his face. Now he is overwhelmed with unpleasantness. He has 
no control of himself. It is owing to his undevelopped mind. Not only a child, 
most of us become childish at times the Blessed One specifies an antidote for us 
to develop the mind and that is the four jhanas.</P>
<P>4. Undevelopped wisdom `abhàvitapa¤¤à' It is not knowing, this is unpleasant, 
as it really is. Not knowing this is the arising of unpleasantness,...re... Not 
knowing this is the cessation of unpleasantness,..re.... Not knowing this is the 
path to the cessation of unpleasantness, ..re.... That path is the Noble 
Eightfold Path. </P>
<P>5. Is insignificant with a small self `paritto appàtumo' For a person to 
become significant, merely becoming huge and strong is not enough, he should 
have some internal build up in the form of character building. Observing certain 
restrains and observances would be helpful. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>10. Paüsudhovakasuttaü - Washing impurities.</P>
<P>102. Bhikkhus, to born gold there are rough impurities, such as dirty sand, 
pebbles and stones. The washer or his apprentice spreads the impure gold in a 
trough and washes, cleans and shakes it, when the rough impurities are cleaned,- 
</P>
<P>To born gold there are middling impurities, such as fine stones, and big 
grains of sand The washer or his apprentice washes, cleans and shakes it, when 
the middling impurities are cleaned,-</P>
<P>To born gold there are fine impurities, such as fine sand and black sand The 
washer or his apprentice washes, cleans and shakes it, when the fine impurities 
are cleaned,-</P>
<P>Then the goldsmith does the rest. The goldsmith or his apprentice puts the 
raw gold to a metal vessel and heats and boils does not turn it into liquid or 
attend to it well. When not yet attended to, the gold is not bright, is brittle 
and not ready to work with </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, there comes a time when the goldsmith or his apprentice heats, 
boils and turns it into liquid. Then the brittleness is gone it becomes pure, 
bright and ready to work with. Whatever the goldsmith desires to make with it, 
whether a girdle, earings or a chain for the neck, for that purpose it becomes 
suitable. </P>
<P>In the same manner bhikkhus, to the bhãkkhu developping the mind to a higher 
degree there are rough defilements such as misbehaviour by body, speech or mind. 
A capable bhikkhu dispels them turns them out and makes them things that would 
not rise again.</P>
<P>When these are dispelled to the bhãkkhu developping the mind to a higher 
degree there are middling defilements, such as sensual thoughts, hateful 
thoughts and hurting thoughts A capable bhikkhu dispels them turns them out and 
makes them things that would not rise again. </P>
<P>When these are dispelled to the bhãkkhu developping the mind to a higher 
degree there are fine defilements, such as thoughts about the nationality, state 
and other deceptive thoughts. A capable bhikkhu dispels them turns them out and 
makes them things that would not rise again. </P>
<P>After that thoughts about the Teaching take over. That concentration is not 
peaceful, not exalted, not appeasing with the mind not coming to a single point 
and neither without thoughts that rebuke the religious observances. Bhikkhus, 
there comes a time when the.concentration is peaceful, exalted, appeased with 
the mind coming to a single point and without thoughts that rebuke the religious 
observances. Then to whatever realization of knowledge the mind is bent, 
mindfulness in that sphere becomes the eyewitness. </P>
<P>If he desires, partakes various forms of psychic powers. One becomes many and 
many becomes one. Appears and disappears without obstructions, across walls, 
embankments and rocks, as though passing through space. Comes out of earth and 
dives into it as though in water. One goes unbroken on water as though on hard 
earth. Sits cross legged in space like birds small or large. Touches the moon 
and sun with the hand, thus wields power as far as the world of Brahma. -Thus 
mindfulness becomes the eyewitness in that respective mental sphere. </P>
<P>If he desires, with the purified heavenly ear beyond human, hears sounds both 
heavenly and human at close quarters or at a distance-Thus mindfulness becomes 
the eyewitness in that respective mental sphere.</P>
<P>If he so desires, penetratingly knows the mental state of other persons and 
other beings. As this is a mind, with greed, without greed, with hate, without 
hate, with delusion, without delusion. As this mind is, not scattered, 
scattered, grown great, not grown great, with a compare, without a compare. As 
this mind is concentrated, not concentrated, released, not released.- Thus 
mindfulness becomes the eyewitness in that respective mental sphere</P>
<P>If he so desires, recalls innumerable previous births, such as one, two, 
three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred, one thousand, 
one hundred thousand, innumerable forward cycles, innumerable backward cycles 
and innumerable forward and backward cycles. -He recalls there I was of such 
name, lineage, clan, with such a disposition, such supports, experiencing such 
pleasant and unpleasant feelings and with such a life span. Disappearing from 
there was born there, of such name, lineage, clan, with such a disposition, such 
supports, experiencing such pleasant and unpleasant feelings and with such a 
life span. Disappearing from there is born here. Thus he recollects innumerable 
previous births with characteristics and details. Thus mindfulness becomes the 
eyewitness in that respective mental sphere.</P>
<P>If he so desires, with the purified heavenly eye which is beyond human he 
sees beings disappearing and appearing unexalted and exalted, beautiful and 
ugly, in good and evil states. Knows them born according to their actions. As 
these good beings on account of bodily, verbal and mental misconduct, on account 
of blaming noble ones, on account of wrong view, on account of wrong view of 
actions, after death are born in decrease, in an evil state, in hell As these 
good beings on account of bodily, verbal and mental good conduct, on account of 
not blaming noble ones, on account of right view, on account of right view of 
actions, after death are born in increase, in a good state, in heaven. Thus with 
the purified heavenly eye which is beyond human he sees beings disappearing and 
appearing unexalted and exalted, beautiful and ugly, in good and evil states. 
Knows them born according to their actions.-Thus mindfulness becomes the 
eyewitness in that respective mental sphere.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, if he so desires, releasing the mind from desires and released 
through wisdom, here and now by himself realizing abides,-Thus mindfulness 
becomes the eyewitness in that respective mental sphere.. </P>
<P>11. Nimittasuttaü Signs </P>
<P>103. Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu developping the mind to higher states should attend 
to three things from time to time- Alternately should attend to one or all the 
four ways of establishing mindfulness, to the most patronized sign,[1] and to 
the chosen release of mind.[2] </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, if the bhikkhu developping the mind to higher states should attend 
to only establishing mindfulness, the mind tends to become lazy. Bhikkhus, if 
the bhikkhu developping the mind to higher states should attend to only the most 
patronized sign, the mind tends to become excited or distracted. Bhikkhus, if 
the bhikkhu developping the mind to higher states should attend to only the 
chosen release of mind, it does not become concentrated for the destruction of 
desires. When the bhikkhu developping the mind to higher states alternately 
attends to establishing mindfulness, attends to the most patronized sign and 
attends to the chosen release of mind, it becomes gentle, workable, bright not 
prone to be interuptted it gets concentrated for the destruction of desires.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the goldsmith or his apprentice builds a furnace and lights its 
mouth, then taking the gold with a pair of pincers he holds it at the mouth of 
the furnace, from time to time he sprinkles water on it and looks at it. 
Bhikkhus, if the goldsmith or his apprentice only held the gold at the mouth of 
the furnace, it would get burnt. If he only sprinkled water on it, it would get 
cold. If he only looked at it, it would not be quite ready Since the goldsmith 
or his apprentice from time to time held the gold at the mouth of the furnace, 
sprinkled water and looked at it, it became gentle, workable, bright and not 
brittle, it became suitable to make whatever desired ornament, whether a girdle 
band, earings, a necklace or a gold chain. . </P>
<P>In the same manner bhikkhus, a bhikkhu developping the mind to higher states 
should attend to three things from time to time- should attend to one or all the 
four ways of establishing mindfulness,[1] should attend to the most patronized 
sign,[2] and to the chosen release of mind.[3] </P>

patronized sign, the mind tends to become excited or distracted. Bhikkhus, if

chosen release of mind, it does not become concentrated for the destruction of

attends to establishing mindfulness, attends to the most patronized sign and 
attends to the chosen release of mind, it becomes gentle, workable, bright, not 
prone to be interuptted it gets concentrated for the destruction of desires.</P>

became necessary. -In that respective sphere the mindfulness became the eye 
witness.</P>

earth. Sits cross legged in space like birds small or large. Touches the moon 
and sun with the hand, thus wields power as far as the world of Brahma. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, if he so desires, releasing the mind from desires and released 
through wisdom, here and now by himself realizing abides,-Thus mindfulness 
becomes the eyewitness in that respective mental sphere.. </P>
