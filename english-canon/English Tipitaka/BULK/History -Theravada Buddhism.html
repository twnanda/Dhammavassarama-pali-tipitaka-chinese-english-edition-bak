<h2>A Chronology</h2>
</center>
This timeline sketches some of the significant events and personalities in the evolution of Theravada Buddhism that, in one way or another, figure prominently in the readings found elsewhere on this website. This is not meant to be a definitive chronology.
<p>
Because the sources I used in constructing this timeline (indicated by braces {} and listed at the <A HREF="#sources">end of this document</A>) often assumed different dates for the Buddha's nativity, I have occasionally had to interpolate in order to fit events (particularly the early ones) onto a reasonably consistent timeline. Nevertheless, this chronology should provide a fairly clear picture of the relative sequence of events, if not the absolute dates on which they occurred.
<p>

<dd>The Bodhisatta (Sanskrit: Bodhisattva), or Buddha-to-be, is born in Lumbini (in present-day Nepal) as Siddhattha (Skt: Siddhartha) Gotama, a prince of the Sakya clan. {<A HREF="#s1">1</A>,<A HREF="#s2">2</A>}

<dd>While meditating under the Bo tree in the forest at Gaya (now Bodhgaya, India) during the full-moon night of May, the Boddhisatta becomes the Buddha (age 36).
<p>
During the full-moon night of July, the Buddha delivers his <A HREF="canon/samyutta/sn56-11.html">first discourse</A> near Varanasi, introducing the world to the <A HREF="ptf/sacca.html">Four Noble Truths</A> and commencing a 45-year career of teaching the religion he called "Dhamma-vinaya".

<dd>Parinibbana (Skt: Parinirvana; death and final release) of the Buddha, at Kusinara (now Kusinagar, India) (age 80). {<A HREF="#s1">1</A>,<A HREF="#s3">3</A>}
<p>
During the rains retreat following the Buddha's Parinibbana, the <B>First Council</B> convenes at Rajagaha, India, during which 500 arahant bhikkhus, led by Ven. Mahakassapa, gather to recite the entire body of the Buddha's teachings. The recitation of the Vinaya by Ven. Upali becomes accepted as the <A HREF="canon/vinaya/index.html">Vinaya Pitaka</A>; the recitation of the Dhamma by Ven. Ananda becomes established as the <A HREF="canon/sutta.html">Sutta Pitaka</A>. {<A HREF="#s1">1</A>,<A HREF="#s4">4</A>}
<p>
<dt><B><A NAME="council2">100</A></b> &nbsp; -444/-380
<dd>100 years after the Buddha's Parinibbana the <B>Second Council</B> convenes in Vesali to discuss controversial points of Vinaya. The first schism of the Sangha occurs, in which the Mahasanghika school parts ways with the traditionalist Sthaviravadins. At issue is the Mahasanghika's reluctance to accept the Suttas and the Vinaya as the final authority on the Buddha's teachings. This schism marks the first beginnings of what would later evolve into Mahayana Buddhism, which would come to dominate Buddhism in northern Asia (China, Tibet, Japan, Korea). {<A HREF="#s1">1</A>}
<p>
<dt><B><A NAME="council3">294</a></b> &nbsp; -250
<dd><B>Third Council</B> is convened by <A HREF="index-subject.html#asoka">King Asoka</A> at Pataliputra (India). Disputes on points of doctrine lead to further schisms, spawning the Sarvastivadin and Vibhajjavadin sects. The <A HREF="canon/abhidhamma/index.html">Abhidhamma Pitaka</A> is recited at the Council, along with additional sections of the <A HREF="canon/khuddaka/index.html">Khuddaka Nikaya</A>. The modern Pali Tipitaka is now essentially complete, although some scholars have suggested that at least two parts of the extant Canon -- the <A HREF="canon/vinaya/index.html#parivara">Parivara</A> in the Vinaya, and the <A HREF="canon/khuddaka/index.html#apadana">Apadana</A> in the Sutta -- may date from a later period. {<A HREF="#s1">1</A>, <A HREF="#s4">4</A>}

<p>
<dt><B><A NAME="council4">444</A></b> &nbsp; -100
<dd>Famine and schisms in Sri Lanka point out the need for a written record of the Tipitaka to preserve the Buddhist religion. King Vattagamani convenes a <B>Fourth Council</B>, in which 500 reciters and scribes from the Mahavihara write down the Pali Tipitaka for the first time, on palm leaves. {<A HREF="#s4">4</A>, <A HREF="#s5">5</A>, <A HREF="#s6">6</A>}

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<b><A NAME="n1">1</A>.</b> BE = Buddhist Era. Year 1 of the Buddhist Era calendar is the year of the Buddha's Parinibbana (death and final release), which occurred in the Buddha's eightieth year (480&nbsp;BCE according to the "historical" timeline; 544&nbsp;BCE by tradition).
<p>
The actual date of the Buddha's birth is unknown. According to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha's birth took place in 624&nbsp;BCE, although some recent estimates place the Buddha's birth much later -- perhaps as late as 448&nbsp;BCE {<A HREF="#s1">1</A>}. 560&nbsp;BCE is one commonly-accepted date for the Buddha's birth, and the "historical" date for that event that I adopt here.
<p>
Events in the timeline prior to -250&nbsp;CE are shown with two CE dates: the date based on the "traditional" nativity of 624&nbsp;BCE, followed by the date based on the "historical" date of 560&nbsp;BCE. After -250&nbsp;CE the "historical" date is dropped, since these dates are more appropriate only in discussions of earlier events.
<p>
To calculate the CE date corresponding to an event in the Buddhist traditional calendar, <i>subtract</I> 544 years from the BE date. The BE dates of well-documented historical events (particularly those in the twentieth century) may be off by one year, since the CE and BE calendars start their years on different months (January and May, respectively).

<b><A NAME="n2">2</A>.</b> CE = Common Era. Year 1 of the Common Era corresponds with the year 1 AD <i>(Anno Domini)</i> in the Christian calendar. -1&nbsp;CE (or 1 BCE -- "Before the Common Era") corresponds with the year 1 BC ("Before Christ"). As in the Christian system which has no year zero, the year 1&nbsp;BCE is followed by 1&nbsp;CE.
