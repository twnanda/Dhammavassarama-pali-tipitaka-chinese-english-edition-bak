<P>2. Dhanãya Sutta. To Dhanãya the cowherd.</B>.</P>
<P>18. The Cowherd Dhanãya said to the Blessed One. </P>
<P>ßMy food is ready, the cows are milked, we live together on the bank of river 
Mahi.</P>
<P>The huts are thatched, firewood is collected, if it happens, may rain come 
down."</P>
<P>19. The Blessed One said:</P>
<P>ßFree from anger, my arrow is pulled out<SUP>4</SUP> , one night I live on 
the bank of river Mahi.</P>
<P>My hut is open space, the fires are put out, if it happens, may rain come 
down."</P>
<P>20 The cowherd Dhaniya said:</P>
<P>ßGad flies and yellow flies are not seen, cattle roam in the well grown 
grass,</P>
<P>Enough rain has come, if it happens, may rain come down".</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>21. The Blessed One said:</P>
<P>ßMy well bound raft controlled the floods and reached the other shore,</P>
<P>I see no use for the raft<SUP>1</SUP> , if it happens, may rain come 
down."</P>
<P>22. The cowherd Dhaniya said:</P>
<P>ßMy wife is loyal and has one single wish, we have lived together happily for 
a long time,</P>
<P>I do not hear evil talk about her, if it happens, may rain come down." </P>
<P>23. The Blessed One said </P>
<P>"My well developed and tamed mind is free from loyalties,</P>
<P>Evil thoughts do not arise in me, if it happens, may rain come down."</P>
<P>24. The cowherd Dhaniya said:</P>

<P>And forefathers of the herd, if it happens, may rain come down."</P>
<P>27. ßThe Blessed said:</P>
<P>ßI have no calves, cows, cows bearing young ones, breeders, strong bulls,</P>
<P>Or even forefathers of the herd, if it happens, may rain come down."</P>
<P>28. The cowherd Dhaniya said:</P>
<P>ßPegs are well fixed, so that they would not move, the grass ropes are newly 
made</P>
<P>It's not possible the young cows should break them, if it happens, may rain 
come down."</P>
<P>29. The Blessed One said:</P>
<P>ßLike a strong bull I have broken the bonds, like an elephant destroyed the 
decaying creepers, </P>
<P>I would not approach a womb any more, if it happens, may rain come down." 
</P>
<P>30. Instantly a great shower came down, filling the valleys and the 
highlands</P>
<P>Hearing that sound, the cowherd Dhaniya said:---</P>
<P>31. ßIndeed, it is great gain that we saw the Blessed One ,</P>
<P>Wise one, we take your refuge. You are our Teacher</P>
<P>32. O! Well Gone One, my wife and I will lead the holy life in your 
dispensation</P>
<P>Reaching beyond birth and death, we will make an end of unpleasantness." </P>
<P>33. Death the evil one<SUP>2</SUP> said:</P>
<P>ßSons are the joy of those who have sons, cattle, the joy of those who have 
cattle,</P>
<P>Endearments are the joy of humans, without them there is no rejoicing."</P>
<P>34. The Blessed One said:</P>
<P>ßSons are the grief of those who have sons, cattle, the grief of those who 
have cattle,</P>
<P>Endearments are the grief of humans, where's grief without endearments." </P>

<P>4. Kasãbhàradvàja Sutta- The farmer Bhàradvàja.</P></B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I heard thus.</P>
<P>Once the Blessed One lived in the brahmin village Ekanàliya in Magadha, among 
the southern</P>
<P>hills. On a certain day about five hundred people were ploughing the fields 
of the farmer </P>
<P>Bhàradvàja. Then the Blessed One put on robes in the morning and taking bowl 
and robes</P>
<P>approached the work place of the farmer Bhàradvàja. The farmer at that time 
was distributing food</P>
<P>and the Blessed One approached the place where food was distributed and stood 
there for alms.</P>
<P>The brahmin seeing the Blessed One standing for alms said:"Recluse, I plough 
and sow and </P>
<P>then partake food, you too plough and sow and partake food.." The Blessed One 
said:</P>
<P>ßBrahmin, I too plough and sow and partake food." The brahmin said, ß We do 
not see good Gotama's </P>
<P>yoke, plough, plough share, driving stick or buffaloes, yet good Gotama says 
I plough, sow and</P>
<P>then partake food ß Then the farmer Bhàradvàja addressed the Blessed One in 
verse. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>76. ßWe know the farmer too well, we do not see him ploughing.,</P>
<P>Tell us that ploughing, we like to know your ploughing.."</P>
<P>77. ßFaith is the seed, austerities the rain, wisdom my yoke and plough,</P>
<P>Conscientiousness the pole, mind the reins, and mindfulness is my driving 
stick.</P>
<P>78. Restrained in body and words, I know the right amount to partake</P>
<P>Indeed I do the mowing, and forbearance is my release. </P>
<P>79.Effort is my yoked oxen, to run to the end of the yoke, </P>
<P>There if you go non-stop, you will not grieve.</P>
<P>80.Ploughing in this manner, results in the fruits of deathlessness,</P>
<P>Ploughing thus you are released from all unpleasantness. </P>
<P>Then the farmer Bhàradvàja served rich porridge into a huge bronze bowl and 
offered it to the</P>
<P>Blessed One and said. ß good Gotama, partake of the porridge since you plough 
for deathlessness.</P>
<P>81.ßLook, brahmin, food gained by chanting verses is not suitable for me</P>
<P>Becoming mindful of the Teaching, enlightened ones preach at the correct 
moment.</P>
<P>82. Offer those eatables and drinks to some perfected sage who has destroyed 
desires,</P>
<P>Has gone beyond doubts, it becomes a field of merit to one expecting 
merit."</P>
<P>ßO! Good Gotama, to whom shall I offer this porridge, ß ßBrahmin, among gods 
and</P>
<P>men, Màras, Brahmas, and the community of recluses and brahmins, I do not see 
anyone who </P>
<P>partaking this porridge, could completely digest it, other than a Thus Gone 
One or the disciple</P>
<P>of a Thus Gone One. Therefore throw it to a place where there is no green, or 
put it into some</P>
<P>water where there are no living things." Then the brahmin Bhàradvàja threw 
that porridge</P>
<P>into some water where there were no living things. That porridge thrown into 
the water,</P>
<P>made a hissing sound and fumigated, like a ploughshare heated throughout the 
day put in</P>
<P>the water would give a hissing sound and fumigate. Then the farmer Bhàradvàja 
frightened</P>
<P>and with hairs standing on end, approached the Blessed One, and putting his 
head at the feet of the</P>
<P>Blessed One said: ßGood Gotama, now I know! To me it seems that something 
overturned</P>
<P>is now re-installed. Something covered is made visible, One who has lost his 
way is shown</P>
<P>the way. And as though a lamp was lighted for the dark, so that those who 
have eyes could see</P>
<P>forms. Good Gotama, in various ways you have explained the Teaching. Now I 
take refuge in</P>
<P>good Gotama, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. May I gain the 
going forth</P>
<P>and the higher ordination in the dispensation of good Gotama." </P>
<P>Then the farmer Bhàradvàja obtained the going forth and the higher ordination 
in the dispen-</P>
<P>sation of the Blessed One. Soon after the higher ordination venerable 
Bhàradvàja secluded </P>
<P>and withdrawn from the crowd abode diligently to dispel, and before long , 
for whatever reason</P>
<P>sons of clansmen rightfully leave the household and go forth, that highest 
end of the holy life by </P>
<P>himself realising abode. He himself knew, birth is destroyed, the holy life 
is lived to the end ,</P>
<P>there is nothing more to wish for. Venerable Bhàradvàja became one of the 
arahants.<SUP>1</SUP> </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>5. Cunda Sutta- To Cunda.</P></B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>83. Cundakammàraputta asked the Blessed One:</P>
<P>ßI ask the wise enlightened lord of the Teaching, the noble two footed 
charioteer free of greed, </P>
<P>How many recluses are there in the world"</P>
<P>84. The Blessed One said: </P>
<P>ßCunda, there are only four, not a fifth, asked, I will explain them with 
examples,</P>
<P>Winner of the path, proclaimer of the path, abider on the path and the soiler 
of the path."</P>
<P>85. Cundakammàraputta asked the Blessed One:</P>
<P>ßTo whom do enlightened ones say winners of the path, how is the proclaimer 
described,</P>
<P>Explain the abider on the path, and explain to me the soiler of the path. 
</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>86. The Blessed One said:</P>
<P>ßWith doubts dispelled, arrow pulled out and greed dispelled is attached to 
extinction,</P>
<P>He is a leader to the world together with the gods. Enlightened Ones say such 
are </P>
<P>winners of the path.</P>
<P>87. One knowing the highest as the highest, would preach and explain that 
same Teaching ,</P>
<P>That unwavering sage, doubts overcome, is second bhikkhu, the proclaimer of 
the path. </P>
<P>.</P>
<P>88. He who lives according to the well preached Teaching, skilfully and 
mindfully,</P>
<P>Developing the mental states not blameworthy, is third bhikkhu, the abider on 
the path.</P>
<P>89. Disguised as a virtuous one the daring highway robber springs,</P>
<P>The deceitful untrained noisy one, lives disguised, he is soiler of the 
path.</P>
<P>90. It is hard for the ordinary one to know these, the wise noble disciples, 
know all of them, </P>
<P>as they really are,</P>
<P>Knowing, they do not place faith in them, how could the wicked impure be 
compared to the </P>
<P>not wicked pure." </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>6. Paràbhava Sutta.- The downfall.</P></B>
<P>I heard thus.</P>
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anàthapindika 
in Jeta's grove in</P>
<P>Sàvatthi When that night was waning a certain deity, illuminating the whole 
of Jeta's grove</P>
<P>approached the Blessed One, worshipped ,stood on a side and addressed the 
Blessed One in verse.</P>
<P>91. ßO! Blessed Gotama, we came to ask about man's downfall,</P>
<P>What are the causes for man's downfall."</P>
<P>92. "Know well the growth, so also the downfall</P>
<P>The lover of the Teaching grows and the hater has a downfall".</P>
<P>93. "Now we know the first cause for man's downfall.</P>
<P>May the Blessed One tell the second cause for man's downfall."</P>
<P>94. ßBecomes dear to the unappeased, and does not like the appeased</P>
<P>Desires the Teaching of the unappeased and has a downfall."</P>

<P>97. ßNow we know the third cause for man's downfall.</P>

<P>98 ßIf someone does not support his mother and father,</P>
<P>Decayed and youthfulness gone, he has a downfall."</P>
<P>99. "Now we know the fourth cause for man's downfall.</P>
<P>May the Blessed One tell the fifth cause for man's downfall." </P>
<P>100. "If someone deceives a brahmin, a recluse or even a beggar,</P>
<P>Telling lies, he has a downfall."</P>
<P>101 ßNow, we know the fifth cause for man's downfall.</P>
<P>May the Blessed One tell the sixth cause for man's downfall."</P>
<P>102 ßA man with much wealth, gold and much food,</P>
<P>Partakes of it by himself and has a downfall."</P>
<P>103.ßNow, we know sixth cause for man's downfall.</P>
<P>May the Blessed One tell the seventh cause for man's downfall. </P>
<P>104. ßA man proud about his birth, wealth , or clan ,</P>
<P>Belittles his relations and has a downfall."</P>
<P>105. ßNow, we know the seventh cause for man's downfall</P>
<P>May the Blessed One tell the eighth cause for man's downfall."</P>
<P>106."A man indulging in women, intoxicating drinks or betting ,</P>
<P>Spends all his earnings and has a downfall". </P>
<P>107." Now, we know the eighth cause for man's downfall,</P>
<P>May the Blessed One tell the ninth cause for man's downfall."</P>
<P>108."A man dissatisfied with his wife, is seen with whores,</P>
<P>And is seen with other's wives, and has a downfall."</P>
<P>109. ßNow, we know the ninth cause for man's downfall.</P>

<P>110. ßA man who is not young any more, brings along a young wife,</P>
<P>And jealous of her would not sleep, and has a downfall."</P>
<P>111."Now we know the tenth cause for man's downfall.</P>
<P>May the Blessed One tell the eleventh cause for man's downfall."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>112."A man fond of women, a spendthrift, or such like one,</P>
<P>Is given supremacy and has a downfall."</P>
<P>113."Now, we know the eleventh cause for man's downfall,</P>
<P>May the Blessed One tell the twelfth cause for man's downfall."</P>
<P>114."A man with little means and much craving born to a warrior clan.</P>
<P>Wishes to be the ruler, and has a downfall."</P>
<P>115ßThe wise see these as the causes for downfall, </P>
<P>The noble ones who have come to righteousness of view become happy."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>7. Vasala Sutta. The Outcaste.</P></B>
<P>I heard thus.</P>
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery of Anàthapindika, in 
Jeta's grove in </P>
<P>Sàvatthi. Then the Blessed One putting on robes in the morning, taking bowl 
and robes entered </P>
<P>Sàvatthi for alms. At that time in the house of the brahmin Aggikabhàradvàja 
the fire was </P>
<P>lighted to perform the fire sacrifice. The Blessed One going for alms in due 
order approached the</P>
<P>house of the brahmin Aggikabhàradvàja. The brahmin saw the Blessed One 
approaching</P>
<P>from a distance and said thus to the Blessed One. ßYou shaveling, you 
recluse, you outcaste</P>
<P>stop there. Then the Blessed One asked: ßO! Brahmin, do you know an outcaste 
, or the factors</P>
<P>that make an outcaste". The brahmin said, ßGood Gotama, I do not know the 
outcaste or the </P>
<P>factors that make an outcaste. It is for my good, if the outcaste and the 
factors that make an </P>
<P>outcaste are taught". ßIf so brahmin, listen carefully and pay attention I 
will tell" and the Blessed</P>
<P>One said thus:</P>
<P>116."If man is angry, with ill-will and with the evil contempt </P>
<P>Is crafty with the view gone wrong, know him as an outcaste.</P>
<P>117. If he harms those born, or even eggs</P>
<P>And has no compassion for living things, know him as an outcaste.</P>
<P>118. If one kills and robs in village and hamlet</P>
<P>And is known for that kind of action, know him as an outcaste.</P>
<P>119. In the village and the forest, if one robs</P>
<P>And takes things not given to him, know him as an outcaste.</P>
<P>120. One who has borrowed money, when asked to repay would run away,</P>
<P>Saying I have not borrowed money, know him as an outcaste.</P>
<P>121. If one kills people gone to the forest, for some work</P>
<P>And robs their few belongings, know him as an outcaste.</P>
<P>122 A man when asked to give evidence would tell lies </P>
<P>For his good, for another's good , or for some money, know him as an 
outcaste.</P>
<P>123. If a man turns out his relations, or children or wives,</P>
<P>Violently or by friendly means, know him as an outcaste.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>124. If a rich man does not support his decayed mother and father,</P>
<P>Gone beyond youth, know him as an outcaste..</P>
<P>. </P>
<P>125. If one arouses the anger of mother, father , brother or sister,</P>
<P>By beating or with rough words, know him as an outcaste.</P>
<P>126. When advice is asked, the wrong advice is given,</P>
<P>With secret intentions, know him as an outcaste.</P>
<P>127. One having done demerit, desires, may my actions be not known,</P>
<P>He with secretive actions should be known as an outcaste.</P>
<P>128. Gone to another family, if one is well fed</P>
<P>If that hospitality is not returned, know him as an outcaste.</P>
<P>129. If one deceives a brahmin, a recluse or even a beggar </P>
<P>By telling lies, know him as an outcaste.</P>
<P>130 A brahmin or recluse arrived at meal time is annoyed with words,</P>
<P>And nothing is offered to him, know him as an outcaste.</P>
<P>131. If one deluded shouts for some trifling matter,</P>
<P>Without any good reason, know him as an outcaste.</P>
<P>132. If one praises oneself and disparages others</P>
<P>Measuring others on account of his conceit, know him as an outcaste.</P>
<P>133. The wrathful, greedy, selfish, crafty, evil desired one </P>
<P>Without conscience and remorse is as an outcaste. . </P>
<P>134. He that runs down the enlightened one, his disciples </P>
<P>Those gone forth and householders is an outcaste. </P>
<P>135. He that acknowledges he is perfect, without that attainment, </P>
<P>Is a robber in this and the Brahmà world, he is the worst of outcastes.</P>
<P>I declare that these are the outcastes.</P>
<P>136. By birth one does not become an outcaste, or a brahmin.</P>
<P>By actions one becomes an outcaste, and a brahmin. </P>
<P>137. Know this too according to the example I give,</P>
<P>How Sopàka the son of the outcaste became known as Màtanga.</P>
<P>138. Màtanga the rare one became perfect and famous</P>
<P>And many warriors and brahmins came to wait on him.</P>
<P>139. He ascended the heavenly chariot and rode resplendent on the highway</P>
<P>Giving up sensuality was born in the world of Brahmà, birth did not stop him 
from that.</P>
<P>140. Those born in brahmin families and related to the reciters of the sacred 
sayings</P>
<P>Are constantly seen involved in demerit.</P>
<P>141. Here and now debased, hereafter are born in loss</P>
<P>Birth does not stop them from being debased and going to loss.</P>
<P>142. By birth one does not become an outcaste, or a brahmin.</P>
<P>By actions one becomes an outcaste and a brahmin". </P>
<P>When this was said, the brahmin Aggikabhàradvàja said thus to the Blessed 
One: ßGood </P>
<P>Gotama, now I know, to me it seems that something overturned is re-installed, 
something </P>
<P>covered is made manifest. It seems as though the path was shown to one who 
had lost his way.</P>
<P>It seems as though an oil lamp was lighted for the darkness, so that those 
who have eyes could</P>
<P>see forms. In various ways good Gotama has explained the Teaching. .</P>
<P>Now I take refuge in good Gotama, the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. 
May</P>
<P>good Gotama think of me as one who has taken refuge from today until life 
lasts". </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>8. Metta Sutta. Loving kindness.</P></B>
<P>143. What profitable things should be done to attain that appeased 
state..</P>
<P>Be able, straight forward, quite straight forward, suave, gentle, and not 
conceited.</P>
<P>144. Satisfied, easily supported, have few things to do and a light 
living,</P>
<P>Mental faculties calmed become clever, not daring, and not greedily attached 
to families. </P>
<P>145. The slightest thing looked down by other wise ones should not be 
done,</P>
<P>May mental happiness and appeasement be , may all come to well being. </P>
<P>146. Who ever living thing be infirm or firm or otherwise, </P>
<P>Long or huge, middle sized, short or very small</P>
<P>147. Seen and not seen, living far and near,</P>
<P>Born and to be born, - may all beings be well and happy.</P>

mind.</P>
<P>149.Like a mother protecting her only son's life would think,</P>
<P>Develop that same thought towards all beings limitlessly.</P>
<P>150. Develop loving kindness too towards all beings limitlessly</P>
<P>Above, below, across, without an obstacle, anger or enmity.</P>
<P>151. Standing, sitting, or walking or even when lying as long as awake</P>
<P>Intend this mental attitude, it is called the divine abiding..</P>
<P>152. Not tarrying in any view, become virtuous and come to righteousness of 
view</P>

<P>9. Hemavata Sutta. To the Demon Hemavata.</P></B>
<P>153. The demon Sàtàgiri said:</P>
<P>ßToday is the fifteenth day of the waxing moon, it is the heavenly night.. 
</P>
<P>We will see Gotama the Teacher with perfect name." </P>
<P>154. The demon Hemavata said:</P>
<P>ßHow, is his mind established is it alike towards all beings</P>

<P>155. The demon Sàtàgiri said:</P>
<P>ßHis mind is established, it is alike towards all beings, </P>
<P>He has power over thoughts agreeable and disagreeable".</P>

<P>ßDoes he not take what is not given, how, is he restrained towards beings</P>
<P>Is he far away from negligence, has he not abandoned jhàna."</P>
<P>157. The demon Sàtàgiri said: </P>
<P>ßHe does not take what is not given, is restrained towards beings,</P>
<P>Is far away from negligence, the Blessed One has not abandoned jhàna. </P>
<P>158. The demon Hemavata said:</P>

<P>Does he not curse, and talk frivolously</P>
<P>159òhe demon Sàtàgiri said:</P>

<P>ßHis mind does not linger in sensuality and it is undisturbed,</P>
<P>He has overcome all delusion, and the Enlightened One's Teaching is wise"</P>
<P>162. The demon Hemavata said: </P>
<P>ß Is he endowed with knowledge and pure conduct . </P>
<P>Are his desires destroyed, and hasn't he future rebirth."</P>
<P>163òhe demon Ssatàgiri said:</P>
<P>ß He is endowed with knowledge and pure conduct,</P>
<P>All desires destroyed, has no future rebirth.</P>
<P>163a. The sage is endowed with an action destroyed mind,</P>
<P>He is praiseworthy, for the endowment knowledge and conduct.</P>
<P>163bòhe sage is endowed with an action destroyed mind, </P>
<P>We appreciate his endowment of knowledge and conduct.</P>
<P>164. The sage is endowed with an action destroyed mind,</P>
<P>Is endowed with knowledge and conduct, now we will see him. </P>
<P>165. Has thin limbs like an antelope, is wise and eats little food without

<P>Let's go and see the sage Gotama, concentrating in the forest.</P>
<P>166. Is like a lion, not desiring sensuality is like a roaming single 
elephant. </P>
<P>Let's approach and ask the release from Death </P>
<P>167. He is a preacher and practiser who has gone beyond all things.</P>
<P>We will ask enlightened Gotama, who has overcome anger and fear.</P>
<P>168. The demon Hemavata asked:</P>
<P>ßHow has the world arisen and how are acquaintances made, </P>
<P>On what is the world supported, and how does it get destroyed."</P>
<P>169. The Blessed One said;</P>
<P>ßHemavata, the world arises in the six, and acquaintances are on the six </P>
<P>Supported on these same six, the world gets destroyed in the six".</P>
<P>170. ßHow is that supportive condition, from where the world gets 
destroyed,</P>
<P>Explain the release, how is the release from unpleasantness."</P>
<P>171. ßIn the world there are five strands of sense desires, the mind is the 
sixth</P>
<P>Cutting up interest there, comes the release from unpleasantness.</P>
<P>172òhis is the release from the world, preached to you as it really is,</P>
<P>I tell you again, this is the release from unpleasantness.."</P>
<P>173 ßWho will cross the flood, and who will cross the ocean, </P>
<P>Not taking a footing and not supported who will not sink in the deep." .</P>
<P>174. ßAlways endowed with virtues, wise and concentrated, </P>
<P>With mindfulness turned inwards, he crosses the flood. difficult to cross. 
</P>
<P>175. Turning away from sensual perceptions and reaching beyond all bonds</P>
<P>With the destruction of the interest `to be', one does not sink in the 
deep."</P>
<P>176. "With deep wisdom, cleverly sees the essential, not soiled by sensuality 
in any way,</P>
<P>The sage goes along the divine path, released in every way.</P>
<P>177òhe sage with perfect name sees the essential cleverly, and gives 
wisdom</P>

<P>That we saw the all Enlightened One, who has crossed the flood and has no 
desires.</P>
<P>179. We a thousand demons, all powerful and famous, take your refuge,</P>
<P>You are our Teacher incomparable.</P>
<P>180. Now we will go from village to village and from town to town</P>
<P>Worshipping the all Enlightened One and the goodness of the Teaching."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>10. âlavaka Sutta. To âlavaka the Demon.</P></B>
<P>Thus I heard.</P>
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the domain of the demon Aalavaka. Then 
the demon Aalavaka</P>
<P>approached the Blessed One and said: ßRecluse, go out." The Blessed One said: 
ßAlright friend."</P>
<P>and went out. Then he said ßRecluse, enter." The Blessed One said ßAlright 
friend"</P>
<P>and entered.. For the second time, the demon said ßRecluse, go out." The 
Blessed One said:</P>
<P>ßAlright, friend" and went out Again, the demon said, ßRecluse, enter." The 
Blessed One</P>
<P>said: ßAlright friend" and entered. For the third time the demon said: 
ßRecluse, go out."</P>
<P>The Blessed One said:"Alright, friend" and went out. Again the demon said, 
ßRecluse, enter."</P>
<P>The Blessed One said: ßAlright, friend" and entered. For the fourth time the 
demon said:</P>
<P>ßRecluse, go out" The Blessed One said: ßFriend, I will not go out , do 
whatever you could</P>
<P>do.".</P>
<P>ßRecluse, I will ask you a question, if you do not explain it, I will confuse 
your mind, or will split</P>
<P>your heart, or will take you by the feet and throw to the other bank of the 
river."</P>
<P>ßIn this world of gods and men, together with Màras, Brahmas, and the 
community of recluses</P>
<P>and brahmins I do not see anyone who could confuse my mind, or split my 
heart, or taken by the feet</P>
<P>could throw me to the other bank of the river. Yet, do ask, whatever you 
desire to. Then the demon</P>
<P>Aalavaka addressed the Blessed One in verse.</P>
<P>181."Of wealths what is the foremost to a man, what well practised brings 
pleasantness </P>
<P>Of tastes what is the foremost, and living how is the foremost 
livelihood."</P>
<P>182.."Faith, is the foremost wealth to man, the Teaching well practised 
brings pleasantness.</P>
<P>Of tastes truth is the foremost The livelihood of one living wisely is said 
to be the foremost."</P>
<P>183. ßHow is the flood crossed, how is the ocean crossed,</P>
<P>How does unpleasantness exhaust, and how does purity come about."</P>
<P>184. ßWith faith, the flood is crossed, with diligence the ocean,</P>
<P>With effort unpleasantness gets exhausted, and with wisdom purity comes 
about"</P>
<P>. </P>
<P>185."How is wisdom obtained and how is the wealth experienced,</P>
<P>How does one become famous, and how are friends bound.</P>
<P>Gone from this to the next world, how is there no grief."</P>
<P>186. ßPlacing faith in the perfect state and the Teaching to attain 
extinction,</P>
<P>Those that listen to it diligently and discriminatingly gain wisdom. </P>
<P>187. Those suitably yoked with aroused effort experience the Teaching</P>
<P>Through truthfulness one becomes famous and by giving friends are bound. </P>
<P>188. To a householder with faith, if there be truthfulness, training, </P>
<P>Right view and generosity, he would not grieve afterwards. </P>
<P>189. Now come on, question other recluses and brahmins, to know,</P>
<P>Whether there is much truthfulness, training, generosity and forbearance 
evident here. </P>
<P>190. ßWhat is there to question now, from recluses and brahmins</P>
<P>Today I know what is essential for the next birth.</P>
<P>191` It is for my good that the Enlightened One came to Aalavi,</P>
<P>Now I know that, given to whom is of much fruit. </P>
<P>192öow I will go from village to village and from town to town,</P>

<P>193.When walking, standing, sitting or even lying, it is bending and 
stretching,</P>
<P>These are the movements of the body.</P>

<P>The body is covered up with the skin, and the true state is not seen.</P>
<P>195òhe inside is full, the stomach is full with the liver and sexual 
organs</P>

<P>With blood, oil of the joints, bile and the hardened oil. </P>
<P>197òhen from the nine external doors secrete filth all the time.</P>
<P>Through the eyes and ears there are secretions</P>
<P>198òhere is snot coming from the nose and through the mouth vomit,</P>
<P>So also bile or phlegm is vomited, from all over the body sweat trickles</P>

<P>The fool deluded thinks it is something agreeable.</P>
<P>200. When he lies on his back dead, bloated and turned blue</P>

<P>201. It is eaten by dogs, jackals, wolves and worms, </P>
<P>Crows and hawks too eat it, and whatever other creatures there be.</P>
<P>202 The bhikkhu hearing the words of the Enlightened One, becomes wise,</P>
<P>Looks at the body as it really is, and learns it thoroughly.</P>
<P>203..As I am now, this body also was: as this body is, so I will be,</P>
