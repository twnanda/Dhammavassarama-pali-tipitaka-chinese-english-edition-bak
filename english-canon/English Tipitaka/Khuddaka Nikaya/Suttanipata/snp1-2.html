<h3>Notes</h3>
<b><A NAME="n1">1</A>.</b> Dhaniya Gopa: Literally, one whose wealth is in cattle. According to the Commentary, his herd consisted of 30,000 head of cattle.
<!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<A HREF="#1">Go back</A>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END -->
<p>
<b><A NAME="n2">2</A>.</b> The first line in the Buddha's verse plays on words in the first line of Dhaniya's. "Free from anger" <i>(akkodhano)</i> plays on "rice is cooked" <i>(pakkodano);</i> and "stubbornness"<i> (khilo)</i> plays on "milk"<i> (khiro).</i>
<!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<A HREF="#2">Go back</A>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END -->
<p>
<b><A NAME="n3">3</A>.</b> "Open" means having a mind not covered or concealed by craving, defilement, or ignorance. This image is also used in <A HREF="../udana/ud5-5.html">Ud V.5</A> and <A HREF="snp4-4.html">Sn IV.4</A>. "My fire out" refers to the fires of passion, aversion, &amp; delusion; birth, aging, &amp; death; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair. See <A HREF="../../samyutta/sn35-28.html">SN XXXV.28</A>; <A HREF="../itivuttaka/iti3.html#93">Iti 93</A>; and <i><A HREF="../../../lib/modern/likefire/index.html">The Mind Like Fire Unbound</A>.</i>
<!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<A HREF="#3">Go back</A>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END -->
<p>
<b><A NAME="n4">4</A>.</b> The raft stands for the noble eightfold path. See passages <A HREF="../../../lib/modern/wings/2h.html#113">113</A> and <A HREF="../../../lib/modern/wings/2h.html#114">114</A> in <i>The Wings to Awakening.</i>
<!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<A HREF="#4">Go back</A>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END -->
<p>
<b><A NAME="n5">5</A>.</b> As this verse doesn't seem to be a direct response to the preceding one, the Commentary suggests that we are missing part of the conversation here. An alternative possibility is that the Buddha is engaging in word play -- the word "crossed over" <i>(tinna)</i> being a pun on Dhaniya's reference to grass<i> (tina).</i>
<!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<A HREF="#5">Go back</A>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END -->
<p>
<b><A NAME="n6">6</A>.</b> According to the Commentary, the Buddha is not in anyone else's employ nor even in his own employ -- i.e., he is not in the employ of craving.
<!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<A HREF="#6">Go back</A>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END -->
<p>
<b><A NAME="n7">7</A>.</b> The Buddha may be speaking literally here -- he has no cattle, so there is no way that a heavy rain could cause him harm -- but he may also be speaking metaphorically. See <A HREF="../../samyutta/sn4-19.html">SN IV.19</A>.
<!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<A HREF="#7">Go back</A>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END -->
<p>
<b><A NAME="n8">8</A>.</b> According to the Commentary, Mara suddenly comes on the scene to try -- unsuccessfully -- to prevent Dhaniya and his wife from going forth. His verses here, together with the Buddha's response, are also found at <A HREF="../../samyutta/sn4-8.html">SN IV.8</A>.
