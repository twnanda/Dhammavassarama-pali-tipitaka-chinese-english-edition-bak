<h3>Notes</h3>
<b><A NAME="n11-1">1</A>.</b> As other passages in this poem indicate (<A HREF="#n11-5">see note 5, below</A>), the goal is not measured in terms of knowledge, but as this passage points out, knowledge is a necessary part of the path to the goal.
<!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<A HREF="#11-1">Go back</A>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END -->
<p>
<b><A NAME="n11-2">2</A>.</b> According to Nd.I, this passage is describing the four formless jhanas, but as the first three of the formless jhanas involve perception (of infinite space, infinite consciousness, and nothingness), only the fourth of the formless jhanas -- the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception -- would fit this description.
<!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<A HREF="#11-2">Go back</A>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END -->
<p>
<b><A NAME="n11-3">3</A>.</b> Complication-classifications <i>(papa&ntilde;ca-sankha)</i>: The mind's tendency to read distinctions and differentiations even into the simplest experience of the present, thus giving rise to views that can issue in conflict. As <A HREF="snp4-14.html">Sn IV.14</A> points out, the root of these classifications is the perception, "I am the thinker." For further discussion of this point, see <A HREF="snp4-14.html#n14-1">note 1</A> to that discourse and the introduction to <A HREF="../../majjhima/mn18.html">MN 18</A>.

<p>
<b><A NAME="n11-4">4</A>.</b> "Spirit" is the usual rendering of the Pali word, <i>yakkha.</i> According to Nd.I, however, in this context the word <i>yakkha</i> means person, individual, human being, or living being.
<!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<A HREF="#11-4">Go back</A>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END -->
<p>
<b><A NAME="n11-5">5</A>.</b> In other words, the sage knows that both groups in the previous stanza fall back on their knowledge as a measure of the goal, without comprehending the dependency still latent in their knowledge. The sages in the first group are mistaking the experience of neither perception nor non-perception as the goal, and so they are still dependent on that state of concentration. The sages in the second group, by the fact that they claim to be skilled, show that there is still a latent conceit in their awakening-like experience, and thus it is not totally independent of clinging. (For more on this point, see <A HREF="../../../lib/modern/likefire/2-3.html#mn102">MN 102</A>, quoted in <i>The Mind Like Fire Unbound,</i> pp. 81-82.) Both groups still maintain the concept of a "spirit" that is purified in the realization of purity. Once these dependencies are comprehended, one gains release from disputes and from states of becoming and not-becoming. It is in this way that knowledge is a means to the goal, but the goal itself is not measured or defined in terms of knowledge.
