<blockquote>
Staying attached to the cave,<br>
covered heavily over,[<a HREF="#n2-1" NAME="2-1">1</A>]<br>
a person sunk in confusion<br>
is far from seclusion -- <br>
for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sensual pleasures<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sensual desires[<a HREF="#n2-2" NAME="2-2">2</A>]<br>
in the world<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are not lightly let go.
<p>
Those chained by desire,<br>
bound by becoming's allure,<br>
aren't easily released<br>
for there's no liberation by others.<br>
Intent, in front or behind,[<a HREF="#n2-3" NAME="2-3">3</A>]<br>
on hunger for sensual pleasures<br>
here or before -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; greedy<br>
for sensual pleasures,<br>
busy, deluded, ungenerous,<br>
entrenched in the out-of-tune way,[<a HREF="#n2-4" NAME="2-4">4</A>]<br>
they -- impelled into pain -- lament:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What will we be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when we pass on from here?"
<p>
So a person should train<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right here &amp; now.<br>
Whatever you know<br>
as out-of-tune in the world,<br>
don't, for its sake, act out-of-tune,<br>
for that life, the enlightened say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is short.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see them,<br>
in the world, floundering around,<br>
people immersed in craving<br>
for states of becoming.<br>
Base people moan in the mouth of death,<br>
their craving, for states of becoming &amp; not-,[<a HREF="#n2-5" NAME="2-5">5</A>]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unallayed.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See them,<br>
floundering in their sense of <i>mine,</i><br>
<A NAME="fish">like fish</A> in the puddles<br>
of a dried-up stream -- <br>
and, seeing this,<br>
live with no <i>mine,</i><br>
not forming attachment<br>
for states of becoming.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subdue desire<br>
for both sides,[<a HREF="#n2-6" NAME="2-6">6</A>]<br>
comprehending[<a HREF="#n2-7" NAME="2-7">7</A>] sensory contact,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with no greed.
<p>
Doing nothing for which<br>
he himself<br>
would rebuke himself,<br>
the enlightened person doesn't adhere<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to what's seen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to what's heard.<br>
Comprehending perception,<br>
he'd cross over the flood -- <br>
the sage not stuck<br>
on possessions.<br>
Then, with arrow removed,<br>
living heedfully, he longs for neither -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this world,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the next.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
<b><A NAME="n2-1">1</A>.</b> Nd.I: "Covered heavily over" with defilements and unskillful mental qualities.
<!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<A HREF="#2-1">Go back</A>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END -->
<p>
<b><A NAME="n2-2">2</A>.</b> "Sensual desires/sensual pleasures": two possible meanings of <i>kama.</i> According to Nd.I, both meanings are intended here.
<!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<A HREF="#2-2">Go back</A>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END -->
<p>
<b><A NAME="n2-3">3</A>.</b> Nd.I: "In front" means experienced in the past (as does "before" two lines down); "behind" means to-be-experienced in the future.
<!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<A HREF="#2-3">Go back</A>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END -->
<p>
<b><A NAME="n2-4">4</A>.</b> Nd.I: "The out-of-tune way" means the ten types of unskillful action (see <A HREF="../../anguttara/an10-176.html">AN X.176</A>).
<!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<A HREF="#2-4">Go back</A>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END -->
<p>
<b><A NAME="n2-5">5</A>.</b> States of not-becoming are oblivious states of becoming that people can get themselves into through a desire for annihilation, either after death or as a goal of their religious striving (see <A HREF="../itivuttaka/iti2.html#49">Iti 49</A>). As with all states of becoming, these states are impermanent and stressful.
<!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<A HREF="#2-5">Go back</A>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END -->
<p>
<b><A NAME="n2-6">6</A>.</b> According to Nd.I, "both sides" here has several possible meanings: sensory contact and the origination of sensory contact; past and future; name and form; internal and external sense media; self-identity and the origination of self-identity. It also might mean states of becoming and not-becoming, mentioned in the previous verse and below, in <A HREF="snp4-5.html">Sn IV.5</A>.
<!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<A HREF="#2-6">Go back</A>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END -->
<p>
<b><A NAME="n2-7">7</A>.</b> Nd.I: Comprehending sensory contact has three aspects: being able to identify and distinguish types of sensory contact; contemplating the true nature of sensory contact (e.g., inconstant, stressful, and not-self); and abandoning attachment to sensory contact. The same three aspects would apply to comprehending perception, as mentioned in the following verse.
