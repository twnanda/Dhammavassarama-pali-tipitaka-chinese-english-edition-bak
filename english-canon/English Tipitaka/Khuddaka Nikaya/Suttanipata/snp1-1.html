<B>Translator's note:</B> A comparative study among the records of various early Buddhist schools suggests that the verses here, like those in <A HREF="snp1-3.html">I.3</A>, were originally separate poems, spoken on separate occasions, and that they have been gathered together because they share the same refrain.

The monk who subdues his arisen anger<br>
as, with herbs, snake-venom once it has spread,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sloughs off the near shore &amp; far -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a snake, its decrepit old skin.
<p>
The monk who has cut off passion<br>
without leaving a trace,<br>
as he would plunging into a lake, a lotus,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sloughs off the near shore &amp; far -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a snake, its decrepit old skin.
<p>
The monk who has cut off craving<br>
without leaving a trace,<br>
as if he had dried up a swift-flowing stream,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a snake, its decrepit old skin.
<p>
The monk who has demolished conceit<br>
without leaving a trace,<br>
as a great flood, a very weak bridge made of reeds,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a snake, its decrepit old skin.
<p>
The monk seeing<br>
in states of becoming<br>
no essence,<br>
as he would,<br>
when surveying a fig tree,<br>
no flowers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sloughs off the near shore &amp; far -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a snake, its decrepit old skin.
<p>
The monk with no inner anger,<br>
who has thus gone beyond<br>
becoming &amp; not-,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sloughs off the near shore &amp; far -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a snake, its decrepit old skin.
<p>
The monk whose discursive thoughts are dispersed,<br>
well-dealt with inside<br>
without leaving a trace,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sloughs off the near shore &amp; far -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a snake, its decrepit old skin.
<p>
The monk who hasn't slipped past or turned back,<br>
transcending all<br>
this complication,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sloughs off the near shore &amp; far -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a snake, its decrepit old skin.
<p>
The monk who hasn't slipped past or turned back,<br>
knowing with regard to the world<br>
that "All this is unreal,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sloughs off the near shore &amp; far -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a snake, its decrepit old skin.
<p>
The monk who hasn't slipped past or turned back,<br>
without greed, as "All this is unreal,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sloughs off the near shore &amp; far -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a snake, its decrepit old skin.
<p>
The monk who hasn't slipped past or turned back,<br>
without aversion, as "All this is unreal,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sloughs off the near shore &amp; far -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a snake, its decrepit old skin.
<p>
The monk who hasn't slipped past or turned back,<br>
without delusion, as "All this is unreal,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sloughs off the near shore &amp; far -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a snake, its decrepit old skin.
<p>
The monk in whom there are no latent tendencies<br>
-- the roots of unskillfulness totally destroyed -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sloughs off the near shore &amp; far -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a snake, its decrepit old skin.
<p>
The monk in whom there's nothing born of distress<br>
that would lead him back to this shore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sloughs off the near shore &amp; far -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a snake, its decrepit old skin.
<p>
The monk in whom there's nothing born of desire<br>
that would keep him bound to becoming,<br>

<p>
The monk who's abandoned five hindrances,<br>
who, untroubled, unwounded,<br>
has crossed over doubt,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sloughs off the near shore &amp; far -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a snake, its decrepit old skin.
