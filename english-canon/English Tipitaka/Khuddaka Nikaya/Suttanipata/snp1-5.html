"I ask the sage of abundant discernment,<br>
awakened, lord of the Dhamma, free<br>
of craving, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; supreme <br>
among two-legged beings, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; best<br>
of charioteers:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How many contemplatives <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are there in the world?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please tell me."

"Four contemplatives, Cunda. There isn't a fifth.<br>
Being asked face-to-face, I'll explain:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Victor of the path,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the teacher of the path,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one who lives the by path,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; one who corrupts the path."

call the Victor of the path<br>

Tell me the one who lives by the path,<br>

"<A NAME="arrow">He's</A> crossed over perplexity,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Awakened<br>

He here knows the foremost as foremost,<br>
who right here shows &amp; analyzes the Dhamma,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he's called the second of monks,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the teacher of the path.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mindful, restrained,<br>
he lives by the well-taught &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dhamma-principles,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; path,<br>

going around in disguise:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he's one who corrupts the path.
<p>
Any householder, having ferreted these out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- a discerning disciple of those who are noble --<br>
knowing they aren't all the same,<br>

A corrupter of families is a monk who ingratiates himself into a family's affections by performing services for them that are inappropriate for a monk to do, thus diverting their faith away from those who live by the Dhamma and Vinaya. For more on this term, see <A HREF="../../../lib/modern/bmc/ch5.html#13"><i>The Buddhist Monastic Code,</i> Sanghadisesa 13</A>.
