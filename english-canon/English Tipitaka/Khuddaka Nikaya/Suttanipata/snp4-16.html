"Never before<br>
have I seen or heard<br>
from anyone<br>
of a teacher with such lovely speech<br>
come, together with his following<br>
from Tusita heaven,[<a HREF="#n16-1" NAME="16-1">1</A>]<br>
as the One with Eyes<br>
who appears to the world with its devas<br>
having dispelled all darkness<br>
having arrived at delight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all alone.
<p>
To that One Awakened -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unentangled, Such, un-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deceptive,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; come with his following -- <br>
I have come with a question<br>
on behalf of the many<br>
here who are fettered.<br>
For a monk disaffected,<br>
frequenting a place that's remote -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the root of a tree,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a cemetery,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in mountain caves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; various places to stay -- <br>
how many are the fears there<br>
at which he shouldn't tremble<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- there in his noiseless abode -- <br>
how many the dangers in the world<br>
for the monk &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; going the direction<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he never has gone<br>
that he should transcend<br>
there in his isolated abode?<br>
What should be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the ways of his speech?<br>
What should be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his range there of action?<br>
What should be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a resolute monk's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; precepts &amp; practices?[<a HREF="#n16-2" NAME="16-2">2</A>]<br>
<A NAME="silver">Undertaking</A> what training<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- alone, astute, &amp; mindful -- <br>
would he blow away<br>
his own impurities<br>
as a silver smith,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those in molten silver?"

<i>The Buddha:</i>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"I will tell you<br>
as one who knows,<br>
what is comfort<br>
for one disaffected<br>
resorting to a remote place,<br>
desiring self-awakening<br>
in line with the Dhamma.<br>
An enlightened monk,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; living circumscribed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mindful,<br>
shouldn't fear the five fears:<br>
of horseflies, mosquitoes, snakes,<br>
human contact, four-footed beings;<br>
shouldn't be disturbed<br>
by those following another's teaching<br>
even on seeing their manifold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terrors;<br>
should overcome still other<br>
further dangers<br>
as he seeks what is skillful.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Touched<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the touch<br>
of discomforts, hunger,<br>
he should endure cold<br>
&amp; inordinate heat.<br>
He with no home,<br>
in many ways touched by these things,<br>
striving, should make firm his persistence.
<p>
He shouldn't commit a theft,<br>
shouldn't speak a lie,<br>
should touch with thoughts of good will<br>
beings firm &amp; infirm.<br>
Conscious of when<br>
his mind is stirred up &amp; turbid,<br>
he should dispel it:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It's on the Dark One's side.'
<p>
He shouldn't come under the sway<br>
of anger or pride.<br>
Having dug up their root<br>
he would stand firm.<br>
Then, when prevailing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- yes -- <br>
he'd prevail over his sense of dear &amp; undear.<br>
Yearning &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for discernment<br>
enraptured &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with what's admirable,<br>
he should overcome these dangers,<br>
should conquer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discontent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in his isolated spot,<br>
should conquer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these four<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thoughts of lament:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What will I eat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or where will I eat.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How badly I slept.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonight were will I sleep?'
<p>
These lamenting thoughts<br>
he should subdue -- <br>
one under training,<br>
wandering without home.<br>
Receiving food &amp; cloth<br>
at appropriate times,<br>
he should have a sense of enough<br>
for the sake of contentment.[<a HREF="#n16-3" NAME="16-3">3</A>]<br>
Guarded in regard to these things<br>
going restrained into a village,<br>
even when harassed<br>
he shouldn't say a harsh word.
<p>
With eyes downcast,<br>
&amp; not footloose,<br>
committed to jhana,<br>
he should be continually wakeful.[<a HREF="#n16-4" NAME="16-4">4</A>]<br>
Strengthening equanimity,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; centered within,<br>
he should cut off any penchant<br>
to conjecture or worry.<br>
When reprimanded,<br>
he should -- mindful -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rejoice;[<a HREF="#n16-5" NAME="16-5">5</A>]<br>
should smash any stubbornness<br>
toward his fellows in the holy life;<br>
should utter skillful words<br>
that are not untimely;<br>
should give no mind<br>
to the gossip people might say.
<p>
And then there are in the world<br>
the five kinds of dust<br>
for whose dispelling, mindful<br>
he should train:<br>
with regard to forms, sounds, tastes,<br>
smells, &amp; tactile sensations<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he should conquer passion;<br>
with regard to these things<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he should subdue his desire.
<p>
A monk, mindful,<br>
his mind well-released,<br>
contemplating the right Dhamma<br>
at the right times,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on coming<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to oneness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should annihilate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; darkness,"
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Blessed One said.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
<b><A NAME="n16-1">1</A>.</b> The Buddha spent his next-to-last lifetime in the Tusita heaven, one of the highest levels on the sensual plane.

<b><A NAME="n16-2">2</A>.</b> The fact that the Buddha answers this question in a straightforward manner illustrates the point that abandoning precepts and practices does not mean having no precepts and practices. See <A HREF="snp4-13.html#n13-2">note 2 to Sn IV.13</A>.
