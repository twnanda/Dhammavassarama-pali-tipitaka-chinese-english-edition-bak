<h3><A NAME="1">XVIII</A> -- Maha Kassapa</h3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
One shouldn't go about<br>
surrounded, revered<br>
by a company:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one gets distracted;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; concentration<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is hard to gain.<br>
Fellowship with many people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is painful.<br>
Seeing this,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one shouldn't approve<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of a company.
<p>
A sage shouldn't visit families:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one gets distracted;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; concentration<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is hard to gain.<br>
He's eager &amp; greedy for flavors,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whoever misses the goal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that brings bliss.
<p>
They know it's a bog -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the reverence &amp; veneration<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of families -- <br>
a subtle arrow, hard to extract.<br>
Offerings are hard for a worthless man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to let go.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *
<p>
Coming down from my dwelling place,<br>
I entered the city for alms,<br>
stood courteously next to a leper<br>
eating his meal.
<p>
He, with his rotting hand,<br>
tossed me a morsel of food,<br>
and as the morsel was dropping,<br>
a finger fell off<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right there.
<p>
Sitting next to a wall,<br>
I ate that morsel of food,<br>
and neither while eating it,<br>
nor having eaten,<br>
did I feel<br>
any disgust.
<p>
Whoever has mastered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; left-over scraps for food,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; smelly urine for medicine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the foot of a tree for a dwelling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cast-off rags for robes:<br>
<i>He</i> is a man<br>
of the four directions.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *
<p>
Where some are exhausted<br>
climbing the mountain,<br>
there <br>
the Awakened One's heir<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- mindful, alert,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; buoyed by his psychic power -- <br>
Kassapa climbs.
<p>
Returning from his alms round,<br>
climbing the peak,<br>
Kassapa does jhana<br>
with no sustenance/clinging,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; having abandoned terror<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; fear.
<p>
Returning from his alms round,<br>
climbing the peak,<br>
Kassapa does jhana<br>
with no sustenance/clinging,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unbound<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; among those who burn.
<p>
Returning from his alms round,<br>
climbing the peak,<br>
Kassapa does jhana<br>
with no sustenance/clinging,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; free of fermentation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his duty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; done.
<p>
Spread with garlands of vines,<br>
places delighting the mind,<br>
resounding with elephants,<br>
appealing:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those rocky crags <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; refresh me.
<p>
The color of blue-dark clouds,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; glistening,<br>
cooled with the waters<br>
of clear-flowing streams<br>
covered with ladybugs:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those rocky crags<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; refresh me.
<p>
Like the peaks of blue-dark clouds,<br>
like excellent peaked-roof buildings,<br>
resounding with tuskers,<br>
appealing:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those rocky crags<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; refresh me.
<p>
Their lovely surfaces wet with rain,<br>
mountains frequented<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by seers<br>
&amp; echoing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with peacocks:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those rocky crags<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; refresh me.
<p>
This is enough for me --<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desiring to do jhana,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resolute, mindful;<br>
enough for me --<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desiring the goal,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resolute,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a monk;<br>
enough for me --<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desiring comfort,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resolute,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in training;<br>
enough for me --<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desiring my duty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resolute,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such.
<p>
Flax-flower blue,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like the sky<br>
covered over with clouds;<br>
filled with flocks<br>
of various birds:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those rocky crags<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; refresh me.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncrowded<br>
by householders,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; frequented<br>
by herds of deer<br>
filled with flocks<br>
of various birds:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those rocky crags<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; refresh me.
<p>
With clear waters &amp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; massive boulders,<br>
frequented by monkeys &amp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deer,<br>
covered with moss &amp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; water weeds:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those rocky crags<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; refresh me.
<p>
There is no such pleasure for me<br>
in the music of a five-piece band<br>
as there is when my mind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is at one,<br>
seeing the Dhamma<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aright.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *
<p>
One shouldn't do lots of work,<br>
should avoid people,<br>
shouldn't busy oneself.<br>
He's eager &amp; greedy for flavors,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whoever misses the goal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that brings bliss.
<p>
One shouldn't do lots of work,<br>
should avoid<br>
what doesn't lead to the goal.<br>
The body gets wearied,<br>
fatigued.<br>
Aching, one finds<br>
no tranquility.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *
<p>
Simply by flapping the mouth<br>
one doesn't see<br>
even oneself.<br>
One goes around stiff-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; necked,<br>
thinking, 'I'm better<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than they.'
<p>
Not better,<br>
he thinks himself better,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the fool:<br>
the wise don't praise him,<br>
the stiff-necked man.
<p>
But whoever isn't stirred<br>
by the modes of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'm better,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not better.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm worse.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm like that';<br>
one who's discerning,<br>
who acts as he says,<br>
well-centered<br>
in virtues,<br>
committed to<br>
tranquility of awareness, he<br>
is the one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the wise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would praise.
<p>
One with no respect<br>
for his fellows in the holy life,<br>
is as far<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the true Dhamma<br>
as the earth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is from the sky.
<p>
But those whose conscience<br>
&amp; fear of evil<br>
are always rightly established: they<br>
have flourished in the holy life.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For them<br>
there's no further becoming.
<p>
A monk conceited &amp; vain,<br>
even though clad<br>
in a robe of cast-off rags,<br>
like a monkey in a lion's skin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't shine because of it.
<p>
But a monk not conceited<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or vain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; masterful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his faculties restrained, shines<br>
because of his robe of cast-off rags,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like a lion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the cleft of a mountain.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *
<p>
These many devas,<br>
powerful, prestigious<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- 10,000 devas --<br>
all of Brahma's retinue,<br>
stand with their hands over their hearts,<br>
paying homage to Sariputta,<br>
the Dhamma-general,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enlightened,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; centered,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; great master of jhana,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [saying:]
<p>
'Homage to you, O thoroughbred man.<br>
Homage to you, O superlative man --<br>
of whom we have no direct knowledge<br>
even of that<br>
in dependence on which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you do jhana.
<p>
'How very amazing:<br>
the awakened ones'<br>
very own deep range --<br>
of which we have no direct knowledge,<br>
though we have come<br>
as hair-splitting archers.'
<p>
Seeing Sariputta,<br>
a man worthy of worship,<br>
worshipped by deva retinues,<br>
Kappina<br>
smiled.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * *
<p>
As far as this buddha-field extends<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- except for the great sage himself --<br>
I'm the one<br>
outstanding<br>
in ascetic qualities.<br>
There's no one else<br>
like me.
<p>
The Teacher has been served by me;<br>
the Awakened One's bidding,
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; done;<br>
the heavy load, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; laid down;<br>
the guide to becoming, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uprooted.
<p>
Neither to robe,<br>
nor dwelling,<br>
nor food<br>
does he cling:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gotama,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like a lotus unspotted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by water, inclining<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to renunciation, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; detached<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the three planes of becoming.
<p>
He,<br>
the great sage,<br>
has the frames of reference<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as his neck,<br>
conviction<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as hands,<br>
discernment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as head.<br>
The great master of jhana<br>
he goes about<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; always unbound.
