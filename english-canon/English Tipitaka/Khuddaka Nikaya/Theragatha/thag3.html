<i>It's too cold,</i><br>
<i>too hot,</i><br>
<i>too late in the evening -- </i><br>
people who say this,<br>
shirking their work:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the moment passes them by.<br>
Whoever regards cold &amp; heat<br>
as no more than grass,<br>
doing his manly duties,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; won't fall away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from ease.<br>
With my chest<br>
I push through wild grasses -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spear-grass,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ribbon-grass,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rushes -- <br>
cultivating<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a seclusion heart.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
His limbs knotted<br>
like a kala plant,<br>
his body lean<br>
&amp; lined with veins,<br>
knowing moderation<br>
in food &amp; drink:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the man of undaunted heart.
<p>
Touched by gnats<br>
&amp; horseflies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the wilds,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the great wood,<br>
like an <A NAME="elephant">elephant</A><br>
at the head of a battle:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he, mindful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should stay there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; endure.
<p>
One alone is like Brahma,<br>
two, like devas,<br>
three, like a village,<br>
more than that:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a hullabaloo.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Listen, kinsmen, all of you,<br>
as many as are assembled here.<br>
I will teach you the Dhamma:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Painful is birth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; again &amp; again.
<p>
Rouse yourselves.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go forth.<br>
Apply yourselves<br>
to the Awakened One's bidding.<br>
Scatter the army of Death<br>
as an elephant would<br>
a shed made of reeds.
<p>
He who,<br>
in this doctrine &amp; discipline,<br>
remains heedful,<br>
abandoning birth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the wandering-on,<br>
will put an end<br>
to suffering &amp; stress.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
While wandering on<br>
I went to hell;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; went again &amp; again<br>
to the world of the hungry shades;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stayed countless times, long,<br>
in the pain of the animal womb;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enjoyed<br>
the human state;<br>
went to heaven<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from time to time;<br>
settled in the elements of form,<br>
the elements of formlessness,<br>
neither-perception, perception-less.
<p>
Ways of taking birth<br>
are now known:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; devoid of essence,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unstable,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conditioned,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; always driven along.<br>
Knowing them<br>
as born from my self,<br>
mindful<br>
I went right to peace.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Whoever wants to do later<br>
what he should have done first,<br>
falls away from the easeful state<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; later repents.
<p>
One should speak<br>
as one would act,<br>
&amp; not<br>
as one wouldn't.<br>
When one speaks without acting,<br>
the wise, they can tell.
<p>
How very easeful:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbinding,<br>
as taught by the Rightly<br>
Self-awakened One -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sorrowless,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dustless,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; secure,<br>
where stress<br>
&amp; suffering<br>
cease.
