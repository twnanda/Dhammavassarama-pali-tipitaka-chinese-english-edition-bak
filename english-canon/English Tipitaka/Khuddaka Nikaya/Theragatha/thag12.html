<BLOCKQUOTE>
In a lowly family I was born,<br>
poor, with next to no food.<br>
My work was degrading:<br>
I gathered the spoiled,<br>
the withered flowers from shrines<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and threw them away.<br>
People found me disgusting,<br>
despised me, disparaged me.<br>
Lowering my heart,<br>
I showed reverence to many.
<p>
Then I saw the One Self-awakened,<br>
arrayed with a squadron of monks,<br>
the Great Hero, entering the city,<br>
supreme, of the Magadhans.<br>
Throwing down my carrying pole,<br>
I approached him to do reverence.<br>
He -- the supreme man -- stood still<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out of sympathy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for me.<br>
After paying homage<br>
to the feet of the teacher,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stood to one side<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; requested the Going Forth from him,<br>
supreme among all living beings.<br>
The compassionate Teacher,<br>
sympathetic to all the world, said:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come, monk."<br>
That was my formal Acceptance.
<p>
Alone, I stayed in the wilds,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; untiring,<br>
I followed the Teacher's words,<br>
just as he, the Conqueror, had taught me.
<p>
In the first watch of the night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recollected previous lives;<br>
in the middle watch,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; purified the divine eye;<br>
in the last,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; burst the mass of darkness.
<p>
Then, as night was ending<br>
&amp; the sun returning,<br>
<A NAME="indra">Indra</A> &amp; <A NAME="brahma">Brahma</A> came to pay homage to me,<br>
hands palm-to-palm at their hearts:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Homage to you, O thoroughbred of men,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Homage to you, O man supreme,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whose fermentations are ended.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You, dear sir, are worthy of offerings."
<p>
<A NAME="smile">Seeing  me,</A> arrayed with a squadron of devas,<br>
the Teacher smiled &amp; said:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Through austerity, celibacy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; restraint, &amp; self-control:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's how one is a brahmin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is a brahmin supreme."
