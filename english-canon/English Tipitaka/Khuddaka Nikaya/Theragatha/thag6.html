<h3><A NAME="6">VI.6</A> -- Sappadasa <A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../../../icon/scrollup.gif" ALT="[go to top]"></A></h3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Twenty five years since my going forth,<br>
and no peace of awareness<br>
-- not a finger-snap's worth -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attained.<br>
Having gained no oneness of mind,<br>
I was wracked with lust.<br>
Wailing, with my arms upheld,<br>
I ran amok from my dwelling -- <br>
"Or...or shall I take the knife?<br>
What's the use of life to me?<br>
If I were to renounce the training,<br>
what sort of death would I have?"<br>
So, taking a razor,<br>
I sat down on a bed.<br>
And there was the razor,<br>
placed ready to cut my own vein,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when apt attention arose in me,<br>
the drawbacks appeared,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disenchantment stood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at an even keel:
<p>
With that, my heart was released.<br>
See the Dhamma's true rightness!<br>
The three knowledges<br>
have been attained;<br>
the Awakened One's bidding,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; done.

<h3><A NAME="9">VI.9</A> -- Jenta, the Royal Chaplain's Son <A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../../../icon/scrollup.gif" ALT="[go to top]"></A></h3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was<br>
drunk with the intoxication<br>
of my birth, wealth, &amp; sovereignty.<br>
Drunk with the intoxication<br>
of my body's build, coloring, &amp; form,<br>
I wandered about,<br>
regarding no one<br>
as my equal or better,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foolish, arrogant, haughty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my banner held high.<br>
I -- disrespectful, arrogant, proud -- <br>
bowed down to no one,<br>
not even &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mother,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; father,<br>
or those commonly held<br>
in respect.
<p>
Then -- seeing the ultimate leader,<br>
supreme, foremost of charioteers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like a blazing sun,<br>
arrayed with a squadron of monks -- <br>
casting away pride &amp; intoxication<br>
through an awareness serene &amp; clear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bowed down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; head<br>
to him, supreme<br>
among all living beings.
<p>
Haughtiness &amp; contempt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have been abandoned<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- rooted out -- <br>
the conceit "I am" is extracted,<br>
all forms of pride, destroyed.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When I was seven<br>
&amp; newly gone forth,<br>
having conquered with my power<br>
the great powerful serpent,<br>
I was fetching water for my preceptor<br>
from the great lake, <A NAME="anotatta">Anotatta</A>,[<a href="#note1" NAME="ref1">1</A>]<br>
when the Teacher saw me &amp; said:<br>
<p>
"Look, <A NAME="sariputta">Sariputta</A>, at that one,<br>
the young boy coming there,<br>
carrying a pot of water,<br>
well-centered within,<br>
his practices -- inspiring;<br>
his bearing -- admirable.<br>
He's <A name="anuruddha">Anuruddha's</A> novice,<br>
mature in his powers,<br>
made thoroughbred by a thoroughbred,<br>
good by one who is good,<br>
tamed by Anuruddha,<br>
trained by one whose task<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is done.
<p>
He, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; having reached the highest peace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; realized the unshakable,<br>
Sumana the novice<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wants this:<br>
'Don't let anyone know me.'"

<b><A NAME="note1">1.</A></b> <B>Anotatta</B>: A fabulous lake located in the Himalayas, famed for the purity of its cool waters. Sumana would have had to use his psychic powers to fetch water from there. <!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<A HREF="#ref1">Go back</A>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END -->
