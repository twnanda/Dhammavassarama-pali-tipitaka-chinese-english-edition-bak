<BLOCKQUOTE>
"You don't know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the path<br>
of his coming or going,<br>
that being who has come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where? -- <br>
the one you lament as 'my son.'<br>
But when you know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the path<br>
of his coming or going,<br>
you don't grieve after him,<br>
for that is the nature<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of beings.
<p>
Unasked,<br>
he came from there.<br>
Without permission,<br>
he went from here -- <br>
coming from &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where?<br>
having stayed a few days.<br>
And coming one way from here,<br>
he goes yet another<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from there.<br>
Dying in the human form,<br>
he will go wandering on.<br>
As he came, so he has gone -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so what is there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to lament?"
<p>
Pulling out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- completely out -- <br>
the arrow so hard to see,<br>
embedded in my heart,<br>
he expelled from me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- overcome with grief -- <br>
the grief<br>
over my son.
<p>
Today -- with arrow removed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without hunger, entirely<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbound -- <br>
to the Buddha, Dhamma, &amp; Sangha I go,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for refuge to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Sage.

<h3><A NAME="2">VI.2</A> -- Vasitthi the Madwoman <A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../../../icon/scrollup.gif" alt="[go to top]"></A></h3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Overwhelmed with grief for my son -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; naked, demented,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my hair dishevelled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my mind deranged -- <br>
I went about here &amp; there,<br>
living along the side of the road,<br>
in cemeteries &amp; heaps of trash,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for three full years,<br>
afflicted with hunger &amp; thirst.
<p>
Then I saw<br>
the One Well-gone,<br>
gone to the city of <A NAME="mithila">Mithila</A>:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tamer of those untamed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-Awakened,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with nothing to fear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from anything, anywhere.
<p>
Regaining my mind,<br>
paying him homage,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat myself down.<br>
He, Gotama, from sympathy<br>
taught me the Dhamma.<br>
Hearing his Dhamma,<br>
I went forth into homelessness.<br>
Applying myself to the Teacher's words,<br>
I realized the state of auspicious bliss.
<p>
All griefs have been cut off,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abandoned,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brought to this end,<br>
for I've comprehended<br>
the grounds from which griefs<br>
come into play.

<h3><A NAME="5">VI.5</A> -- Anopama, the Millionaire's Daughter <A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../../../icon/scrollup.gif" alt="[go to top]"></A></h3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Born in a high-ranking family<br>
with much property, great wealth,<br>
consummate in complexion &amp; figure,<br>
I was the daughter of <A NAME="majjha">Majjha</A>, the treasurer.<br>
Sons of kings sought for me,<br>
sons of rich merchants<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; longed for me.<br>
One of them sent my father a messenger,<br>
saying, "Give me Anopama.<br>
I will give in return<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eight times her weight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in jewels &amp; gold."<br>
But I, having seen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the One Self-awakened,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unsurpassed, excelling the world,<br>
paid homage to his feet,<br>
sat down to one side.<br>
He, Gotama, from sympathy,<br>
taught me the Dhamma.<br>
And as I sat in that very seat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I attained the third fruit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [of non-return.]<br>
Then I cut off my hair,<br>
and went forth into homelessness.<br>
Today is the seventh day<br>
since I made craving<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wither away.
