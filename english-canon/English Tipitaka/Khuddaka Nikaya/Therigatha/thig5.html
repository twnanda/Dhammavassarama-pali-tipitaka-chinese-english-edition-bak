<h3><A NAME="2">V.2</A> -- Vimala, the Former Courtesan <A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../../../icon/scrollup.gif" alt="[go to top]"></A></h3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Intoxicated with my complexion<br>
figure, beauty, &amp; fame;<br>
haughty with youth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I despised other women.<br>
Adorning this body<br>
embellished to delude foolish men,<br>
I stood at the door to the brothel:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a hunter with snare laid out.<br>
I showed off my ornaments,<br>
and revealed many a private part.<br>
I worked my manifold magic,<br>
laughing out loud at the crowd.
<p>
Today, wrapped in a double cloak,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my head shaven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; having wandered for alms,<br>
I sit at the foot of a tree<br>
and attain the state of no-thought.<br>
All ties -- human &amp; divine -- have been cut.<br>
Having cast off all effluents,<br>
cooled am I,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unbound.

<h3><A NAME="4">V.4</A> -- Nanda's Vision <A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../../../icon/scrollup.gif" alt="[go to top]"></A></h3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Sick, putrid, unclean:<br>
look, Nanda, at this physical heap.<br>
Through contemplation of the foul,<br>
develop your mind,<br>
make it one, well-centered.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As this [your body], so that.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As that, so this.<br>
It gives off a foul stench,<br>
the delight of fools."
<p>
Considering it thus,<br>
untiring, both day &amp; night,<br>
I, with my own discernment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dissecting it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; saw.
<p>
And as I, heedful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; examined it aptly,<br>
<i>this</i> body -- as it actually is -- <br>
was seen inside &amp; out.
<p>
Then was I disenchanted with the body<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; dispassionate within:<br>
Heedful, detached,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calmed was I.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbound.

<h3><A NAME="6">V.6</A> -- Mittakali <A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../../../icon/scrollup.gif" alt="[go to top]"></A></h3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Going forth through conviction<br>
from home into homelessness,<br>
I wandered this place &amp; that,<br>
greedy for tribute &amp; gains.<br>
Missing out on the foremost goal,<br>
I pursued a lowly one.<br>
Under the sway of defilements<br>
I surrendered the goal<br>
of the contemplative life.
<p>
Then, sitting in my dwelling,<br>
I suddenly came to my senses:
<blockquote>
<i>I'm following a miserable path.<br>
I'm under the sway of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; craving.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next to nothing, my life -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crushed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by aging &amp; illness.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the body breaks apart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for heedlessness.</i>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
After watching, as it actually was,<br>
the rising &amp; falling of aggregates,<br>
I stood up with mind released,<br>
the Awakened One's bidding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; done.

<h3><A NAME="8">V.8</A> -- Sona, Mother of Ten <A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../../../icon/scrollup.gif" alt="[go to top]"></A></h3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Ten children I bore<br>
from this physical heap.<br>
Then weak from that, aged,<br>
I went to a nun.<br>
She taught me the Dhamma:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aggregates, sense spheres, &amp; elements.<br>
Hearing her Dhamma,<br>
I cut off my hair &amp; ordained.<br>
Having purified the divine eye<br>
while still a probationer,<br>
I know my previous lives,<br>
where I lived in the past.<br>
I develop the theme-less meditation,<br>
well-focused oneness.<br>
I gain the liberation of immediacy -- <br>
from lack of clinging, unbound.<br>
The five aggregates, comprehended,<br>
stand <A NAME="tree8">like a tree</A> with its root cut through.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spit on old age.<br>
There is now no further becoming.

<h3><A NAME="10">V.10</A> -- Patacara <A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../../../icon/scrollup.gif" alt="[go to top]"></A></h3>
[I thought:]
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Plowing the field with plows,<br>
sowing the ground with seed,<br>
supporting their wives &amp; children,<br>
young men gather up wealth.
<p>
So why is it that I,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; consummate in virtue,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a doer of the teacher's bidding,<br>
don't gain Unbinding?<br>
I'm not lazy or proud."
<p>
Washing my feet, I noticed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; water.
<p>
And in watching it flow from high<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; low,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my heart was composed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like a fine <A NAME="thoroughbred10">thoroughbred</A> steed.
<p>
Then taking a lamp, I entered the hut,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; checked the bedding,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sat down on the bed.
<p>
And taking a pin, I pulled out the wick:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the <A NAME="flame10">flame's unbinding</A><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was the liberation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of awareness.

<h3><A NAME="11">V.11</A> -- Patacara's Thirty Students <A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../../../icon/scrollup.gif" alt="[go to top]"></A></h3>
[Patacara taught:]
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Taking the pestle,<br>
young men grind the corn.<br>
Supporting their wives &amp; children,<br>
they gather up wealth.<br>
Do the Awakened One's bidding,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which, having done,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you'll have no regret.<br>
Intent on tranquillity of awareness,<br>
do the Awakened One's bidding.<br>
Quickly:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having washed your feet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go sit to one side."
<p>
Hearing these words,<br>
Patacara's bidding,<br>
they washed their feet<br>
and retired to one side.<br>
Intent on tranquillity of awareness,<br>
they did the Awakened One's bidding.<br>
In the first watch of the night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they recollected their previous lives.<br>
In the middle watch,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; purified the divine eye.<br>
In the last,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; burst the mass of darkness.<br>
Getting up, they bowed down to her feet.
<p>
"We have done your bidding.<br>
Like the thirty devas honoring <A NAME="indra">Indra</A>,<br>
unvanquished in battle,<br>
we -- endowed with the three knowledges,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; effluent-free -- <br>
will continue honoring you."

<h3><A NAME="12">V.12</A> -- Canda, the Beggar <A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../../../icon/scrollup.gif" alt="[go to top]"></A></h3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Before, I had fallen on evil times:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no husband, no children,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no relatives, friends,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no way to obtain clothing &amp; food.<br>
So, taking a staff &amp; bowl in hand,<br>
begging for alms from house to house,<br>
feverish from the cold &amp; heat,<br>
I wandered for seven full years.<br>
Then seeing a nun<br>
obtaining food &amp; drink,<br>
I approached her &amp; said:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me go forth into homelessness."
<p>
She, <A NAME="patacara12">Patacara</A>, from sympathy,<br>
let me go forth;<br>
then, exhorting me,<br>
urged me on to the highest goal.<br>
Hearing her words,<br>
I did her bidding.<br>
Her exhortation was not in vain.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Endowed with the three knowledges,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm effluent-free.
