I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="sav">Savatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana">Anathapindika's</A> monastery. At that time <A NAME="sariputta">Ven. Sariputta</A> was with a variety of approaches instructing, urging, rousing, and encouraging <A NAME="bhaddiya">Ven. Bhaddiya the Dwarf</A> with Dhamma-talk. As Ven. Bhaddiya the Dwarf was, with a variety of approaches, being instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged by Ven. Sariputta with Dhamma-talk, his mind, through lack of clinging/sustenance, was released from the effluents.

The Blessed One saw that as Ven. Bhaddiya the Dwarf was, with a variety of approaches, being instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged by Ven. Sariputta with Dhamma-talk, his mind, through lack of clinging/sustenance, was released from the effluents.
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Above, below, everywhere released,<br>
he does not focus on 'I am this.'<br>
Thus released, he crosses the flood<br>
not crossed before,<br>
for the sake of no further becoming.
