I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="sav">Savatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana">Anathapindika's</A> monastery. At that time <A NAME="sariputta">Ven. Sariputta</A> was with a variety of approaches instructing, urging, rousing, and encouraging <A NAME="bhaddiya">Ven. Bhaddiya the Dwarf</A> with Dhamma-talk to an even greater extent, as he thought that Bhaddiya was still just a learner.

The Blessed One saw that Ven. Sariputta was with a variety of approaches instructing, urging, rousing, and encouraging Ven. Bhaddiya the Dwarf with Dhamma-talk to an even greater extent, as he thought that Bhaddiya was still just a learner.
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
He has broken the cycle,<br>
attained freedom from desire.<br>
The dried-up stream<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no longer flows.<br>
The cycle, broken,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no longer turns.<br>
This, just this,<br>
is the end of stress.
