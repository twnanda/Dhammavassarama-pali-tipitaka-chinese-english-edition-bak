I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="sav">Savatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana">Anathapindika's</A> monastery. Now at that time <A NAME="sariputta">Ven. Sariputta</A> was sitting not far from the Blessed One -- his legs crossed, his body held erect -- a man of few wishes, content, solitary, unentangled, his persistence aroused, devoted to the heightened mind. The Blessed One saw Ven. Sariputta sitting not far away -- his legs crossed, his body held erect -- a man of few wishes, content, solitary, unentangled, his persistence aroused, devoted to the heightened mind.
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

Exalted in mind &amp; heedful,<br>
the sage trained in sagacity's ways:<br>
He has no sorrows, one who is Such,<br>
calmed &amp; ever mindful.
