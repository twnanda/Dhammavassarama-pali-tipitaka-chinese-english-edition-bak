I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="sav">Savatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana">Anathapindika's</A> monastery. Now at that time a certain monk was sitting not far from the Blessed One, his legs crossed, his body held erect, enduring sharp, piercing, racking pains that were the result of old kamma -- mindful, alert, without suffering. The Blessed One saw him sitting not far away, his legs crossed, his body held erect, enduring sharp, piercing, racking pains that were the result of old kamma -- mindful, alert, without suffering.
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For the monk who has left<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all kamma<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behind,<br>
shaking off the dust of the past,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; steady, without longing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such*:<br>
there's no point in telling<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anyone else.
