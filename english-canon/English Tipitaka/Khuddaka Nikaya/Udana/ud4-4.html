I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in <A NAME="rajagaha">Rajagaha</A> at the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary. Now at that time <A NAME="sariputta">Ven. Sariputta</A> and <A NAME="moggallana">Ven. Maha Moggallana</A> were staying in <A NAME="pigeon">Pigeon Cave</A>. Then, on a moonlit night, Ven. Sariputta -- his head newly shaven -- was sitting in the open air, having attained a certain level of concentration.
<p>
It so happened that two yakkhas who were companions were flying from north to south on some business or other. They saw Ven. Sariputta -- his head newly shaven -- sitting in the open air. Seeing him, the first yakkha said to the second, "I'm inspired to give this contemplative a blow on the head."
<p>
When this was said, the second yakkha said to the first, "Enough of that, my good friend. Don't lay a hand on the contemplative. He's an outstanding contemplative, of great power and great might."
<p>
A second time, the first yakkha said to the second, "I'm inspired to give this contemplative a blow on the head."
<p>
A second time, the second yakkha said to the first, "Enough of that, my good friend. Don't lay a hand on the contemplative. He's an outstanding contemplative, of great power and great might."
<p>
A third time, the first yakkha said to the second, "I'm inspired to give this contemplative a blow on the head."
<p>
A third time, the second yakkha said to the first, "Enough of that, my good friend. Don't lay a hand on the contemplative. He's an outstanding contemplative, of great power and great might."
<p>
Then the first yakkha, ignoring the second yakkha, gave Ven. Sariputta a blow on the head. And with that blow he might have knocked over an elephant seven or eight cubits tall, or split a rocky crag. But right there the yakkha -- yelling, "I'm burning!" -- fell into the Great Hell.
<p>
Now, Ven. Moggallana -- with his divine eye, pure and surpassing the human -- saw the yakkha give Ven. Sariputta a blow on the head. Seeing this, he went to Ven. Sariputta and, on arrival, said to him, "I hope you are well, friend Sariputta. I hope you are comfortable. I hope you are feeling no pain."
<p>
"I am well, friend Moggallana. I am comfortable. But I do have a slight headache."
<p>
"How amazing, friend Sariputta! How awesome! How great your power and might! Just now a yakkha gave you a blow on the head. So great was that blow that he might have knocked over an elephant seven or eight cubits tall, or split a rocky crag. But all you say is this: 'I am well, friend Moggallana. I am comfortable. But I do have a slight headache'!"
<p>
"How amazing, friend Moggallana! How awesome! How great your power and might! Where you saw a yakkha just now, I didn't even see a dust devil!"
<p>
The Blessed One -- with his divine ear, pure and surpassing the human -- heard those two great beings speak in praise of one another in this way. Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Whose mind is like rock,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; steady,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unmoved,<br>
dispassionate for things that spark passion,<br>
unangered by things that spark anger:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When one's mind is developed like this,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from where can there come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suffering &amp; stress?
