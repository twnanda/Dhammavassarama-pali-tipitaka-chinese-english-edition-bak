<hr>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="sav">Savatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana">Anathapindika's</A> monastery. Now at that time <A NAME="moggallana">Ven. Maha Moggallana</A> was sitting not far from the Blessed One, his legs crossed, his body held erect, having mindfulness immersed in the body well established within. The Blessed One saw Ven. Maha Moggallana sitting not far away, his legs crossed, his body held erect, having mindfulness immersed in the body well established within.
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
With mindfulness immersed in the body<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well established, restrained<br>
with regard to the six media of contact -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; always centered, the monk<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can know Unbinding* for himself.
