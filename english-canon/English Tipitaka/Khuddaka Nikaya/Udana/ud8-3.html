I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="sav">Savatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana">Anathapindika's</A> monastery. Now at that time the Blessed One was instructing urging, rousing, and encouraging the monks with Dhamma-talk concerned with Unbinding. The monks -- receptive, attentive, focusing their entire awareness, lending ear -- listened to the Dhamma.
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is, monks, an unborn -- unbecome -- unmade -- unfabricated. If there were not that unborn -- unbecome -- unmade -- unfabricated, there would not be the case that emancipation from the born -- become -- made -- fabricated would be discerned. But precisely because there is an unborn -- unbecome -- unmade -- unfabricated, emancipation from the born -- become -- made -- fabricated is discerned.
