I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="sav">Savatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana">Anathapindika's</A> monastery. Now at that time the Blessed One was instructing urging, rousing, and encouraging the monks with Dhamma-talk concerned with Unbinding. The monks -- receptive, attentive, focusing their entire awareness, lending ear -- listened to the Dhamma.
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

It's hard to see the unaffected,<br>
for the truth isn't easily seen.<br>
Craving is pierced<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in one who knows;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For one who sees,<br>
there is nothing.
