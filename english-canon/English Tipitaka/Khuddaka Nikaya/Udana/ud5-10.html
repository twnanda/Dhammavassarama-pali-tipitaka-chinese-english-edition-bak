<hr>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <a name="sav">Savatthi</a>, in Jeta's Grove, <a name="ana">Anathapindika</a>'s monastery. Now at that time Ven. Cula Panthaka was sitting not far from the Blessed One, his legs crossed, his body held erect, with mindfulness established to the fore. The Blessed One saw Ven. Cula Panthaka sitting not far away, his legs crossed, his body held erect, with mindfulness established to the fore.
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With steady body,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with steady awareness,<br>
whether standing, sitting, or lying down,<br>
a monk determined on mindfulness<br>
gains one distinction<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; after another.<br>
Having gained one distinction<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; after another,<br>
he goes where the King of Death<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can't see.
