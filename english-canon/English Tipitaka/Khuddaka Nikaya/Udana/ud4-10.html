I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="sav">Savatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana">Anathapindika's</A> monastery. Now at that time <A NAME="sariputta">Ven. Sariputta</A> was sitting not far from the Blessed One -- his legs crossed, his body held erect -- reflecting on the peace within himself. The Blessed One saw Ven. Sariputta sitting not far away -- his legs crossed, his body held erect -- reflecting on the peace within himself
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For the monk whose mind is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; peaceful, at peace,<br>
whose cord to becoming is cut,<br>
birth &amp; the wandering on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are totally ended.<br>
Freed is he<br>
from Mara's bonds.
