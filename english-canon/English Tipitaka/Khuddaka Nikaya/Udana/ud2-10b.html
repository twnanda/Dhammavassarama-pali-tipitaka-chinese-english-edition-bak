<hr>
Thus have I heard. At one time the Lord was staying at Anupiya in the Mango Orchard. At that time the Venerable Bhaddiya, Kaligodha's son, on going into the forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty place, constantly uttered, "Ah, what bliss! Ah, what bliss!"
<p>
A number of bhikkhus heard the Venerable Bhaddiya ... constantly uttering, "Ah, what bliss! Ah, what bliss!" and the thought came to them: "No doubt, friend, the Venerable Bhaddiya, Kaligodha's son, is dissatisfied with leading the holy life, since formerly when he was a householder he enjoyed the bliss of royalty. And when recollecting that, on going into the forest ... he utters, 'Ah, what bliss! Ah, what bliss!'"
<p>
Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Lord, prostrated themselves, sat down to one side, and reported this to the Lord.
<p>
Then the Lord addressed a certain bhikkhu: "Come, bhikkhu, in my name tell the bhikkhu Bhaddiya, 'The Teacher calls you, friend Bhaddiya.'"
<p>
"Very well, revered sir," the bhikkhu replied and approaching the Venerable Bhaddiya, Kaligodha's son, he said, "The Teacher calls you, friend Bhaddiya."
<p>
"Very well, friend," the Venerable Bhaddiya replied, and approaching the Lord he prostrated himself and sat down to one side. The Lord then said to him: "Is it true, Bhaddiya, that on going into the forest ... you utter, 'Ah, what bliss! Ah, what bliss!'?"
<p>
"Yes, revered sir."
<p>
"But, Bhaddiya, what do you see that prompts you to do so?"
<p>
"Formerly, revered sir, when I was a householder and enjoyed the bliss of royalty, inside and outside my inner apartments guards were appointed; inside and outside the city guards were appointed; inside and outside the district guards were appointed. But, revered sir, although I was thus guarded and protected, I lived fearful, agitated, distrustful, and afraid. But now, revered sir, on going alone into the forest, to the foot of a tree or to an empty place, I am fearless, unagitated, confident, and unafraid. I live unconcerned, unruffled, my needs satisfied, with a mind become like a deer's. Seeing this, revered sir, prompts me, on going to the forest ... to utter constantly, 'Ah, what bliss! Ah, what bliss!'"
<p>
Then, on realizing its significance, the Lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utterance:

<i>In whom exist no inner stirrings,<br>
Having passed beyond being this or that,<br>
Free from fear, blissful and sorrowless,<br>
The devas are not capable of seeing him.</i>
