I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="sav">Savatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana">Anathapindika's</A> monastery. Now at that time a large number of monks, after the meal, on returning from their alms round, had gathered at the meeting hall when this discussion arose: "Friends, which of these two kings has greater wealth, greater possessions, the greater treasury, the greater stock of riding animals, the greater army, greater power, greater might: <A NAME="bimbisara">King Seniya Bimbisara</A> of Magadha or <A NAME="pasenadi">King Pasenadi</A> of Kosala?" And this discussion came to no conclusion.
<p>
Then the Blessed One, emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon, went to the meeting hall and, on arrival, sat down on a seat made ready. As he sat down there, he addressed the monks: "For what topic are you gathered together here? And what was the discussion that came to no conclusion?"
<p>
"Just now, lord, after the meal, on returning from our alms round, we gathered at the meeting hall when this discussion arose: 'Friends, which of these two kings has greater wealth, greater possessions, the greater treasury, the greater stock of riding animals, the greater army, greater power, greater might: King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha or King Pasenadi of Kosala?' This was the discussion that had come to no conclusion when the Blessed One arrived.
<p>
"It isn't right, monks, that sons of good families, on having gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless life, should talk on such a topic. When you have gathered you have two duties: either Dhamma-talk or <A NAME="silence">noble silence</A>."
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<blockquote>
Any sensual bliss in the world,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any heavenly bliss,<br>
isn't worth one sixteenth-sixteenth<br>
of the bliss of the ending of craving.
</blockquote>
