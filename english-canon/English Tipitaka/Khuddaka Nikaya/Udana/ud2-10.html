I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at <A NAME="anupiya">Anupiya</A> in the Mango Orchard. Now at that time, <A NAME="bhaddiya">Ven. Bhaddiya Kaligodha</A>, on going to a forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, would repeatedly exclaim, "What bliss! What bliss!" A large number of monks heard Ven. Bhaddiya Kaligodha, on going to a forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, repeatedly exclaim, "What bliss! What bliss!" and on hearing him, the thought occurred to them, "There's no doubt but that Ven. Bhaddiya Kaligodha doesn't enjoy leading the holy life, for when he was a householder he knew the bliss of kingship, so that now, on recollecting that, he is repeatedly exclaiming, 'What bliss! What bliss!'" They went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they told him: "Ven. Bhaddiya Kaligodha, lord, on going to a forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, repeatedly exclaims, 'What bliss! What bliss!' There's no doubt but that Ven. Bhaddiya Kaligodha doesn't enjoy leading the holy life, for when he was a householder he knew the bliss of kingship, so that now, on recollecting that, he is repeatedly exclaiming, 'What bliss! What bliss!'"
<p>
Then the Blessed One told a certain monk, "Come, monk. In my name, call Bhaddiya, saying, 'The Teacher calls you, my friend.'"
<p>
"As you say, lord," the monk answered and, having gone to Ven. Bhaddiya, on arrival he said, "The Teacher calls you, my friend."
<p>
"As you say, my friend," Ven. Bhaddiya replied. Then he went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, "Is it true, Bhaddiya that, on going to a forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, you repeatedly exclaim, 'What bliss! What bliss!'?"
<p>
"Yes, lord."
<p>
"What meaning do you have in mind that you repeatedly exclaim, 'What bliss! What bliss!'?"
<p>
"Before, when I was a householder, maintaining the bliss of kingship, I had guards posted within and without the royal apartments, within and without the city, within and without the countryside. But even though I was thus guarded, thus protected, I dwelled in fear -- agitated, distrustful, and afraid. But now, on going alone to a forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, I dwell without fear, unagitated, confident, and unafraid -- unconcerned, unruffled, my wants satisfied, with my <A NAME="deer">mind like a wild deer</A>. This is the meaning I have in mind that I repeatedly exclaim, 'What bliss! What bliss!'"
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

In whom there exists<br>
no provocation,<br>
&amp; for whom becoming &amp; non-becoming<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are overcome,<br>
he is one -- beyond fear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blissful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without grief,<br>
whom the devas can't see.
