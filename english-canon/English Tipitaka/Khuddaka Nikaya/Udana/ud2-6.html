I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A name="sav">Savatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana">Anathapindika's</A> monastery. Now at that time the young wife of a certain wanderer was pregnant and on the verge of delivery. So she said to the wanderer, "Go get some oil for my delivery."
<p>
When this was said, the wanderer said to her, "But where can I get any oil?"
<p>
A second time, she said to him, "Go get some oil for my delivery."
<p>
A second time, he said to her, "But where can I get any oil?"
<p>
A third time, she said to him, "Go get some oil for my delivery."
<p>
Now at that time at the storehouse of <A NAME="pasenadi">King Pasenadi</A> Kosala they were giving priests and contemplatives as much oil or ghee as they needed to drink, but not to take away. So the thought occurred to the wanderer, "At present at the storehouse of King Pasenadi Kosala they are giving priests and contemplatives as much oil or ghee as they need to drink, but not to take away. Suppose, having gone there, I were to drink as much oil as I need and, on returning home, were to vomit it up to use at the delivery?"
<p>
So, having gone to the storehouse of King Pasenadi Kosala, he drink as much oil as he needed but, on returning home, was unable to bring it up or pass it down. So he rolled back and forth, suffering from pains that were piercing, racking, and agonizing. Then early in the morning the Blessed One, having put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. He saw the wanderer rolling back and forth, suffering from pains that were piercing, racking, and agonizing,
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

How blissful it is, for one who has nothing.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who are expert<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are people with nothing.<br>
See how they suffer, those who have something,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people bound in mind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with people.
