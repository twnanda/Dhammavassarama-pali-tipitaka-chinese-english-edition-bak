[<b>*Note:</b> "The All" = the six senses (sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, &amp; ideation) and their respective objects. This covers the entirety of experience that can be described.

Which one thing? Schism in the Sangha. When the Sangha is split, there are arguments with one another, there is abuse of one another, ganging up on one another, abandoning of one another. Then those with little confidence [in the teaching] lose all confidence, while some of those who are confident become otherwise."

<i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: </i>"Monks, don't be afraid of acts of merit. This is another way of saying what is blissful, desirable, pleasing, endearing, charming -- i.e., acts of merit. I am cognizant that, having long performed meritorious deeds, I long experienced desirable, pleasing, endearing, charming results. Having developed a mind of good will for seven years, then for seven aeons of contraction &amp; expansion I didn't return to this world. Whenever the aeon was contracting, I went to the realm of Streaming Radiance. Whenever the aeon was expanding, I reappeared in an empty Brahma-abode. There I was the Great Brahman, the Unconquered Conqueror, All-seeing, &amp; Wielder of Power. Then for thirty-six times I was Sakka, ruler of the gods. For many hundreds of times I was a king, a wheel-turning emperor, a righteous king of Dhamma, conqueror of the four corners of the earth, maintaining stable control over the countryside, endowed with the seven treasures<B>*</B> -- to say nothing of the times I was a local king. The thought occurred to me: 'Of what action of mine is this the fruit, of what action the result, that I now have such great power &amp; might?' Then the thought occurred to me: 'This is the fruit of my three [types of] action, the result of three types of action, that I now have such great power &amp; might: i.e., generosity, self-control, &amp; restraint.'"
<p>
<blockquote>
Train in acts of merit<br>
that bring long-lasting bliss -- <br>
develop generosity,<br>

The accumulation<br>
of a single person's<br>
bones for an aeon<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the cause of stress,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the transcending of stress,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the way to the stilling of stress -- <br>
having wandered on<br>
