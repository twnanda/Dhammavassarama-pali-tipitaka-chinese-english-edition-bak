<i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: </i>"Endowed with two things, a monk lives in stress in the present life -- troubled, distressed, &amp; feverish -- and at the break-up of the body, after death, a bad destination can be expected. Which two? A lack of guarding of the doors of the sense faculties, and knowing no moderation in food. Endowed with these two things, a monk lives in stress in the present life -- troubled, distressed, &amp; feverish -- and at the break-up of the body, after death, a bad destination can be expected."

evil comes from that,<br>

And what is the Unbinding property with fuel remaining? There is the case where a monk is an Arahant whose fermentations have ended, who has reached fulfillment, finished the task, laid down the burden, attained the true goal, destroyed the fetter of becoming, and is released through right gnosis. His five sense faculties still remain and, owing to their being intact, he is cognizant of the pleasant &amp; the unpleasant, and is sensitive to pleasure &amp; pain.

<i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: </i>"Overcome by two viewpoints, some human &amp; divine beings adhere, other human &amp; divine beings slip right past, while those with vision see.
<p>
"And how do some adhere? Human &amp; divine beings enjoy becoming, delight in becoming, are satisfied with becoming. When the Dhamma is being taught for the sake of the cessation of becoming, their minds do not take to it, are not calmed by it, do not settle on it or become resolved on it. This is how some adhere.
<p>
"And how do some slip right past? Some, feeling horrified, humiliated, &amp; disgusted with that very becoming, relish non-becoming: 'When this self, at the break-up of the body, after death, perishes &amp; is destroyed, and does not exist after death, that is peaceful, that is exquisite, that is sufficiency!' This is how some slip right past.
<p>
"And how do those with vision see? There is the case where a monk sees what has come into being as come into being. Seeing what has come into being as come into being, he practices for disenchantment with what has come into being, dispassion toward what has come into being, cessation of what has come into being. This is how those with vision see."

<blockquote>
Those, having seen<br>
what's come to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as what's come to be,<br>
and what's gone beyond<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what's come to be,<br>
are released in line<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with what's come to be,<br>
through the exhaustion of craving<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; becoming.<br>
If they've comprehended<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what's come to be,<br>
and are free from the craving<br>
for becoming &amp; non-,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the non-becoming<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of what's come to be,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; monks come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to no further becoming.
