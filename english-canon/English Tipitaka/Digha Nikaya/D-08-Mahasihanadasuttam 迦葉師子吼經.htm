<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>IN this Sutta the 
Buddha, in conversation with a naked ascetic, explains his position as regards 
asceticism-so far, that is, as is compatible with his invariable method (as 
represented in the Dialogues) when discussing a point on which he differs from 
his interlocutor.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>When speaking on 
sacrifice to a sacrificial priest, on union with God to an adherent of the 
current theology, on Brahman claims to superior social rank to a proud Brahman, 
on mystic insight to a man who trusts in it, on the soul to one who believes in 
the soul theory, the method followed is always the same. Gotama puts himself as 
far as possible in the mental position of the questioner. He attacks none of his 
cherished convictions. He accepts as the starting-point of his own exposition 
the desirability of the act or condition prized by his opponent-of the union 
with God (as in the Tevijja), or of sacrifice (as in the KÂÒadanta), or of 
social rank (as in the AmbaÒÒha), or of seeing heavenly sights, &amp;c. (as in 
the Mah‡li), or of the soul theory (as in the PoÒÒhap‡da). He even adopts the 
very phraseology of his questioner. And then, partly by putting a new and (from 
the Buddhist point of view) a higher meaning into the words ; partly by an 
appeal to such ethical conceptions as are common ground between them; he 
gradually leads his opponent up to his conclusion. This is, of course, always 
Arahatship-that is the sweetest fruit of the life of a recluse, that is the best 
sacrifice, that the highest social rank, that the best means of seeing heavenly 
sights, and a more worthy object; and so on. In our Sutta it is the path to 
Arahatship which is the best asceticism.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>There is both 
courtesy and dignity in the method employed. But no little dialectic skill, and 
an easy mastery of the ethical points involved, are required to bring about the 
result. On the hypothesis that the Buddha is a sun myth, and his principal 
disciples personifications of the stars,</SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>the facts seem 
difficult to explain. One would expect, then, something quite different. How is 
it that the other disciples who must, in that case, have concocted these 
Dialogues, refrain so entirely from astrological and mythological details ? How 
is it they attribute to their hero qualities of courtesy and sympathy, and a 
grasp of ethical problems, all quite foreign, even antagonistic, to those 
usually ascribed to sun-heroes-mostly somewhat truculent and very unethical 
personages ?</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>On the 
hypothesis, that he was an historical person, of that training and character he 
is represented in the PiÒakas to have had, the method is precisely that which it 
is most probable he would have actually followed.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>Whoever put the 
Dialogues together may have had a sufficiently clear memory of the way he 
conversed, may well have even remembered particular occasions and persons. To 
the mental vision of the compiler, the doctrine taught loomed so much larger 
than anything else, that he was necessarily more concerned with that, than with 
any historical accuracy in the details of the story. He was, in this respect, in 
much the same position as Plato when recording the dialogues of Socrates. But he 
was not, like Plato, giving his own opinions. We ought, no doubt, to think of 
compilers, rather than of a compiler. The memory of co-disciples had to be 
respected, and kept in mind. And so far as the actual doctrine is concerned our 
Dialogues are probably a more exact reproduction of the thoughts of the teacher 
than the dialogues of Plato.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
lang=EN-GB>However this may be, the method followed in all these Dialogues has 
one disadvantage. In accepting the position of the adversary, and adopting his 
language, the authors compel us, in order to follow what they give us as 
Gotama's view, to read a good deal between the lines. The <I 
style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">argumentum ad hominem </I>can never be the 
same as a statement of opinion given without reference to any particular person. 
That is strikingly the case with our present Sutta.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>When addressing 
his five hearers-the Pa§cavaggiy‡, the first five converts, and the first 
Arahats-in the Deer-park at Benares, on the occasion of his first discourse, the 
Buddha is represented to have spoken of asceticism in a very different way. He 
there calls it one of 'two extremes which are to be avoided'; and describes it 
as 'painful, unworthy, and unprofitable<A title="" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1"

So in the Puggala Pa§§atti (IV, 24) the very practices set out in our Sutta, by 
Kassapa the ascetic,</SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>as desirable and 
praiseworthy, are set out as the actions by which a man injures himself. There 
is nothing of this sort in our Sutta. To judge from it alone one might fairly 
conclude that the Buddha approved of asceticism, only insisting that the 
self-mastery and self-control of the Path were the highest and best forms of it. 
There is really no inconsistency in these three Suttas. But while the first 
discourse and the Puggala passage were both addressed to disciples, our Sutta is 
addressed to an ascetic, and the language used is modified accordingly. The 
conclusion in all is exactly the same.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>It is clear that 
at the time when our Sutta was put together the practice of self-mortification 
had already been carried out to a considerable extent in India. And further 
details, in some of which the self-imposed penances are even more extreme, are 
given in other Dialogues of the same date, notably in the twelfth Sutta of the 
Majjhima. This is oddly enough also called a S„han‡da Sutta, and the reason is 
not far to seek.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>The carrying out 
of such practices, in all countries, wins for the ascetic a very high 
reputation. Those who despise earthly comforts, and even submit themselves to 
voluntary torture, are looked upon, with a kind of fearsome wonder, as more holy 
than other men. And no doubt, in most cases, the ascetics laid claim to special 
virtue. In the Suttas dealing with the practices of the ascetics, Gotama, in 
laying stress on the more moderate view, takes occasion also to dispute this 
claim. He maintains, as in our Sutta, that the insight and self-control and 
self-mastery of the Path, or of the system of intellectual and moral 
self-training laid down for the Bhikkhu, are really harder than the merely 
physical practices so much more evident to the eye of the vulgar. It was a point 
that had to be made. And the Suttas in which it is made are designated as 
S„han‡das, literally 'the lion's roars'-the proud claim by the Arahat to a 
dignity and veneration greater than that allowed by the people to the 
self-torturer or even to the man who</SPAN></P>

that the Arahat, or, the man striving towards Arahatship, should be always 
sufficiently clothed, and take regular baths, regular exercise, regular food. 
The line was to be drawn at another point. He was to avoid, not what was 
necessary to maintain himself in full bodily vigour and power, but all undue 
luxury, and all worry about personal comfort. It was his duty to keep himself in 
health.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>It is open to 
question whether the earnest and unworldly would now draw the line at the 
precise point at which Gotama drew it; either as regards what they would think 
proper for themselves now, or what they would have thought most proper for those 
living in India then. Probably they would think rather that he erred on the side 
of austerity. His contemporaries the NigaıÒhas thought the other way. And the 
most serious schism in the Buddhist Order, that raised by Devadatta, was 
especially defended on the ground that Gotama would not, as regards various 
points, adopt ascetic practices which Devadatta held to be then 
necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>It is probable 
that Gotama was largely guided by the opinions and practice of previous 
recluses. For we have already seen that in other matters, important it is true 
but not essential, Gotama adopted and extended, so far as it agreed with the 
rest of his system, what had already been put forward by others. But we cannot, 
as yet, speak on this point with as much certainty as we could in the other 
cases of the ethical view of sacrifice, of the ethical connotation attached to 
the word Brahman<A title="" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn4"

and of the reasonable view as to social distinctions and questions of impurity. 
Our available texts are only sufficient, at present, to suggest the 
probability.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>The technical 
term tapas is already found in the Rig-veda, though only in the latest hymns 
included in the collection. It is literally 'glow, burning,' and very early 
acquired the secondary sense of retirement into solitude, and of the attempted 
conquest of one's lower nature by the burning heat of bodily austerity. And this 
must have been a common practice, for the time of the year most favourable to 
such</SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>tapas came to be 
known as the month tapas. There was no association with the word of what we call 
'penance,' a conception arising out of an entirely different order of religious 
ideas. There was no idea of atonement for, punishment of, making amends for sin. 
But just as the sacrificer was supposed, by a sort of charm that he worked by 
his sacrifice, to attain ends desirable for himself, so there was supposed to be 
a sort of charm in tapas producing mystic and marvellous results. The 
distinction seems to have been that it was rather power, worldly success, 
wealth, children, and heaven that were attained by sacrifice; and mystic, 
extraordinary, superhuman faculties that were attained by tapas.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>By a natural 
anthropomorphism the gods too were supposed, for like ends, to offer sacrifice 
and to perform tapas. Thus it is sometimes by sacrifice, but more often by 
tapas, that in the different cosmological legends one god or the other is 
supposed to bring forth creation<A title="" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn5"

In the latter case an expression often used on such occasions is tapas 
atapasyata, literally 'he glowed a glow,' and the exact meaning of this 
enigmatic phrase is by no means certain. It may have been meant to convey that 
he glowed with fierce resolve, or that he glowed with deep thought, or that he 
glowed with strong desire, or that he carried out each or some or all of the 
practices given in Kassapa's three lists of self-mortifications in our Sutta. 
All these various ideas may possibly be meant to be inferred together, and 
before they were ascribed to gods similar actions must have been well known 
among men.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>There were some,

The more conservative view of the learned Brahman-that it is repeating by heart 
to oneself, and teaching others, the Vedic verses, that is the chief thing (with 
which twelve other qualities or practices should always be associated)-is only 
given with the interesting note that one teacher thinks 'the true' only, another 
thinks austerity only to be necessary, and yet a third thinks that learning and 
teaching the Veda is enough by itself, 'for that is tapas, that is tapas<A

According to the Ch‡ndogya, those who know a certain mystical doctrine about 
five fires, and those who in the forest follow faith and austerity (tapas), go 
along the path of the gods to the Brahma worlds. On the other hand, they who 
sacrifice, and give alms go to the moon, and thence return to earth, and are 
reborn in high or low positions according to their deeds. But the bad become

differ there is a general concensus that above both sacrifice and austerity, 
which are themselves meritorious, there is a something higher, a certain kind of 
truth or faith or wisdom.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>This is the exact 
analogue, from the Upanishad point of view, to the doctrine of the Buddhists 
that Arahatship is better than austerity. And though the Upanishad belief is not 
worked out with the same consistency, nor carried so far to its logical 
conclusion, as the Buddhist, that is simply to be explained by the facts that it 
is not only earlier, belonging to a time when thought was less matured, but is 
also not the work of one mind, but of several. There can be but little doubt 
that Gotama, during his years of study and austerity before he attained Nirv‡ıa 
under the Tree of Wisdom, had come into contact with the very beliefs, or at 
least with beliefs similar to those, now preserved in the Upanishads; and that 
his general conclusion was based upon them. That he practically condemns 
physical tapas (austerity) altogether is no argument against his indebtedness, 
so far as the superiority of wisdom to austerity is concerned, to the older

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>already current, 
but by no means settled as to detail. It must evidently have taken shape between 
the date of the Upanishads just quoted and that of the law books ; that is to 
say, either just before or, some time after the rise of Buddhism. We can, I, 
think, go safely further, and say that it must have been, in all probability, 
after Buddha, and even after the time when the PiÒakas were put together. For 
neither the technical term ‚srama, nor any of the four stages of it, are 
mentioned in the PiÒakas.</SPAN></P>

Householder, (3) Hermit, (4) Wandering Mendicant-Brahmac‡rin, G.r.ihastha,

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>It will be 
noticed that this final arrangement differs in two respects-and both of them of 
importance-from the earliest. In the first place the wandering beggar is put in 
the last, that is in the highest, place. He is not subordinated, as he was at 
first, to the hermit. In the second place the expression Bhikshu, applied in 
Gautama to the wandering mendicant, is dropped in the later books.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>The commentators 
are at great pains to harmonise the divergent order. And they do so by 
suggesting that the earlier arrangement (which, of course, is, in their eyes, 
the strange one) is meant to infer exactly the same as does the contrary later 
arrangement so familiar to them. To them the wandering mendicant had become the 
last, in order of time and importance, of the Four Efforts; and they try to put 
back their own view into the words of the ancient writer they are dealing with. 
But if the order they were familiar with implies one thing, the older order, 
which is exactly the reverse, can scarcely imply the same. Or if it does, then 
the question arises, why should it ? In either case the explanation may be 
sought for in the history of the two ideas.</SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>description of 
the hermit by saying that he is to feed on roots and fruits, and practise tapas. 
And all the later books lay stress on the same point ; often giving, as 
instances of the tapas, one or other of the very practices detailed by Kassapa 
the t‡pasa, in his three lists, in our Sutta<A title="" 
style="mso-footnote-id: ftn17"

On the other hand, the wandering mendicant does not practise these severe 
physical self-mortifications. He is never called t‡pasa, and though he has 
abandoned the world, and wanders without a home, simply clad, and begging his 
food, his self-restraint is mental rather than physical. Of the fifteen rules 
laid down for him by Gautama, who calls him the Bhikshu (in X, 11-25), four or 
five are precisely equivalent to rules the Buddhist Bhikshu has to observe. 
There is one significant rule in Baudh‡yana, however, which is quite contrary to 
the corresponding Buddhist rule. According to it the twice-born mendicant of the 
priestly books is, in begging for food, to observe the rules of ceremonial 
purity, what we call now the rules of caste<A title=""

self-torture, tapas; is a world-wide phenomenon, and the practice of it was, no 
doubt, very early in India too, the idea of the wandering mendicant is peculiar 
to India. And though the origin and early history of this institution are at

referred to as belonging to a higher sphere than the muni, the ascetic. If that

This was doubtless of long standing. But it is a conception altogether different 
from that of the wandering mendicant. The word Bhikshu does not occur in any of

whereas the regulations, of about the same age, preserved in the Buddhist texts, 
fill the three volumes translated, under the title 'Vinaya Texts,' in the 
'sacred Books of the East.' And as time goes on the priestly literature 
continues to treat the life of a Bhikshu as entirely subordinate, and in the 
curtest manner. Even Manu has only three or four pages on the subject. The 
inconsistency, brevity, and incompleteness of the regulations in the priestly 
books lead one to suppose that, at the time when they were written, there were 
not enough Bhikshus, belonging to those circles, to make the regulations 
intended for them alone a matter of much practical importance. In other words, 
the development also of the Bhikshu idea was due rather to the Kshatriyas than 
to the sacrificing priests.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>The latter were 
naturally half-hearted in the matter. Even after they had invented the ‚srama 
theory, they did not seem to be very keen about it. On the contrary, there are 
several passages the other way. ‚pastamba closes his exposition of them with a 
remark that upsets the whole theory: 'There is no reason to place one ‚srama 
before another<A title="" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn24"

those who become Bhikshus do not gain salvation at all, 'they become dust and 
perish.'</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>This was no doubt 
the real inmost opinion of the more narrow-minded of the priests. But the first 
maker of the phrase did not quite like to put this forward in his own name-the 
idea of the Bhikshu as a man worthy of special esteem had already become too 
strong for that. So he makes the god his stalking-horse; and tries, by using his 
name, to gain respectability and acceptance for his view. And it survives 
accordingly as late as the earlier portion of Manu (II, 230), where mention is 
made of 'the Three ‚sramas,' omitting the Bhikshu. We ought not to be surprised 
to find that, though the whole passage is reproduced, in other respects, in the 
Institutes of Vishıu (XXXI, 7), this very curious and interesting phrase is 
replaced by another which avoids the difficulty.</SPAN></P>

when the custom of 'going forth' as a Bhikshu was becoming prevalent, had wished 
to counteract it, to put obstacles in the way, and especially to prevent any one 
doing so without first having become thoroughly saturated with the priestly view 
of things, they could scarcely have taken a more efficacious step than the 
establishment of this theory. And so far as it served this purpose, and so far 
only, do they seem to have cared much for it. We have no evidence that the 
theory had, at any time, become a practical reality-that is, that any 
considerable number of the twice-born, or even of the Brahmans, did actually 
carry out all the four ‚˘ramas. Among the circles led by the opinion of learned 
and orthodox priests it was, no doubt, really held improper for any man to 
become a <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">religieux </I>until he was 
getting old, or without having first gone through a regular course of Vedic 
study. And whenever he did renounce the world he was expected to follow such of 
the ancient customs (now preserved in the priestly books under the three heads 
of V‡naprastha, Parivr‡jaka, and Vedasa¸ny‡sin) as he chose to follow. But even 
then he need not observe a clear distinction between these various heads. The 
percentage of elderly Brahmans who followed any of the three at all must always 
have been very small indeed, and of these a good many probably became 
Veda-sa¸ny‡sins, a group which lies outside of the ‚˘ramas. The rules are 
admitted to be obsolete now. SaÔkara says. they were not observed in his time<A

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>self-torture of 
which our Sutta gives the earliest detailed account. There were others who 
rejected both, and preferred the life of the wandering mendicant. In both 
classes there were unworthy men who used their religious professions for the 
'low aims' set out in the tract on the S„las incorporated in our Sutta, whose 
very words, in not a few instances, recur in the old law books.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>But there was 
also no little earnestness, no little 'plain living and high thinking' among 
these 'irregular friars.' And there was a great deal of sympathy, both with 
their aims and with their practice (provided always they keep to the priestly 
view of things), among the official class, the regular sacrificing priests. 
Instead of condemning them, the priests tried, therefore, rather to regulate 
them. One. Vikhanas compiled a special book on Tapas, called either after the 
author the Vaikh‡nasa SÂtra, or after the subject the Sr‡maıaka SÂtra, which is 
several times referred to as an authority in the law books whose precepts are 
doubtless, in part, taken from it<A title="" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn28"

Tapas was then, in accordance with the general view in the circles in which the 
law books were composed, regarded as the higher, of the two, and put therefore 
at the end in the list of ‚˘ramas.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>But there was 
also another view which had already made itself felt in the Upanishads, which is 
the basis of our Sutta, and which no doubt became more widely spread in 
consequence of its having been the view taken up by the progressive party we now 
call Buddhists. According to this view the life of the Bhikshu, of the wandering 
mendicant, was the higher. This view, disliked by the more narrowminded, but 
regarded with favour by the more spirituallyminded of the Brahmans, gradually 
attained so unquestionably the upper hand, that the order of the last two of the 
‚˘ramas had to be changed. T a p a s became then a preliminary stage to, instead 
of the final crown of, the religious life.</SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>of all kinds 
could not be eradicated. Many of the laity still looked on those who carried out 
such practices with peculiar favour. The tendency made itself felt even in 
Buddhism, in spite of our present Sutta, and of many other passages to a similar 
effect. There is a special name for the 'extra vows,' the dhutangas, carried out 
by such of the brethren as were inclined that way. And these receive special 
glorification in a whole book at the end of the Milinda<A title="" 
style="mso-footnote-id: ftn29"

It is true that, even in these 'extra vows,' all the extreme forms of tapas are 
omitted. But this is only a matter of degree. In the priestly law books, also, 
though they go somewhat further than the dhutangas, the most extreme forms are 
omitted, especially in the rules for hermits and mendicants contained in the 
earlier books. This is another point in which the early Buddhists and the more 
advanced of the learned Brahmans of their time are found to be acting in 
sympathy. But the discussion of the details would take us too far from our 
subject.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>The NigaıÒhas, 
‚j„vakas, and others went to the other extreme, and like the Buddhists, they

It is even doubtful how far that distinction became a really valid and practical 
reality among the learned priests. They alone, as we have seen, always laid 
stress on the importance of not 'going forth,' either as ascetic or as wandering 
mendicant (t‡pasa or bhikshu unless first the years of studentship, and then the 
life as a sacrificing householder, had been fulfilled. They spoke occasionally

he mentions two Bhikshu SÂtras-manuals for mendicants, as the Vaikh‡nasa SÂtra 
was for the hermits (t‡pasas). These are used by the P‡r‡˘‡riıas and the 
Karmandinas, two groups or corporations, doubtless, of Brahmanical mendicants. 
Professor Weber refers to this in his History of Indian Literature, P. 305, and 
Professor Kielhorn has been kind enough to inform me that nothing more has been 
since discovered on the matter. These SÂtras are not mentioned elsewhere. And 
they can never have acquired so much importance as the Vaikh‡nasa SÂtra, or they 
would almost certainly have been referred to in the sections in the later law 
books on mendicants, just as the Vaikh‡nasa is in the sections on the 
t‡pasas.</SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>'That, Kassapa, 
is a common saying in the world that the life of a Samaıa and of a Br‡hmaıa is 
hard to lead. But if the hardness, the very great hardness, of that life 
depended merely on this ascetism, on the carrying out of any or all of those 
practices you have detailed, then it would not be fitting to say that the life 
of the Samaıa, of the Br‡hmaıa, was hard to lead. It would be quite possible for 
a householder, or for the son of a householder, or for any one, down to the 
slave girl who carries the water-jar, to say: " Let me now go naked, let me 
become of low habits," and so on through all the items of those three lists of

to which ‚pastamba belonged, was not convinced by the arguments leading up to 
the above conclusion. He only ventured, after reading them, to put ‚pastamba 'at

hermit, it is not necessary to call in the ‚srama rules to justify the foul 
deed. The offence (in the view of the poet on the part of the hermit, in the 
view of most Westerns on the part of the hero) is simply social insolence. Would 
public opinion, in Kosala, have sanctioned such an act, or enjoyed such a story, 
in the time of the PiÒakas? The original R‡m‡yaıa probably arose, as Professor 
Jacobi has shown, in Kosala; but this episode (VII, 76) is not in the oldest 
part. The doctrine for which the poet claims the approval of the gods (and 
which, therefore, was not unquestioned among men, or he need not have done so) 
is that a SÂdra may not become a t‡pasa.</SPAN></P></DIV>

the descendants of allied forms. Childers gives another form khalop„ on the

a cure for wind in the stomach is mentioned at Mah‡ Vagga VI, 16. 3; and it was 
allowed, as a beverage, if mixed with water, to the Buddhist Bhikkhus. In Vim‡na 
Vatthu XIX, 8 it is mentioned in a list of drinks given to them. Childers calls 
it 'sour gruel' following SubhÂti in the first edition (1865) of the Abhidh‡na 
Pad„pik‡ (verse 460), but in the Abh. Pad. SÂci (published in 1893) SubhÂti 
renders it 'kongey'; something of the same sort as barley water. Buddhaghosa 
adds: 'Every one agrees that it is wrong to drink intoxicants. These ascetics 
see sin even in this.' The corresponding Sanskrit word, tusodaka, is found only 
in Su˘ruta.</SPAN></P></DIV>

lang=EN-GB> The Burmese MSS. call it the Mah‡ S„han‡da Sutta, which is also the 
name given in the MSS. to the Twelfth Sutta in the Majjhima-called there in the 
text (p. 83) and in the Milinda (P.396), the Lomaha¸sana Pariy‡ya. We have had 
an instance above (p.55) of several different names being given, in the text 
itself, to the same Sutta. And I had already, in 1880, called attention in my 
'Buddhist Birth Stories' (pp. lx, lxi) to the numerous instances in the J‡taka 
Book of the same J‡taka being known, in the collection itself, by different 
names. It is evident that the titles were considered a very secondary 
matter.</SPAN></P></DIV></DIV></BODY></HTML>
