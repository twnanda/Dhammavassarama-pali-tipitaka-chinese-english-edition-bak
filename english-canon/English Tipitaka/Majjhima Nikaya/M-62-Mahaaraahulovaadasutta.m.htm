<P class=MsoBodyText>I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One was living in the 
monastery offered by anathapindika in Jeta’s grove in Savatthi. Then the Blessed 
One put on robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes entered Savatthi for 
alms. Venerable Rahula too putting on robes, taking bowl and robes followed the 
Blessed One close behind. Then the Blessed One looked back and addressed 
venerable Rahula: ‘Rahula, whatever matter, in the past, in the future or at 
present, internal or external, coarse or fine, un exalted or exalted, far or 
near, all matter is not mine, that is not me, that is not my self. This has to 
be seen as it really is with right wisdom’. ‘Blessed One, is it only matter?’ 
‘Rahula, feelings also, perceptions also, determinations and consciousness too.’ 

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then it occurred to 
venerable Rahula, advised by the Blessed One. What is the use of going for alms 
today? Venerable Rahula, stopped short, and sat with legs crossed at the root of 
a certain tree. The body straight and mindfulness established in front. 
Venerable Sariputta saw venerable Rahula seated cross, legged at the root of a 
certain tree, the body straight and mindfulness established in front of him. He 
said,‘Rahula, develop in breathing and out breathing. When, in- and out 
breathing is developed and made much, it brings good results and benefits. In 
the evening, venerable Rahula got up from his seclusion, approached the Blessed 
One, worshipped, sat on a side and said, ‘Venerable sir developed and made much

benefits?*1)<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>
