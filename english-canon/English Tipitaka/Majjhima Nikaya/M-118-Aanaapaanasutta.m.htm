heard thus.At one time the Blessed One lived in the Pubba monastery in the 
palace of Migaara’s mother, with the thoroughly learned elder disciples, such as 
venerables Saariputta, Mahaamoggallaana, Mahaakassapa, Mahaakaccaayana, 
Mahaako.t.thita, Mahaakappina, Mahaacunda, Anuruddha, Revata, Aananda and other 
learned elder disciples. At that time the elder bhikkhus were advising and 
instructing the novices. A certain elder bhikkhu advised ten novices, another 
twenty novices, another thirty and yet another forty novices. The novices too 
advised and instructed by the elder bhikkhus attained distinctive levels not 
attained before. On that full moon night the Blessed One was seated outside in 
the moonlight attended by the Community of bhikkhus&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></SPAN>

style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The Blessed One observed the silent Community 
of bhikkhus and addessed them ‘Bhikkhus, I’m happy and convinced with this mode 
of progress. Therefore bhikkhus arouse much effort to attain the not attained, 
to realize the not realized, as I would be leaving Saavatthi on the full moon 
day of the fourth month of the rains.’. The bhikkhus who had come from the 
states heard these words and they came to see the Blessed One. The elder 
bhikkhus hearing these words were very pleased and advised and instructed the 
novices. A certain elder bhikkhu advised ten novices, another twenty novices, 
another thirty and yet another forty novices. The novices too advised and 
instructed by the elder bhikkhus attained distinctive levels not attained

Community of bhikkhus and addressed them. Bhikkhus, this gatherig is without 
idle talk, without empty talk, established in the pure essence. Such a gathering 
is worthy of honour, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings and reverential 
salutation, and it becomes an incomparable field of merit to the worldling. 
Giving a little to such a gathering brings much results, giving much brings much 
more. The sight of such a gathering is rare in the world<SPAN

such a gathering with provisions for the journey. In this gathering there are 
worthy ones, desires destroyed, lived the holy life, done what should be done, 
dismissed the weight, come to the highest good, destroyed the bond ‘to be’ and 
rightly knowing released. In this gathering there are bhikkhus who have 
destroyed the five lower bonds of the sensual world and are born spontaneously, 
not to proceed but to extinguish in that same birth<SPAN

destroyed three bonds and dwindling greed, hate and delusion, would come to this

Teaching, not falling from there, are sure of enlightenment. In this gathering
