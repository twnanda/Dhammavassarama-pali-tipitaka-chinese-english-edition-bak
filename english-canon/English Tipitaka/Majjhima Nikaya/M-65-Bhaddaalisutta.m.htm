<BR>&nbsp; 
<P class=MsoBodyText>I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One was living in the 
monastery offered by Anathapindika in Jeta’s grove in Savatthi. The Blessed One 
addressed from there.Bhikkhus, I partake a single meal for the day, and on 
accont of it experience few afflictions, few ailments, lightness, power, and a 
pleasant abiding.Come! bhikkhus, you too partake a single meal for the day, and 
on accont of it experience few afflictions, few ailments, lightness, power, and 
a pleasant abiding. When this was said venerable Bhaddali said thus to the 
Blessed One-Venerable sir, I would not venture to eat one meal for the day. 
Eating one meal a day, doubts and remorse arise to me*1). Then Bhaddali, when 
you are invited do you partake there, and carry away food to another region and 
partake it? Bhaddali are you supported that way too? Even then venerable sir, I 
would not venture to eat one meal for the day. Eating one meal a day, doubts and 
remorse arise to me. When the Blessed One, was laying down the rules and the 
Community of bhikkhus accepting to abide by the rules, venerable Bhaddali was 
not venturing to accept them. So Venerable Bhaddali did not come to the presence 
of the Blessed One during those three months as one incomplete in the training, 
in the dispensation.of the Teacher.. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>At that time many 
bhikkhus were sewing the Blessed One’s robe; When the robe was sewn and 
completed the Blessed One was to leave on a tour. Venerable Bhaddali approached 
those bhikkhus, exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side. Then those 
bhikkhus said. ‘Bhaddali, here, we are sewing the Blessed One’s robe, when it is 
completed and at the end of the three months the blessed One is leaving on a 
tour. Come, Bhaddali, be careful. Don’t fall into unpleasantness for a long 
time.’ Venerable Bhaddali accepting the advice given by those bhikkhus, 
approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said, to the Blessed 
One: ‘Venerable sir, I have transgressed, owing to foolishness, delusion and 
demerit. When the rules were laid down for the Community of bhikkhus, and when 
the bhikkhus were accepting the rules, I declared not venturing to accept.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Pardon my fault, venerable sir, and that would 
be for future restraint’. ‘Bhaddali, you have transgressed, owing to 
foolishness, delusion, and demerit. When I was laying down the rules, and when 
the Community of bhikkhus were accepting the rules, you declared not venturing 
to accept them. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhaddali, didn’t it 
occur to you, the Blessed One lives in Savatthi, and will know me as a bhikkhu 
incomplete in the training? Bhaddali, didn’t it occur to you, many bhikkhus have 
come for the rains to Savatthi, they will know me as a bhikkhu incomplete in the 
training? Bhaddali, didn’t it occur to you, many bhikkhunis have come for the 
rains to Savatthi, they will know me as a bhikkhu incomplete in the training? 
Bhaddali, didn’t it occur to you, many male lay disciples have come to Savatthi, 
they will know me as a bhikkhu incomplete in the training? Bhaddali, didn’t it 
occur to you, many female lay disciples have come to Savatthi, they will know me 
as a bhikkhu incomplete in the training? Bhaddali, this too didn’t occur to you, 
many recluses and brahmins of other sects have come to Savatthi for the rains, 
they will know me as a bhikkhu incomplete in the training? A disciple of the 
recluse Gotama, a certain elder in the dispensation is incomplete in the 
training.’ ‘Venerable sir, I have transgressed, owing to foolishness, delusion 
and demerit. When the rules were laid down for the Community of bhikkhus, and 
when the bhikkhus were accepting the rules, I declared not venturing to accept 
them. Pardon my fault, venerable sir, and that would be for future restraint. 
Bhaddali, you have transgressed, owing to foolishness, delusion, and demerit, 
when I was laying down the rules, and when the Community of bhikkhus were 
accepting the rules, you declared not venturing to accept them. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhaddali, I tell a 
bhikkhu released both ways,*1) Come bhikkhu, lie in this mud for me. Would he 
lie in the mud, or would he put something else on the mud, or would he say no?’ 
‘That, would not happen, venerable sir.’ ‘Bhaddali, I tell a bhikkhu released 
through wisdom.*2) Come bhikkhu lie in this mud for me. Would he lie in the mud, 
or would he put something else on the mud, or would he say no?’ ‘That would not 
be venerable sir.’ ‘Bhaddali, I tell a body witness of the path,*3) or one come 
to righteousness of view,*4) or one released through faith*5), or one faring 
according to the Teaching,*6) or one faring according to faith*7). Come bhikkhu 
lie in the mud for me. Would he lie in the mud, or would he put something else 
on the mud, or would he say no?’ ‘That would not be venerable sir.’ ‘Bhaddali, 
weren’t you at that time empty, useless and gone wrong?’ ‘Yes, venerable sir.I 
have transgressed owing to foolishness, delusion and demerit. When the rules 
were laid down for the Community of bhikkhus, and when the bhikkhus were 
accepting the rules, I declared not venturing to accept them.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Pardon my fault, venerable sir. That would be 
for future restraint.’ ‘Bhaddali, you have transgressed, owing to foolishness, 
delusion, and demerit. When I was laying down the rules, and when the Community 
of bhikkhus were accepting the rules, you declared not venturing to accept them. 
Bhaddali, since you accept the fault, and ask to be pardond for future 
restraint, I pardon you. It is growth in the noble one’s dispensation to ask to 
be pardoned, seeing the fault and for future restraint. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhaddali, there is a 
bhikkhu in the dispensation of the Teacher not yet complete in the training, he 
thinks Indeed I will attain some distinctive knowledge above human if I dwelt in 
some secluded dwelling like the root of a tree in the forest, a cave or grotto 
in the mountains, a charnel ground, a jungle forest, an open space or a heap of 
straw..He dwells in some secluded dwelling like the root of a tree in the 
forest, a cave or grotto in the mountains, a charnel ground, a jungle forest, an 
open space or a heap of straw. The Teacher blames him, considering it the wise 
co-associates blame him, gods and he himself blames him and he does not attain 
some distinctive knowledge above human. What is the reason? That happens to one 
incomplete in the training in the dispensation of the Teacher.<SPAN

blame him, considering it the wise co-associates do not blame him, gods and he 
himself do not blame him and he attains some distinctive knowledge above human. 
Secluded from sensual desires, and thoughts of demerit, with thoughts and 
thought processes and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion attained to 
abides in the first jhana: What is the reason?. Bhaddali it happens to one 
complete in the training of the dispensation of the Teacher. Again the bhikkhu 
overcoming thoughts and thought processes with the mind appeased and in one 
point, without thoughts and thought processes and with joy and pleasantness born 
of concentration attained to abides in the second jhana: What is the reason? 
Bhaddali, it happens to one complete in the training. Again, Bhaddali the 
bhikkhu with equanimity to joy and detachment and experiencing pleasantness with 
the body too abides in the third jhaana. To this the noble ones say abiding in 
pleasantness minful of equanimity. What, is the reason?. Bhaddali it happens to 
one complete in the training. Again, Bhaddali, the bhikkhu dispelling 
pleasantness and unpleasantness and earlier having overcome pleasure and 
displeasure..With equnimity purifying mindfulness abides in the fourth jhana. 
What is the reason? Bhaddali it happens to one complete in the training in the 
dispensation of the Teacher. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>When the mind is 
concentrated, pure without blemish free of minor defilements workable and 
malleable and is steady he directs the mind to know previous births. He 
recollects innumerable previous births. What is the reason? Bhaddali it happens 
to one complete in the training in the dispensation of the Teacher. When the 
mind is concentrated, pure without blemish free from minor defilements, workable 
malleable and steady, he directs the mind to know the disappearing and appearing 
of beings. With the heavenly eye purified beyond human he sees beings 
disappearing and appearing in unexalted and exalted states, beautiful and ugly 
in good and bad states. Knows beings according their actions. What is the 
reason? Bhaddali it happens to one complete in the training in the dispensation 
of the Teacher When the mind is concentrated, pure, without blemish free from 
minor defilements, workable malleable and is steady directs the mind for the 
destruction of desires. He knows, as it really is, this is unpleasant---- knows 
the path to the cessation of desires as it really. When he knows and sees thus, 
his mind is released from sensual desires, from the desires ‘to be’ and from 
ignorant desires. When released knows, I’m released. Birth is destroyed, the 
holy life is lived, what should be done is done. There is nothing more to wish. 
What is the reason? Bhaddali it happens to one complete in the training, in the 
dispensation, of the Teacher’ 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>When this was said 
venerable Bhaddali said to the Blessed One.Venerable sir, why is a certain 
bhikkhu pursued closely and another not? Bhaddali, a certain bhikkhu always does 
an offence. When the bhikkhus question him, he leads the talk aside and shows 
anger, aversion and displeasure. He does not behave correctly and say, I will 
act in such a way to please the Community. Then it occurs to those bhikkhus. 
This bhikkhu always does an offence. When questiond by the bhikkhus, he leads 
the talk aside and shows anger, aversion and displeasure. He does not behave 
correctly and say, I will act in such a way to please the Community. Then the 
bhikkhus say, good if the venerable ones do not settle this bhikkhu’s question 
quickly. Bhaddali, then it happens that the bhikkhus do not settle that 
bhikkhu’s question quickly. Here Bhaddali, a certain bhikkhu always does an 
offence, when the bhikkhus question him, he does not lead the talk aside and 
does not show anger, aversion and displeasure, he behaves calmly and says, I 
will act in such a way to please the Community. Then it occurs to those 
bhikkhus.The bhikkhu always does an offence. When questiond by the bhikkhus he 
does not lead the talk aside and show anger, aversion and displeasure. He 
behaves calmly and says, I will act in such a way to please the Community, Then 
the bhikkhus say, good if the venerable ones settle this bhikkhu’s question 
quickly. Bhaddali, then it happens that the bhikkhus settle that bhikkhu’s 
question quickly. .<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Here Bhaddali, a 
certain bhikkhu is always guilty, without an offence when the bhikkhus question 
him, he leads the talk aside and shows anger, aversion and displeasure. He does 
not behave correctly and say, I will act in such a way to please the 
Community.Then it occurs to those bhikkhus. This bhikkhu is always guilty 
without an offence, when questiond by the bhikkhus leads the talk aside and 
shows anger, aversion and displeasure. He does not behave correctly and say, I 
will act in such a way to please the Community, Then the bhikkhus say, good if 
the venerable ones do not settle<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>this 
bhikkhu’s question quickly. Bhaddali, then it happens that the bhikkhus do not 
settle that bhikkhu’s question quickly. Here Bhaddali, a certain bhikkhu is 
always guilty without an offence, when the bhikkhus question him, he does not 
lead the talk aside and does not show anger, aversion and displeasure. He

settle that bhikkhu’s question quickly. .<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhaddali, a certain 
bhikkhu goes on, only out of faith and love. Then it occurs to the bhikkhus: 
This bhikkhu goes on only out of faith and love: If we pursue this bhikkhu too 
much his little faith and love will decrease. When a man has a single eye, his 
friends, co-associates and blood relations protect his single eye, do not do 
this and that, your one eye will be lost. In the same manner it occurs to the 
bhikkhus: This bhikkhu goes on only out of faith and love: If we pursue this 
bhikkhu too much even his little faith and love will decrease. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhaddali this is the 
reason for a certain bhikkhu to be pursued closely and another not to be pursued 
closely ‘ 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable sir, what 
is the reason that earlier, with few rules many bhikkhus attained extinction, 
and now with many rules a few bhikkhus attain extinction?’ ‘Baddali, it happens 
when human beings diminish in good and when the Teaching deteriorates. Many 
rules are appointed few bhikkhus attain extinction. Bhaddali, the Teacher does 
not appoint a rule until a fall for desires is evident, when falls for desires 
are evident among the Community, the Teacher appoints a rule for the dispelling 
of those falls for desires. Until the Community grows large, these falls for 
desires do not become evident. Until the Community become the highest gainers, 
the Community reaches the highest fame, become the most learned, the long 
standing ones, a fall for desires does not become evident. Bhaddali, when a 
bhikkhu becomes a long standing one a fall for desires becomes evident and then 
the Teacher appoints a rule to dispel those falls for desires.’<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhaddali you were 
small when I taught the discourse with the comparison of the thoroughbred, do 
you remember it? No, venerable sir. Bhaddali, do you know why it was taught? 
Venerable sir, isn’t it for being incomplete in the training in the dispensation 
of the Teacher for a long time? Bhaddali, that only, is not the reason, I have 
penetrated and seen your mind throughout a long time. I knew,:this foolish man 
does not consider the Teaching as a whole and and take the essence. I will give 
the discourse with the simile of the thoroughbred, listen and attend carefully.’ 
Venerable Bhaddali agreed and the Blessed One said thus: 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Bhaddali, a good 
tamer of horses, getting a thoroughbred to train would first train it to the 
mouth. While getting trained to the mouth it would be restless, disagreeable and 
would writhe with the unusual training but would quickly do the first and the 
last of those exercises and soon the restlessness, disagreeability and the 
writhing would subside. When the restlessness, disagreeability and the writhing 
by wearing the mouth -piece subsides, the horse trainer gives it a further 
training in fixing the yoke. When fixed to the yoke too the thoroughbred would 
be restless, disagreeable and would writhe with the unusual training but would 
quickly do the first and the last of the exercises and soon the restlessness, 
disagreeability and the writhing would subside. Then the horse trainer would 
give him a further training in gallopping in circles, repeatedly. Getting 
trained in the unusual gallopping in circles, repeatedly it would be restless, 
disagreeable and would writhe with the unusual training but would quickly do the 
first and the last of those exercises and soon the restlessness, disagreeability 
and the writhing would subside. When the restlessness, disagreeability and the 
writhing subsides, when gallopping in circles, repeatedly, the horse trainer 
would give it a further training in maintaining silence. While getting trained 
in maintaining silence too, it would be restless, disagreeable and would writhe 
with the unusual training but would quickly do the first and the last of those 
exercises and soon the restlessness, disagreeability and the writhing would 
subside. When the thoroughbred has finished this tenfold training, it becomes 
worthy for the king, worthy for the services of the king, the royal property. In 
the same manner the bhikkhu endowed with these ten things would be worthy for 
hospitality, offerings, gifts, and for reverential salutation. He becomes an 
incomparable field of merit for the world: What ten: The bhikkhu should be 
endowed with the right view, of one gone beyond the training and right thoughts 
of one gone beyond the training. Endowed with right words and right actions of 
one gone beyond the training. Endowed with the right livelihood of one gone 
beyond the training. With right effort and right mindfulness of one gone beyond 
the training. Should be endowed with the right concentration and right release 
of one gone beyond the training. Bhaddali, the bhikkhu endowed with these ten 
things becomes worthy for hospitality, worthy for offerings, worthy for gifts, 
worthy for reverential salutation and an incomparable field of merit for the 
world’.

released both ways.’ubhatovimutto’ A bhikkhu released both ways literary knows 
the release and he experiences that release here and now. That is he experiences 
the release that he knows with the body here and now.eg. He is not touched by 
any contact at one or the other doors of mental contact. He also has experienced 
this through the jhaanas. 2. Released through wisdom.’pa~n~naavimutto’ He

experience the results here and now. Yet he is quite safe and would experience 
its results at least on his death bed. 4.One come to righteousness of

of faith in the enlightenment of the Blessed One, in the Teaching and in the 
Community of bhikkhus. On account of it he is released through faith. He is
