<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">I heard 
thus.At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anathapindika 
in Jet’s grove in Savatthi. At that time the wandering ascetic Uggaahamaana<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Samanamandikaaputta with the opportunitst view 
was living in the single halled Mallika monastery on the bank of Tindukaa, with 
a large gathering of wandering ascetics about three hundred. It happened that 
the carpenter Pancakanga arrived in Savatthi during the day to see the Blessed 
One and it occurred to him. It is too early to see the Blessed One, he is 
abiding in his seclusion. He also thought of approaching the bhikkhus who give 
advice for the development of the mind, and thought. They should be in seclusion 
and then thought of approaching the wandering ascetic Uggaahamaana 
Samanamandikaaputta in the single halled Mallika monastery and approached him At 
the time the wandering ascetic Uggaahamaana Samanamandikaaputta was seated with 
a large gathering of wandering ascetics&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-AU>making much 
noise. They were engaged in various kinds of childish talk, about kings, 
robbers, chief ministers, the army, fears, fights, eatables, drinks, dress, 
beds, flowers scents, relations, conveyances, villages, hamlets, towns and 
states, women heros, gossip at the corner of the street and at the well. Gossip 
about those dead and gone, various other talk about the origin of the world and 
the ocean and the things that<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>happened<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>and did not happen. The wandering ascetic 
Uggaahamaana Samanamandikaaputta saw the carpenter Pancakanga coming in the 
distance and silenced the gathering. ‘Good sirs, make less noise, do not make 
such a noise. A lay disciple of the recluse Gotama the carpenter Pancanga is 
coming. He is one of the lay disciples of the recluse Gotama, of those who live 
in Savatthi and wear white clothes These venerable ones make little noise, are 
trained to make little noise and they train others to make little noise. 
Thinking this gathering makes little noise may have thought to approach.’ Then 
those wandering ascetics became silent. The carpenter Pancakanga approached the 
wandering ascetic Uggahamana Samanamandikaputta, exchanged friendly greetings 
with the wandering ascetic Uggaahamaana Samanamandikaaputta and sat on a side. 
When he was seated the wandering ascetic Uggaahamaana Samanamandikaaputta said 
thus to him. ’Carpenter, I declare the person endowed with four things as the 
most skilled, perfect recluse, endowed with highest merit. What are four? Here 
carpenter, he does no evil by body, no evil by words, does not think evil 
thoughts and does not lead an evil livelihood. A man endowed with these four 
things, I declare as the most skilled, perfect recluse endowed with the highest 
merit.’&nbsp;</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The 
carpenter Pancakanga was not pleased nor did condemn those words of the 
wandering ascetic Uggahamana Samanamandikaputta. He got up thinking I will know 
the meaning of these words from the Blessed One approached the Blessed One, 
worshipped and sat on a side. Then he related the conversation, that occurred 
between himself and the wandering ascetic Uggaahamaana Samanamandikaaputta. The 
Blessed One said to the carpenter Pancakanga. ‘Carpenter, if this is so, a 
toddler who could not stand or sit quickly would be the most skilled, perfect 
recluse endowed with the highest merit. Carpenter, a toddler who could not stand 
and sit quickly, would not have an idea of a body, so how could he do evil with 
the body, other than move his limbs. Carpenter, a toddler who could not stand 
and sit quickly, would not have even words, so how could there be evil done with 
words, other than crying. Carpenter, a toddler who could not stand and sit 
quickly, would not have even thoughts, so how could he think evil thoughts, 
other than expressing displeasure. Carpenter, a toddler who could not stand and 
sit quickly, would not have even a livelihood, so how could there be evil 
livelihood to him, other than drinking the mother’s milk. Carpenter, according 
to the words of the wandering ascetic Uggaahamaana Samanamandikaputta, a toddler 
who could not stand and sit quickly would be the most skilled, perfect recluse 
endowed with the highest merit.&nbsp;</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Carpenter, I do not declare the most skilled 
perfect recluse endowed with the highest merit with these four things, as the 
wandering ascetic Uggaahamaana Samanamandikaputta says. I say these are the 
perfect qualities of a toddler who could not stand and sit quickly. What are the 
four? Carpenter, he does no evil action by body, utters no evil words, does not 
think evil thoughts, and has no evil livelihood. I do not declare the most 
skilled perfect recluse endowed with the highest merit with these four 
qualities. They are the perfect qualities of a toddler who could not stand and 
sit quickly.</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Carpenter, with these ten things I declare the 
most skilled perfect recluse endowed with the highest merit. I say, he should 
know, these observances lead to demerit. These observances of demerit start 
here. The observances of demerit cease here without a remainder. Carpenter, I 
say, this is the method of ceasing observances of demerit. He should know these 
observances of merit start here and cease here without a remainder. I say, this 
is the method of ceasing observances of merit. Carpenter, I say, he should know, 
that these are evil thoughts that start here. He should know, these evil 
thoughts cease here without a remainder. Carpenter, I say, this is the method of 
ceasing evil thoughts. He should know these are thoughts of merit, and they 
start here. These thoughts of merit cease here without a remainder. Carpenter, I 
say, this is the method for the cessation of thoughts of merit, he should know 
this too.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-GB

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Carpenter, what are observances of demerit? 
Bodily actions of demerit, verbal actions of demerit and a livelihood of demerit 
are the observances of demerit. Carpenter, where do these observances of demerit 
rise? They arise in the mind, is the reply What is that mind? Minds are various 
and different. The mind is with greed, anger and delusion. Thus observances of 
demerit start there. Carpenter, where do these observances of demerit cease 
completely? Their cessation is thus. The bhikkhu gives up bodily actions of 
demerit and develops bodily actions of merit. Gives up verbal actions of demerit 
and develops verbal actions of merit. Gives up mental actions of demerit and 
develops mental actions of merit. Giving up wrong livelihood develops the right 
livelihood. Here, these observances of demerit cease completely. Carpenter, 
fallen to what method, is the ceasing of observances of demerit? Carpenter, the 
bhikkhu arouses interest and effort to push the mind forward with endeavour, for 
the not arising of not arisen demerit. The bhikkhu arouses interest and effort, 
to push the mind forward with endeavour, to dispel arisen demerit. The bhikkhu 
arouses interest and effort to push the mind forward with endeavour for arousing 
not arisen merit. The bhikkhu arouses interest and effort, to push the mind 
forward with endeavour for the undeluded stabilisation, growth, development and 
completion of arisen merit. Carpenter, this is the method, of ceasing 
observances of demerit.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-GB

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU>. Carpenter, what are observances, for 
merit?<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bodily actions of merit, verbal 
actions of merit and a pure livelihood are observances for merit. Where do these 
observances of merit rise? They arise in the mind, is the reply What is that 
mind? Minds are various and different. The mind without greed, the mind without 
anger and the mind without delusion, are the varied and different minds. Thus 
observances of merit start here. Carpenter, where do these observances of merit 
cease completely? Their cessation too is told. Carpenter, the bhikkhu becomes 
virtuous, not only that, but knows as it really is, how there is to him the 
release of the mind and the release through wisdom through the cessation of the 
observances of merit*1) Here, these observances of merit completely cease. 
Carpenter, fallen to what method, is the ceasing of observances of merit? 
Carpenter, the bhikkhu arouses interest and effort to push the mind forward with 
endeavour for not arousing of not arisen demerit. The bhikkhu arouses interest 
and effort to push the mind forward with endeavour to dispel arisen demerit. The 
bhikkhu arouses interest and effort to push the mind forward with endeavour to 
arouse, not arisen merit. The bhikkhu arouses interest and effort, to push the 
mind forward with endeavour for undeluded stabilisation, growth, development and 
completion of arisen merit. Carpenter, the bhikkhu falls to this method, for 
ceasing observances of merit. .&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-GB

style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Carpenter, what are thoughts of demerit? 
Sensual thoughts, angry thoughts and hurting thoughts, are thoughts of demerit. 
Where do these thoughts of demerit arise? They arise from perceptions, is the 
reply. What are perceptions? Perceptions are also various and different. They 
are sensual perceptions, angry perceptions, and hurting perceptions. Thoughts of 
demerit arise from these perceptions. Carpenter, where do these thoughts of 
demerit cease completely? Their cessation too is told. Here, the bhikkhu 
secluded from sensual thoughts ---abides in the first jhana. Here, all thoughts 
of demerit cease completely. Carpenter, fallen to what method is the ceasing of 
thoughts of demerit? Here, carpenter, the bhikkhu arouses interest and effort to 
push the mind forward with endeavour for the non arising of not arisen thoughts 
of demerit. The bhikkhu arouses interest and effort to push the mind forward 
with endeavour to dispel arisen thoughts of demerit. The bhikkhu arouses

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Carpenter, what are thoughts of merit? 
Non-sensual thoughts, non-angry thoughts and not hurting thoughts are thoughts 
of merit. Carpenter, where do these thoughts of merit arise?.There arising is 
also told, they arise in perceptions, is the reply. What are perceptions? 
Perceptions are also various and different, non-sensual perceptions, non-angry 
perceptions and non-hurting perceptions. From these arise thoughts of merit. 
Carpenter, where do these thoughts of merit cease without a remainder. 
Carpenter, their cessation is also told. Here, carpenter, the bhikkhu, 
overcoming thoughts and thought processes –re—attained to abide in the second 
jhana. Here all thoughts of merit cease without a remainder. Carpenter, fallen 
to what method, is the cessation of thoughts of merit? Here, carpenter, the 
bhikkhu arouses interest and effort to push the mind forward with endeavour for 
the not arising of not arisen thoughts of demerit. The bhikkhu arouses interest 
and effort, to push the mind forward with endeavour to dispel arisen thoughts of 
demerit. The bhikkhu arouses interest and effort to push the mind forward with 
endeavour to arouse not arisen thoughts of merit. The bhikkhu arouses interest 
and effort, to push the mind forward with endeavour for the undeluded 
stabilisation, growth, development and completion of arisen thoughts of merit. 
Carpenter, the bhikkhu falls to this method for the cessation of thoughts of 
merit. Carpenter, endowed with what ten things do I declare the most skilled 
perfect recluse with the highest merit.? Here, carpenter, the bhikkhu is endowed 
with, right understanding of one gone beyond the training. He is endowed with 
right thoughts right speech, right actions, right livelihood, right endeavour, 
right mindfulness and right concentration of one gone beyond the training. He is 
endowed with right knowledge and right release of one gone beyond the training. 
Endowed with these ten things, I declare the most skilled perfect recluse with 
the highest merit.&nbsp;</SPAN>
