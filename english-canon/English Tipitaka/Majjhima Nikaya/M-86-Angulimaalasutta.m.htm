<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was 
living in the monastery offered by Anathapindika in Jeta’s grove in Savatthi. At 
that time in King Pasenadi Kosala’s kingdom there was a robber named Angulimala. 
He was fierce, with bloody hands, engaged in killing living things without 
mercy. At that time he destroyed complete villages, complete hamlets and even 
the state. He killed humans to wear a garland of fingers. Then the Blessed One 
put on robes in the morning, taking bowl and robes entered Savatthi for alms. 
Going the alms round and returning from the alms round and after the meal was 
over, arranged the dwelling and taking bowl and robes, followed up the path to 
where Angulimala was. Cowherds, farmers and travellers seeing the Blessed One 
following up the path leading to where Angulimala was staying said. ‘Recluse do 
not fall to that path, there lives a robber named Angulimala, a fierce one with 
bloody hands, engaged in killing living things, without mercy. He has destroyed 
complete villages, complete hamlets and even states. He kills humans to wear a 
garland of fingers. O! recluse, even a band of ten, twenty, thirty forty, or 
even fifty people going along this path were killed by this robber Angulimala. 
When this was said the Blessed One went on, silently. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>For the second time they said it and the 
Blessed One went on, silently and for the third time they said it and the 
Blessed One went on, silently. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The robber Angulimala saw the Blessed One 
coming in the distance and it occurred to him: Indeed it is wonderful, people 
come along this path in bands of ten, or twenty, or thirty, or forty, or fifty, 
they all got into my hands, this recluse comes all alone, without another, may 
be he thinks to overcome me. What if I kill this recluse? Then the robber 
Angulimala took out his sword and armour and fixed his bow and arrow and 
followed close behind Blessed One. The Blessed One performed such a psychic 
intention, that the robber Angulimala pursuing the Blessed One with all his 
strength would not reach the Blessed One. Then it occurred to the robber 
Angulimala: It is indeed wonderful, earlier, I could overtake a running 
elephant, a running horse, a moving chariot, here running with all my strength, 
I cannot reach up to this recluse. He stopped and called to the Blessed One. 
‘Stop! Recluse stop!’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Angulimala, I have stopped. ‘Stop you too!’ The 
Blessed One said. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then it occurred to the robber Angulimala: 
These recluses, the sons of the Sakyas talk the truth and are established in the 
truth: Yet while walking why did he say, I have stopped and Angulimala you too 
stop! What if I ask about it from the recluse?’ Then the robber Angulimala said 
this verse to the Blessed One.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘While going the recluse says ‘I have stopped,’ 
when I have stopped, he says I have 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>not stopped.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Recluse, explain this to me, how have you 
stopped and I have not stopped.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Angulimala I have stopped for good, giving up 
punishing living things. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>You are not restrained towards living things, 
therefore I have stopped and you have<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>

your words enjoined with the Teaching. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN

weapons into the depths of the forest 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Fell at the feet of the Blessed One and begged 
for the going forth,

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then the Blessed One with venerable Angulimala 
as the second monk went through the streets of Savatthi and arrived at the 
monastery offered by Anathapindika in Jeta’s grove. At that time at the entrance 
to the palace of king Pasenadi of Kosala was assembled a large gathering, making 
much noise: Lord, there is a robber Angulimala, in the kingdom. He is fierce, 
with bloody hands, has no compassion for living things, destroys, hamlets, 
villages and states. He killing humans collects fingers to wear as a garland 
round his neck. Lord he should be punished. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then king Pasenadi of Kosala left his palace 
with about five hundred riders on horse back and approached the monastery. Went 
as far as could be reached in that conveyance and approached the Blessed One, on 
foot. Approaching the Blessed One worshipped and sat on a side. Then the Blessed 
One said thus to king Pasenadi of Kosala ’Great king, has king Seniya Bimbisara 
of Magadha arisen against you, or has the Licchavis of Vesali arisen against 
you?’ ‘No, venerable sir, neither king Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha has arisen 
against me, nor the Licchavis of vesali have arisen against me. Yet there is a 
robber in my kingdom, by the name Angulimala, fierce, bloody handed, without 
compassion for living things. He destroys hamlets, villages and states killing 
humans to collect fingers to wear a garland round his neck..Venerable sir, I 
cannot punish him.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Great king, if you see, Angulimala, with 
shaved head and beard, donning yellow clothes, gone forth homeless, abstaining 
from, destroying life, taking the not given, telling lies, partaking one meal a 
day, and virtuous. What would you do to him?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable sir, I will get up from my seat on 
his arrival, prepare him a seat, invite him, arrange to provide the four 
requisites of life, robes, morsel food, dwellings and requisites when ill and 
provide him righteous protection. Yet venerable sir, how could such virtues come 
to evil doers, like him?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>At that time venerable Angulimala was seated 
close to the Blessed One, and the Blessed One stretched his right and said, to 
king Pasenadi of Kosala: Great king that is Angulimala. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then king Pasenadi of Kosala was shivering with 
fear and his hairs stood on end. Then the Blssed One knowing that king Pasenadi 
of Kosala was shivering with fear and that his hairs were standing on end, said 
thus: Great king, do not fear, there is nothing to fear now. Then all that fear 
vanished from the king and approached venerable Angulimala and said. ‘Venerable 
sir, are you Angulimala?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Yes, great king, I’m Angulimaala.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Of what clan is the venerable one’s father and 
of what clan is the venerable one’s mother?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Great king, my father is Gagga and my mother 
Mantani’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable sir, venerable Gaggamantaniputta, 
take pleasure in the Dispensation, I will provide with the four requisites of 
life such as robes, morsel food dwellings and requisites when ill. At that time 
venerable Angulimala was a dependent on morsel food, a forest dweller, a rag 
robe wearer and confined to three robes. So venerable Angulimala said to king 
Pasenadi of Kosala.’Useless great king, my three robes are complete.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then king Pasenadi of Kosala approached the 
Blessed One worshipped, sat on a side and said. ‘Indeed, it is wonderful, how 
you tame, those that have to be tamed, how you appease those that are not 
appeased, how you make the not extinguished to extinguish. How you tame those 
that could not be tamed with stick or weapon, without stick or weapon. Now we 
have much work to do, we would go. Then king Pasenadi of Kosala getting up from 
his seat, worshipped and circumambulated the Blessed One, and went away.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then venerable Angulimala putting on robes in 
the morning and taking bowl and robes entered Savatthi for alms. When going the 
alms round in Savatthi in due order, saw a certain woman with the pains of 
childbirth, then it occurred to him, indeed beings are defiled. Then after the 
alms round and after the meal was over, venerable Angulimala approached the 
Blessed One worshipped, sat on a side and said to the Blessed One: ‘Venerable 
sir, when I was going for alms in due order, I saw a certain woman suffering 
from the pains of childbirth and it occurred to me: Indeed beings are defiled.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Then Angulimala go to Savatthi, approach that 
woman and tell her. ‘Sister, since my birth I have not destroyed a living thing 
knowingly, by that truth may you be well and may the one to be born be well.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable sir, won’t it be a lie told with 
awareness, I have destroyed many living things with awareness.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Then Angulimala go to Savatthi 
and approach that woman and tell her. ‘Sister, since I was born in the noble 
birth I have not destroyed a living thing knowingly, by that truth may you be 
well and may the one to be born be well.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then venerable Angulimala agreed went to 
Savatthi approached that woman and told her. ‘Sister, since I was born in the 
noble birth I have not destroyed a living thing knowingly, by that truth may you 
be well and may the one to be born be well.’ Then she got well and the child was 
also well. Then Angulimala withdrawn from the crowd, secluded and diligent for 
dispelling abode and before long for whatever reason sons of clansmen rightfully 
leave the household and become homeless, that noble end of the holy life he here 
and now knowing realised and abode. He knew, birth is destroyed, the holy life 
is lived, what should be done is done. There is nothing more to wish. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then venerable Angulimala putting on robes in 
the morning and taking bowl and robes went the alms round in Savatthi. Then if a 
clod was thrown at anybody else, it hit venerable Angulimala. If a stick was 
thrown at anybody else, it hit venerable Angulimala. If a stone was thrown, it 
hit venerable Angulimala. Venerable Angulimala would come to the Blessed One 
with a split head and blood dripping, with the bowl broken and with robes torn. 
The Blessed One seeing venerable Angulimala approaching in the disstance would 
say: Brahmin, endure that, on account of the results of your actions you would 
have been reaping results for many years, for many hundreds of years, for many 
thousands of years in hell. Brahmin, bear the results of your actions here and 
now. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Venerable Angulimala experienced the 
pleasantness of release in his seclusion, and then these verses occurred to him:
