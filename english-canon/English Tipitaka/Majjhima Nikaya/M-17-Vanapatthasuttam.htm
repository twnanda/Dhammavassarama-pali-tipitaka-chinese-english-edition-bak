<P>I heard thus: 
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika 
in Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi. 
<P>From there the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, "Bhikkhus, I will teach 
the method of the foreat 
<P>listen, and attend carefully, I will teach. 
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu abides in a certain forest stretch . When abiding 
there, unestablished mindfulness does not get established, unconcentrated mind 
does not concentrate, not destroyed desires do not get destroyed and the not 
attained noble end of the yoke is not attained, as for the four requisites of 
life for the gone forth, robes, morsel food, dwellings and requities when ill 
are collected with difficulty. That bhikkhu should reflect, I abide in this 
forest stretch, to me abiding in this forest, unestablished mindfulness does not 
get established, unconcentrated mind does not get concentrated, not destroyed 
desires do not get destroyed and the not attained noble end of the yoke is not 
attained , as for the four requisites of life for the gone forth, robes, morsel 
food dwellings and requisites when ill are collected with difficulty Bhikkhus, 
he should not abide in that stretch of forest, he should leave it by night or by 
day. 
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu abides in a certain forest stretch. When abiding 
there, unestablished mindfulness does not get established, unconcentrated mind 
does not concentrate, not destroyed desires, do not get destroyed, and the not

attained, as for the four requisites of life for the gone forth, robes, morsel 
food, dwellings and requisites when ill are collected without difficulty. That 
bhikkhu should reflect, I abide in this stretch of forest, to me abiding in this 
forest unestablished mindfulness does not get established unconcentrated mind 
does not concentrate, the not destroyed desires do not get destroyed, the not

are collected without difficulty. I did not go forth as a homeless for the sake 
of robes, morsel food, dwellings and requisites when ill, yet to me living in 
this stretch of forest not established mindfulness does not get established, not 
concentrated mind does not concentrate, the not destroyed desires do not get 
destroyed and the not attained noble end of the yoke is not attained. Bhikkhus, 
that bhikkhu considering should leave that stretch of forest, should not abide 
there.. .
