<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>I heard thus.<SPAN lang=EN-GB 
style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">At one time the Blessed One lived with the 
Koliyas, in a hamlet named Haliddavasana. Punna the Koliya, who observed the 
habits of cattle and naked Seniya who observed the habits of dogs approached the 
Blessed One. Punna the Koliya who observed the habits of cattle worshipped the 
Blessed One and sat on a side. Naked Seniya who observed the habits of dogs 
exchanged friendly greetings with the Blessed One, and curling up like a dog, 
sat on a side. Then Punna the observer of cattle habits said to the Blessed 
One.’Venerable sir, this naked Seniya, observer of dog habits, observe difficult 
vows, partaking food thrown on the ground, has been observing these vows since 
long. After death where would his consciousness move? What would be his birth?’ 
‘Punna, leave it alone, do not ask me.’ For the second and up to the third time, 
Punna the observer of cattle habits said to the Blessed One. ’Venerable sir, 
this naked Seniya, observer of dog habits, observe difficult vows, partaking 
food thrown on the ground, has been observing these vows since long. After death 
where would his consciousness move? What would be his birth?’ ‘Indeed Punna, 
even when I refused to declare it, you entreat me to tell it. Now I will tell 
you. Punna, a certain one observes, the vows and virtues of a dog complete, 
without an interval. Develops the mind and the ways of a dog complete, without 
an interval. After death he is born with the dogs. If he, maintains the view, 
leading this holy life and keeping my vows, I will be born a god, or among gods. 
That is his wrong view. Punna, for wrong view, there are two behaviours of the 
mind either hell or birth in the animal world*1). So Punna, with the completion 
of those vows he will be born with the dogs or in hell.’&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>When this was said, naked Seniya, the observer 
of dog habits cried aloud tears streaming down his face. The blessed One said. 
‘I told Punna, I refused to declare it, and you entreated me.’ ‘Venerable sir I 
do not cry because the Blessed One has declared this. We have been observing 
these vows for a long time.’ Seniya the observer of dog habits said to the 
Blessed One. ‘Venerable sir, this Punna son of the Koliyas, observing cattle 
habits, has observed these vows, since long. After death, where would his 
consciousness move? What would be his birth?’<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Seniya, leave it alone, do not ask me.’ For 
the second and up to the third time, Seniya the observer of dog habits said to 
the Blessed One. ‘Venerable sir, this Punna the koliya observing cattle habits, 
has been observing these vows since long. After death where would his 
consciousness move?<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>What would be his 
birth?’ ‘Indeed Seniya, even when I refused to declare it, you entreated me. Now 
I will tell you. Seniya, a certain one observes the vows and virtues of cattle 
complete, without an interval. Develops the mind and ways of cattle complete, 
without an interval. After death he is born with cattle. If he, maintains the 
view, leading this holy life and keeping my vows, I will be born a god, or among 
gods. That would be his wrong view. Seniya, for wrong view, there are two 
behaviours of the mind either hell or birth in the animal world. Seniya, with 
the completion of those vows, he will be born with cattle or in 
hell.’<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>When this was said, Punna, the son of the 
Koliyas, observing vows of the cattle cried aloud with tears streaming down the 
face. Then the Blessed One said. ‘Seniya. I told you, I refused to declare it. 
You entreated me.’ ‘Venerable sir, I do not cry because the Blessed One declared 
it. We have been observing these vows since long. I’m pleased with the Blessed 
One. The Blessed One can preach the Teaching so that I could give up my cattle 
vows and this naked Seniya his dog vows.’ ‘Then Punna, attend carefully I will 
teach.’ Punna the son of the Koliyas agreed and the Blessed One said.: 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Punna, these four are the actions by me 
realised and declared. What are the four? Punna, there are dark actions with 
dark results. There are pure actions with pure results. There are dark and pure 
actions with dark and pure results and there are neither dark nor pure actions, 
with neither dark nor pure results. Punna, a certain one intends troublesome 
bodily behaviour, troublesome verbal behaviour and troublesome mental 
behaviour*2). Intending troublesome bodily, verbal and mental behaviour is born 
in a world of troubles, feeling troublesome feelings that are only unpleasant. 
Like beings born in hells. Punna, the done, brings birth to the doer.*3)The one 
born feels those contacts. On account of that, I say beings are the heirs of 
their actions. To these are said dark actions with dark results. Punna, what are 
pure actions with pure results? Punna, a certain one intends non-troublesome 
bodily behaviour intends non-troublesome verbal behaviour and intends 
non-troublesome mental behaviour. Intending non-troublesome bodily, verbal and 
mental behaviour is born in a world free from troubles. Born in a world free 
from troubles, feels untroubled feelings that are only pleasant. Like beings 
born in complete happiness. Punna, actions and results bring birth to the doer. 
The one born feels those contacts. On account of that I say beings are the heirs 
of their actions. Punna, these are pure actions with pure results. Punna what 
are dark and pure actions with dark and pure results? Punna, a certain one 
intends troublesome and non-troublesome bodily behaviour troublesome and 
non-troublesome verbal behaviour and troublesome and non-troublesome mental 
behaviour. Intending troublesome and non-troublesome bodily, verbal and mental 
behaviour is born in a world with and without troubles, and feels feelings 
pleasant and unpleasant, like beings born as humans. They are once godly and 
another time hellish Punna, actions and results bring birth to the doer. The 
born, feels those contacts. On account of that I say beings are the heirs of 
their actions. Punna, these are pure and dark actions with pure and dark 
results. Punna what are neither dark nor pure actions with neither dark nor pure 
results that lead to the destruction of actions? Punna, to dispel dark actions 
with dark results, an intention is made. To dispel, pure actions with pure 
results an intention is made. .To dispel dark and pure actions with dark and 
pure results, an intention is made. Punna to this is said neither dark nor pure 
actions that bring neither dark nor pure results.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>They lead to the destruction of actions. Punna, 
these are the four actions by me realised and declared.’ 
<P class=MsoBodyText3 style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0in"><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>When this was said, Punna the son of the 
Koliyas who observed the cattle vows said. ‘Now I&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-AU 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">understand it. Venerable 
sir, it is as though something over turned was reinstalled. As something covered 
was made manifest. As though the path was told to one who had lost his way. As 
though an oil lamp was lighted for the dark for those with sight to see forms. I 
take refuge in the Blessed One, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. 
May the Blessed One bear me as one taken refuge from today until life lasts.’ 
The naked Seniya observing dog vows said to the Blessed One: ‘Now I understand 
it venerable sir. It is as though something over turned was reinstalled. As 
something covered was made manifest. As though the path was told to one who had 
lost his way, As though an oil lamp was lighted for the dark for those with 
sight to see forms The Blessed One has explained the Teaching in various ways. 
Now I take refuge in the Blessed One in the Teaching and the Community of 
bhikkhus. May I gain the going forth, and the higher ordination, in the 
dispensation of the Blessed One.’ ‘Seniya, those of another sect seeking the 
going forth and the higher ordination in this Dispensation should be on 
probation for four months. After the four months, if the bhikkhus are satisfied, 
they would give the going forth and the higher ordination. It is to see the 
differnce in the person.’ ‘Venerable sir if one of another sect would have to be 
on probation for four months, I would be on probation for four years. May the 
bhikkhus, when satisfied give me the going forth and the higher ordination.’ 
Seniya, who was the observer of the dog vows gained the going forth and the 
higher ordination. Soon after the higher ordination, venerable Seniya, abode 
withdrawn from the crowd, diligent for dispelling. He attained that highest end 
of the yoke, for which sons of clansmen rightfully leave the household and 
become homeless. He here and now realized and abode in it and knew, birth is 
destroyed, the holy life is lived, what should be done is done, there is nothing 
more to wish..<O:P></O:P></SPAN>

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Notes. 
<P class=MsoBodyText2><SPAN lang=EN-AU>1. For wrong view there are two 
behaviours of consciousness either hell or birth in the animal 
world.’micchaadi.t.tikassa kho aha.m Punna dvinna.m gatiina.m a~n~natara.m 
gati.m vadaami niraya.m vaa tiracchaana yoni.m vaa‘To behave like cattle or 
dogs, people have to think much about their behaviour, and have to probe into 
the minds of animals to know how they think. These kinds of mental actions take 
one to the animal world here and now. Practising that behaviour much, leads one 
to the animal world, here and now and after death too. When humans behave like 
animals, they undergo much difficulty and they are here and now in hell. Again 
when born as animals, they undergo much difficulty as though,<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>in hell.&nbsp;</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>2. A certain one intends troublesome bodily 
behaviour, intends troublesome verbal behaviour<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>and intends troublesome mental behaviour.<I> 
‘sabyaabajjha.m kaayasankhaara.m abhisankharoti sabyaabajjha.m vaciisankhaara,m 
abhisankharoti sabyaabajjha.m manosankhaara.m abhisankharot</I>i’ Here it is 
quite clear that the Blessed One alludes this to the two observers of cattle 
vows and dog vows. With difficulty and hard straining they have to think how 
cattle and dogs think, behave, act, eat, urinate, excrete and how they do 
everything else, and bearing up all the difficulty, they go on practising these 
difficult vows, to gain only very bad results. To be born undoubtedly in a worse 
state than in which they now are. Here the Blessed One clearly shows that 
intentions are what really matters for one’s actions. These two are here and now 
in unpleasantness in hell. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">3 The done brings birth to the 
doer. ‘iti kho Punna bhuutaa bhuutassa uppattii hoti, ya.m karoti tena 
uppajjati<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘ This means whatever may be the 
intended actions of someone, it brings him future results of birth, decay, death 
etcetra. In whatever fields he had his intentions, in sensuality, in materiality 
or in immateriality, in that and the other sphere he is born, even here and now 
and also after death.
