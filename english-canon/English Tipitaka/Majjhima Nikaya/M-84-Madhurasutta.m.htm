heard thus.At one time venerable Mahaakaccaayana was living in Madhura in the 
Gunda forest. King Avantiputta of Madhura heard that venerable Mahaakaccaayana 
was living in Madhura in the Gunda forest, and fame of venerable Mahaakaccaayana 
had spread, he is wise, learned, a clever preacher, a perfected one since long, 
and it is good to see such perfect ones. Then king Avantiputta of Madhura 
getting ready good conveyances went to see venerable Mahaakaccaayana in all 
royal splendour. Going as far as the conveyances could carry them went on foot 
and approached venerable Mahaakaccaayana. Approaching and exchanging friendly 
greetings with venerable Mahaakaccaaya, sat on a side and said thus: Venerable 
sir, brahmins say, brahmins are from the chief clan, the most superior in 
appearance, all other clans are inferior, its the brahmins born from the mouth 
of Brahma, his hereditary sons, that purify, non-brahmins do not purify. What
