‘Yassa kassaci bhikkhave, bhikkhuno kaayagataa sati abhaavitaa abahuliitakaa 
labhati tassa Maaro otara.m. labhati tassa Maaro aarammana.m.’ ‘Maara’ though 
alluded to a supernormal being, here it means the defilements in the thoughts.of 
the bhikkhu.<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal>2. Mindfulness of the body in the body developped and made 
much, when directed to the realization of whatever higher knowledge, it becomes 
the eye witness in that and that sphere.’Yassa kassaci bhikkhave kaayagataa sati 
bhaavitaa bahuliikataa, so yassa yassa abhi~n~naa sacchikaraniiyassa dhammassa 
citta.m abhininnaameti abhi~n~naasacchikiriyaaya tatra tatr’eva sakkhibhavyata.m 
paapunaati sati sati aayatane. The thorough development of mindfulness of the 
body in the body, leads the bhikku for the realization of the higher knowledges. 
It is said that, that developped mindfulness, is the eye witness of those higher 
knowledges. There is no other evidence of these attainments.
