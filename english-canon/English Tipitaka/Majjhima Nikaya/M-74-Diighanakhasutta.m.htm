<P class=MsoBodyText>I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One lived on vultures’ 
peak where pigs were molested, in Rajagaha. Then the wandering ascetic 
Dighanakha approached the Blessed One, exchanged friendly greetings, stood on a 
side, and said to the Blessed One: ‘Good Gotama, I’m of this view, and declare 
Everything is not pleasing.to me’.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Aggivessana, according to this view of yours, 
everything is not pleasing to me. Is that view pleasing to you?’ ‘Good Gotama, 
that view pleases me and such others like them.’ ‘Aggivessana, there are very 
many in the world, who have this view, that too is like that and that too is 
like that. They do not give up that view, but take up another view. Aggivessana, 
only a few in this world say, that too is like that and that too is like that, 
and they give up that view and do not uphold another view’. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Aggivessana, there 
are recluses and brahmins, in this world, who uphold this view and declare it. 
Every thing is pleasing to me Aggivessana, there are recluses and brahmins in 
this world, who uphold this view and declare it. Every thing is not pleasing to 
me. Aggivessana, there are recluses and brahmins, in this world, who uphold this 
view and declare it. Some things are pleasing to me and other things are not 
pleasing to me. Aggivessana the view of those recluses and brahmins, every thing 
is pleasing to me, is close upon greed, is yoked to interest, appropriating and 
seizing. Aggivessana the view of those recluses and brahmins, every thing is not 
pleasing to me, is away from greed, not yoked to interest, appropriating and 
seizing’. When this was said, the wandering ascetic Dighanakha said thus to the 
Blessed One.’ Does good Gotama, praise my view.’ ‘Aggivessana, the view of those 
recluses and brahmins, some things are pleasing to me and other things are not 
pleasing. Pleasing things, are close upon greed, yoked to interest, 
appropriating and seizing. The things not pleasing, are away from greed, unyoked 
from interest, appropriating and seizing.. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Aggivessana, a wise 
man reflects, if I held this view, every thing is pleasing to me, this only is 
the truth all else is false, stubbornly and did not give it up easily. I have to 
worry on account of two things. About the recluses and brahmins of this view, 
every thing is not pleasing to me and the recluses and brahmins of this view, 
some things are pleasing to me and some other things are not pleasing to me. On 
account of these two views, there is a split. On account of a split, a dispute, 
and trouble. Then seeing that his view has split, and there is a dispute and 
trouble, he gives up that view and does not uphold another view. This is the 
giving up of such views. Aggivessana, a wise man reflects. If I held this view, 
every thing, is not pleasing to me, this is the truth. All else is false, 
stubbornly and not give it up easily. I have to worry on account of two things. 
About the recluses and brahmins of this view. Every thing is pleasing, to me and 
the recluses and brahmins of this view, some things are pleasing to me and some 
other things are not pleasing to me. On account of these two views, there is a 
split, a dispute and trouble. Then seeing that his view has split, and there is 
a dispute and trouble, he gives up that view and does not uphold another. This

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Aggivessana, this 
material body of the four primary elements, brought forth by mother and father 
and supported on rice and bread, is subject to change through brushing and 
breaking. It should be reflected, as impermanent, unpleasaant, an illness, an 
abscess, an arrow, a troublesome thing, as foreign and as breaking apart, as 
void, and as not mine. When he sees this body as impermanent, unpleasaant, an 
illness, an abscess, an arrow, as a troublesome thing, as foreign and as 
breaking apart, as void, and as not mine, the interest for the body, the love 
for it and following the needs of the body, fade. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Aggivessana, these 
three are the feelings, pleasant, unpleasant and neither unpleasant nor 
pleasaant. Aggivessana, when a pleasant feeling is felt, at such time an 
unpleasant feeling or a neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings is not felt. 
Only the pleasant feeling is felt. Aggivessana, when an unpleasant feeling is 
felt, at such times a pleasant feeling or a neither unpleasant nor pleasant 
feelings is not felt. Only the unpleasant feeling is felt. . Aggivessana, when a 
neither unpleasant nor pleasant feeling is felt, at such time a pleasant feeling 
or an unpleasant feelings is not felt. Only the neither unpleasant nor pleasant 
feeling is felt. Aggivessana, even the pleasant feelings are impermanent, 
compounded, dependently arisen. They get destroyed, fade, get detached and 
cease. Aggivessana, even the unpleasant feelings are impermanent, compounded and 
dependently arisen. They get destroyed, fade, get detached and cease. 
Aggivessana, even the neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings are impermanent, 
compounded and dependently arisen. They get destroyed, fade,<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>get detached and cease. When the noble disciple 
sees this, his mind breaks away from pleasant feelings, unpleasant feelings and 
even from neither unpleasant- nor<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>pleasant 
feelings. When the mind breaks away, it gets detached, when detached it is 
released. When released knowledge arises I’m released. Birth is destroyed, the 
holy life is lived. What should be done is done. He knows there is nothing more 
to wish. Aggivessana, the so released mind does not disagree with anyone has no 
dispute with any one, abides with the truth vogue in the world without a 
dispute. At that time venerable Sariputta was fanning the Blessed One, standing 
beside him, and it occurred to venerable Sariputta. This is the reason, that the 
Blessed One asked us constantly, to dispel thoughts. When venerable Sariputta 
reflected on this, his mind was released from desires, without holdings. To the 
wandering ascetic Dighanakha the stainless, pure vision arose. Whatever arises, 
all that ceases.*1) Then the wandering ascetic Dighanakha here and now, mastered 
the Teaching, experienced it and penetrated it, without doubts became confident 
of things that should be done and should not be done and did not need a teacher 
in the dispensation any more. Then he said. I understand good Gotama. It is like 
something over turned is reinstalled. Something covered is made manifest. As 
though the path is told to one who had lost his way. As though an oil lamp was 
lighted for those who have sight to see forms in the dark. In various ways, good 
Gotama explained it. Now I take refuge in good Gotama, in the Teaching and the 
Community of bhikkhus. May I be remembered as a lay disciple from today until 
life lasts.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>.<SPAN

Whatever arises, all that ceases.’ya.m kinci samudayadhamma.m sabba.m tam

realization, that happens, when he enters the stream of the 
Teaching.<O:P></O:P></SPAN>
