<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I heard thus.At one time the 
Blessed One lived in Anguttaraapa in a hamlet named Aapana in the bazaar. Then 
the Blessed One put on robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes entered 
Aapana for alms. After returning from the alms round and after the meal was 
over, the Blessed One entered a forest stretch and sat at the root of a tree to 
spend the day. The householder Potaliya too completely dressed and with a tent, 
walking and wandering for exercise, entered the forest stretch and approached 
the Blessed One, exchanged friendly greetings and stood on a side. Then the 
Blessed One addressed the householder.:’Householder, there are seats, if you 
wish sit.’ When this was said, the householder Potaliya, thought the recluse 
Gotama, addresses me as a householder, was angry and averse and would not talk. 
For the second time the Blessed One said ‘Householder, there are seats if you 
wish sit.’ When this was said, the householder Potaliya, thought the recluse 
Gotama, addresses me as a householder, was angry and averse and would not talk 
For the third time the Blessed One said. ‘Householder, there are seats, if you 
wish sit.’ When this was said, the householder Potaliya, thought the recluse 
Gotama, addresses me as a householder, was angry and averse and said. ‘It is not 
suitable that the recluse Gotama should address me as a householder.’ ‘By your 
signs and attributes, you are a householder.’ ‘Good Gotama, I have come to the 
end of all my actions and business. Whatever I had as wealth, grains, gold and 
silver is given to my sons and I do not advise or blame them. I care only for my 
food and clothing. Thus I have come to the end of all my actions and business.’ 
‘Householder, your ending of all actions and business is different from the 
ending of all actions and business in the noble ones Dispensation.’ ‘Venerable 
sir, it is good if the Blessed One teaches me the ending of all actions and 
business in the noble ones Dispensation.’ ‘Then householder, listen carefully, I 
will preach. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Householder, there are eight ways to end all 
actions and business in the noble ones dispensation. What are the eight?. 
Householder, for the purpose of not destroying life, destruction done to life, 
should be given up. For the purpose of taking what is given, taking the not 
given should be given up. For the purpose of talking the truth, telling lies 
should be given up. For the purpose of not slandering, slandering should be 
given up. For the purpose of not coveting and non-greed, coveting and greed 
should be given up. For the purpose of maintaining blameless non-aversion, 
blameful aversion should be given up. For the purpose of maintaining non-anger 
and non-malice, anger and malice should be given up. For the sake of 
non-conceit, conceit should be given up. These stated in short conduce to the 
ending of all actions and business in the dispensation of the noble ones.’ 
‘Venerable sir, may the Blessed One explain, out of compassion, these eight 
things that conduce to the ending of actions and business in the noble one’s 
Dispensation.’<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Householder, listen and

destroy living things, myself will blame me, when the wise ones know about it,

actions and business of the dispensation of the noble ones. Venerable sir, 
earlier, we thought, the ascetics of other sects were thoroughbreds and fed them 
thinking they were thoroughbreds, and placed faith in them. The bhikkhus, we 
thought were not thoroughbreds, fed them thinking they were not thoroughbreds 
and did not place faith in them, thinking they were not thoroughbreds. Now we 
know the ascetics of other sects are not the thoroughbreds, and feed them 
knowing they are not the thoroughbreds and do not place faith in them. Now we 
know that the bhikkhus are the thoroughbreds, feed them knowing that they are 
the thoroughbreds and place faith in them, knowing they are thoroughbreds. 
Venerable sir, you have produced in me love and reverence for the recluses. Now 
I understand venerable sir. It is as though something overturned is reinstalled. 
Something covered is made manifest. As though the path was shown to someone who 
had lost his way. It is like an oil lamp was lighted for the darkness, so that, 
those who have sight could see forms. In various ways the Blessed One has 
explained the Teaching. Now I take refuge in the Blessed One, in the Teaching 
and the Community of bhikkhus. May I be remembered as a lay disciple who has 
taken refuge from today till life lasts.’
