<P>I heard thus. 
<P>At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by 
Anaathapindika in Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi. Then venerable Mahaako.t.thita 
getting up from his seclusions in the evening, approached venerable Saariputta, 
exchanging friendly greetings, sat on a side and said: 
<P>Friend, it is said, lacking in wisdom. What is lacking in wisdom? Friend, 
does not know, therefore it is said lacking in wisdom. Does not know what?: Does 
not know, this is unpleasant, this is the arising of unpleasantness, this is the 
cessation of unpleasantness and this is the path to the cessation of 
unpleasantness. Does not know these, therefore it is said lacking in wisdom. 
Venerable Mahaako.t.thita agreeing and delighting, with the words of venerable 
Saariputta asked another question. It is said wise, for what is it said wise? 
Knows, therefore it is said wise. Knows what? Knows this is unpleasant, this is 
the arising of unpleasantness, this is the cessation of unpleasantness and this 
is the path to the cessation of unpleasantness. Knows these, therefore it is 
said wise.It is said consciousness. Friend, what is consciousness?: Knows, 
therefore conscious. Knows what? Knows this is pleasant, this is unpleasant and 
knows this is neither unpleasant nor pleasant.Knows therefore it is said 
conscious. Friend, this knowledge and this consciousness, are they associated or 
dissociated? Is there a method to differentiate them and show them apart? What 
is known is consciousness and consciousness is knowledge. Therefore these things 
are associated and not dissociated and it is not possible to differentiate them 
and show them apart. Friend, of these things that are associated and not 
dissociated, what is their difference? Friend, of these things associated and 
not dissociated knowledge should be developed and consciousness should be 
accurately known. That is their difference. 
<P>Friend, it is said feeling? What is feeling? When felt it is said feeling. 
What is felt?: Pleasant feeling, unpleasantness feeling and neither 
unpleasantness nor pleasant feeling. These feelings are felt. Friend, it is said 
perception, what is perception? Perceives therefore it is said perception. What 
is perceived? Blue is perceived, yellow is perceived, red is perceived and white 
is perceived. Therefore it is said perception..Friend, this feeling, perception, 
and this consciousness, are these associated or dissociated? Is it possible to 
differenciate them and show them apart?: Friend, feelings, perceptions and 
consciousness are associated and not dissociated and it is not possible to 
differentiate them and show them apart: Friend, the felt is perceived, and the 
perceived is consciously known Therefore these things are associated and not 
dissociated and it is not possible to differenciate them and show them apart. 
<P>Friend, when the five sense faculties do not lead, to what is the purified 
faculty of the mind led? Friend, when the five sense faculties do not lead, the 
purified faculty of the mind leads to space with space is boundless, leads to 
conscioussness with consciousness is boundless, leads to the sphere of no-thing 
with there is nothing. Friend, how is this leading to be known? Friend, this 
leading should be known with the eye of wisdom. Friend, for what purpose is 
wisdom? Wisdom is for depth realisation, thorough knowing and for giving up. 
<P>Friend, how many ways are there for the arising of right view? Friend, there 
are two ways for the arising of right view. Either hearing it from an outside 
source or internally reflecting the root causes. In these two ways right view 
arises. Friend, in how many ways does there come about, the release of mind with 
right view and the results of the release of mind, the release through wisdom 
with right view and the results of the release through wisdom: Friend, the 
release of mind with right view and its results and the release through wisdom 
with right view and its results, come about in five ways. Friend, that right 
view comes with virtues, learning, discussion, appeasement and wisdom. In these 
five ways there comes about, the release of mind through right view and its 
results, and the release of mind.:through wisdom and its results. Friend, how 
many kinds of ‘being’ are there? Friend, its threefold: Being with sensuality, 
with matter and with non-matter.*!)Friend, how does future rebirth come about?. 
Friend, beings shrouded in ignorance and bound to craving delight here and 
there, thus comes about rebirth in the future*2). Friend, how does future 
rebirth not come about? When ignorance is dispelled science arises and craving 
ceases, thus future rebirth does not come about*3) 
<P>Friend, what is the first jhaana? Here, friend, the bhikkhu secluded from 
sensual desires and thoughts of demerit, with thoughts and thought processes and 
with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion attained to abides in the first 
jhaana. Friend, how many factors has the first jhaana? The first jhaana has five 
factors.: Here friend, the bhikkhu attained to the first jhaana maintains 
thoughts, thought processes, joy, pleasantness and one pointedness of mind. The 
first jhaana has these five factors.. Friend, in the first jhaana how many 
factors are dispelled, and how many factors are maintained? One attained to the 
first jhaana dispels five factors and maintains five factors. Here, friend, the 
bhikkhu attained to the first jhaana has dispelled the interest for sensuality, 
anger, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry and doubts. He maintains, 
thoughts, thought processes, joy, pleasantness, and one pointedness of mind. 
Friend, the first jhana is devoid of these five and endowed with these five. 
<P>Friend, these five mental faculties with varing provinces and pastures not 
partaking each others province and pasture such as the faculties of the eye, 
ear, nose, tongue and body, where are they restored and who partakes the pasture 
commonly?. 
<P>Friend, these five mental faculties with varing provinces and pastures not 
partaking each others province and pasture such as the faculties of the eye, 
ear, nose, tongue and body. They are restored in the mind and it partakes the 
pasture commonly. 
<P>Friend, these five mental faculties of the eye, ear, nose, tongue and body, 
on what do they rely? Friend, these five mental faculties of eye, ear, nose, 
tongue, and body rely on life span. Friend, this life span, on what does it 
rely? Friend, life span relies on breath. Friend, on what does breath rely? 
Breath relies on life.span. Now we understand the words of venerable Saariputta 
thus. Life span relies on breath and breath relies on life span. How could we 
understand these words of venerable Saariputta?.Then I will give you an example, 
for some wise understand when an example is given. Just as the burning wick of 
an oil lamp shows a light on account of the flame and a flame on account of the 
light. In the same manner life span relies on breath and breath on life span. 
<P>Friend, is life span the same as the field of feelings or else is life span 
different from the field of feelings?*4) Friend, life span is not the field of 
feelings . If it happened that life span was the field of feelings a bhikkhu’s 
rising from the attainment, the cessation of perceptions and feelings could not 
be explained. Since the life span is different from the field of feelings the 
rising from the attainment, cessation of perceptions and feelings could be 
explained..Friend, when this body is forsaken, useless and lies lifeless like a 
log, how many things are thrown out of it? Friend, when three things, life, heat 
and consciousness, are thrown out, this body becomes useless and lifeless like a 
log of wood. Friend, what is the difference between a dead body and a bhikkhu 
attained to the cessation of perceptions and feelings? Friend, in a dead body 
the bodily determination has ceased and is appeased The verbal determination has 
ceased and is appeased The mental determination has ceased and is appeased*5). 
Life span has exhausted. The heat has extinguished, and the mental faculties 
have broken. up. Of the bhikkhu attained to the cessation of perceptions and 
feelings, the bodily determintion has ceased and is appeased The verbal 
determination has ceased and is appeased The mental determination has ceased is 
appeased. The life span is not exhausted. The heat is not extinguished. The 
mental faculties are very clear. Friend, this is the difference between a dead 
body and of one attained to the cessation of perceptions and feelings. Friend, 
how many factors are there in the release in neither unpleasant nor pleasant 
feelings? The release in neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings is based on 
four factors. Here, the bhikkhu dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness and 
earlier having overcome pleasure and displeasure, and mindfulness purified with 
equanimity attained to abides in the fourth jhaana. Based on these four is the 
release from neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings. Friend, based on how many 
factors is the release of mind in signlessness?. The release of mind in 
signlessness is based on two factors. Not attending to any signs and attending 
to the no-sign element. Based on these two factors the release of mind in 
signlessness is attained. On account of what is the duration of the release of 
mind in signlessness? The duration of the release of mind in signlessness is 
based on three factors. Not attending to any signs, attending to the no-sign 
element, and making a determination earlier. Friend, based on these three is the 
duration of the release of mind in the no-sign element.. Friend, how is the 
rising from the release of mind in the no-sign element? Based on two factors is 
the rising from the release of mind in the no-sign element: Attending to all 
signs and not attending to the no-sign element. Based on these two is the rising 
from the attainment, release of mind in the no-sign element. 
<P>Friend, the limitless release of mind, the release of mind in no-thingness, 
the release of mind in voidity, and the release of mind in the no-sign element, 
are they different in meaning and different in words or are they the same in 
meaning and different in words? There is a method in which they are different in 
meaning and different in words and there is a method in which they are the same 
in meaning and different in words.Friend, how are they different in meaning and 
different in words. Here the bhikkhu abides with the thought of loving kindness 
pervading one direction, so too the second, third, and fourth directions, above, 
below and across, in all circumstances, for all purposes, towards all, this 
thought grown great and extensive without anger. The thought of compassiosn—The 
thought of intrinsic joy,---The thought of equanimity pervading one direction, 
so too the second, the third, the fourth, above, below, and across, in all 
circumstances, for all purposes, towards all, this thought grown great and 
extensive without anger he abides.This is the limitless release of mind. Friend, 
what is the release of mind in no-thingness: Here the bhikkhu overcoming all the 
sphere of consciousness attained to abides in the sphere of no-thingness. To 
this is said, the release of mind in the sphere of no-thingness. Friend what is 
release of mind in voidity? Here the bhikkhu gone to the forest, to the root of 
a tree or to an empty house reflects This is void of a self or the belongings of 
a self. Friend to this is said the release of mind in voidity. Friend, what is 
the release of mind in the no-sign element: Here the bhikkhu not attending to 
any sign, attends to the no-sign element and abides in it. To this is said the 
release of mind in the no-sign element. According to this method, these things 
are different in meaning and different in words. 
<P>Friend, how are these things the same in meaning and different in words. 
Here, friend, greed is a limiting factor, hate is a limiting factor, delusion is 
a limiting factor, 
<P>To the bhikkhu with desires destroyed these things are dispelled, pulled out 
with the roots, have the tops cut off, made things that would not grow again. Of 
the boundless releases of the mind the immovable release of mind is the highest, 
it is said*6). Friend that immovable release of mind is void of greed, void of 
hate and void of delusion. Friend, greed is something, hate is something, 
delusion is something. To the bhikkhu with desires destroyed these things are 
dispelled, pulled out with the roots, have the tops cut off, made things that 
would not grow again. Of the release of mind in no-thingness, the immovable 
release of mind is the highest it is said. Friend, the immovable release of mind 
is void of greed, void of hate and void of delusion. Friend, greed is a sign, 
hate is a sign, and delusion is a sign. To the bhikkhu with desires destroyed , 
these things are dispelled, pulled out with the roots, have the tops cut off, 
made things that would not grow again. Of the release in signlessness, the 
immovable release is the highest it is said. Friend, the immovable release of 
mind is void of greed, void of anger, void of delusion. According to this 
method, these things are the same in meaning and different in words. 
<P>Venerable Saariputta said thus and venerable Mahaako.t.thita delighted in the 
words of venerable Saariputta. . . 
<P><FONT size=-1>Note.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=-1>1. Being with sensuality, with matter and with 
non-matter.’kaamabhava ruupabhava aruupabhava’ Being ‘bhava’ Bava the Pali word 
translated as being is the ramblings of the mind in sensual desires, in material 
things and in immaterial states such as the jhaanas, and attainments described 
in this Sutta.</FONT>

delight here and there, thus comes about rebirth in the 
future.’<I>avijjaaniivaranaana.m kho aavuso sattaana.m tanhasanyojanaana.m eva.m 
aayati.m punabbhavaanibbanti hont</I>i’ Rebirth in the future is a result of the 
mind’s ramblings in sensuality, matter and non-matter covered by ignorance and 
bound to craving.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=-1>3.When ignorance is dispelled, science arises and craving 
ceases, thus future rebirth does not come about.’<I>avijjaaviraagaa kho aavuso 
vijjuppaadaa ta.nhaanirodhaa eva.m aayati.m punabbhavaanibbanti na honti</I>.’ 
The dispelling of the rambling mind’s interest in sensuality, matter and 
non-matter is the dispelling of ignorance and the arsing of science and that is 
the cessation of craving..</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=-1>4. Is life span the same as the field of feelings? ‘ <I>teva 
nukho aavuso aayusankhaaaraa teva vedaniiyaa dhammaa udaahu a~n~ne 
aayusankhaaraa a~n~ne vedaniiyaa dhammaa</I>?.’ The field of feelings is the 
sixfold sphere of mental contact, based on which feelings constantly arise with 
every contact at one or the other of the doors of mental contact.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=-1>5. In a dead body the bodily determination has ceased and is 
appeased. The verbal determination has ceased and is appeased. The mental

verbal and mental determinations are in and out breaths, thinking and pondering, 
and feeling and perceiving. en one is dead, these things have ceased and are 
appeased, that is they do not worry him any more.</FONT> 
<P>.<FONT size=-1>6 Of the boundless releases of the mind the immovable release 
of mind is the highest, it is said.</FONT> ‘<I><FONT size=-1>yaavataa kho aavuso

aggamakkhaayaati’</FONT>The</I> 
<P><I>releases of mind</I> <FONT size=-1>experienced by those free of greed,
