<P class=MsoBodyText>I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One lived in 
Anguttaraapa in a hamlet named Aapana in the bazaar. Then the Blessed One put on 
robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes entered Aapana for alms. After 
returning from the alms round and after the meal was over, the Blessed One 
entered a forest stretch and sat at the root of a tree to spend the day. 
Venerable Udayi too putting on robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes 
entered Aapana for alms. After returning from the alms round and after the meal 
was over, entered that same forest stretch and sat under a certain tree to spend 
the day. To venerable Udayi in his seclusion this discursive thought arose: 
Indeed a lot of our unpleasant things of demerit are removed by the Blessed One 
and a lot of pleasant things of merit reinstated instead. Then, in the evening 
venerable Udayi got up from his seclusion, approached the Blessed One, 
worshipped, sat on a side and said<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable sir, in my seclusion this discursive 
thought arose:to me<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Indeed a lot of our 
unpleasant things of demerit are removed by the Blessed One and a lot of 
pleasant things of merit reinstated instead. Venerable sir, in the past we 
partook food in the evening, early in the morning, during the day, and at 
untimely hours. There was a time when the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus 
thus. Come! Bhikkhus, give up partaking food in the day time, venerable sir, it 
was disagreeable to me, I was displeased. Some householders offer us nourishing 
eatables and drinks out of faith during the day and at untimely hours. The 
Blessed One says, give them up. Venerable sir, I gave up partaking food during 
the day and at untimely hours out of love, reverence, shame and remorse for the 
Blessed One. Venerable sir, in the past we partook food in the evening, early in 
the morning, during the day and at untimely hours. There was a time when the 
Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: Come! Bhikkhus, give up partaking food 
in the night and at untimely hours. Venerable sir, it was disagreeable to me. I 
was displeased. Of the two meals offered the more excellent one the Blessed One 
says give up. Venerable sir, a certain man gaining soups in the day, put them 
away thinking we will partake them together in the evening. Venerable sir, all 
left overs are in the night. There are little left overs during the day. 
Venerable sir, I gave up partaking food at night and at untimely hours out of 
love, reverence, shame and remorse for the Blessed One. Venerable sir, in the 
past, bhikkhus going for alms in the darkness of the night, fell into pools. At 
the entrance of the village, fell into dirty water pools. Climbed on thorny 
fences, tred on sleeping cows, met young men gone or not gone for evil, and 
encountered women calling for evil. Venerable sir, when I was going for alms in 
the darkness of the night, a certain woman was washing pots in the darkness. 
With a streak of lightening she saw me and frightened, shouted ‘am caught by a 
demon’ Then I said to her, Sister, it is not a demon, it is a bhikkhu standing 
for alms. Then she said, Bhikkhu, it is better that you die, isn’t it noble to 
die, cutting the belly with the sharp carving knife of a butcher, than to go for 
alms for the sake of the belly in the darkness of the night’. Venerable sir, 
when I recall these, it occurs to me:. Indeed a lot of our unpleasant things of 
demerit are removed by the Blessed One and a lot of pleasant things of merit 
reinstated instead’. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Udayi, a certain 
foolish man when I say dispel this, would say, what does it matter to the 
diligent bhikkhu of this world. The rising to the beyond is for a recluse*1) So 
they do not give it up, they arouse aversion for me. For the bhikkhus, desirous 
of the training, it is a strong bond, a firm bond, a not decaying bond, a bond 
similar to a big log. Udayi, the quail bound with the decaying creeper, is 
tortured, bound, and meets death there itself. Like the quail bound with the 
decaying creeper is tortured, bound and meets death there itself, to them that 
weak bond, decaying bond, useless bond, would that be a good bond to say it 
rightly? No, venerable sir. Like the quail bound with the decaying creeper is 
tortured, bound and meets death. It becomes a strong bond, a firm bond, a not 
decaying bond, like a big log. Udayi, in this manner a certain foolish man when 
I say dispel this, would say, what does it matter to the diligent bhikkhu of 
this world. The rising to the beyond is for a recluse; so they do not give it 
up. They arouse aversion for me. For the bhikkhus, who are desirous of the 
training, it is a strong bond, a firm bond, a not decaying bond, a bond similar 
to a big log.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Udayi, to a certain 
son of a clansman: I say, dispel this, he would say, I will dispel.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>It is simple for a diligent bhikkhu of this 
world. If the Blessed One says give up, we give it up and they give it up and do 
not arouse aversion for me. They are desirous of the training. They give it up, 
live at ease subdued, fond of being prepared and living calmly. Udayi, to them 
that bond is weak, not firm, a decaying bond, an useless bond. Like the leather 
straps of the king’s huge elephant with long tusks, gone to the battle Which he 
would easily break, bending his body and would go where he wished.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Udayi, if someone was to say, the strong firm 
leather straps, of the king’s elephant were strong, firm, bonds. Could be 
compared to a log of wood. Is he saying it rightly? No, venerable sir. The 
strong, firm, leather straps, by which the king’s elephant was bound, which he 
broke bending his body and went where he wished to go. They to him were weak, 
infirm, decaying, useless bonds. In the same manner, a certain son of a 
clansman, when I say, dispel this. Would say, what is it for the diligent 
bhikkhu of this world. If the Blessed One says give up. We give it up, and they 
give it up and do not arouse aversion for me. They are desirous of the training. 
They give it up, live at ease subdued, fond of being prepared and living calmly. 
Udayi, to them that bond is weak, not firm, a decaying bond, a useless bond. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Udayi, a poor 
destitute miserable man, had a single, valueless, rotting and falling house, in 
it a bedstead, a single pot to store grains, a fire -place to cook. He would go 
to the monastery and see the bhikkhus, with clean hands and feet partaking of 
delightful food and sitting in a shady place yoked to the development of the 
mind. Then it would occur to him I shall shave head and beard, put on yellow 
clothes, and become a homeless. It is not possible for him to give up that 
single, valueless, rotting and falling house, bedstead, pot to store grains and 
the fire -place. So it is not possible for him to shave head and beard, put on 
yellow clothes, and go forth. Udayi, if someone was to say. It is not possible 
for this man to give up that single, valueless, rotting and falling house, 
bedstead, the single pot to store grains, and that single fire place, to cook. 
So it is not possible for him, to shave head and beard, put on yellow clothes, 
and go forth. If someone says, this bond to him is weak, feeble, a decaying 
useless bond. Would he be saying it rightly? No, venerable sir. The bonds by 
which that man is bound, to the house, that bedstead, that pot to store grains, 
and that fire place, on account of which he finds it impossible to shave head 
and beard, put on yellow clothes, and go forth as a homeless. That bond to him 
is strong, not feeble, firm, not a decaying bond, it is a huge log. Udayi, in 
the same manner, I tell a certain foolish man to dispel. He would say. What does 
it matter to the diligent bhikkhu of this world? The rising to the beyond is for 
a recluse. So does not give it up. He arouses aversion for me. As for the 
bhikkhus, who are desirous of the training, it is a strong bond, a firm bond, a 
not decaying bond, a bond similar to a big log. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Udayi, like a 
householder or a householder’s son, with wealth, fields, treasures, wives, 
slaves male and female of innumerable amounts, gone to the monastery would see 
the bhikkhus, partake pleasant food, and sitting under shady trees yoked to the 
development of the mind. Then it would occur to him: Indeed recluseship is 
pleasant, recluseship is with ease. What if I shaved head and beard and put on 
yellow clothes and went forth? It is possible for him to give up the collection 
of innumerable wealth, innumerable fields, innumerable treasures, innumerable 
number of wives, slaves male and female. He would shave head and beard put on 
yellow clothes and go forth. Udayi, if someone was to say. It was possible for 
him to give up all his wealth, fields, treasures, an innumerable number of 
wives, slaves male and female, shave head and beard put on yellow clothes and go 
forth. As his bond was weak, not firm, a decaying bond, an useless bond. Would 
he be saying it rightly? He would be venerable sir. In the same manner, a 
certain son of a clansman: when I say dispel this. Would say, what is it, to the 
diligent bhikkhu of this world? If the Blessed One says give up, we give it up. 
They give it up and do not arouse aversion for me. They are desirous of the 
training. They give it up, live at ease subdued, fond of being prepared and 
living calmly. Udayi, to them that bond is weak, not firm, a decaying bond, an 
useless bond. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Udayi, there are 
four persons evident in the world. What are the four? Udayi, a certain person 
falls to the method of dispelling and giving up endearments. Thoughts about 
endearments assail him, he endures them, does not dispel them and make them not 
to rise again. Udayi, I say this person is yoked. What is the reason? I know 
this person through my developped mental faculties. A certain person, comes to 
the method of dispelling and giving up endearments. Thoughts about endearments 
assail him. He does not endure them, dispels them and makes them not to rise 
again. Udayi, I say this person too is yoked. What is the reason? I know this 
person through my developped mental faculties. Udaayi, a certain person falls to 
the method of dispelling and giving up endearments. On account of lapses in 
mindfulness, thoughts about endearments arise, mindfulness arises to him slowly, 
and he instantly dispels them, and makes them not to rise again. Like a man 
dropping a few drops of water to an iron pot heated through out the day. The 
falling of the water may be slow, but the water vanishes instantly. Udayi, in 
the same manner a certain person falls to the method of dispelling and giving up 
endearments. On account of lapses in mindfulness, thoughts about endearments 
arise, mindfulness arises to him slowly, and he instantly dispels them, and 
makes them not to rise again.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>I say this 
person too is yoked. What is the reason? I know this person through my 
developped mental faculties. Uddayi a certain person, knowing that endearments 
are the origin of unpeasantness, frees himself from endearments and the 
reckonings of endearments and is released*2) Udayi, I say this person is 
unyoked. What is the reason? I know this person through my developped mental 
faculties. .<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Udayi, these are the five strands of sensual 
pleasures: What five? Pleasant agreeable forms cognizable by eye consciousness, 
arousing fondness and delight. Sound cognizable by ear consciousness. Smells 
cognizable by nose consciousness..Tastes cognizable by tongue consciousness and 
touches cognizable by body consciousness, arousing fondness and delight. Udayi, 
these are the five strands of sensual pleasures. Whatever pleasure and 
pleasantness arises on account of these five strands of sensual pleasures, are 
said to be low pleasures, of the ordinary man, not the pleasures of the nobles 
ones. These should not be practised, developed and made much. I say this 
pleasantness should be feared. Udayi, the bhikkhu, secluded from sensual desires 
and thoughts of demerit, with thoughts and thought processes, and with joy and 
pleasantness born from seclusion, abides in the first jhana. Overcoming thoughts 
and thought processes, and the mind appeased and in one point, without thoughts 
and thought processes and with joy and pleasant born from concentration abides 
in the second jhana—third jhana,-- abides in the fourth jhana. This is the 
pleasantness of giving up, the pleasantness of seclusion, pleasantness of 
appeasement, the pleasantness of enlightenment, which should be practised, 
developed, made much and I say this pleasantness should not be feared. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Here, Udayi, the 
bhikkhu secluded from sensual desires--- abides in the first jhana<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Udayi, I say it is vacillation. So long as the 
thoughts and thought processes have not ceased, it is vacillation. Udayi, the 
bhikkhu overcoming thoughts and thought processes, abides in the second jhana. 
Udayi, I say this too is vacillation. What vacillates in this? So long as joy 
and pleasantness have not ceased, it is vacillation. Udayi, the bhikkhu with 
equanimity to joy and detachment—abides in the third jhana Udayi, I say this too 
is vacillation. What vacillates in this? As long as pleasantness to equanimity 
has not ceased, it is vacillation. Udayi the bhikkhu dispelling pleasantness and 
unpleasantness—abides in the fourth jhana. Udayi, I say, this does not vacillate 

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Udayi, the bhikkhu, 
secluded from sensual desires—abides in the first jhana. Udayi, I say it is 
insufficient. Dispel it and go beyond it. What’s beyond it? Here, Udayi the 
bhikkhu, overcoming thoughts and thought processes, abides in the<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>second jhana Udayi, I say it is insufficient. 
Dispel it and go beyond it. What’s beyond it? Udayi the bhikkhu with equanimity 
to joy and detachment—abides in the third jhana. This is beyond that. Udayi, I 
say this too is insufficient. Dispel it and go beyond it? What’s beyond it. 
Udayi the bhikkhu dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness—abides in the 
fourth jhana. This is beyond that. Udayi, I say this too is insufficient. Dispel 
it and go beyond it..What’s beyond it?.Udayi the bhikkhu overcoming all 
perceptions of matter and perceptions of aversion, not attending to various 
perceptions, with space is boundless abides in the sphere of space This is<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>beyond that. Udayi, I say this too is 
insufficient. Dispel it and go beyond it. What’s beyond it? Udayi, the bhikkhu 
overcoming all perceptions of space, with consciousness is boundless abides in 
the sphere of consciousness This is<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>beyond 
that. Udayi, I say this too is insufficient. Dispel it and go beyond it. What’s 
beyond it? Udayi, the bhikkhu overcoming all the sphere of consciousness with 
there is nothing abides in the sphere of no-thingness This, is beyond that. 
Udayi, I say this too is insufficient, dispel it and go beyond it. What’s 
beyond? The bhikkhu overcoming all the sphere of no-thingness abides in the 
sphere of neither -perception-nor -non-perception This is beyond that. Udayi, I 
say this too is insufficient. Dispel it and go beyond it. What’s beyond it? The 
bhikkhu overcoming all the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception 
attains to the cessation of perceptions and feelings. Thus Udayi I declare the 
dispelling of the sphere of neither-perceptions-nor-non-perceptions. Udayi, do 
you see the bond small or large, on account of which I tell you dispel it?. No, 
venerable sir. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The Blessed One said
