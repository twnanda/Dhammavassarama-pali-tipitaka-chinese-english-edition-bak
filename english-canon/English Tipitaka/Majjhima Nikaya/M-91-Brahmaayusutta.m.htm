<BR>&nbsp; 
<P class=MsoNormal>I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One was touring Videha, 
with about five hundred bhikkhus. At that time the Brahmin Brahmaayu, an aged 
decayed man of hundred and twenty years was living in Mithila. He had learned 
the three Vedas, knew, the rites and rituals as officiating priest, the 
phonology and etymology of words and the marks of a Great Man. The Brahmin 
Brahmaayu heard that the recluse Gotama who had gone forth from the Sakya clan 
was touring Videha with about five hundred bhikkhus. Such fame had spread about 
that good Gotama. That Blessed One is perfect, rightfully enlightened, endowed 
with knowledge and conduct, well gone, knows the worlds, is the incomparable 
tamer of those to be tamed, Teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed. He 
declares to this world of gods and men, together with its Maaras, Brahmaas, 
recluses and Brahmins, a Teaching by himself known and realized. It is good at 
the beginning, in the middle and the end and it states the complete and pure 
holy life. It is good to see such perfect ones. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>At that time the 
Brahmin Brahmaayu had a pupil, a young man named Uttara who had learned the 
three Vedas, knew the rites and rituals as officiating priest, the phonology and 
etymology of words and the marks of a Great Man. The Brahmin Brahmaayu addressed 
his pupil and said.’Dear Uttara, approach the recluse Gotama, son of the Sakyas, 
who is said to be perfect, … re…. enlightened and blessed, and find out whether 
these qualities are really so, or not. You should examine good Gotama for me.’ 
‘Sir, how should I know whether good Gotama is endowed with these qualities or 
not.’ ‘Uttara, the two and thirty marks of a Great Man have come down to us in 
the sayings. One endowed with these marks has two courses of action and not 
another. If he leads the household life, becomes the Universal Monarch, a 
stable, righteous king with power in the four directions, endowed with the seven 
jewels. They are the jewels of the, wheel, elephant, horse, gem, woman, 
householder, and the advisor. He has more than a thousand sons, with heroic 
figures, clever and able to subdue foreign armies. He rules over the country 
bounded by the ocean righteously, without stick or weapon. If he leaves the 
household and becomes homeless, he will be perfect and all knowing and would 
remove the veil of darkness. I have given you this knowledge and you know that.’ 

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The young man Uttara 
agreeing, got up from his seat worshipped and circumambulated the Brahmin 
Brahmaayu and left to go to Videha to meet the Blessed One. In stages he 
approached, the Blessed One, exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side. The 
young man Uttara examined the two and thirty marks of a Great Man on the body of 
the Blessed One. Seeing most of the marks excepting two, not satisfied, has 
doubts, whether the pudendum is encased, and the tongue is large enough. It 
occurred to the Blessed One, this young man Uttara sees most of the marks of a 
Great Man on my body except two. He is not satisfied, is doubting whether the 
pudendum is enclosed and the tongue is large enough. Then the Blessed One 
exercised a psychic power, so that Uttara could see the encased pudendum. The 
Blessed One drew forth his tongue, touched the ear lobes, the nostrils and 
covered the complete forehead with the nose. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then it occurred to 
the young man Uttara, the recluse Gotama is endowed with the two and thirty 
marks of a Great Man. If I follow the recluse Gotama, would see his postures. He 
followed after the Blessed One for seven months, like a shadow that follows 
someone, without leaving him. At the end of the seven months, he embarked on a 
tour to return to Mithila, to approach the Brahmin Brahmaayu. Approaching the 
Brahmin Brahmaayu, Uttara worshipped him and sat on side. The Brahmin Brahmaayu 
said. ‘Dear Uttara, is the recluse Gotama, endowed with those qualities as that 
fame says?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Good One, the recluse 
Gotama is endowed with the two and thirty marks of a Great Man there is no 
question about it. His feet are well established when placed. The soles of the 
feet have wheels with thousandfold discs and naves, complete in every way. It is 
the mark of a Great Man. He has long eye -lashes, long fingers, hands and feet, 
soft to the touch. There are lines on the palms and feet like a woven net. He 
has high ankles and the legs of an antelope. When standing he does not bend and 
with the fingers could touch the knees. His pudendum is cased. His skin is of 
golden hue. Dust does not settle on his fine skin. On his body a single hair 
comes up from each pore and those dark blue hairs stand aloft turning to the 
right. He has a straight body, with the fore part like a lion’s. He has heaped 
up shoulders and his body has a breadth to suit the height. He has a halo, 
around his body. Of tastes, good Gotama knows the highest. He has the jaws of a 
lion with forty comely white teeth. He has a large tongue and a melodious voice 
like the voice of a cuckoo. He has dark blue eyes and a comely mouth. Between 
the eyebrows, is a tuft of hair turned to the right. Good Gotama has a raised 
top like wearing a turban. These are the two and thirty marks of a Great Man. 
Good Gotama always starts to walk with the right foot, placing the foot not too 
far nor too close. Does not walk too fast nor too slowly, the knees do not brush 
each other when walking, nor do the ankles and thighs. When walking his thighs 
do not writhe, bend or raise, only the lower body moves without a bodily effort. 

<P class=MsoNormal>When looking he turns the whole body. He does not look up or 
down and does not walk with inquisitive eyes. When confronting looks a short 
distance ahead yet is aware of his surrounding. Entering a house does not raise, 
bend or writhe the body. He does not turn about for a seat from a distance, or 
come too close, nor does he hang to the seat before sitting or throw himself on 
the seat. Seated inside a house he does not fidget with his hands or feet nor 
does he raise one foot over the other or place one calf over the other. He does 
not support his jaws with the hands. Inside a house he does not shake or shiver 
or sit uneasily, sits calm and at ease. Good Gotama accepting water in the bowl 
does not bend, raise or shake it, accepts the right amount of water. Washing the 
bowl does not make a sound, does not turn the bowl about, or put it on the 
ground to wash. With the water in the bowl he washes his fingers and with the 
fingers washes the bowl and throws the water not too far or too close without 
sprinkling it everywhere. Accepting rice in the bowl accepts the right amount, 
without turning or twisting the bowl. Accepts soups and curries enough to suit 
the amount of rice, but not to make a salve of it. Good Gotama chews the food in 
the mouth two or three times and does not swallow unbroken particles, does not 
keep any particles in the mouth, when the next mouthful is taken. Good Gotama 
partakes food conscious of the taste, yet not greedy for tastes. Considering 
eight things good Gotama partakes food not for, play, intoxication or adornment. 
He partakes food to support the body, without greed for tastes, thinking I 
should make an end of earlier unpleasant feelings, and not arouse new, just the 
right amount for a pleasant abiding, without faults. After partaking food, 
accepting water in the bowl does not bend, raise or shake it, accepts the right 
amount of water. Washing the bowl does not make a sound, does not turn the bowl 
about, or put it on the ground to wash. With the water in the bowl he washes his 
fingers and with the fingers washes the bowl and throws the water not too far or 
too close without sprinkling it everywhere. After partaking food, he places the 
bowl on the ground, not too far nor too close, thinking may the bowl be of no 
disturbances, does not protect it too long. After the meal is over he sits 
silently for some time, not neglectful of a thanksgiving. When he gives the 
thanksgiving, it is not to debase that food or to desire some other food. It is 
an all round teaching, with advice, incitement, and to make the hearts light. 
After the thanksgiving, he gets up and goes away, not too fast, nor too slowly 
and not as though were relieved. He wears the robe not too short, nor too long, 
not too tight nor too loose. Wears it so that the body does not feel the contact 
of air, and dust and dirt does not settle on good Gotama’s body. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Gone to the monastery 
sits on the prepared seat and washes his feet, not to adorn them. With washed 
feet, sits legs crossed, keeping his body straight and mindfulness established 
in front of him. He thinks, not to hurt himself, another, or anyone in the 
world<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal>Thinks, the welfare of the whole world. In the monastery he 
teaches the gathering, not praising, or condemning them. Advises, incites, and 
makes the hearts light of all in that gathering. The sounds that leave the mouth 
of good Gotama have eight factors. They are distinct, wise, charming, pleasing 
to the ears, compact, not scattered, deep and resonant. Good Gotama’s voice 
reaches as far as the gathering and does not exceed that gathering. 
<P class=MsoNormal>That gathering advised, incited and made the hearts light, 
get up and go away, thinking to come back, not with a mind of abandoning. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>I have seen good 
Gotama, going, standing, sitting inside a house silently, partaking food there, 
sitting silently after the meal, giving the thanksgiving after the meal, going 
to the monastery, sitting silently in the monastery, teaching gatherings in the 
monastery. Good Gotama<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>is thus and thus 
and something more. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>When this was said, 
the brahmin Brahmaayu got up from his seat, arranged the shawl on his shoulder, 
turning towards where the Blessed One was, with clasped hands uttered a solemn 
utterance thrice. ‘I worship that Blessed One perfect and rightfully 
enlightened. We will some day meet that good Gotama, and have a conversation 
with him.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The Blessed One 
touring Videha, in stages came to Mithila and abode in the Makhaadeva mango 
orchard. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The people of Mithila 
heard that the good recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyas, touring videha had 
eventually arrived in Mithila, with a community of about five hundred bhikkhus 
and was abiding in the Makhaadeva mango orchard. About that good Gotama such 
fame had spread. …re.. it is good to see such perfect ones. Then the Brahmin 
householders of Mithila, approached the Blessed One. Some worshipped, some 
exchanged friendly greetings, some clasped their hands towards the Blessed One, 
some announced their name and clan, and some others silently sat on a side. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The Brahmin Brahmaayu 
heard, the good recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyas has come to Mithila. Then 
he approached the Makhaadeva mango orchard with many young men. When the Brahmin 
Brahmaayu had come close to the Makhaadeva mango orchard, it occurred to him. It 
is not suitable for me to approach the recluse Gotama without prior notice. He 
called a certain young man and said. ’Come good man approach the recluse Gotama 
and for my sake inquire whether he is with few ailments, no troubles and has a 
light living. Then tell him, good Gotama, the Brahmin Brahmaayu is an aged 
decayed man of hundred and twenty years is living in Mithila. He has learned the 
three Vedas, knows, the rites and rituals as officiating priest, the phonology 
and etymology of words<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>and the marks of a 
Great Man. Of the Brahmins living in Mithila, the Brahmin Brahmaayu is the 
wealthiest, the most learned in the Vedas, out of the aged, the most old, and 
the most famous. He desires to see good Gotama.’ The young man agreeing 
approached the Blessed One, exchanged friendly greetings, standing on a side 
said. ‘Good Gotama, the Brahmin Brahmaayu is an aged decayed man of hundred and 
twenty years is living in Mithila. He has learned the three Vedas, knows, the 
rites and rituals as officiating priest, the phonology and etymology of words 
and the marks of a Great Man. Of the Brahmins living in Mithila, the Brahmin 
Brahmaayu is the wealthiest, the most learned in the Vedas, out of the aged, the 
most old, and the most famous. He desires to see good Gotama.’<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Young man, if he 
thinks, this is the suitable time do so.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The young man 
approached the Brahmin Brahmaaayu, and said. ‘Consent is given by the good 
recluse Gotama, now do as it is fit.’<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then the Brahmin 
Brahmaayu approached the Blessed One. When he was approaching in the distance, 
the gathering moved and made some space for him, as suitable for his fame. 
Brahmin Brahmaayu<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>told them. ‘Useless, sit 
where you are, I’m going to the presence of the Blessed One.’ He approached the 
Blessed One, exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side. Seated he examined 
the two and thirty marks of a Great Man on the body of the Blessed One. Seeing 
most of them except two, not satisfied doubted whether the pudendem was encased 
and the tongue was large enough. Then the Brahmin addressed the Blessed One in 
verse. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘I hear of two and 
thirty marks of a Great Man, 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Good sir, I do not see 
two of them on your body, 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The Great Man’s 
pudendum, the association with women 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The size of the 
tongue, pull out the tongue and dispel doubts, 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>For the welfare here 
and now, and the here after. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Permission granted, 
may our wishes, be fulfilled.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then it occurred to 
the Blessed One, the Brahmin Brahmaayuu, sees most of the marks of a Great Man 
on my body, and not two of them.. He is not satisfied, doubts whether the 
pudendum is encased and the tongue is large enough. Then the Blessed One 
exercised a psychic power, so that the Brahmin could see the encased pudendum. 
The Blessed One drew forth his tongue, touched the ear lobes, the nostrils and 
covered the complete forehead with the nose. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then the Blessed One 
addressed the Brahmin Brahmaayuu with verses 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘The two and thirty 
marks of a Great Man, that you have heard of, 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Are all present on my 
body, Brahmin, there are no doubts about that. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>What I should know is 
known, what should be developed is developed. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>What should be 
dispelled, is dispelled, therefore I’m enlightened. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>For the welfare here 
and now, and here after, 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>I grant permission to 
ask whatever you wish.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then it occurred to 
the Brahmin Brahmaayu. Permission is granted, by the Blessed One to ask 
questions. What should I ask the recluse Gotama, is it the welfare here and now 
or the welfare here after. It occurred to the Brahmin Brahmaayu. I’m clever in 
the welfare here and now. Even others question me about the welfare here and 
now. I should question the recluse Gotama the welfare here after. So he 
addressed the Blessed One in verses. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Good One, how does 
one become a Brahmin? How does he become a knower?<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>How does he know the 
three Vedas? And to what is it said health? 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>How does one become 
worthy? And how does he become perfect? 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>How does one become a 
sage?<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>And what is enlightenment? 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then the Blessed One 
explained them to the Brahmin Brahmaayu in verses. 
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]><O:P></O:P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Recollecting earlier 
births, and seeing the heavenly and hellish births, 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>With the destruction of birth, the sage becomes 
master, of<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>knowledges 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Knows the purity of 
the mind, when released from all greed, 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>When birth and death 
is expelled, the holy life becomes complete 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>When come to the end 
of all things, such ones are said to be enlightened. 
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]><O:P></O:P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>When this was said, 
the Brahmin Brahmaayu, got up from his seat, arranged the shawl on one shoulder, 
put his head at the feet, worshipped the Blessed One, kissed the feet, and 
stroked them with the hands, and announced ‘Good Gotama, I’m the Brahmin 
Brahmaayu.’ Then that gathering was surprised and said, ‘The power of the 
recluse is wonderful.The Brahmin Brahmaayu, so famous and well known should show 
this kind of reverence and humility.’ Then the Blessed One said. ‘Useless, 
Brahmin get up and sit on your seat, as your mind is pleased, mine too is 
pleased.’ Then the Brahmin got up and sat on his seat. Then the Blessed One gave 
the gradual Teaching to the Brahmin Brahmaayu. 
<P class=MsoNormal>Such as giving gifts, becoming virtuous, the heavens, the 
dangers of sensuality, and their defiling nature and the fruits of giving up. 
When the Blessed One knew that the mind of the Brahmin Brahmaayu is pure, 
refined, free from hindrances, is aloft and pleased. The Blessed One gave the 
Teaching peculiar to the Enlightened Ones, such as unpleasantness, its arising, 
cessation and the path to its cessation. Just as a pure cloth would take the dye 
evenly, there arose to the Brahmin Brahmaayu the pure and stainless eye of the 
Teaching, seated on that same seat. Whatever thing arises, all that ceases. Then 
the Brahmin Brahmaayu then and there, attained, knew and penetrated the 
Teaching. Doubts dispelled, 
<P class=MsoNormal>knew, what should and should not be done, became confident 
and did not want a Teacher any more, in the dispensation of the Teacher. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>He said thus to the 
Blessed One. ‘Good Gotama, now I understand, it’s like something overturned is 
reinstalled. Like something covered is disclosed. It’s like the path is shown to 
someone who has lost his way. It’s like a lamp is lighted for those who have 
their sight to see forms. Good Gotama has taught in various ways. Now I take 
refuge in good Gotama, in the Teaching, and the Community of bhikkhus. May good 
Gotama accept tomorrows meal together with the Community of bhikkhus.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The Blessed One 
accepted in silence. The Brahmin Brahmaayu knowing that the Blessed One had 
accepted the invitation, got up from his seat, worshipped and circumambulated 
the Blessed One and went away. Then the Brahmin Brahmaayu at the end of that 
night made them prepare nourishing eatables and drinks at his home and informed 
the Blessed One. ‘Good Gotama, the food is ready.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The Blessed One put on 
robes in the morning, took bowl and robes approached the Brahmin Brahmaayu’s 
house, together with the Community of bhikkhus and sat on the prepared seats. 
The Brahmin Brahmaayu served and satisfied the Community of bhikkhus headed by 
the Blessed One with nourishing eatables and drinks with his own hands for seven 
days. At the end of the seven days the Blessed One went on the tour to 
Videha.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Soon after the Blessed 
One went away the Brahmin Brahmaayu passed away. Many bhikkhus approached the 
Blessed One, worshipped the Blessed One, sat on a side and 
<P class=MsoNormal>said. ‘Venerable sir, the Brahmin Brahmaayu passed away,
