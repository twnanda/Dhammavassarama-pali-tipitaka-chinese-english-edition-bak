<P><B>(4.11) <I>Saccavibhangasuttam</I></B> 
<P><B>141. Classification of the Truth.</B></CENTER>
<P>I heard thus. 
<P>At one time the Blessed One was lived in the deer sanctuary in Isispatana, in 
Benares and addressed the bhikkhus from there. ‘O! Bhikkhus.’ Those bhikkhus 
replied ‘Yes venerable sir.’ The Blessed One said ‘Bhikkhus, the Thus Gone One 
worthy, rightfully enlightened set rolling the Teaching not to be interrupted by 
a recluse, a brahmin, a god, Maara, Brahmaa or anyone in the world, announcing, 
detailing establishing and explaining the four noble truths. 
<P>What are the four? They are the announcing, detailing, establishing and 
explaining, the noble truth of unpleasantness, its arising, its cessation and 
the path and method leading to its cessation. Bhikkhus, associate Saariputta and 
Moggallaana. They are wise and helpful to those leading the holy life. 
<P>Saariputta is like the mother who gives birth and Moggallaana is like the 
father. Saariputta trains until the fruition of the entry into the stream of the 
Teaching and Moggallaana until the highest aim is attained. Bhikkhus, Saariputta 
can announce, detail, establish and explain the four noble truths. 
<P>Saying this the Blessed One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. 
<P>Then venerable Saariputta soon after the Blessed had left, addressed the 
bhikkhus. ‘Bhikkhus, the Thus Gone One worthy, rightfully enlightened set 
rolling the Teaching not to be interrupted by a recluse, a brahmin, a god, 
Maara, Brahmaa or anyone in the world, announcing, detailing establishing and 
explaining the four noble truths. 
<P>Friends, what is the noble truth of unpleasantness? Birth is unpleasant. So 
too are decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress. 
Unfulfilled desires are also unpleasant. In short the five holding masses are 
unpleasant. 
<P>Friends, what is birth? The conscious birth in the womb of that and other 
group of beings, appearing of the masses and the gain of the mental faculties is 
birth. 
<P>Friends, what is decay? The breaking up of the body, grayness of hair, 
wrinkling of the skin, the decrease of the life span and maturing of the mental 
faculties in this and other group of beings is decay. 
<P>Friends, what is death? The disappearing, falling away, breaking up, apparent 
death, end of the life span, the falling apart of the masses and laying down the 
body of this and other group of beings is called death. 
<P>Friends, what is grief? Faced with one or the other kind of disaster, the 
grievous thoughts stricken by grief and the resulting internal and severe grief 
is called grief. 
<P>Friends, what is lament? Faced with one or the other kind of disaster, the 
grievous laments stricken by grief and the resulting loud and soft laments are 
called lamenting. 
<P>Friends, what is unpleasantness? Unpleasant, disagreeable feeling born of 
unpleasant disagreeable bodily contact*1) is called unpleasantness. 
<P>Friends, what is displeasure? Unpleasant, disagreeable feeling born of 
unpleasant disagreeable mental contact*2) is called displeasure. 
<P>Friends, what is a disturbed condition? Faced with one or the other kind of 
disaster, the arising unpleasant thoughts cause a disturbed condition that is 
troublesome and disturbing. This is called a disturbing condition. 
<P>Friends, what are unfulfilled desires that are unpleasant? Beings have such 
desires about birth. May birth not be to me. In this way non-birth does not 
come. It is not obtainable by desiring. This is an unfulfilled desire, which is 
unpleasant. Beings have such desires about decay. May decay not be to me. In 
this way non-decay does not come. It is not obtainable by desiring. This is an 
unfulfilled desire, which is unpleasant. Beings have such desires about ailing. 
May ailments not come to me. In this way non-ailing does not come. It is not 
obtainable by desiring. This is an unfulfilled desire that is unpleasant. Beings 
have such desires about death. May death not be to me. In this way deathlessness 
does not come. It is not obtainable by desiring. This is an unfulfilled desire, 
which is unpleasant. Beings have such desires about grief, lament, 
unpleasantness, displeasure and disturbed conditions. May grief, lament, 
unpleasantness, displeasure and disturbed conditions not come to me. In this way 
non-grief, non-lament, pleasantness, pleasure and the undisturbed condition do 
not come. They are not obtainable by desiring. These are unfulfilled desires, 
which are unpleasant. 
<P>.Friends, how are the five holding masses in short unpleasant? In short the 
five holding masses of matter, feelings, perceptions, determinations and 
consciousness are unpleasant*3). 
<P>Friends, this is the noble truth of unpleasantness. 
<P>Friends, what is the noble truth, of the arising of unpleasantness? The 
interest and greed to be again and again, rejoicing in sensuality, in desires 
‘to be’ and desires ‘not to be’. To this is called the noble truth of the 
arising of unpleasantness. 
<P>Friends, what is the noble truth, of the cessation of unpleasantness? 
Non-greed without anything left behind, the cessation, giving up the settlements 
of that same greed, is called the noble truth of the cessation of 
unpleasantness. 
<P>Friends, what is the noble truth, of the path and method for the cessation of 
unpleasantness? This same noble Eight-fold path, such as right view, right 
thoughts, right speech, right actions, right livelihood, right effort, right 
mindfulness and right concentration is called the noble truth, of the path and 
method for the cessation of unpleasantness. 
<P>Friends, what is right view? Recognizing unpleasantness, its arising, its 
cessation and the path and method leading to the cessation of unpleasantness is 
called right view. 
<P>Friends, what are right thoughts? Thoughts, of giving up sensuality, turning 
away from anger and turning away from hurting are called right thoughts. 
<P>Friends, what is right speech? Abstaining from lies, slandering, rough speech 
and frivolous speech is called right speech. 
<P>Friends, what is right action? Abstaining from, destroying living things, 
taking the not given and misbehaving in sexual needs is called right action. 
<P>Friends, what is right livelihood? Here the noble disciple refrains from 
wrong livelihood and leads a livelihood that is right. This is called right 
livelihood. 
<P>Friends, what is right effort? Here, the bhikkhu arouses interest, puts forth 
effort and makes the mind spring forward. For the non arising of non-arisen evil 
thoughts of demerit, for the dispelling of arisen evil thoughts of demerit, for 
the arousing of non arisen thoughts of merit and for the non deluded 
establishment, development and completion of arisen thoughts of merit. This is 
called right effort. 
<P>. Friends, what is right mindfulness? Here the bhikkhu is zealously mindful 
and aware to dispel covetousness and displeasure in the world, reflecting, the 
body in the body, the feeling in feelings, the mental state in the mind and the 
thought in thoughts. This is called right mindfulness. 
<P>Friends, what is right concentration? Here the bhikkhu forsaking sensuality 
and evil thoughts, with thoughts, discursive thoughts and joy and pleasantness 
born of seclusion abides in the first jhaana. Overcoming thoughts and discursive 
thoughts, the mind internally appeased and concentrated in one point, and with 
joy and pleasantness born of concentration abides in the second jhaana.. Again 
the bhikkhu abides mindful and aware with equanimity to joy and detachment, with 
the body experiencing pleasantness too*4) and abides in the third jhaana. To 
this the noble ones say abiding in pleasantness mindful of equanimity. Again the 
bhikkhu dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness and earlier having dispelled 
pleasure and displeasure and with mindfulness purified with equanimity abides in 
the fourth jhaana. To this is called right mindfulness. 
<P>Friends, this is the noble truth of the path and method for the cessation of 
unpleasantness. 
<P>Bhikkhus, the Thus Gone One worthy, rightfully enlightened set rolling the 
Teaching not to be interrupted by a recluse, a brahmin, a god, Maara, Brahmaa or 
anyone in the world, announcing, detailing establishing and explaining the four 
noble truths. 
<P>Venerable Saariputta said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of 
the Blessed One. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; 
<P>Notes. 1. Unpleasant, disagreeable feeling born of unpleasant disagreeable 
bodily contact is called unpleasantness.’<I>ya.m kho, aavuso, kaayika.m dukkha.m 
kaayika.m asaata.m kaayasamphassaja.m dukkha.m asaata.m vedaniiya.m –ida.m 
vuccati aavuso dukkha.m’</I> The body consists of six doors of mental contact 
pervading the six spheres of contact in the form of sights, sounds, smells, 
tastes, touches and ideas. A person collects data from the world through these 
contacts. Some contacts are unpleasant and disagreeable and they give birth to 
unpleasant and disagreeable feelings. This is unpleasantness. 
<P>2. Unpleasant disagreeable feeling born of unpleasant disagreeable mental 
contact is called displeasure. <I>’ya.m kho aavuso cetasika.m asaata.m 
manosamphassaja.m dukkha.m asaata.m vedaniiya.m –ida.m vuccati aavuso 
domanassa.m’</I>The mental unpleasant, disagreeable feeling is displeasure. As 
soon as the bodily pleasant agreeable feeling fades, there pervades the mental 
unpleasant, disagreeable feeling. 
<P>3. In short the five holding masses of matter, feelings, perceptions, 
determinations and consciousness are unpleasant. <I>‘seyyathiida.m 
ruupuupaadaanakkhando vedanuupaadaanakkhando sa~n~nuupaadaanakkhanado 
sankhaaruupaadaanakkhando vi~n~naanuupaadanakkhando;-ime vuccanti aavuso 
sa.mkhittena pa~ncupaadaanakkhanaa dukkhaa.’</I> These are called masses as 
there is a lot of matter, a lot of feelings, a lot of perceptions, a lot of 
determinations and a lot of consciousness. If someone probes into them 
meditating with keen interest, he finds that to hold them with the mind is 
unpleasant. 
<P>4. With the body experiencing pleasantness too. <I>’sukha.m ca kaayena 
patisa.mvedeti’</I> Here the third <I>jhaana</I> is described and it is said 
that pleasantness is experienced with the body too. As the body is also the six 
doors of mental contact, pleasantness is enjoyed by not being disturbed by any 
of the contacts that come from these six spheres of mental contact. Is a 
pleasant experience enjoyed by the worthy ones ‘<I>arahantaa’</I> <BR>&nbsp;
