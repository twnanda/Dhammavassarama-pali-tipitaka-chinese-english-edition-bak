<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU>I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One 
was living in the Sakya hamlet Devadaha. From there the Blessed One addressed 
the bhikkhus. ’Bhikkhus, there are recluses and Brahmins, who hold this view and 
preach it. “Whatever this person feels, whether pleasant, unpleasant or neither 
unpleasant nor pleasant, feelings, all those are the results of earlier actions. 
These earlier actions are finished off with austerities, new, are not done, thus 
there is no accumulation for the future. Without a future accumulation, there is 
destruction of actions. With the destruction of actions, there is destruction of 
unpleasantness. With the destruction of unpleasantness, there is destruction of 
feelings. With the destruction of feelings all unpleasantness finishes.” 
Bhikkhus, Nigan.tas, are of this view. I approached the Nigan.tas of this view 
and asked them. ’Friends, Nigan.tas, is it true, that you are of this view 
Whatever this person feels, whether pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant 
nor pleasant, feelings, all those are the results of earlier actions. These 
earlier actions, are finished off with austerities, new are not done, thus there 
is no accumulation for the future. Without a future accumulation, there is 
destruction of actions. With the destruction of actions, there is destruction of 
unpleasantness. With the destruction of unpleasantness, there is destruction of 
feelings. With the destruction of feelings all unpleasantness finishes? 
Bhikkhus, they acknowledged that it was true. Then I asked them. ‘Nigan.tas, do 
you know, whether you were in the past, or whether you were not in the 
past?’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN

did this demerit or the other demerit?’&nbsp;</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU>‘Friend, we do not know 
that.’&nbsp;</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU>‘Friends, Nigan.tas, do you know, this 
much unpleasantness is finished, this much unpleasant has to be finished, and 
when this unpleasantness is finished, all unpleasantness, will 
finish?’&nbsp;</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Friends, Nigan.tas, you do not know, whether 
you were, or were not, in the past. Whether you did or did not do demerit in the 
past. You do not know what and what demerit you did in the past and how much 
unpleasantness, is finished, how much has to be finished and when, how much of 
it is finished, all unpleasantness finishes. You do not know to dispel demerit 
and accumulate merit here and now. When that is so it is not suitable that the 
venerable Nigan.tas should say. Whatever this person feels, whether pleasant, 
unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant, feelings, all those are the 
results of earlier actions. These earlier actions, are finished off with 
austerities, new are not done, thus there is no accumulation for the future. 
Without a future accumulation, there is destruction of actions. With the 
destruction of actions, there is destruction of unpleasantness. With the 
destruction of unpleasantness, there is destruction of feelings. With the 
destruction of feelings all unpleasantness finishes.</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Friends, Nigan.tas, if you knew, we were in the 
past, and not otherwise. We did demerit in the past and not otherwise. We did 
this and other demerit in the past. This much unpleasantness is finished, this 
much has to be finished and when this much unpleasantness is finished all 
unpleasantness finishes. If you knew how to dispel demerit and accumulate merit 
here and now, it is suitable that the venerable Nigan.tas should say. Whatever 
this person feels, whether pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor

feelings. With the destruction of feelings all unpleasantness finishes.</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Friends, Nigan.tas, it is like a man shot with 
a poisoned arrow, feels sharp unpleasant feelings, on account of the shot arrow. 
His friends, co-associates and blood relations call a surgeon to attend on him. 
The surgeon probes into his open wound with an instrument. On account of that 
probing, he feels sharp unpleasant feelings. He removes the arrow probing into 
the wound. On account of removing the arrow, he feels sharp unpleasant feelings. 
The surgeon administers burning charcoal on the wound as counter medicine. On 
account of administering burning charcoal on the open wound he feels sharp 
unpleasant feelings. In the meantime his wound heals, he becomes well, 
independent and goes where he wishes. Then it occurs to him. I was shot with a 
poisoned arrow and felt sharp unpleasant feelings on account of it. My friends, 
co-associates and blood relations called a surgeon to attend on me. He probed 
into my open wound with an instrument. On account of that probing I felt sharp 
unpleasant feelings. Probing he removed the arrow, on account of removing the 
arrow, I felt sharp unpleasant feelings. Then he administered burning charcoal 
as counter medicine on my wound. On account of that I felt sharp unpleasant 
feelings. Now my wound is healed, I’m well, independent and go where I wish. 
Friends, Nigan.tas, if you knew, we were in the past, and not otherwise. We did 
demerit in the past and not otherwise. We did this and other demerit in the 
past. This much unpleasantness is finished, this much has to be finished and 
when this much unpleasantness is finished all unpleasantness finishes. If you 
knew how to dispel demerit and accumulate merit here and now, it is suitable 
that the venerable Nigan.tas should say. Whatever this person feels, whether 
pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant, feelings, all those are 
the results of earlier actions. These earlier actions, are finished off with 
austerities, new are not done, thus there is no accumulation for the future. 
Without a future accumulation, there is destruction of actions. With the 
destruction of actions, there is destruction of unpleasantness. With the 
destruction of unpleasantness, there is destruction of feelings. With the 
destruction of feelings all unpleasantness finishes Friends, Nigan.tas, since 
you do not know, whether you were, or were not, in the past. Whether you did or 
did not do demerit in the past. You do not know what and what demerit you did in 
the past and how much unpleasantness, is finished, how much has to be finished 
and when, how much of it is finished, all unpleasantness finishes. You do not 
know to dispel demerit and accumulate merit here and now. When that is so it is 
not suitable that the venerable Nigan.tas should say. Whatever this person 
feels, whether pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant, 
feelings, all those are the results of earlier actions. These earlier actions, 
are finished off with austerities, new are not done, thus there is no 
accumulation for the future. Without a future accumulation, there is destruction 
of actions. With the destruction of actions, there is destruction of 
unpleasantness. With the destruction of unpleasantness, there is destruction of 
feelings. With the destruction of feelings all unpleasantness 
finishes.&nbsp;</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>When this was said, the Nigan.tas said to 
me.’Friend, Nigan.tanaataputta acknowledges he has knowledge and vision of 
everything, whether walking, standing, sleeping or awake constantly established. 
He says thus. Nigan.tas, you have demerit done in the past, finish that with 
these difficult austerities. Be restrained in body, words and mind, so that no 
demerit is done for the future These earlier actions, are finished off with 
austerities, new are not done, thus there is no accumulation for the future. 
Without a future accumulation, there is destruction of actions. With the 
destruction of actions, there is destruction of unpleasantness. With the 
destruction of unpleasantness, there is destruction of feelings. With the 
destruction of feelings all unpleasantness finishes. We like these words, and 
are pleased with these words.</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>When this was said, I said to those Nigan.tas. 
‘Friends, Nigan.tas, these five are with twofold results, here and now. What are 
the five? Faith, liking, hearsay, careful thinking and forbearance with view, 
are with twofold results here and now. In which teacher did the venerable 
Nigan.tas’ place faith in the past? What was their liking? What was their 
hearsay? How was their careful thinking? With what view did they forbear? 
Bhikkhus, when I said that, the Nigan.tas had no rightful thing to say. Then 
again, I said thus to the Nigan.tas. ‘Friends, Nigan.tas, when do you feel acute 
severe pain, is it when you pursue difficult exertions or when you do not pursue 
difficult exertions?’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Friend, Gotama, when we pursue difficult 
exertions, we feel acute severe pain. When we do not pursue difficult exertions, 
we do not feel acute severe pain.’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘So 
then Nigan.tas, when you pursue difficult exertions, you feel acute, severe pain 
and when you do not pursue difficult exertions, you do not feel acute severe 
pain. When this is so, is it suitable that the Nigan.tas explain it, as whatever 
this person feels, whether pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor 
pleasant, feelings, all those are the results of earlier actions. These earlier 
actions, are finished off with austerities, new are not pursued, thus there is 
no accumulation for the future. Without a future accumulation, there is 
destruction of actions. With the destruction of actions, there is destruction of 
unpleasantness. With the destruction of unpleasantness, there is destruction of 
feelings. With the destruction of feelings all unpleasantness finishes. If the 
venerable Nigan.tas feel severe acute pain, at the time they pursue difficult 
exertions and at the time they do not pursue difficult exertions, it is suitable 
that the venerable Nigan.tas explain it, as whatever this person feels, whether 
pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant, feelings, all those are 
the results of earlier actions. These earlier actions, are finished off with 
austerities, new are not pursued, thus there is no accumulation for the future. 
Without a future accumulation, there is destruction of actions. With the 
destruction of actions, there is destruction of unpleasantness. With the 
destruction of unpleasantness, there is destruction of feelings. With the 
destruction of feelings all unpleasantness finishes Nigan.tas, when you pursue 
difficult exertions, you feel acute, severe pain and when you do not pursue 
difficult exertions, you do not feel acute severe pain. You, yourself pursue 
these difficult exertions and work them out owing to ignorance and delusion. 
Even when this was pointed out the Nigan.tas had nothing to say 
rightfully.</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhikkhus, again I asked the Nigan.tas. 
‘Nigan.tas, actions with feelings here and now, could they be made actions with 
feelings hereafter by some method, or exertion?’&nbsp;</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘So 
then Nigan.tas, it is not possible to change actions with feelings here and

is so, the venerable Nigan.tas’ method and exertion becomes fruitless. Bhikkhus, 
Nigan.tas who bear this view are blamed rightfully on ten counts.&nbsp;</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>If

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>If

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Bhikkhus, how does the method and the exertion 
become fruitful?<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu 
does not soil the unsoiled self with unpleasantness, does not abandon 
pleasantness rightfully obtained, nor does he indulge in that pleasantness. He 
knows, when I exert on determinations that originate unpleasantness, those 
determinants separate. When I observe carefully the origin of my unpleasantness, 
and develop equanimity, my mind gets detached. In whatever manner I exert on the 
determinations that originate unpleasantness, those determinants separate, there 
the exertion is on the determinations. In whatever manner I observe, the origin 
of my unpleasantness, equanimity develops in that manner. Thus when the exertion 
is on determinations that originate unpleasantness, those determinants separate. 
In this manner too his unpleasantness finishes. When the origin of this and 
other unpleasantness is observed equanimity develops and detachment sets in. In 
this manner too unpleasantness finishes.&nbsp;</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN

seeing this woman standing, conversing, laughing and smiling with another man be

exert on determinations that originate unpleasantness, those determinants

equanimity, my mind gets detached. In whatever manner I exert on the

When the arrow is straightened the fletcher does no more torture of burning and 
hammering it as it is made workable. Thus the bhikkhu reflects in this manner.

this a householder or a householder’s son, born to some clan, gains faith in the 
Thus Gone One. With that faith he reflects. The life in a household is full of 
defilements, going forth is like open space. It is not easy for one living a 
household to lead the holy life complete and pure without defilements. What if I 
shave head and beard, don yellow robes and go forth homeless. Later he gives up
