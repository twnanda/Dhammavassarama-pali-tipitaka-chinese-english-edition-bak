<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>I heard thus.At one 
time the Blessed One lived in the Ka.n.nakatthala deer park in Uju~n~naaya. At 
that time, king Pasenadi of Kosala had come to Uju~n~naaya for some purpose. 
Then the king called a certain man, and said. ‘Come good man, approach, and 
worship the Blessed One, for my sake and ask whether he has few ailments, no 
troubles and a light living. Also tell, king Pasenadi of Kosala will come to see 
the Blessed One after the mid-day meal.’ This man agreed, approached, worshipped 
the Blessed One, and sat on a side. Then he said, ‘Venerable sir, king Pasenadi 
of Kosala worships, with his head at the feet of the Blessed One, and inquires 
whether the Blessed One is with few ailments, without troubles and has a light 
living. Today king Pasenadi of Kosala will come to see the Blessed One after the 
mid-day meal.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The two sisters Soma 
and Sakulaa heard that the king would go to see the Blessed One after his 
mid-day meal, and they approached him at the time he was taking his meal. They 
said to the king, ‘Great king, if that is so, worship the feet of the Blessed 
One for the sake of Soma and Sakula and inquire whether the Blessed One is with 
few ailments, without troubles and has a light living.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then king Pasenadi of 
Kosala, after the meal was over approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a 
side and said to the Blessed One. ’Venerable sir, my sisters Soma and Sakulaa 
too worship the Blessed One with their heads at your feet and asks whether the 
Blessed One is with few ailments, without trouble and has a light living?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Great king, hasn’t 
the sisters Soma and Sakula any other messenger?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable sir, my 
sisters Soma and Sakula heard that I was approaching you, after my mid-day meal. 
They approached me when I was partaking the mid-day meal and said. Great king if 
you approach the Blessed One, worship the feet of the Blessed One for the sake 
of Soma and Sakula and inquire whether the Blessed One is with few ailments, 
without troubles and has a light living.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Great king, may the 
sisters Soma and Sakula be with pleasantness*1).’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then king Pasenadi of 
Kosala said. ‘Venerable sir, I heard that the recluse Gotama said this. There is 
no possibility that a recluse or Brahmin could acknowledge, knowledge and vision 
of everything without leaving out anything. Venerable sir, those who say, the 
recluse Gotama said, there is no possibility that a recluse or Brahmin 
could<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>have knowledge and vision of 
everything without leaving out anything. How far are they saying the words of 
the Blessed One, and not insulting the Blessed One falsely. How much of it is 
according the Teaching and are they saying the words of the Blessed One?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Great king, those who 
say, the recluse Gotama said, there is no possibility that a recluse or Brahmin 
could acknowledge, knowledge and vision of everything, without leaving out 
anything, are not saying my words. They insult me falsely.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>King Pasenadi of 
Kosala spoke to the general Waduudabha. ‘General, who was it that brought these 
words to the inner chambers of the palace?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Great king, it was 
Sanjaya Aakaasagotta.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then king Pasenadi of 
Kosala called a certain man and said. ‘Good man, call the Brahmin Sanjaya 
Aakaasagotta in my words, tell him the king wants you.’ He agreed, approached 
the Brahmin Sanjaya Aakaasagotta and said. ‘Sir, king Pasenadi of Kosala wants 
you.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Meanwhile king 
Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One. ‘Venerable sir, has the Blessed One 
said something else on account of this? Which people may have not understood 
correctly? How does the Blessed One recall saying something pertaining to 
this?’<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Great king I remember 
saying something like this. There is no possibility that a recluse or Brahmin, 
could know and see everything at one and the same time.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable sir, you 
have said with reasons. There is no possibility that a recluse or Brahmin, could 
know and see everything at one and the same time. Venerable sir, there are four 
castes. They are warrior, Brahmin, one of the common grade and slaves. ‘Great 
king of these four castes, two are thought to be superior, that is the warrior 
and Brahmin castes, in the matter of revering, paying attention, clasping hands 
as respect, and to associate with respect. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable, sir, I do 
not question, about the here and now, it is here after I question. Venerable 
sir, of these four castes of warriors, Brahmins, the common man and the slaves 
is there any difference?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Great king there are 
these five attributes for exertion. What are the five? The bhikkhu places faith 
in the enlightenment of the Blessed One. The Blessed One is perfect, rightfully 
enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, knows the worlds,*2 
is the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, Teacher of gods and men, 
enlightened and blessed. He is one with few ailments, a good digestive system 
not too cold nor too hot. Not crafty and fraudulent, shows his real self to the 
Teacher, to the wise or co-associates in the holy life. Abides with aroused 
effort, for dispelling demerit and becomes firm and strenuously yoked to 
accumulate merit. Becomes wise, endowed with the noble one’s wisdom, to 
penetrate and see the rising and falling, for the rightful destruction of 
unpleasantness.*3) Great king, these are the five attributes for exertion. If 
these four castes of warriors, Brahmins, of ordinary people and slaves, are 
endowed with these five attributes of exertion, it will be for their good and 
welfare for a long time.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable sir, when 
these four castes of warriors, Brahmins, ordinary people and slaves are endowed 
with these five attributes of exertion, will there be a difference among them?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Great king, I will 
tell you the difference in their exerting. There are two elephants, or horses or 
bulls to be trained, of them one trained and tamed, the other untrained and 
untamed. Of them which one would be trained tamed and come to the category of 
the trained, is it the trained tamed one or the untrained untamed one?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable sir, the 
trained, tamed one will be trained and tamed, and will come to the category of 
the trained.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Great king in the 
same manner, whatever could be attained by one with faith, few ailments, without 
craftiness and fraudulence, with aroused effort and wisdom, that<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>could be attained by one without faith, many 
ailments, crafty, fraudulent, lazy, without effort and<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>not wise is not a possibility.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable sir, the 
Blessed One said with reasons<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable 
sir, when these four castes of warriors, Brahmins, ordinary people and slaves 
are endowed with these five attributes of exertion, will there be a difference 
among them here?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Great king, I do not 
see any difference in the release or the released. Like one man would light a 
fire with dry branches leaves and twigs. Another would light with dry Sal wood, 
another with dry mango wood and yet another with dry wood apple sticks. Great 
king in these fires lighted with different kinds of wood, do you see any 
difference in the flame, colour or the lustre?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘No, venerable sir.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Great king in the 
same manner, in that fire created by effort, and born out of exertion, I do not 
see any difference in the release or the released. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable sir, the 
Blessed One speaks with reasons. Venerable sir, are there gods?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Great king, why do 
you ask? Venerable sir, are there gods?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable sir, are 
there gods, who would return here, or gods who would not return here?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Great king, those 
gods with a troubled mind return here and the others without a troubled mind do 
not return here.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then the general 
Widuudabha asked the Blessed One. ‘Venerable sir, do the gods with an untroubled 
mind chase out or banish the gods with a troubled mind?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘It occurred to 
venerable Aananda, general Widuudabha is the son of king Pasenadi of Kosala, and 
I’m the son of the Blessed One. The son should speak to the son. Then venerable 
Aananda spoke to the general Widuudabha. ‘General, I will question you on this, 
answer as it pleases you. Within the kingdom of king Pasenadi of Kosala, where 
he wields power, could he chase out or banish recluses, Brahmins, pure or impure 
ones, those leading the holy life or those not leading the holy life?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Within the kingdom of 
king Pasenadi of Kosala, where he wields power, it is possible for him to chase 
out or banish recluses, Brahmins, pure or impure ones, those leading the holy 
life or those not leading the holy life.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘General, have you 
heard of the gods of the thirty three?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘I have heard of the 
gods of the retinue of thirty three, and also this king Pasenadi of Kosala has 
heard of the gods of the retinue of thirty three.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘General could king of 
Kosala chase out or banish gods of the thirty three from there?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Even gaining a sight 
of those gods is not possible to king Pasenadi of Kosala. How could he chase out 
or banish them from there?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘General in the same 
manner, the troubled gods who come here, do not even see the untroubled gods who 
do not come here, so how could they chase them out or banish them from 
there?’<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>King Pasenadi of 
Kosala asked the Blessed One.‘Venerable sir, what is the name of this bhikkhu?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Great king his name 
is Aananda.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Indeed, good Aananda 
has pleasant ways, speaks with reasons. Venerable sir, is there Brahmaa?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Great king, why do 
you ask? ‘Is there Brahmaa?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Are there Brahmaa who 
return here and those that do not return here?’<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Great king the 
troubled Brahmaas return here and those not troubled do not return here.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then a certain man 
said to king Pasenadi of Kosala. ‘Great king, the Brahmin Sanjaya Aakaasagotta 
has come.’ King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Brahmin Sanjaya Aakaasagotta. 
‘Brahmin who brought these words to the inner chambers of the palace.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Great king, the 
general Widuudabha did so.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>General Widuudabha 
said.’Great king it is the Brahmin Sanjaya Aakaasagotta.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then a certain man 
said to king Pasenadi of Kosala. ‘Great king it is time to go.’ Then king 
Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One.’I asked the Blessed One, about the 
knowledge and vision of all. The Blessed One explained it to me. I like the 
reply and I’m satisfied. I asked the Blessed One about the purity of the four 
castes<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The Blessed One explained it to me. 
I like the reply and I’m satisfied. I asked the Blessed One about the superior 
gods. The Blessed One explained it to me. I like the reply and I’m satisfied. I 
asked the Blessed One, about the Great Brahmaas The Blessed One explained it to 
me. I like the reply and I’m satisfied. Whatever questions I asked, the Blessed 
One explained them, now I’m happy and satisfied. Venerable sir, now we go. There 
is much work to do.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Great king if you 
think it is fit, do so.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Then king Pasenadi of 
Kosala got up from his seat, worshipped,<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>circumambulated the Blessed One and went away. 
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]><O:P></O:P>
<P class=MsoNormal>.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Notes<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>1. May the sisters Soma and Sakula be with 
pleasantness.’sukhiniyo hontu Mahaaraaja Somaa ca bhaagini Sakulaaca bhagini’ 
When the Blessed One says sukhiniyo, he means may they be healthy, this is not 
bodily health, which cannot be obtained. What can be gained is the mental 
health. That is the mind free from greed, hate and delusion. Pleasantness is the 
mind free from greed, hate and delusion. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>2Knows the 
worlds.’lokaviduu’ The world to any person is the data collected through six 
spheres of mental contact. That collected data is different from one person to 
the other, according to the additions made of greed, non-greed, hate, non-hate, 
delusion and non-delusion. So each person differs from the other. The Blessed 
One declared this fact and so he is lokaviduu. 
<P class=MsoNormal>3.Becomes wise endowed with the noble one’s wisdom to 
penetrate and see the rising and falling for the rightful destruction of 
unpleasantness. ‘Pa~n~nvaa hoti udayatthagaaminiyaa pa~n~naaya samannaagato 
ariyaaya nibbedhikaaya sammaadukkhakkhaya gaaminiyaa.’ To attain enlightenment 
one has to penetrate and see the rising and falling nature of the five holding 
masses. The five holding masses are the holding masses of matter, feelings, 
perceptions, determinations and consciousness. It is through these five that one 
holds on to a self and a view. So we have to see wisely that they are 
impermanent. We have to see that whatever is impermanent is not 
pleasant-‘dukkha’ and whatever is impermanent and unpleasant should not be taken 
as mine. It is in this manner we push away ‘sakkayadi,t,thi’ the view about a 
self. In plain words it is thoughts about a self.<SPAN
