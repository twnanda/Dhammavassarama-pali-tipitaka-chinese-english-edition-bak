<P class=MsoBodyText>I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One was living in the 
gabled hall in the great forest in Vesali. At that time the wandering ascetic 
Vacchagotta was living in the wandering ascetic’s hall Ekapundarikaa. The 
Blessed One putting on robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes entered 
Vesali for alms. It occurred to the Blessed One, it is too early to go for alms 
in Vesali. What if I approach the wandering ascetic’s hall Ekapundarikaa and 
approach the ascetic Vacchagotta. Then the Blessed One approached the wandering 
ascetic’s hall and the ascetic Vacchagotta. He saw the Blessed One approaching 
and said, Come! Blessed One. It’s after a long time that the Blessed One came, 
may the Blessed One take a seat. Here the seat is ready. The Blessed One sat on 
the prepared seat and the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta too taking a low seat 
sat on a side, and said to the Blessed One. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable sir, I 
have heard this said: The recluse Gotama is all knowing and all seeing and 
acknowledges remainderless knowledge and vision in this manner, ‘while walking, 
standing, lying or awake, constantly and continually knowledge and vision is 
established, to me’.Venerable sir, those who say, these words, ‘The recluse 
Gotama is all knowing and all seeing and acknowledges remainderless knowledge 
and vision:<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>while walking, standing, lying 
or awake, constantly and continually.’ Are they saying the words of good Gotama 
and are they not blaming the Blessed One falsely? Vaccha, those who say, the 
recluse Gotama is all knowing and all seeing and acknowledges remainderless 
knowledge and vision, while walking, standing, lying or awake, constantly and 
continually. They, do not say my words, they blame me falsely. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Venerable sir, 
saying how would it be said, correctly not blaming the Blessed One falsely? ‘The 
recluse Gotama knows the three knowledges. Saying it thus they would be saying 
the right thing, and not blaming me falsely. Vaccha, whenever I desire, I 
recollect the manifold previous births, such as one birth, two births, with all 
modes and all details, thus I recall the manifold previous births. Vaccha, when 
I desire, with the purified heavenly eye beyond human, see beings disappearing 
and appearing, in unexalted and exalted states, beautiful and ugly, in good and 
bad states,-- I see beings, according their actions. Vaccha, destroying desires, 
my mind released and released through wisdom, here and now by myself realising I 
abide. Vaccha, if it is said, the recluse Gotama knows the three knowledges, 
saying it thus, you would be saying the right thing and not blaming me falsely’. 

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>When this was said, 
the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta said thus to the Blessed One: Good Gotama, are 
there any laymen who without giving up the lay bonds, would make an end of 
unpleasaantness after death? No, Vaccha, there aren’t any laymen who have made 
an end of unpleasantness. Without giving up the lay bonds. Good Gotama, are 
there any laymen born in heaven after death without giving up the lay bonds? 
Vaccha, not one hundred, not two hundred, not three hundred, not four hundred, 
not five hundred, many more, are born in heaven after death without giving up 
the lay bonds. Good Gotama, are there any ascetics who have made an end of 
unpleasantness after death? No, Vaccha, there isn’t any ascetic, who has 
made<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>an end of unpleasantness, after 
death. Good Gotama, are there any ascetics who are born in heaven after death? 
Vaccha, I recollected so many as ninety one world cycles and did not see any 
ascetic born in heaven, except for a certain one who was of the view, there are 
results for actions. Good Gotama, if that is so, all other faiths are useless 
even without a birth in heaven. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The Blessed One said 
thus and wandering ascetic Vacchagotta delighted in the words of the Blessed 
One.
