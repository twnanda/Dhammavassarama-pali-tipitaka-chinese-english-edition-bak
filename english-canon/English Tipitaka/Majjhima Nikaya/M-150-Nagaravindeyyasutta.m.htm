<P><B>(5.8) <I>Nagaravindeyyasutta.m</I></B> 
<P><B>150.<I> </I>The discourse delivered at Nagaravindika</B></CENTER>
<P>I heard thus. 
<P>At one time the Blessed One was touring the Kosala country with a large 
Community of bhikkhus and arrived at the brahmin village Nagaravindika of 
Kosala. The brahmin householders of Nagaravindika heard ‘The good recluse 
Gotama, son of the Sakyas, who became homeless, while touring the Kosala country 
with a large Community of bhikkhus have arrived at the brahmin village 
Nagaravindika. This is the fame that has spread about him. That Blessed One is 
worthy, rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, has gone 
well, knows the worlds, is the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, Teacher 
of gods and men, enlightened and blessed. We should see such worthy ones. Then 
the brahmin householders of Nagaravindika approached the Blessed One. Some of 
them exchanged friendly greetings with the Blessed One and sat on a side. Some 
joined their hands in reverence and sat on a side. Some made their names and 
clans heard in the presence of the Blessed One and sat on a side and the rest 
silently sat on a side. 
<P>To the brahmin householders of Nagaravindika the Blessed One said. 
<P>‘Householders, if the homeless ascetics of other beliefs ask you: 
"Householders, what kind of recluses and brahmins should not be revered, 
esteemed and worshipped?" You should reply them thus. Those recluses and 
brahmins, without dispelled greed, aversion and delusion, for forms cognizable 
by eye-consciousness, internally not appeased, abide with good and bad conduct 
by body, speech and mind. Such recluses and brahmins should not be revered, 
esteemed and worshipped. For we too are without dispelled greed, aversion and 
delusion, for forms cognizable by eye-consciousness, internally not appeased, 
abide with good and bad conduct by body, speech and mind. Not seeing any good 
conduct above that, we should not revere, esteem and worship those good recluses 
and brahmins. Those recluses and brahmins, without dispelled greed, aversion and 
delusion, for sounds cognizable by ear-consciousness,…re… for scents cognizable 
by nose consciousness,…re…for tastes cognizable by tongue-consciousness,…re…for 
touches cognizable by body consciousness and for thoughts cognizable by 
mind-consciousness internally not appeased, abide with good and bad conduct by 
body, speech and mind. Such recluses and brahmins should not be revered, 
esteemed and worshipped. For we too are without dispelled greed, aversion and 
delusion, for thoughts cognizable by mind-consciousness, internally not 
appeased, abide with good and bad conduct by body, speech and mind. Not seeing 
any good conduct above that, we should not revere, esteem and worship those good 
recluses and brahmins. Householders, you should reply those ascetics of other 
beliefs in this manner. 
<P>Householders, if the homeless ascetics of other beliefs ask you: 
"Householders, what kind of recluses and brahmins should be revered, esteemed 
and worshipped?" You should reply them thus. Those recluses and brahmins, with 
dispelled greed, aversion and delusion, for forms cognizable by 
eye-consciousness, internally appeased, abide with the right conduct by body, 
speech and mind. Such recluses and brahmins should be revered, esteemed and 
worshipped. For we are without dispelled greed, aversion and delusion, for forms 
cognizable by eye-consciousness, internally not appeased, abide with good and 
bad conduct by body, speech and mind. Seeing good conduct in these recluses and 
brahmins above us, we should revere, esteem and worship those good recluses and 
brahmins. Those recluses and brahmins, with dispelled greed, aversion and 
delusion, for sounds cognizable by ear-consciousness,…re… for scents cognizable 
by nose consciousness,…re…for tastes cognizable by tongue-consciousness,…re…for 
touches cognizable by body consciousness,…re… and for thoughts cognizable by 
mind-consciousness internally appeased, abide with the right conduct by body, 
speech and mind. Such recluses and brahmins should be revered, esteemed and 
worshipped. For we are without dispelled greed, aversion and delusion, for 
thoughts cognizable by mind-consciousness, internally not appeased, abide with 
good and bad conduct by body, speech and mind. Seeing good conduct in these 
recluses and brahmins above us, we should revere, esteem and worship those good 
recluses and brahmins. Householders, you should reply those ascetics of other 
beliefs in this manner. 
<P>Householders, if the homeless ascetics of other beliefs ask you: 
Householders, what are the ways and behavior patterns, of those venerable ones, 
that you say: Indeed these venerable ones are free of greed, or fallen to train 
for it? Free of aversion or fallen to train for it and free of delusion, or 
fallen to train for it? You should reply them thus. Those venerable ones abide 
in forest dwellings and leaves huts, where such forms cognizable by eye 
consciousness could not be enjoyed. Such sounds cognizable ear-consciousness 
could not be enjoyed, such scents cognizable nose-consciousness could not be 
enjoyed, such tastes cognizable tongue-consciousness could not be enjoyed, such 
touches cognizable body-consciousness could not be enjoyed. Because of these 
ways and behavior patterns, we say that these venerable ones are free of greed, 
or fallen to train for it, free of aversion or fallen to train for it, free of 
delusion, or fallen to train for it.’ 
<P>When this was said the brahmin householders of Nagaravindika said. ‘Good 
Gotama, now we understand. It’s like something overturned was reinstated….re…. 
From today, until we live, remember us as your disciples.’
