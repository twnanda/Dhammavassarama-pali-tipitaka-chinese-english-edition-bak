<P><B>5.8 <I>Kosambiyasutta.m</I></B> 
<P><B>(48) The Discourse at Kosambi</B></CENTER>
<P>I heard thus. 
<P>At one time the Blessed One was living in Ghosita’s monastery in Kosambi. At 
that time the bhikkhus of Kosambi had aroused a dispute and were quarrelling 
with each other, throwing sharp words at each other They would not discuss the 
matter among themselves and come to an understanding. A certain bhikkhu 
approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said, Venerable sir, 
the bhikkhus of Kosambi have aroused a dispute and are quarrelling with each 
other, throwing sharp words at each other. They would not discuss the matter 
among themselves and come to an understanding. Then the Blessed One addressed a 
certain bhikkhu: Come bhikkhu in my words address those bhikkhus, and tell, the 
Teacher wants you. That bhikkhu agreed, approached those bhikkhus, and said 
Bhikkhus, the Teacher wants you: Those bhikkhus agreed, approached the Blessed 
One, worshipped and sat on a side. Then the Blessed One said to those bhikkhus; 
Bhikkhus, is it true that you have aroused a dispute among yourselves are 
quarrelling with each other throwing sharp words at each other.You wouldn’t 
discuss the matter among yourselves and come to an understanding? Yes, venerable 
sir.Bhikkhus, at a time when you have aroused a dispute among yourselves are 
quarrelling with each other throwing sharp words at each other, are you 
established in bodily actions of loving kindness, towards co-associates in the 
holy life openly and secretly? Established in verbal actions of loving kindness, 
towards co-associates in the holy life openly and secretly? Establishd in mental 
actions of loving kindness, towards co-associates in the holy life openly and 
secretly? No, venerable sir.Bhikkhus, you have aroused a dispute among 
yourselves quarrelling with each other, throwing sharp words at each other.Now 
you are not established in bodily actions of loving kindness, towards 
co-associates in the holy life openly or secretly. You are not established in 
verbal actions of loving kindness, towards co-associates in the holy life openly 
or secretly. You are not established in mental actions of loving kindness, 
towards co-associates in the holy life openly or secretly. Foolish men, seeing 
what good have you aroused this dispute? You do not discuss this matter among 
yourselves and come to an understanding. Foolish men, this will be for your 
undoing for a long time 
<P>Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: Bhikkhus, there are six things 
which conduces to reverence, unity, friendliness and love for each other. What 
six: Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu should be establishd in bodily actions of 
loving kindness towards co-associates in the holy life openly and secretly. This 
is a thing which conduces to reverence, unity, friendliness and love for each 
other. Again, the bhikkhu should be established in verbal actions of loving 
kindness towards co-associates in the holy life openly and secretly. This too is 
a thing which conduces to reverence, unity, friendliness and love for each 
other. Again the bhikkhu should be established in mental actions of loving 
kindness towards co-associates in the holy life openly and secretly. This too is 
a thing that conduces to reverence, unity, friendliness and love for each other. 
Again bhikkhus, gains rightfully obtained, as far as what is put into the bowl, 
the bhikkhu would not partake without sharing equally with the co-associates in 
the holy life. This too is a thing that conduces to reverence, unity, 
friendliness and love for each other. Again the bhikkhu becomes equal in virtues 
with the co-associates in the holy life openly and secretly. The virtues that 
are not broken, fissured or spotted, are consistent and praised by the wise as 
unaffected and conductive to concentration. This too is a thing that conduces to 
reverence, unity, friendliness and love for each other . Again the bhikkhu 
becomes equal with the co-associates in the holy life in the noble view that 
leads to the beyond.Which rightfully shows the destruction of unpleasantness to 
one who thinks logically. This too is a thing that conduces to reverence, unity, 
friendliness and love for each other. Bhikkhus, these are the six things that 
conduces to reverence, unity, frendliness and love for each other. Bhikkhus, of 
these six the noble view that leads to the beyond and rightfully shows the 
destruction of unpleasantness to one who thinks logically is the foremost and 
the chief. It binds all others at the top most beam of the gabled house. .. 
<P>Bhikkhus, what is that noble view that leads to the beyond and rightfully 
shows the destruction of unpleasantness to one who thinks logically. Here. 
Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu gone to a forest or to the root of a tree, or to an empty 
house reflects. Are there undispelled hindrances in me? Do they obstruct my 
mind, from knowing and seeing as it really is? Am I overcome by sensual lust, or 
is my mind hindered by them? Am I overcome by anger, or is my mind hindered by 
it? Am I overcome by sloth and torpor, or is my mind hindered by sloth and 
torpor? Am I overcome by restlessness and worry, or is my mind hindered by 
restlessness and worry? Is my mind overcome with doubts, about this world and 
the other world? Or am I with a dispute quarrelling, throwing rough words at 
others, is my mind hindered in this manner? 
<P>The bhikkhu knows, I haven’t undispelled hindrances on account of which my 
mind would not see it, as it really is.These things are thoroughly dispelled 
from my mind and it is ready for realising the truth. This is the first noble 
knowledge attained, not of the world and not shared by the ordinary*. 
<P>Again, the noble disciple reflects When I practise and develop this view 
much, I experience internal appeasement, and internal extinction*. This is the 
second noble knowledge attained, not of the world and not shared by the 
ordinary. 
<P>Again the noble disciple reflects. This view I have gained is it also the 
view of the recluses and brahmins of other sects. Then he knows, this view with 
which I am endowed, is not shared by recluses and brahmins of other sects. This 
is the third noble knowledge attained, not of the world and not shared by the 
ordinary. 
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflects. I share this view with those 
come to righteousness of view. I’m also endowed with that unique characteristic. 
Bhikkhus, what is that unique characteristic of one come to righteousness or 
view? When he does any wrong, it becomes manifest to him, and he instantly goes 
to the Teacher or a wise co-associate in the holy life and declares and makes it 
manifest and makes amends for future restrain, like a toddler who is slow to 
stand and lie would tred on a burning piece of charcoal and would instantly pull 
away from it. In the same manner when he does any wrong, it becomes manifest to 
him, and he instantly goes to the Teacher or a wise co-associate in the holy 
life and declares and makes amends for future restrain. This is a unique 
character of one come to righteousness of view. This is the fourth noble 
knowledge attained, not of the world and not shared by the ordinary. 
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflects. I share this view, with those 
come to righteousness of view. I’m also endowed with that unique characteristic. 
Bhikkhus, what is that unique characteristic of one come to righteousness of 
view? It is the unique characteristic of one come to righteousness view, to be 
greatly intent in completing any work high or low that has to be done for the 
co-associates in the holy life. Mindful of the high virtues, training, and high 
wisdom. Like the cow which would even pull out the post to which it is tied in 
an effort to save her calf. In the same manner would be greatly intent in 
completing any work high or low that has to be done for the co-associates in the 
holy life. Mindful of the high virtues, much training and high wisdom. Then he 
knows, I share this view, with those come to righteousness of view. I’m endowed 
with that unigue characteristic. This is the fifth noble knowledge attained, not 
of the world and not shared by the ordinary. 
<P>Again, the noble disciple reflects I share this power, with those come to 
righteousness of view. I’m endowed with that power.What is that power with which 
the one come to righteousness of view is endowed?.One come to righteousness of 
view listens to the Teaching attending carefully to take the essential with the 
mind well concentrated. Then he knows, I’m endowed with the power of one come to 
righteousness of view. This is the sixth noble knowledge attained, not of the 
world and not shared by the ordinary. 
<P>Again, the noble disciple reflects.I share this power, with those come to 
righteousness of view. I’m endowed, with that power What is that power with 
which the one come to righteousness of view is endowed?. It is the power of one 
come to righteousness of view to listen to the Teaching taught by the Blessed 
One and gain the meanings, experience the Teaching and experience the joy. Then 
he knows, with whatever power the one, come to righteousness of view is endowed, 
I too share that power. . This is the seventh noble knowledge attained, not of 
the world and not shared by the ordinary. 
<P>When the noble disciple is endowed with these seven characteristics, he is 
ready to realise the fruits of the entry into the stream of the Teaching. 
<P>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the 
Blessed One. . . 
<P><FONT size=-1>Notes</FONT> 
<P>. 1. <FONT size=-1>This is the first knowledge attained not of the world and 
not shared with the ordinary’i<I>damassa pa;.thama.m ~naana.m adhigata.m honti 
ariya.m lokuttara.m asaadhaarana.m puthujjanehi</I>’. This knowledge does not 
belong to the world, as the data does not enter through any of the doors of 
mental contact. So it is not shared by the ordinary worldliing.It is some 
knowledge realised by the noble disciple.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=-1>2. When I practise and develop this view much, I experience 
internal appeasement and internal extinction.<I>’ima.m nukho aha.m di.t.thi 
aasevanto baavento bahulii karonto labhaami paccatta.m samatha.m labhaami 
paccatta.m nibbuuta.mti</I>’ The view of the noble disciple when his mind is 
freed from the five hindrances, when he practises and develops this view, he 
experiences internal appeasement and internal extinction.</FONT>
