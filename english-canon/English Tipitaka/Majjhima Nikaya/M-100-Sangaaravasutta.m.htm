<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU>I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One 
was touring Kosala with a large Community of bhikkhus. At that time the Brahmin 
woman Dhaana~njaani lived in Candaalakappa, with faith in the Blessed One, the 
Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. Then the Brahmin woman Dhaana~njaani 
falling on the ground, uttered this solemn utterance thrice.’I worship that 
Blessed One, perfect and rightfully enlightened.’ At that time a young man named 
Sangaarava lived in Candaalakappa learned in the three Vedas, the phonology and 
etymology of words and the marks of a Great Man. The young man Sangaarava heard 
the Brahmin woman Dhaana~njaani say these words and said. ‘The Brahmin woman 
Dhaana~njaani is low and should be despised, that she ignores the Brahmins and 
speaks much of the shaveling monks.’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Good one with a bright face, you do not know 
the virtues and wisdom of that Blessed One, if you knew the virtues and wisdom 
of the Blessed One you would not think of scolding and depreciating him.’</SPAN> 

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Then good one when the recluse Gotama comes to 
Candaalakappa let me know about it.’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘ 
Yes, I will, good one.’ said the Brahmin woman Dhaana~njaani to Sangaarava,<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>the young Brahmin.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The 
Blessed One touring across Kosala entered Candaalakappa, and lived in the mango 
orchard of the Brahmin Todeyya. The Brahmin woman Dhaana~njaani heard that the 
Blessed One had arrived in Candaalakappa and was abiding in the mango orchard of 
the Brahmin Todeyya. She approached the young man Sangaarava and told him. ‘Good 
one, the Blessed One has arrived in Candaalakappa and is abiding in the mango 
orchard of the Brahmin Todeyya. It is time for you to do what you 
wish.’&nbsp;</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The 
Brahmin Sangaarava said. ‘Yes, I will go.’ Approached the Blessed One, exchanged 
friendly greetings, sat on a side and said. ‘Good Gotama, there are recluses and 
Brahmins who acknowledge they have attained knowledge and reached the fundaments 
here and now. Of these recluses and brahmins, who acknowledge the attainment of 
knowledge and reaching the fundaments here and now, what has good Gotama to 
say?’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Bhaaradvaaja, of these recluses and Brahmins, 
who acknowledge the attainment of knowledge and reaching the fundaments, I 
declare a differentia. There are certain recluses and Brahmins who acknowledge 
the attainment of knowledge and reaching the fundaments through hearsay. Like 
the Brahmins, who have learnt the three Vedas. There are certain recluses and 
Brahmins who acknowledge the attainment of knowledge and reaching the fundaments 
through faith only. Like when done by logical thinking and discrimination. There 
are certain recluses and Brahmins who acknowledge the attainment of knowledge 
and reaching the fundaments through knowing things not heard before, and by 
oneself realising them. Bhaaradvaaja, I belong to the category of recluses and 
Brahmins who acknowledge the attainment of knowledge and reaching the fundaments 
through knowing things not heard before and by myself realising them. 
Bhaaradvaaja, you should know how I belong to the category of recluses and 
Brahmins, who acknowledge the attainment of knowledge and reaching the 
fundaments through knowing things not heard before, realising them by myself in 
this manner.&nbsp;</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhaaradvaaja, before my enlightenment, when I 
was not enlightened, yet a seeker of enlightenment, it occurred to me: The 
household life is full of troubles and defilements. It is not possible to lead 
the completely pure holy life living in a household. What if I shaved head and 
beard, donned yellow clothes and went forth. Even in the prime of youth, with 
black hair, against the wish of mother and father, when they were crying with 
tearing eyes, I shaved head and beard, donned yellow robes leaving the household 
became homeless. Becoming a seeker of good and a seeker of the incomparable 
peaceful state approached Aalaara Kaalaama and said: ‘Venerable one, I want to 
lead the holy life in this dispensation.’ ‘Come friend, the wise before long 
realize this teaching and abide like the teacher. Bhaaradvaaja, I quickly 
learned that Teaching to acknowledge I know and see by uttering and reciting as 
the elders did. Then it occurred to me merely with this faith Aalaara Kaalaama 
would not acknowledge, I know and realized this Teaching. Indeed he abides 
knowing and seeing this teaching. Then I approached Aalaara Kaalaama and asked 
him. Venerable one, how do you abide knowing and realizing this teaching? 
Aalaara Kaalaama declared the sphere of nothingness. Then it occurred to me, it 
is not only Aalaara Kaalaama who has faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration, 
and wisdom. I too have faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration and wisdom. I 
will arouse effort to realize this Teaching realized by him. Before long I 
realized that Teaching. Then I approached Aalaara Kaalaama and asked: Venerable 
one, is it this much, the teaching you have realized. Friend, it is this much 
only, the teaching that I have realized, declare and abide in. Then I said, I 
too have realized this much and abide in it. Venerable one, it is rare gain for 
us to meet co-associates like you in the holy life. That the Teaching I have 
realized, you too have realized. So that, whatever Teaching, I know, that, you 
too know. Now the two of us are on equal grounds. Let us together guide this 
following. Bhaaradvaaja, it was in this manner that my teacher Aalaara Kaalaama, 
gave me equal status. Then it occurred to me: This teaching does not lead to 
giving up, detachment, cessation, appeasement, knowledge enlightenment and 
extinction. It leads up to the sphere of nothingness only.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Not satisfied I turned away from it. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Becoming a seeker of good, and in search of the 
incomparable peaceful state I approached Uddaka Raamaputta and said. Venerable 
one, I want to lead the holy life in this dispensation. Come friend, wise ones, 
before long realize this teaching and abide like the teacher. Bhaaradvaaja, I 
quickly learned that teaching to acknowledge, I know and see to utter and recite 
as the elders did. Then it occurred to me. Merely with this faith, Uddaka 
Raamaputta would not acknowledge I know and have realized this Teaching. Indeed 
he abides knowing and seeing this Teaching. Then I approached Uddaka Raamaputta 
and asked him. Venerable one, how do you know and realize this teaching? Uddaka 
Raamaputta declared the sphere of neither perception-nor non-perception. 
Bhaaradvaaja, then it occurred to me. It is not only Uddaka Raamaputta who has 
faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. I too have faith, effort, 
mindfulness, concentration and wisdom. What if I put forth effort to realize 
this. Before long I realized that teaching. Then I approached Uddaka Raamaputta 
and asked him. Venerable one, is it this much, the Teaching, you have realized? 
Friend, it is this Teaching that I have realized, declare and abide Then I said, 
I too have realized this much and abide in it. Venerable one, it is rare gain 
for us to meet co-associates like you in the holy life. The teaching I have 
realized, you too have realized.. So that Teaching I know, you too know. Now the 
two of us are on equal grounds. Come friend, you guide this following. Thus 
Uddaka Raamaputta my co-associate put me in the place of his teacher. Then it 
occurred to me. This Teaching does not lead to giving up, detachment, cessation, 
appeasement, knowledge enlightenment and extinction. It leads up to the sphere 
of neither-perception-nor-non-perception only. Not satisfied I turned away from 
it. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Becoming a seeker of good and in search of the 
incomparable peaceful state came to the village Senaani in Uruwela. There I saw 
a pleasant piece of land, with a forest, a flowing river with white banks and in 
the vicinity a village to pasture. Then it occurred to me: Indeed this stretch 
of land is pleasant, there is a forest, a flowing river and in the vicinity is a 
village to pasture. Then I sat thinking this is the ideal place to make effort 
for a clansman. Bhaaradvvja, three comparisons occurred to me never heard 
before. Just as a man would come with an over cover to a wet, sappy log of wood 
put in the water saying, I will make fire out of this. Bhaaradvaaja, would he be 
able to make fire rubbing on that wet sappy log of wood? No, good Gotama.. What 
is the reason?.That wet, sappy log of wood put in the water<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>when 
rubbed with the over cover, will not produce fire. That man will reap only 
fatigue. In the same way, when recluses or brahmins, abide not even bodily 
secluded from sensuality the sensual interest, sensual need, sensual stupor, 
sensual thirst, sensual burning not well turned out internally. They experience 
sharp rough unpleasant feelings and it is not possible that they should realize 
knowledge and vision and noble enlightenment...Even if these good recluses and 
brahmins do not feel sharp rough unpleasant feelings it is not possible that 
they should realize knowledge and vision and noble enlightenment. This is the 
first comparison that came to me not heard before.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhaaradvaaja, then another comparison came to 
me never heard before. A man would come with an over cover to a sappy log of 
wood put on dry land, far away from water saying I will make fire out of this. 
Bhaaradvaaja, would he be able to make fire rubbing that sappy log of wood put 
on dry land far away from water? Good Gotama, that sappy log of wood, however 
far it may be from water, rubbed with the over cover would not produce fire. 
That man will reap only fatigue. In the same way, recluses and brahmins that 
abide not even bodily secluded from sensuality that sensual interest, sensual 
need, sensual stupor, sensual thirst, sensual burning not well turned out 
internally, experience sharp rough unpleasant feelings. It is not possible that 
they should realize knowledge and vision and noble enlightenment. Even if these 
good recluses and brahmins do not feel sharp rough unpleasant feelings, it is 
not possible that they should realize knowledge and vision and noble 
enlightenment This is the second comparison that came to me not heard before. 
<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhaardvaaja, a third comparison came to me 
never heard before. Just as a man would come with an over cover to a dry sapless 
log of wood, thrown far away from water, saying I will make fire out of this. 
Bhaaraadvaaja, would he be able to make fire rubbing that dry sapless log of 
wood, thrown far away from water? Yes, good Gotama. What is the reason? That dry 
sapless log of wood, thrown far away from water, rubbed with the over cover 
would produce fire. In the same way, recluses and brahmins that abide bodily 
secluded from sensuality that sensual interest, sensual need, sensual stupor, 
sensual thirst, sensual burning well turned out internally, experience sharp 
rough unpleasant feelings. Yet it is possible that they should realize knowledge 
and vision and noble enlightenment...Even if these good recluses and brahmins do 
not feel sharp rough unpleasant feelings it is possible that they should realize

<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Bhaaradvaaja, it occurred to me, what if I 
pressed the upper jaw on the lower jaw, with the tongue pressing on the palate 
pushed out, expelled and burnt up thoughts in my mind. Then even while sweat was 
dripping from my armpits, I pressed the upper jaw on the lower jaw, with the 
tongue pressing on the palate pushed out, expelled and burnt up thoughts in my 
mind. Like a strong man taking hold of a weaker one would press him and worry 
him. In the same manner I pressed the upper jaw on the lower jaw, with the 
tongue pressing on the palate pushed out, expelled and burnt up thoughts in my 
mind, while sweat was dripping from my arm pits. My effort was aroused 
repeatedly, unconfused mindfulness established, the body was not appeased owing

out-breaths, entering through the nose and mouth When I practiced stopping 
in-breaths and out-breaths entering through the nose and mouth, air entering 
through the ear lobes made much noise. It was like the sound that came from the 
bellows of the smithy. In the same manner when I stopped in-breaths and out

air, entering through the nose and mouth and ear lobes. When I practiced 
stopping in-breaths and out-breaths entering through the nose, mouth and the ear

coarse food some cooked rice and bread. At that time the fivefold bhikkhus 
attended on me, thinking whatever noble thing the recluse Gotama attains he will 
inform us. When I partook coarse food such as cooked rice and bread, they went 
away thinking the recluse Gotama has given up exerting and has returned to

secluded from sensual thoughts and thoughts of demerit with thoughts and 
discursive thoughts and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion I attained 
to the first jhaana. Overcoming thoughts and discursive thoughts, with the mind 
internally appeased, and brought to a single point, without thoughts and 
discursive thoughts and with joy and pleasantness born of concentration I 
attained to the second jhaana. With equanimity to joy and detachment abode 
mindful and aware, and with the body experienced pleasantness and attained to 
the third jhaana. To this abiding the noble ones said, abiding mindfully in 
pleasantness. Dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness, and earlier having

hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, innumerable 
forward cycles of births, innumerable backward cycles of births, innumerable

with such a life span, disappearing from there, is born here. Thus with all

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>When the mind was concentrated, pure, free from 
minor defilements, was malleable workable not disturbed, I directed the mind for 
the destruction of desires.. Knew this is unpleasant, knew this is arising of 
unpleasantness, knew this is cessation of unpleasantness and knew this is the 
path to the cessation of unpleasantness as it really is.: Knew these are 
desires, knew the arising of desires, knew the cessation of desires<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>and knew the path<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>to<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>the<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>cessation of<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>desires<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>as it really is. I, knew and saw them and the 
mind was released, from sensual desires, from desires ‘to be’, and from ignorant 
desires When released knowledge arose, I’m released, birth is destroyed, what 
should be done is done.. The holy life is lived to the end. I knew, there is 
nothing more to wish. Bhaaradvaaja, this is the third knowledge, I attained in 
the last watch of the night. Ignorance dispelled, knowledge arose, as it happens 
to those abiding diligent for dispelling.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then the Brahmin Sangaarava said. ‘The great 
efforts of good Gotama have become profitable. They are the efforts of a Great 
Man, as it happens to the perfect rightfully enlightened one. Good Gotama, are 
there gods?’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Bhaaradvaaja, it should be known with reasons, 
whether there are gods.</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Good Gotama, when asked, are there gods, it 
was said, it should be known with reasons, whether there are gods. Are not these 
words useless lies?’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Bhaaradvaaja, when asked are there gods, 
whether told there are gods, or told it should be known with reasons, a wise man 
should conclude that there are gods.&nbsp;</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Why did good Gotama not declare this to me 
earlier?’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Bhaaradvaaja, it is taken for granted, that 
there are gods in the world.’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then the young man Sangaarava said. ‘Good 
Gotama, now I understand. It is like something overturned is reinstalled. 
Something covered is made manifest. It’s as though the path was told to someone 
who has lost his way. It is as though a lamp is lighted for the darkness, for 
those who have sight to see forms. Good Gotama has explained the Teaching in 
various ways. Now I take refuge in good Gotama, in the Teaching and the 
Community of bhikkhus. May I be remembered as a lay disciple from today until 
life lasts.’<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN></SPAN>
