living in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika in Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi. 
The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from there. ‘Bhikkhus I will give the

the Blessed One said thus. ‘Bhikkhus, in whatever manner the bhikkhu examines, 
he finds his external consciousness is not scattered, internally is not settled

consciousness is not scattered, internally is not settled and without a holding
