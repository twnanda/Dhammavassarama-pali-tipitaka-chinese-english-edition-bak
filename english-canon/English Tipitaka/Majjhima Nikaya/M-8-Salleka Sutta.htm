Purity</FONT></I></B></CENTER>I heard thus. <BR>At one time the Blessed One 
lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika in Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi. 
Then venerable Mahaacunda getting up from his seclusion in the evening 
approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said to the Blessed 
One: Venerable sir, there are various views in the world centred around the self 
and the world, would the bhikkhu attending to them from the beginning turn them 
out and dispel them. . 
<P>Cunda, there are various views in the world centred around the self and the 
world, from whatever these views arise, from whatever these views trickle, from 
whatever these views behave, they are not mine, that is not I, they are not my 
self, to one who looks at them, as they really are, in this manner with right 
wisdom, these views get turned out, get dispelled. . 
<P>Cunda, it may happen, that a bhikkhu secluded from sensual desires, secluded 
from evil thoughts, with thoughts and thought processes, with joy and 
pleasantness born of seclusion, would abide in the first jhaana 
<P>Then it would occur to him, I abide in purity. Cunda, in the dispensation of 
the noble ones that is not purity, 
<P>It is called a pleasant abiding here and now. 
<P>Cunda, it may happen that a bhikkhu overcoming thoughts and thought 
processes, the mind internally appeased in one point, without thoughts and 
thought processes, with joy and pleasantness born of concentration would abide 
in the second jhaana. It would occur to him, I abide in purity. Cunda, in the 
dispensation of the noble ones that is not purity, it is a pleasant abiding here 
and now. 
<P>Cunda, it may happen that a bhikkhu with joy and with equanimity to 
detachment, would abide mindful and aware experiencing pleasantness with the 
body, to this the noble ones say abiding mindfully in pleasantness. The bhikkhu 
would abide in this third jhaaana and it would occur to him, I abide in purity. 
In the dispensation of the noble ones, that is not purity, it is a pleasaant 
abiding here and now. 
<P>Cunda, it may happen, that a bhikkhu dispelling pleasantness and 
unpleasantness and earlier overcoming pleasure and displeasure, without 
unpleasantness and pleasantness and with equanimity mindfulness purified would 
attain and abide in the fourth jhaana. It might occur to him, I abide in purity. 
In the dispensation of the noble ones that is not purity, it is a pleasant 
abiding here and now. 
<P>Cunda, it may happen that a bhikkhu overcoming all perceptions of matter, 
overcoming perceptions of anger, not attending to various perceptions, with 
space is limitless, attained to abides in the sphere of space. It might occur to 
him, I abide in purity. In the dispensation of the noble ones, that is not 
purity, it is a pleasant abiding here and now. 
<P>Cunda, it may happen that a bhikkhu ovecoming all the sphere of space with 
consciousness is limitless, attained to abides in the sphere of conscioussness. 
It might occur to him, I abide in purity. In the dispensation of the noble ones, 
that is not purity, it is a pleasant abiding here and now. 
<P>Cunda, it may happen that a bhikkhu overcoming all the sphere of 
consciousness, with there is nothing attained to abides in the sphere of 
no-thingness. It might occur to him I abide in purity. In the dispensation of 
the noble ones, that is not purity, it is a pleasant abiding here and now. 
<P>Cunda, it may happen that a bhikkhu overcoming all the sphere of nothingness, 
would attain and abide in the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception. 
It might occur to him, I abide in purity. In the dispensation of the noble ones, 
that is not purity, it is a pleasant abiding here and now. 
<P>Cunda, purifying should be done thus: Others will be hurters, we will be 
non-hurters. Others will be destroyers of life, we will not destroy life. Others 
will be taking what is not given , we will abstain from taking what is not

should be aroused others will be hurters, we will be non- hurters. The thought 
should be aroused others will be destroyers of life, we will be not. And the

<P>Cunda, just as for the uneven path, there is an alternative even path, for

<P>Cunda, just as merit could rise up stepping down all demerit, in the same 
manner the hurter could rise up.not hurting. The destroyer of life, could rise 
up abstaining from it. The taker of what is not given, could rise up abstaining 
from it. And the one holdling to his views tenaciously could rise up by giving 
up views easily. . 
<P>.Cunda, one submerged in mud could pull out another submerged in mud is not 
possible.. One not submerged in mud could pull out another submerged in mud is 
possible...Cunda, one not tamed, not trained and not extinguished could tame and 
train others and help to extinguish is not possible. One tamed, trained and

<P>Cunda, I have taught the method of purifying, the method of arousing thoughts 
for it, the method of finding an alternative, the method of rising up, and the 
method of extinguishing. I have done, what should be done out of compassion, by 
a Teacher to his disciples, Cunda, there are roots of trees and absorptions 
without thoughts,* Concentrate, do not be negligent and be remorseful later. 
This is our advice to you. 
<P>The Blessed One said thus, and venerable Cunda delighted in the words of the 
Blessed One. . 
<P>Notes. * Absorptions without thoughts. ‘Su~n~naagaaraana.m’ These are the 
three jhaaanas above the first and all other absorptions without thoughts. 
Thoughts are a mental entertainment, peculiar to the ordinary, without them they 
are lost and would not know what to do, while one who knows enjoys the 
absorptions without thoughts.
