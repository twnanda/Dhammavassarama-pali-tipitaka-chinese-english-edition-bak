<P><B>(29) The Major Discourse on Heartwood</B></CENTER>
<P>I heard thus. 
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived on vultures’ peak in Raajagaha soon after 
Devadatta had left the dispensation and the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus 
on account of Devadatta. 
<P>"Here, bhikkhus, a certain son of a clansman victimised by birth, decay and 
death leaves the household out of faith and becomes a homeless thinking I am 
submerged in grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure, distress and death, 
saying only a few declare the complete ending of this mass of unpleasantness. 
Gone forth thus, he is reborn in gain, honour and fame. Satisfied with it, his 
desires fulfilled with that gain, honour and fame, he praises himself and 
disparages others. I am a gainer of hospitality, these other bhikkhus are 
impotent and not wise.He becomes intoxicated and negligent on account of that 
gain honour and fame and abides in unpleasantness*1).Like a man in need of 
heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood, coming to a standing tree with 
heartwood would ignore the heartwood, sapwood, bark and shoots, and cutting the 
branches and leaves would carry them away thinking it’s the heartwood. – A wise 
man seeing him would say: This good man does not know the heartwood, sapwood, 
bark, shoots, branches or leaves. So this man in need of heartwood, wandering in 
search of heartwood, coming to a standing tree with heartwood has ignored the 
heartwood, sapwood, bark and shoots. He has cut the branches and leaves and is 
carrying them away thinking that it is the heartwood, Whatever work he has to do 
with the heartwood, to that he would not come. Bhikkhus, in the same manner, a 
certain son of a clansman, victimised by birth, decay and death leaves the 
household out of faith. He becomes homeless thinking I am submerged in grief, 
lament unpleasantness, displeasure, distress and death and says only a few 
declare the complete ending of this mass of unpleasanatness. Gone forth he is 
reborn in gain, honour and fame. Satisfied with that, and his desires fulfilled 
he praises himself and disparages others. I am a gainer of hospitality, these 
other bhikkhus are impotent and not wise.Thus he becomes intoxicated and 
negligent on account of that gain, honour and fame and lives in unpleasanatness. 
Bhikkhus, to this is said, the bhikkhu has come to the end of the holy life 
among the branches and leaves.

evil without virtues. Become intoxicated and negligent, he abides in

the holy life among the shoots.

Bhikkhus, it is not possible that the bhikhu should fall from the timeless 
release of mind.. Like a man in need of heartwood wandering in search of 
heartwood, coming to a standing tree with heartwood would cut the heartwood and 
carry it away knowing it is heartwood.. A wise man seeing him would say: This

vision would take upon himself to attain the timeless release of mind. Bhikkhus, 
it is not possible that the bhikkhu should fall from the timeless release of 
mind*.2) 
<P>So then, bhikkhus, the holy life is led not for, gain, honour and fame, not 
for the endowment of virtues, not for the endowment of concentration, not for 
the endowment of knowledges and vision. Bhikkhus, it is for the unshakeable 
release of mind*,2) that is the essence and end of the holy life, . 
<P>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the 
Blessed One. 
<P>Notes. * 
<P><FONT size=-1>1. Intoxicated and negligent on account of the endowment of 
concentration abides in unpleasantness.’<I>so taaya samaadhisampadaaya majjati 
pamajjati pamaada.m aapajjati pamatto samaano dhukkha.m viharati</I>’ We see the 
bhikkhu abiding in unpleasaantness on several occasions when he is intoxicated 
and negligent over his gain honour and fame, attainment of virtues, attainment 
of concentration, attainment of knowledges and vision. The person who has 
realised the timeless release of mind only does not abide in unpleasaanatness. 
The lessening of unpleasaantness starts with the attainment of the entry into 
the stream of the Teaching and reaches the climax with the attainment of 
extinction. Arahatta.</FONT>

experienced any more.</FONT> <BR>&nbsp;
