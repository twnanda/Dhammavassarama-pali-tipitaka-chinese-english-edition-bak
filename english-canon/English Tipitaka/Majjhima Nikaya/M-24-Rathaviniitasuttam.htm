<P>I heard thus. 
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the squirrels’ sanctuary in the bamboo 
grove in Rajagaha.. Then many bhikkhus, who had come to spend the rains in the 
home town having observed and spent the rains in the home town, approached the 
Blessed One worshipped the Blessed One and sat on a side.Then the Blessed One 
said thus:" Bhikkhus, out of the bhikkhus of the home town, which one is 
esteemed in this manner by the co-associates in the holy life.Himself with few 
desires, praises few desires. Satisfied praises satisfaction,. practising 
seclusion praises seclusion, withdrawing from the crowd praises withdrawal from 
the crowd, with aroused effort praises aroused effort, endowed with virtues, 
praises endowment of virtues, concentrated praises concentration, wise praises 
wisdom, released praises release, endowed with knowledge of release praises the 
endowment of knowledge of release, He is an adviser, giver of wisdom, an 
instructor, incitor and he is one who makes the hearts of the co-associates glad 
and light Venerable sir, venerable Punna Mantaaniputta of the home town is 
praised by the co-associates of the holy life as himself with few desires, 
praises few desires. Satisfied praises satisfaction,. practising seclusion 
praises seclusion, withdrawing from the crowd praises withdrawal from the crowd, 
with aroused effort praises aroused effort, endowed with virtues, praises 
endowment of virtues, concentrated praises concentration, wise praises wisdom, 
released praises release, endowed with knowledge of release praises the 
endowment of knowledge of release, He is an adviser, giver of wisdom, an 
instructor, incitor and he is one who makes the hearts of the co-associates glad 
and light 
<P>At that time venerable Saariputta was seated close to the Blessed One, and it 
occured to him it is gain to venerable Punna Mantaaniputta, that the wise 
co-associates in the holy life praise him in such a superior manner, and the 
Teacher too agrees and praises in a superior and superior manner. Some day or 
other we will meet venerable Punna Mantaaniputta and have a conversation on 
this. 
<P>The Blessed One having lived as long as he liked in Raajagaha, left on a tour 
to arrive in Saavatthi, and gradually arrived in Saavatthi, and lived in the 
monastery offered by Anaathapindika in Jeta’s grove Punna Mantaaniputta hearing 
that the Blessed One has arrived in Saavatthi, arranged his dwelling and taking 
bowl and robes left on a tour to arrive at the monastery offered by 
Anaathapindika in Jeta’s grove to the presence of the Blessed One. Having come 
to the presence of the Blessed One worshipped and sat on side. Then the Blessed 
One advised and insttructed venerable Punna Mantaaniputta who was seated on a 
side and made his heart light. Venerable Punna Mantaaniputta delighted and the 
heart light with the advice given by the Blessed One got up from his seat, 
worshipped and circumbulated the Blessed One and went to the Dark forest to 
spend the day. 
<P>Then a certain bhikkhu approached venerable Saariputta and said, friend, 
venerable Punna Mantaaniputta of whom you praise again and again, was advised, 
instructed and made the heart light by the Blessed One,got up from his seat, 
worshipped and circumbulated the Blessed One and has just gone to the Dark 
forest to spend the day. Then venerable Saariputta hurriedly taking a small seat 
followed after venerable Punna Mantaaniputta, keeping an eye on his top. 
Venerable Punna Mantaaniputta entered the Dark forest and sat at the root of a 
tree, to spend the day. Venerable Saariputta too entered the Dark forest and sat 
at the root of a certain tree to spend the day. Venerable Saariputta got up from 
his seclusion in the evening and approached venerable Punna Mantaaniputta, the 
two exchanged friendly greetings and venerable Saariputta sat on a side, and 
said, Friend, do you lead the holy life in the dispensation of the Blessed 
One--Yes, friend.--Friend, do you lead the holy life for purity of virtues.--No, 
friend.--Friend, do you lead the holy life for purity of mind.--No, friend..-- 
Friend, do you lead the holy life for the purity of view--No, friend.--Friend, 
do you lead the holy life for purity through dispelled doubts..--No, friend. 
--Friend, do you lead the holy life for the purity of knowledge and vision of 
the path and non path --No, friend.--Friend, do you lead the holy life for the 
purity of knowledge and vision--No, friend.--What friend, when asked is it for 
the purity of virtues, that you lead the holy life, you say no; When asked is it 
for the purity of mind, that you lead the holy life, you say no When asked is it 
for the purity of view, that you lead the holy life, you say no. When asked is 
it for the purity through dispelled doubts that you lead the holy life, you say 
no. When asked is it for purity of knowledge and vision of the path and the 
non-path that you lead the holy life, you say no. When asked is it for knowledge 
and vision that you lead the holy life you say no - Then indeed for what purpose 
do you lead the holy life--The holy life is lead in the dispensation of the 
Blessed One for the purpose of extinction without a hold..What friend, is purity 
of virtues extinction without a hold--No, friend.--Friend, is purity of mind, 
extinction without a hold. -No, friend.- Friend, is purity of view, extinction 
without a hold.--No, friend.--Friend, is purity through dispelled doubts, 
extinction without a hold.--No, friend.-- Friend, is purity of knowledge and 
vision of path and non-path, extinction without a hold.--No, friend.--Friend, is 
purity of knowledge and vision, extinction without a hold.--No, friend.- Friend, 
is there a non-holding extinction without these things.--No, friend.-- What 
friend, when asked, is purity of virtues extinction without a hold, you say no. 
When asked, is purity of mind extinction without a hold, you say no. When asked 
is purity of view extinction without a hold, you say no. When asked is purity 
through dispelled doubts extinction without a hold, you say no. When asked is 
purity of knowledge and vision of path and non-path, extinction without a hold, 
you say no. When asked is purity of knowledge and vision extinction without a 
hold, you say no. Friend, how should we know the meaning of these words. 
<P>Friend, if the Blessed One pointed non-holding extinction in the purity of 
virtues, he points out the non-holding extinction with holdings. If the Blessed 
One pointed non-holding extinction in the purity of mind, he points out the 
non-holding extinction, with holdings. If the Blessed One pointed non-holding 
extinction in the purity of view he points out the non-holding extinction, with 
holdings. If the Blessed One pointed non-holding extinction in the purity of 
dispelled doubts he points out the non-holding extinction, with holdings.. If 
the Blessed One pointed non-holding extinction in the purity of knowledge and 
vision of path and non-path he points out the non-holding extinction, with 
holdings. If the Blessed One pointed non-holding extinction in the purity of 
knowledge and vision he points out the non-holding extinction with holdings. 
Friend, if there was non-holding extinction without these things, the ordinary 
one* would extinguish, for the ordinary one is without these things. Friend, I 
will give you a comparison, for some wise ones understand with a comparison. 
Just as king Pasenadi of Kosala, living in Saavatthi had some urgent work to do 
in Saaketa, and between Saavatthi and Saaketa seven chariots were prepared. Then 
king Pasenadi of Kosala got into the first chariot at the palace gate and 
arrived at the second chariot. Abandoning the first chariot there, got into the 
second chariot and arrived at the third chariot.Abandoning the second chariot 
there, got into the third chariot and arrived at the fourth chariot. Abandoning 
the third chariot there, got into the fourth chariot and arrived at the fifth 
chariot. Abandoning the fourth chariot there, got into the fifth chariot and 
arrived at the sixth chariot. Abandoning the fifth chariot there, got into the 
sixth chariot and arrived at the seventh chariot. Abandoning the sixth chariot 
got into the seventh chariot and arrived at the palace gate at Saaketa . At the 
palace gate friends and blood relations would ask did the great king come to 
Saaketa, from Saavatthi in this chariot How explaining would the king do it 
correctly, I living in Saavatthi had some urgent work to do in Saaketa, and 
between Saavatthi and Saaketa seven chariots were prepared. Then I got into the 
first chariot at the palace gate and arrived at the second chariot. Abandoning 
the first chariot there, got into the second chariot and arrived at the third 
chariot.Abandoning the second chariot there, got into the third chariot and 
arrived at the fourth chariot. Abandoning the third chariot there, got into the 
fourth chariot and arrived at the fifth chariot. Abandoning the fourth chariot 
there, got into the fifth chariot and arrived at the sixth chariot. Abandoning 
the fifth chariot there, got into the sixth chariot and arrived at the seventh 
chariot. Abandoning the sixth chariot got into the seventh chariot and arrived 
at the palace gate at Saaketa --Explaining it in this manner king Pasenadi of 
Kosala would explain it correctly. In the same manner purity of virtues is for 
the purpose of purity of mind , purity of mind is for the purpose of view, 
purity of view is for the purpose of purity through dispelled doubts, purity 
through dispelled doubts is for the purpose of purity of knowledge and vision of 
path and non-path and purity of knowledge and vision of path and non-path is for 
the purpose of purity of knowledge and vision. Purity of knowledge and vision is 
for the purpose of extinction without holding. It is for extinction without 
holding that the holy life is lived in the dispensation of the Blessed One. 
<P>Then venerable Saariputta said thus to venerable Punna Mantaaniputta: How do 
the co-associates of the holy life address the venerable one. Friend, my name is 
Punna, and the co-associates in the holy life know me as Mantaaniputta. Friend, 
it is wonderful, how a learned disciple like you should reply those questions 
leading to deeper and deeper depths in the dispensation of the Teacher. You are 
a gain to the co-associaats in the holy life, even the sight and association is 
invaluable. Should be honoured even if found in the loin cloth, by the 
co-associates in the holy life.It is gain to me too, that I got an opportunity 
to meet and associate venerable Punna Mantaaniputta. 
<P>When this was said venerable Punna Mantaaniputta said thus to venerable 
Saariputta. What is the venerable one’s name and how do the co-associates in the 
holy life address the venerable one. Friend, my name is Upatissa and the 
co-associates in the holy life call me Saariputta. We without knowing had spoken 
to a highly esteemed disciple of the Teacher. If we knew it was venerable 
Saariputta we would not have spoken so much . Friend, it is wonderful how we 
were led on asking deep and more deep questions in the dispensation of the 
Teacher. You are a gain to the co-associates in the holy life, even the sight 
and association is invaluable. Should be honoured even if found in the loin 
cloth, by the co-associates in the holy life. It is a gain to me too, that I got 
an opportunity to meet and associate venerable Saariputta. 
<P>Thus the two Great Men delighted hearing each others words. 
<P>. Notes. 
<P>*. Ordinary one ‘<I>puthujjano</I>’ An ordinary one has not attained any of 
the eight attainments of the Great Men. These attainments are the stream entry 
and its fruits. Once returner and its fruits. Non-returner and its fruit. The 
one extinguished and the one reaping the results.
