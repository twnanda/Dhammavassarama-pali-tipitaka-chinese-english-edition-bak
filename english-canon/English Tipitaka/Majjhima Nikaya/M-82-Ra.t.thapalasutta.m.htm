<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">I heard 
thus.At one time the Blessed One was touring the Kuru country with a large 
community of bhikkhus, arrived in the village of Thullako.t.thita in the Kuru 
country. –The brahmin householders of Thullako.t.thita heard that the Blessed 
One had arrived and the news spread. The good recluse Gotama, the son of the 
Sakyas, gone forth from the clan of the Sakyas while touring the country of Kuru 
with a large community of bhikkhus arrived in the village of Thullako.t.thita. 
About that good Gotama such fame had spread, That Blessed One is perfect, 
rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, knower of 
the worlds, the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, Teacher of gods and 
men, enlightened and blessed. To this world of gods and men together with its 
Maras, Brahmas and the community of recluses and brahmins, he declares that 
Teaching by himself known and realized,<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>good at the beginning, in the middle and at the 
end, full of meanings even in words and stating the pure and complete holy life. 
It is good to see perfect ones like that.<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then the brahmin householders of 
Thullako.t.thita approached the Blessed One, of them, some worshipped the 
Blessed One, some exchanged friendly greetings, some raised their hands clasped 
together, some pronounced their clan and name, and some others silently, sat on 
a side.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then the Blessed One instructed, 
advised, incited and made the hearts light of the householders of 
Thullako.t.thita.<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>At that time the chief clansman Ratthapala’s 
son was seated in that gathering, and it occurred to him. As I understand the 
Teaching given by the Blessed One, it is not easy to lead that holy life, 
complete, pure and stainless while living in a household. What if I shave head 
and beard, put on yellow clothes and go homeless. The brahmin householders of 
Thullako.t.thita instructed, advised, incited and the hearts made light by the 
Blessed One got up from their seats delighted and pleased worshipped and 
circumambulated the Blessed One and went away Soon after the brahmin 
householders of Thullako.t.thita had gone away the householder’s son Ratthapala 
approached the Blessed One, worshiped the Blessed One and sat on a<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>side. Then he said, to the Blessed One. 
‘Venerable sir, as I understand the Teaching given by the Blessed One, it is not 
easy to lead the complete holy life, pure and stainless while living in a 
household. Venerable sir, I desire to shave head and beard, put on yellow 
clothes, and go homeless. Venerable sir, may I gain the going forth and the 
higher ordination.’.<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN

forth homeless by mother and father?’<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN

the going forth as a homeless without the permission of mother and

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Then venerable sir, I’ll act in such a manner 
so that I get permisssion from mother and father for the going forth. Then the 
householder’s son Rattapala getting up from his seat worshipped, circumambulated 
the Blessed One and approached his mother and father. ‘Mother and father, as I 
understand the Teaching given by the Blessed One, it is not easy to lead the 
complete holy life, pure and stainless, while living in a household. I desire to 
shave head and beard, put on yellow clothes and go forth homeless, give me 
permission, to go forth.’ When this was said, the clansman Ratthapala’s mother 
and father said. ‘Dear Ratthapala, you are our only son, dear to us, our 
pleasure, brought up in pleasantness, dear Ratthapala, you do not know, what 
unpleasantness is. Come! Ratthapala, partake of these pleasures, partake of 
sensual pleasures and also accumulate merit. We do not give you permission to go 
forth. At our death, we will not see you. How could we give you permission to go 
forth homeless, when we are living?’<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>For the second, and up to the third time the 
clansman Ratthapala, said to his mother and father. ‘Mother and father, as I 
understand the Teaching given by the Blessed One, it is not easy to lead the 
complete holy life, pure and stainless, while living in a household. I desire to 
shave head and beard, put on yellow clothes, and and to become homeless. Give me 
permission, for that. For the third time the clansman Ratthapala’s mother and 
father said. ‘Dear Ratthapala, you are our only son, dear to us, our pleasure,

Ratthapala kept silent. For the second, and up to the third time, the mother and

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN

Ratthapala approached the friends of the clansman Ratthapala and said to them. 
‘Your friend Ratthapala has stretched himself on the ground. He says, either I 
will die, or I will go forth homeless. Come! Good ones! tell the clansman

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The friends of the clansman Ratthapala 
approached, the mother and father of the clansman Ratthapala and said. ‘Mother, 
father, the clansman Ratthapala, is lying on the ground. He said, either I die 
here, or else I will go forth. If you do not give him permission, to go forth, 
homeless, he will die there itself. If you give him permission to go forth 
homeless, you would at least see him as one gone forth. If the clansman 
Ratthapala becomes displeased with the holy life, what else would he do, other

homeless.’&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN

power and approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said. 
‘Venerable sir, I’m given permission by mother and father to go forth homeless.’ 
The clansman Ratthapala gained the going forth and the higher ordination in the 
presence of the Blessed One.<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN

ordination, to venerable Ratthapala, and having lived as long as he liked in 
Thullako.t.thita, the Blessed One, left on a tour to reach Savatthi in stages. 
Then the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anathapindika in Jeta’s 
grove. Venerable Ra.t.thapala abiding secluded and withdrawn from the crowd, was 
diligent to dispel and before long for whatever purpose sons of clansmen, 
rightfully go forth homeless, that noble end of the holy life, here and now, he 
realised and abode. He knew, birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived, what 
should be done is done, there is nothing more to wish. Venerable Ra.t.thapala 
became one of the perfect ones.<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then venerable Ra.t.thapala approached the

instruct mother and father if the Blessed One gives me 
permission.’<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The Blessed One, mentally considered the 
thoughts and thought processes of venerable Ratthapala. Knowing that it’s not 
possible for the clansman Ratthapala to give up robes and lead a houehold life 
said. ‘Ra.t.thapala, if you think it’s the time, do so.’<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then venerable Ratthapala getting up from his 
seat, worshipped and circumambulated the Blessed One, arranged the dwelling and 
taking bowl and robes left on a tour to reach Thullako.t.thita by stages and 
arrived there. In<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Thullako.t.thita.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>venerable Ra.t.thapala abode in the deer 
hunting grounds of king Koravya.Then venerable Ra.t.thapala putting on robes in 
the morning and taking bowl and robes entered Thullako.t.thita for alms going in 
due order. He approached the house of his father. At that time his father was 
combing his hair at the central entrance to the hall. Venerable Ra.t.thapala’s 
father seeing venerable Ra.t.thapala coming in the distance said ‘These shaven 
headed recluses gave the going forth to my only dear son.’ Thus venerable 
Ra.t.thapala did not receive morsel food at his own father’s home nor was 
morsels refused, he<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>gained 
abuse.&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>At that time, a female slave of his earlier 
home desired to throw away some stale bread, and venerable Ra.t.thapala said to 
her. ‘Sister if you desire to throw away that food, put it in my bowl.’ When 
that female slave was putting the stale bread into the bowl of venerable 
Ra.t.thapala, she recognised certain signs in the hands, feet and the voice, of 
venerable Ra,t.thapala and told his mother.’Indeed, noble lady, know that the 
noble son Ra.t.thapala has come.’<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Good one, if you tell the truth, you will be 
released from slavery.’ Then venerable<SPAN

style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>his father and told him. Householder, do you 
know that, our noble son Ra.t.thapala has arrived?.<SPAN

<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>At that time venerable Ra.t.thapala was 
partaking that stale bread seated against a wall. Then venerable Ra.t.thapala’s 
father approached venerable Ra.t.thapala and said to venerable Ra.t.thapala 
‘Dear Ra.t.thapala, why do you partake that stale bread? Couldn’t you enter your 
own home?’<O:P></O:P></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN

Householder, we came to your house did not receive morsels, nor a refusal, we

Then venerable Ra.tt.hapala’s father knowing that the invitation is accepted 
approached his own home. Then he amassed all the gold in one place covered it 
with a guilt mat. Then he addressed the previous wives of the clansman 
Ra.t.thapala. In whatever manner you were pleasant agreeable and loveable to him 
earlier get yourselves decorated in that manner. Then venerable Ra.t.thapala’s 
father made preparations of nourishing eatables and drinks, and informed 
venerable Ra.t.thapala. ‘Dear Ra.t.thapala, the food is ready.’ Then venerable 
Ra.t.thapala putting on robes and taking bowl and robes entered the house of his 
father and sat on the prepared seat. Venerable Ra.t.thapala’s father removing 
the cover manifested,<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>the mass of gold,
