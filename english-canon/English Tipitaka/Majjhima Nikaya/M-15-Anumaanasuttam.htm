<P>I heard thus. 
<P>At one time venerable Mahaamoggallaana lived in the deer park, in the 
Bhesakalaa forest among the Sumsumaara hills in the Bhagga country. Then 
venerable Mahaamoggallaana addressed the bhikkhus 
<P>Even if the bhikkhus concede to be advised, if they are unruly, with unruly 
talk, not submisive to advice, the co-associates in the holy should think not to 
advise them and not take them into their confidence. Friends what are the unruly 
things. The bhikkhu with evil desires is submerged in them. The bhikkhu with 
evil desires submerged in them is an unruly thing. Praising himself the bhikkhu 
disparages others. The bhikkhu praising himself and disparaging others is an 
unruly thing. Again the angry bhikkhu is overcome by it. The bhikkhu angry and 
overcome by it, is an unruly thing. Again the angry bhikkhu bears a grudge. The 
bhikkhu angry and bearing a grudge, is an unruly thing. Become angry the bhikkhu 
has a cursing nature. The bhikkhu angry and cursing on account of that anger, is 
an unruly thing..Become angry the bhikkhu speaks angry words. The bhikkhu angry, 
speaking angry words, is an unruly thing. When reprimanded the bhikkhu retorts. 
The reprimanded bhikkhu retorting is an unruly thing. When reprimanded the 
bhikkhu reprimands in return. The reprimanded bhikkhu reprimanding in return, is 
an unruly thing. When reprimanded the bhikkhu makes a counter charge. The 
reprimanded bhikkhu making a counter charge is an unruly thing. Again when 
reprimanded the bhikkhu evades the question and shows anger and discontent The 
reprimanded bhikkhu evading the question, and becoming angry and discontented, 
is an unruly thing. The reprimanded bhikkhu would not accept admonition. The 
reprimanded bhikkhu not accepting admonition is an unruly thing, Again the 
bhikkhu becomes hypocritical and unmerciful, The bhikkhu becoming hypocritical 
and unmercciful is an unruly thing. Again the bhikkhu becomes jealous and 
selfish. The bhikkhu becoming jealous and selfish is an unruly thing. Again the 
bhikkhu becomes crafty and fraudulent. The bhikkhu becoming crafty and 
fraudulent, is an unruly thing. Again the bhikkhu becomes obstinate and holds a 
high opinion of himself.The bhikkhu becoming obstinate and holding a high 
opinion of himself is an unruly thing. Again the bhikkhu stained with 
worldliness, holds to it tenaciously finding it difficult to give up. The 
worldly bhikkhu holding to views tenaciously and finding it difficult to give 
up, is an unruly thing. . .Even if the bhikkhus do not ask for advice, are suave 
have a gentle disposition, patient, and full of reverence when advised , the 
bhikkhus should think to advise them and take them into confidence 
<P>Friends, bhikkhus, what are suave things. A bhikkhu not overcome by evil 
desires is a suave thing. Again . the bhikkhu not praising himself and not 
disparaging others is a suave thing. Again the bhikkhu not angry and not bearing 
a grudge is a suave thing. Again the bhikkhu not angry and not cursing others is 
a suave thing. Again the bhikkhu not speaking angry words is a suave thing. 
Again the bhikkhu not retorting when reprimanded is a suave thing. Again the 
bhikkhu not counter charging when reprimanded is a suave thing. Again the 
reprimanded bhikkhu not leading the conversation aside and not showing anger and 
discontent, is a suave thing. Again the reprimanded bhikkhu accepting admonition 
is a suave thing. Again the bhikkhu not hypocritical,is merciful is a susave 
thing. Again the bhikkhu not jealous and selfish is a suave thing. Again the 
bhikkhu not crafty and fraudulent is a suave thing. Again the bhikkhu not 
obstinate, not holding a high opinion of himself, is a suave thing. 
<P>Here, friends, by the bhikkhu himself should this observation be done, I do 
not like a person overcome by evil desires, in the same manner if I were 
overcome by evil desires, others would detest me, knowing this, I should arouse 
thoughts, not to be overcome by evil desires. I do not like a person praising 
himself and disparaging others, in the same manner, if I praise myself and 
disparage others, I would be detested, knowing this I should arouse thoughts to 
be careful when praising myself and disparaging others. I do not like an angry 
person, in the same manner, I would be detested, if overcome by anger, knowing 
this I should arouse thoughts not to be overcome by anger. I do not like a 
person with a grudge, in the same manner, if I had a grudge on account of anger, 
others would detest me, knowing this I should arouse thoughts not to bear a 
grudge. I do not like a cursing person, in the same manner others would detest 
me if I had a cursing nature, knowing this I should arouse thoughts to dispel 
the cursing nature. I do not like a person speaking angrily, in the same manner 
others would detest me if I spoke angry words, knowing this, I should arouse 
thoughts to overcome this nature I do not like a person who retorts when 
reprimanded, in the same manner, I would be detested if I retorted when 
reprimanded, knowing this I should not retort when reprimanded. I do not like a 
person who evades the question and becomes angry and discontented when 
repremanded, if I did this, others would detest me, knowing this .I should not 
evade the question and become angry and discontented when repremanded. I do not 
like a person who would not accept admonition after being reprimanded. If I did 
this othes would detest me, knowing this I should accept admonition after being 
reprimanded. I do not like a merciless hypocrite. If I became a merciless 
hypocrite, others would detest me, knowing this I should be merciful and no 
hypocrite. I do not like a jealous selfish person, If I were jealous and 
selfish, others would detest me, knowing this I should be not jealous and 
selfish. I do not like a crafty fraudulent person. If I were crafty and 
fraudulent, others would detest me, knowing this I should be not crafty and not 
fraudulent. I do not like an obstinate person who has a high opinion of himself. 
If I was obstinate and had a high opinion of myself, others would detest me, 
knowing this I should not be obstinate and hold a high opinion of myself. I do 
not like a worldly person who holds to views tenaciously and finds it difficult 
to give them up. If I was like that others would detest me, knowing this, I 
should not hold to views tenaciously and should give them up with ease. 
<P>Again, the bhikkhu should reflect, are there evil desires in me. If when 
reflecting the bhikkhu sees any evil desires, he should make an effort to dispel 
those evil desires. When reflecting, if the bhikkhu sees, there are no evil 
desires he should abide delighted and joyful training in those meritorious 
things day and night. Again the bhikkhu should reflect, do I praise myself and

curse with an angry mind. When reflecting if the bhikkhu sees himself cursing

and joyful training in those meritorious things day and night. Again the bhikkhu 
should reflect, do I utter angry words. When reflecting if the bhikkhu sees

reprimander. When reflecting if the bhikkhu sees himself depreciating the 
reprimander , he should make an effort to dispel those evil things. When 
reflecting if the bhikkhu sees himself not depreciating the repremander, he

the bhikkhu should reflect, do I repremand the repremander. When reflecting if

should make effort to dispel all these evil things. When reflecting if he sees

fond of decoration would take a mirror, a clear surface, or a bowl of water and 
would see the reflection of the face, and seeing a speck of dirt would make 
effort to dispel it, not seeing a speck of dirt would be pleased on account of 
it. In the same way the bhikkhu when reflecting if he sees all these evil things 
should make effort to dispel them. When reflecting if he does not see thse 
things should be delighted and joyful training in those meritorious things day 
and night. 
<P>Venerable Mahaamoggallaana said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in those 
words.
