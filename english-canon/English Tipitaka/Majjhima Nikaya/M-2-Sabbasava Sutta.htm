<P>I heard thus: 
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monasatery offered by Anaathapindika 
in Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi 
<P>There, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "O! Bhikkhus, I will teach the 
method of restraining the 
<P>mind from all desires, listen and attend carefully. Bhikkhus, I declare the 
restraining of the mind from all 
<P>desires, knowing and seeing, not without knowing and seeing.Knowing and 
seeing what is it: Knowing and seeing with wise attention and with unwise 
attention. When attending unwisely non-arisen desires arise and arisen desires 
grow.When attending wisely non-arisen desires do not arise and arisen desires 
fade. .Bhikkhus, there are desires to be turned out reflecting wisely, there are 
desires to be turned out with restraint, there are desires to be turned out by 
indulging, there are desires to be turned out by enduring, there are desires to 
be turned out by avoiding,. and there are desires to be turned out by dispelling 
and there are desires to be turned out by development. 
<P>Bhikkhus, what desires should be turned out reflecting wisely. Here, 
bhikkhus, the ordinary man who has not seen Noble Ones and Great Men, not clever 
and not tamed in their teaching, does not know the thoughts that should be 
thought and should not be thought. So he thinks thoughts that should not be 
thought and does not think thoughts that should be thought. Bhikkhus, what 
thoughts that should not be thought are thought. Those thoughts that arouse 
non-arisen sensual desires, and thoughts that develop arisen sensual desires. 
Those thoughts that arouse non-arisen desires ‘to be’ and thoughts that develop 
arisen desires ‘to be’. Those thoughts that arouse non-arisen desires of 
ignorance and thoughts that develop arisen desires of ignorance. These thoughts 
that should not be thought are thought. 
<P>Bhikkhus, what thoughts, that should be thought are not thought. Those 
thoughts that do not arouse non-arisen sensual desires and thoughts that 
diminish arisen sensual desires. Those thoughts that do not arouse 
<P>non-arisen desires ‘to be’ and thoughts that diminish arisen desires ‘to be’. 
Those thoughts that do not arouse non-arisen desires of ignorance and thoughts 
that diminish arisen desires of ignorance. These thoughts that should be thought 
are not thought. Thinking thoughts that should not be thought and not thinking 
thoughts that should be thought non-arisen desires arise and arisen desires 
develop. 
<P>He thinks unwisely in this manner:Was I in the past or wasn’t I in the past. 
Who was I in the past. How was I in the past. Become who and who was I in the 
past: Will I be in the future, or will I not be in the future. What will I be in 
the future. How will I be in the future. Become who and who will I be in the 
future. 
<P>Or doubts arise about the self in the present : Am I, or am I not. What am I. 
How am I . From where did this being come, where will it go. To whoever thinking 
unwisely in this manner, one of these six views arises 
<P>To him a view arises perfect and clear, I have a self. Or I have no self. Or 
with the self I know the self.. Or with the self I know the no-self. Or with 
no-self I know the no-self. Or this view arises to him, This my self which 
speaks and feels and experiences the results of good and bad actions done here 
and there, is permanent and eternal and would not change. Bhikkhus, this is 
called the soul view, the thicket of speculations, the wilderness of 
speculations, the bond of views O! Bhikkhus, the ordinary man bound by thesa 
views is not released from birth, decay, death, sorrow, lament, unpleasantness, 
displeasure and distress. Is not released from unpleasantness, I say. . 
<P>Bhikkhus, the learned disciple who has seen Noble Ones and Great Men, clever 
and trained in their Teaching knows the thoughts that should be thought and 
knows the thoughts that should not be thought. He does not think thoughts that 
should not be thought and thinks thoughts that should be thought. 
<P>What are the thoughts that should not be thought. Those thoughts that arouse 
non-arisen sensual desires and develop arisen sensual desires. Those thoughts 
that arouse non-arisen desires ‘ to be’ and develop arisen desires ‘to be’ Those 
thoughts that arouse non-arisen desires of ignorance and develop arisen desires 
of ignorance. These thoughts should not be thought 
<P>What are the thoughts that should be thought. Those thoughts that do not 
arouse non-arisen sensual desires 
<P>and diminish arisen sensual desires. Those thoughts that do not arouse 
non-arisen desires to ‘to be’ and diminish arisen desires ‘to be’. Those 
thoughts that do not arouse non-arisen desires of ignorance and diminish arisen 
desires of ignorance. These thoughts should be thought. 
<P>When he does not think thoughts that should not be thought and thinks those 
that should be thought non arisen desires do not arise and arisen desires 
fade.Then he wisely thinks, this is unpleasant, wisely thinks this is the 
arising of unpleasantness, wisely thinks this is the cessation of unpleasantness 
and wisely thinks 
<P>this is the path to the cessation of unpleasantness. When he thinks in this 
manner three bonds fade away. 
<P>The view about a self, doubts, and the bindings of virtues.. Bhikkhus, these 
are the desires that should be dispelled by wise thinking. 
<P>Bhikkhus, what desires should be turned out through restraint: Here, the 
bhikkhu wisely reflecting abides 
<P>restrained in the mental faculty of the eye. To one abiding unrestrained in 
the mental faculty of the eye 
<P>would arise desires of distress and burning, to one restrained they do not 
arise. The bhikkhu wisely reflecting abides restrained in the mental faculty of 
the ear. To one abiding unrestrained in the mental faculty of the ear would 
arise desires of distress and burning, to one restrained they do not arise. The 
bhikkhu wisely reflecting abides restrained in the mental faculty of the nose. 
To one abiding unrestrained in the mental faculty of the nose would arise 
desires of distress and burning, to one restrained they do not arise. The 
bhikkhu wisely reflecting abides restrained in the mental faculty of the tongue. 
To one abiding unrestrained in the mental faculty of the tongue would arise 
desires of distress and burning, to one restrained they do not arise. The 
bhikkhu wisely reflecting abides restrained in the mental faculty of the body. 
To one abiding unrestrained in the mental faculty of the body would arise 
desires of distress and burning, to one restrained they do not arise. The 
bhikkhu wisely reflecting abides restrained in the mental faculty of the mind. 
To one abiding unrestrained in the mental faculty of the mind would arise 
desires of distress and burning, to one restrained they do not arise. Bhikkhus, 
to one abiding restrained, desires of 
<P>distress and burning do not arise. These are the desires that should be 
turned out through restraint 
<P>Bhikkhus, what desires should be turned out through indulging. Here the 
bhikkhu wisely reflecting uses the robe to ward off cold, heat, the stings of 
gad flies and yellow flies, to ward off the heat of the air and the touch of 
creeping things and for the purpose of covering the loins out of shame. Wisely 
reflcting partakes of the morsel food, not for play, for intoxication or to look 
beautiful, to support the body, without greed for tastes, as support to lead the 
holy life. While partaking the food reflects ‘Giving up the earlier feelings 
would not arouse new, may it be for a faultless light living’ .Wisely reflecting 
partakes the dwelling to ward off the cold, heat, the sting of gad flies and 
yellow flies, to ward off the burning air, creeping things and to end the 
troubles from the seasons and for seclusion..Wisely reflecting partakes 
requisites when ill to ward off oppressive feelings. When not using them may 
arise desires of distress and burning, using them they would not arise. 
Bhikkhus, these are the desires that should be turned out by indulging . 
<P>Bhikkhus, what desires should be turned out by enduring. Here the bhikkhu 
wisely reflecting endures cold, heat, hunger, thirst, the sting of gad flies, 
yellow flies, heat of the air, the touch of creeping things, 
<P>The piercing touch of badly enunciated words, sharp rough piercing bodily 
feelings and unwelcome, disagreeable feelings that end life. To one not enduring 
these may arise desires of burning and distress, to one enduring them desires do 
not arise. These are the desires that should be turned out by enduring. 
<P>Bhikkhus, what desires should be turned out by avoiding. Here the bhikkhu, 
wisely reflecting avoids rough elephants, horses, bulls, dogs, serpents, uneven 
thorny roads, pits, depresssions, pools and village pools. And sitting on 
unsuitable seats, pasturing on unsuitable pastures and associating evil friends, 
these which the wise co-associates in the holy life denounce, he wisely 
reflecting should avoid. Bhikkhus, to one not avoiding these may arise desires 
of burning and distress, to one avoiding them desires do not arise.These desires 
should be turned out by avoiding. . . 
<P>Bhikkhus, what desires should be turned out by dispelling. Here the bhikkhu 
reflecting wisely does not entertain arisen sensual thoughts, dispels them, does 
not let them rise again. Reflecting wisely does not entertain arisen angry 
thoughts, dispels them, does not let them rise again Reflecting wisely does not 
<P>entertain arisen hurting thoughts, dispels them, does not let them rise 
again. Reflecting wisely does not entertain whatever arisen demeritorious evil 
thoughts, dispels them, does not let them rise again. Bhikkhus, to one not 
dispelling these may arise desires and burning, to one dispelling them desires 
do not arise.These desires should be turned out by dispelling. 
<P>Bhikkhus, what desires should be turned out by development. Here, the bhikkhu 
wisely reflecting develops the enlightenment factor mindfulness based on 
seclusion, detachment and cessation and ending in surrender Wisely reflecting 
develops the enlightenment factor investigation of the Teaching based on 
seclusion, 
<P>detachment and cessation and ending in surrender. Wisely reflecting develops 
the enlightenment factor effort based on seclusion, detachment and cessation and 
ending in surrender. Wisely reflecting develops the enlightenment factor joy 
based on seclusion, detachment and ending in surrender. Wisely reflecting 
develops the enlightenment factor tranquillity based on seclusion, detachment 
and cessation and ending in 
<P>surrender. Wisely reflecting develops the enlightenment factor concentration 
based on seclusion, detachment and cessation and ending in surrender. And wisely 
reflecting develops the enlightenment factor 
<P>equanimity based on seclusion, detachment and cessation and ending in 
surrender. Bhikkhus, to one not developing these may arise desires of burning 
and distress, to one developing them these desires do not arise. These desires 
should be turned out by development. 
<P>Bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu turns out those desires which should be turned out 
by wise reflection, turns out those desires that should be turned out by 
restraint, turns out those desires that should be turned out by 
<P>indulging, turns out those desires that should be turned out by enduring, 
turns out those desires that should be turned out by avoiding, turns out those 
desires that should be turned out by dispelling and turns out those desires that 
should be turned out by development, it is said that the bhikkhu abiding 
restrained in all desires, has overcome craving , dispensed the bonds, and 
rightfully ending measuring made an end of unpleasantness. 
<P>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the 
Blessed One. <BR><A
