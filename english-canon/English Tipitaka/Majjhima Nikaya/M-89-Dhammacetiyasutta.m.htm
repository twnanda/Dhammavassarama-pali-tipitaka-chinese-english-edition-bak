<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-AU><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘I 
heard thus.At one time the Blessed One was living with the Saakyas in a hamlet 
of the Saakyas named Medhalumpa. At that time king Pasenadi of Kosala, had come 
to Nangaraka for some purpose, and he said to Diigha Kaaraayana, ‘Friend 
Kaaraayana, yoke good carriages we like to tour the parklands and see the good 
soil.’ He agreed, and yoking suitable carriages, informed king Pasenadi of 
Kosala.’Great king the carriages are yoked, it is time to do what is fit.’ King 
Pasenadi of Kosala ascended a suitable carriage and left Nangaraka in great 
splendour, going as far as the carriages could go, descended from the carriages 
and entered the parklands. King Pasenadi of Kosala walking about in the 
parklands, saw the roots of trees that were pleasing, noiseless, away from 
humans, and suitable for seclusion and thought of the Blessed One. He thought, 
on account of these roots of trees that are pleasing, noiseless, away from 
humans and suitable for seclusion, I should associate the Blessed One, perfect 
and rightfully enlightened. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala addressed Digha 
Kaaraayana. ‘Friend Kaaraayana, these roots of trees, that are pleasing, 
noiseless, away from humans, and suitable for seclusion recall to me the Blessed 
One, perfect and rightfully enlightened. Friend where does he abide now?’ ‘Great 
king, there is a hamlet of the Sakyas, Medalumpa, the Blessed One, perfect and 
rightfully enlightened lives there now.’ ‘Friend, Kaaraayana, how far is 
Medalumpa from Nangaraka ?’ ‘It isn’t very far about one and twenty miles from 
here.’ ‘Could we reach there by night fall?’ ‘Then friend, Kaaraayana yoke 
suitable carriages, I want to see that Blessed One, perfect, rightfully 
enlightened.’ Then Diigha Kaaraayana agreeing yoked suitable carriages and 
informed the king. ‘Great king, the carriages are yoked, it is the time to do 
the suitable.’ Then king Pasenadi of Kosala, ascended the well yoked carriages 
and left Nangaraka, to reach the hamlet Medalumpa of the Sakyas. When it was 
dark, they reached Medalumpa. Going in the carriage as far as it could reach, 
descending from the carriages came to the monastery grounds. At that time many 
bhikkhus, were doing the walking meditation in the open and king Pasenadi of 
Kosala approached them and asked. ‘Venerable sirs, where is the Blessed One at 
this time, we like to see that Blessed One perfect and rightfully enlightened?’ 
‘Great king the door of the living house is closed, approach it quietly, without 
intruding, step up to the terrace cough and knock on the cross bar. The Blessed 
One will open the door. At that point the king of Kosala, gave the sword and 
crown to Diigha Kaaraayana, and it occurred to him, the king wishes to be alone. 
I should not proceed. King Pasenadi of Kosala quietly approached the closed door 
of the living house without intruding stepped on the terrace, coughed and 
knocked on the cross bar. The Blessed One opened the door. King Pasenadi of 
Kosala, entered the living house, placed his head at the feet of the Blessed One 
kissed the feet and stroked them with his hands. Then he announced, venerable 
sir, I’m king pasenadi of Kosala.’</SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Great king, seeing 
what good, do you show highest reverence and make these friendly offerings to 
this body?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable sir, I have 
come to the main drift of the Blessed One’s Teaching. The Blessed One is 
rightfully enlightened, the Teaching of the Blessed One is well proclaimed. The 
disciples of the Blessed One have come to the right path. Venerable sir, I see 
recluses and Brahmins, who lead the holy life for ten, twenty, thirty or even 
forty years. Later I see them having bathed and decorated themselves, with hair 
and beard shortened, partaking of sensual pleasures, well provided. Here I see 
bhikkhus leading the holy life complete and pure until the end of life, until 
they breathe their last breath. Venerable sir, on account of this too I have 
come to the main drift of the Blessed One’s Teaching. The Blessed One is 
rightfully enlightened, the Teaching of the Blessed One is well proclaimed. The 
disciples of the Blessed One have come to the right path. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Again venerable sir, 
kings dispute with kings, warriors with warriors, Brahmins with Brahmins, 
householders with householders, the mother with the son, the son with the 
mother, the father with the son, the son with the father, brother with brother, 
brother with sister, the sister with the brother, friend with friend. Here, 
venerable sir, I see bhikkhus united and friendly, without a dispute, mixing 
like milk and water, abide seeing each other with friendly eyes.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Venerable sir, on account of this too I have 
come to the main drift of the Blessed One’s Teaching. The Blessed One is 
rightfully enlightened, the Teaching of the Blessed One is well proclaimed. The 
disciples of the Blessed One have come to the right path.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Again, venerable sir, 
I wander from one monastery to the other, from one park to the other, there I 
see certain recluses and Brahmins wasted, unpleasant, discoloured with jaundice, 
with protruding veins, not attractive to the eyes. Then it occurs to me. Indeed 
these venerable ones live the holy life not attached to it. Or they have some 
undisclosed demerit. On account of which they are wasting, unpleasant, 
discoloured with jaundice, are with protruded veins, not attractive to the eyes. 

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>I approach them and 
ask. ‘Why are the venerable ones wasting, unpleasant, discoloured with jaundice, 
with protruding veins, not attractive to the eyes’ They tell me. ‘Great 
king,<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>we suffer from jaundice.’ ‘Venerable 
sir, here we see bhikkhus, pleased, in good spirits, pleasant to the sight with 
satisfied mental faculties, leading a carefree life, without fear and ready to 
help, abiding with the mind of a wild animal. Venerable sir, it occurs to 
me<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Indeed these venerable ones, see some 
gradual distinction in themselves, that they are pleased, in good spirits, 
pleasant to the sight, are with satisfied mental faculties, leading a carefree 
life, without fear are ready to help, abide with minds like those of wild 
animals. Venerable sir, on account of this too I have come to the main drift of 
the Blessed One’s Teaching. The Blessed One is rightfully enlightened, the 
Teaching of the Blessed One is well proclaimed. The disciples of the Blessed One 
have come to the right path.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Again venerable sir, 
as a head anointed warrior king, I have power in my kingdom, to kill, destroy or 
banish, those who need to be killed, destroyed or banished. Yet when I sit for 
jurisdiction, I find it impossible to do justice as various interruptions come 
to me. I even tell them, good sirs, do not interrupt me, wait till I finish, my 
talk. Venerable sir, when the Blessed One is teaching various hundreds of 
bhikkhus, even the sound of a sneeze or a cough is not heard. Once it happened, 
that the Blessed One was teaching a gathering of some hundreds. Then a certain 
disciple of the Blessed One coughed and another disciple of the Blessed One 
nudged him on the knee, to say, make no noise, the Blessed One is teaching. 
Venerable sir, then it occurred to me, it is amazing the gathering is well 
behaved, without, stick or weapon. Venerable sir, I have not seen a disciplined 
gathering like this anywhere else. On account of this too I have come to the 
main drift of the Blessed One’s Teaching. The Blessed One is rightfully 
enlightened, the Teaching of the Blessed One is well proclaimed. The disciples 
of the Blessed One have come to the right path.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Again venerable sir, I 
see a certain wise, clever, warrior disputant, going about thinking to pull down 
wise ones and their views. Hearing that the recluse Gotama has visited a certain 
village or hamlet, they concoct a question. We will approach the recluse Gotama 
and ask this question when he explains it, we will draw him to a dispute. When 
they approach, the Blessed One advises them, incites them and makes their hearts 
light. Advised, incited and made the hearts light, they do not even ask the 
question, how is a dispute to come up? They become all round disciples of the 
Blessed One On account of this too I have come to the main drift of the Blessed 
One’s Teaching. The Blessed One is rightfully enlightened, the Teaching of the 
Blessed One is well proclaimed. The disciples of the Blessed One have come to 
the right path. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Again venerable sir, I 
see a certain wise, clever Brahmin, ….re… a householder,…re…. a<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>recluse, disputant going about thinking to pull 
down wise ones and their views. Hearing that the recluse Gotama has visited a 
certain village or hamlet, they concoct a question. We will approach the recluse 
Gotama and ask this question. He will explain it thus and we will draw him to a 
dispute. When they approach, the Blessed One advises them, incites them and 
makes their hearts light. Advised, incited and made the hearts light, they do 
not even ask the question, how is a dispute to come up? They become all round 
disciples of the Blessed One On account of this too I have come to the main 
drift of the Blessed One’s Teaching. The Blessed One is rightfully enlightened, 
the Teaching of the Blessed One is well proclaimed. The disciples of the Blessed 
One have come to the right path. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Again, venerable sir, 
the master builders,<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Isiidatta and 
Puraana, were brought up by me, given life by me, raised<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>to that state by me. Yet these two do not show 
that same reverence to me, that they give to the Blessed One. Venerable sir, in 
the past, when the army was marching against me, it happened that I went to a 
difficult dwelling of the master builders Isiidatta and Puraana, they advised me 
late into the night. They told<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>that they 
sleep, placing their heads towards where the Blessed One was, and their feet 
towards me. Then it occurred to me. It is wonderful and surprising, the master 
builders Isiidatta and puraana were brought up by me, given life by me, raised 
to that state by me.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Yet these two do not 
show that same reverence to me, that they give to the Blessed One. Indeed these 
venerable ones see some gradual distinction in themselves. On account of this 
too I have come to the main drift of the Blessed One’s Teaching. The Blessed One 
is rightfully enlightened, the Teaching of the Blessed One is well proclaimed. 
The disciples of the Blessed One have come to the right path. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Again, venerable sir, 
I’m a warrior, a man of Kosala eighty years old, the Blessed One too is a 
warrior, of Kosala and is eighty years of age. On account of this, too I show 
highest reverence and make these friendly offerings to this body. Venerable sir, 
now we go, there is much work to be done. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Great king do, as you 
think fit.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>King Pasenadi of 
Kosala got up from his seat, worshipped and circumambulated the Blessed One and 
went away.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Soon after king 
Pasenadi of Kosala had gone, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus. ‘Bhikkhus, 
king<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Pasenadi of Kosala made monuments of 
the Teaching. Bhikkhus, learn those monuments to the Teaching. They are 
conducive to good and belong to the fundamentals of the holy life.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The Blessed One said 
that and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One.
