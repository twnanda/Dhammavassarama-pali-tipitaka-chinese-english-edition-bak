<P><B>(16) The Arrow in the Mind.</B></CENTER>
<P>I heard thus. 
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika 
in Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi. From there the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus. 
"O! Bhikkhus, if the five arrows in the mind of the bhikkhu are not dispelled, 
and if the five bonds are not cut, that bhikkhu should come to growth and 
development in the dispensation, is not a posssibility. How are his five arrows 
of the mind not dispelled: Here the bhikkhu doubts.and does not accept the 
Teacher with assurance. When he doubts and does not accept the Teacher with 
assurance his mind does not tend to exert and make effort.to dispel. -This is 
the first arrow in the mind not dispelled. Again the bhikkhu doubts and does not 
accept the Teaching with assurance. When the bhikkhu doubts and does not accept 
the Teaching with assurance his mind does not tend to exert and make effort to 
dispel. This is the second arrow in the mind not dispelled. Again the bhikkhu 
doubts and does not accept the Community of bhikkhus with assurance. When the 
bhikkhu doubts and does not accept the Community of bhikkhus with assurance his 
mind does not tend to exert and make effort to dispel. This is the third arrow 
in the mind not dispelled. Again, the bhikkhu doubts and does not accept the 
Training with assurance. When the bhikkhu doubts and does not accept the 
Training with assurance his mind does not tend to exert and make effort to 
dispel. This is the fourth arrow in the mind not dispelled. Again, the bhikkhu 
angry with the co-associates in the holy life is displeased and hurt, and his 
mind does not tend to exert and make effort to dispel. This is the fifth arrow 
in the mind not dispelled. These five arrows in the mind are not dispelled. 
<P>How are the five bonds of the mind not cut. Here the bhikkhu has undispelled 
greed, intereest, love, thirst and burning for sensuality. When he has not 
dispelled greed, interest, love, thirst and burning for sensuality, his mind 
does not tend to exert and make effort to dispel. This is the first bond not 
cut. Again the bhikkhu has undispelled greed, interest, love, thirst and burning 
for the body. When the bhikkhu has not dispelled greed, interest, love, thirst 
and burning for the body, his mind does not tend to exert and make effort to 
dispel. This is the second bond not cut. Again the bhikkhu has undispelled 
greed, interest, love, thirst and burning for matter. When the bhikkhu has not 
dispelled greed, interest, love, thirst and burning for material, his mind does 
not tend to exert and make effort to dispel. This is the third bond not cut. 
Again, the bhikkhu partaking food as much as he likes, is yoked to the pleasure 
of torpor touch and sleep. When the bhikhu partaking food as much as he likes, 
is yoked to the pleasure of torpor, touch and sleep, his mind does not tend to 
exert and make effort to dispel. This is the fourth bond not cut. Again the 
bhikkhu observing these virtues and austerities and leading this holy life, 
aspires may I be with those gods, or may I be a certain god When the bhikkhu 
observes virtues and austerities and leads the holy life aspiring to be with a 
certain retinue of gods or to be a certain god his mind does not tend to exert 
and make effort to dispel. This is the fifth bond not cut These are the five 
bonds of the mind not cut.If in that bhikkhu the five arrows in the mind are not 
dispelled, the five bonds are not cut, that he should come to growth and 
devlopment in this dispensation is not possible. 
<P>Whoever bhikkhu has the five arrows in the mind dispelled and the five bonds 
cut, that he should come to growth and development in this dispensation is 
possible. How are the five arrows in the mind dispelled. Here the bhikkhu does 
not doubt, accepts the Teacher with assurance. When he does not doubt accepts 
the Teacher with assurance his mind tends to exert and makes effort.to dispel. 
-This first arrow in the mind is dispelled. Again, the bhikkhu does not doubt, 
accepts the Teaching with assurance. When he does not doubt accepts the Teaching 
with assurance his mind tends to exert and makes effort to dispel. This second 
arrow in the mind is dispelled. Again, the bhikkhu does not doubt, accepts the 
Community of Bhikkkhus with assurance. When he does not doubt accepts the 
Community of Bhikkhus with assurance his mind tends to exert and makes effort to 
dispel. This third arrow in the mind is dispelled. Again, the bhikkhu does not 
doubt accepts the Training with assurance. When he does not doubt accepts the 
Training with assurance his mind tends to exert and makes effort to dispel. This 
fourth arrow in the mind is dispelled. Again the bhikkhu not angry with the 
co-associates in the holy life, is pleased and not hurt his mind tends to exert 
and makes effort to dispel. This fifth arrow in the mind is dispelled. Thus the 
five arrows in the mind are dispelled. 
<P>How are the five bonds in the mind cut. Here the bhikkhu has dispelled greed, 
interest, love, thirst and burning for sensuality. When the bhikkhu has 
dispelled greed, interest, love, thirst and burning for sensuality,. his mind 
tends to exert and makes effort to dispel. This is the first bond cut. Again the 
bhikkhu has dispelled greed, interest, love, thirst and burning for the body. 
When the bhikkhu has dispelled greed, interest, love, thirst and burning for the 
body, his mind tends to exert and makes effort to dispel. This is the second 
bond cut. Again the bhikkhu has dispelled greed, interest, love, thirst and 
burning for matter. When the bhikkhu has dispelled greed, interest, love, thirst 
and burning for material, his mind tends to exert and makes effort to dispel. 
This is the third bond cut. Again, the bhikkhu not partaking food as much as he 
likes, is not yoked to the pleasure of torpor, touch and sleep. When the bhikhu 
not partaking food as much as he likes, is not yoked to the pleasure of torpor, 
touch and sleep, his mind tends to exert and makes effort to dispel. This is the 
fourth bond cut. Again the bhikkhu observing these virtues and austerities and 
leading this holy life, does not aspire may I be with those gods, or may I be a 
certain god When the bhikkhu observes virtues and austerities and leads the holy 
life not aspiring a certain retinue of gods or to be a certain god, his mind 
tends to exert and makes effort to dispel. This is the fifth bond cut These are 
the five bonds of the mind cut. When the bhikkhu has dispelled the five arrows 
in the mind, and cut the five bonds, that he should come to growth and 
devlopment in this dispensation is possible. 
<P>The bhikkhu develops the potential endowed with interest, concentration, 
effort, and determination, develops the potential endowed with endeavour, 
concentration, effort and determination. Develops the potential endowed with 
mind, concentration, effort, and determination. Develops the potential endowed 
with discrimination, concentration, effort and determination The fifth is 
exertion. With exertion there are fifteen things, endowed with these fifteen 
things it becomes possible for the bhikkhu to attain enlightenment. 
<P>It becomes possible to come to the noble end of the yoke. Like the hen that 
had sat on the eggs for eight, or ten or twelve days, then a desire would rise 
to her, why shouldn’t the chicken, come out of the shell breaking it with the 
nails of their feet or with the beak. Then the chicken come out of the shell 
safely breaking the shell with the nails of their feet or with their beak. In 
the same manner endowed with these fifteen things it becomes possible for the 
bhikkhu to attain enlightenment, it becomes possible to come to the noble end of 
the yoke. 
<P>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the 
Blessed One.
