<P>I heard thus. 
<P>At one time the Blessed One was living with the Sakyas in their village 
Saamagaama. At that time Nigan.ta Naataputta had recently died at Paavaa. When 
he died the Nigan.tas had split and were quarrelling, fighting and attacking 
each other with the weapon in their mouths. They were saying things like these. 
'You do not know this Teaching and Discipline, I know it. What do you know of 
it? You have fallen to the wrong method. I have fallen to the right method with 
reasons. You say the first things last, the last things first. Your dispute is 
not thought out, it is reversed and made up and should be rebuked. Go! dispute 
and find your way, if possible'. The dispensation of Nigan.ta Naataputta had 
gone to destruction. The lay disciples of Nigan.tanaataputta, who wore white 
clothes too were broken up, uninterested, hindered and without refuge as it 
happens in a Dispensation, not well taught, by one not rightfully enlightened. 
<P>The novice Cunda spent the rains in Paavaa, approached venerable Aananda in 
Saamagaama, worshipped and sat on a side and said to venerable Aananda. 
'Venerable sir, Nigan.ta Naataputta died recently at Paavaa. After his death the 
Nigan.tas have split, are quarrelling, fighting, are attacking each other with 
the weapon in their mouths. They are saying things like these. 'You do not know 
this Teaching and Discipline, I know it. What do you know of it? You have fallen 
to the wrong method. I have fallen to the right method with reasons. You say the 
first things last, the last things first. Your dispute is not thought out, is 
reversed and made up and should be rebuked. Go! dispute and find your way, if 
possible. The dispensation of Nigan.ta Naataputta had gone to destruction. The 
lay disciples of Nigan.tanaataputta, who wore white clothes too were broken up, 
uninterested, hindered and without refuge as it happens in a Dispensation, not 
well taught, by one not rightfully enlightened'. When this was said, venerable 
Aananda said. 'Friend, Cunda, this has to be told to the Blessed One. Let us 
approach the Blessed One and inform about it to the Blessed One.' 
<P>Venerable C unda agreed and venerable Aananda and the novice Cunda approached 
the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and venerable Aananda said to the 
Blessed One.' Venerable sir, the novice Cunda says, that Nigan.ta Naataputta has 
died recently at Paavaa. After his death the Nigan.tas have split, are 
quarrelling, fighting, are attacking each other with the weapon in their mouths. 
They are saying things like these. 'You do not know this Teaching and 
Discipline, I know it. What do you know of it? You have fallen to the wrong 
method. I have fallen to the right method, with reasons. You say the first 
things last, the last things first. Your dispute is not thought out, is reversed 
and made up and should be rebuked. Go! dispute and find your way, if possble. 
The dispensation of Nigan.ta Naataputta had gone to destruction. The lay 
disciples of Nigan.tanaataputta, who wore white clothes too were broken up, 
uninterested, hindered and without refuge as it happens in a Dispensation, not 
well taught, by one not rightfully enlightened. Venerable sir, it occurs to me 
at the demise of the Blessed One, may there be no dispute, for the good and 
welfare of many.' 
<P>'Aananda, do you see any instance in this Teaching, by me realized and 
proclaimed where two bhikkhus could dispute, such as in the four establishments 
of mindfulness, the four right endeavours, the four psychic powers, the five 
mental faculties, the five powers, the seven enlightenment factors and the 
eightfold path?' 'Venerable sir, in this Teaching realized and proclaimed by the 
Blessed One I do not see an instance where two bhikkhus could dispute, such as 
in the four establishments of mindfulness, the four right endeavours, the four 
psychic powers, the five mental faculties, the five powers, the seven 
enlightenment factors and the eightfold path. 
<P>Yet those persons who live as though obedient to the Blessed One now, will 
arouse a dispute on account of the hard livelihood because of the higher code of 
rules, it will be not for the well being of many and the well being of gods and 
men.' Aananda, a dispute on the harsh livelihood or the higher code of rules is 
negligible, if the community has a dispute about the path and method, it will be 
for the unpleasantness of many, and the unpleasantness of gods and men. 
<P>Aananda, these six are the causes for a dispute. What are the six? When the 
bhikkhu becomes angry and bears a grudge, he becomes unruly even towards the 
Teacher, rebels against the Teaching and becomes unruly, rebels against the 
Community and becomes unruly, does not live complete in the training. Thus he 
arouses a dispute in the Community, for the unpleasantness of many and the 
unpleasantness of gods and men. Aananda, if you see this cause for a dispute 
internally or externally, you should make effort for the dispelling of that 
cause for a dispute, and for its non arising again. 
<P>Again, Aananda, the bhikkhu is merciless with hypocrisy ...re... jealous and 
selfish,..re... crafty and fraudulent,...re... is with evil desires and wrong 
view,...re.. holding fast to worldly matters and not giving up easily. When the 
bhikkhu holds fast to worldly matters and does not give up easily, he becomes 
unruly even towards the Teacher, rebels against the Teaching and becomes unruly, 
rebels against the Community and becomes unruly, does not live complete in the 
training. Thus he arouses a dispute in the Community, for the unpleasantness of 
many and the unpleasantness of gods and men. Aananda, if you see this cause for 
a dispute internally or externally, you should make effort for the dispelling of 
that cause for a dispute, and for its non arising again. This is dispelling the 
evil causes of disputes, for their non arising in the future. Aananda, these are 
the six causes for disputes. 
<P>Aananda, there are four administrations What are the four? The questions of 
disputes, questions of censure, questions of misconduct and questions of duties. 
Aananda, there are seven ways to settle all these disputes. Proceeings done in 
the presence of the accused, appealing to the conscience of the accused, 
acquittal on grounds of restored sanity, agreement by a promise, acquittal by a 
majority vote of the chapter, acquital for evil desires and covering up the 
whole thing without going to details. 
<P>Aananda how are the proceedings done in the presence of the accused? The 
bhikkhu disputes, this is the Teaching and this is not the Teaching, this is the 
Discipline and this is not the Discipline. Then all the bhikkhus unite and get 
together and examine it according to the Teaching and should approve and settle 
it. Thus the proceedings are done in the presence of the accused. 
<P>Ananda, how is the acquittal by a majority vote of the chapter? It is not 
possible to settle this in that same monastery, should go to a place where there 
is a larger number of bhikkhus Then all the bhikkhus unite and get together and 
examine it according to the Teaching and should approve and settle it To settle 
that dispute the accued should be acquitted by a majority vote of the chapter. 
In this manner too it is settled. 
<P>Aananda, how is the appealing to the conscience? The bhikkhus blame the 
bhikkhu of a grave offence, which merits expulsion or something similar. They 
ask does the venerable one recall committing this grave offence, that merits 
expulsion or something similar. He says, venerable sirs I do not recall 
committing this grave offence, that merits expulsion or something similar. 
Aananda, it is in this manner, that his conscience should be disciplined. In 
this manner too a dispute is settled disciplining the conscience. 
<P>Aananda, how is the acquittal on grounds of restored sanity? The bhikkhus 
blame the bhikkhu of a grave offence, which merits expulsion or something 
similar. They ask does the venerable one recall committing this grave offence, 
that merits expulsion or something similar. He says, venerable sirs I do not 
recall committing this grave offence, that merits expulsion or something 
similar. Then he should be well bound by explaining, come on venerable one 
recall whether you have done a grave offence or something similar. Then he would 
say, friends, I had a mental aberration, my mind went off and I did many things 
that should not have been done by a true recluse. I said a lot of piercing 
things that should not have been said. These I did out of delusion and do not 
remember them. Aananda, he should be acquitted on grounds of restored sanity. 
This is the acquittal on grounds of restored sanity, thus too disputes are 
settled. 
<P>Aananda, how is an agreement by a promise? A bhikkhu accused or not accused 
of an offence, recalls and declares it. He should approach an elderly bhikkhu, 
arrange his robe on one shoulder, worship his feet, settle on his feet lowering 
himself and say. 'Venerable sir, I have done an offence and confess it.' Then 
the elder bhikkhu would ask. 'Do you see it?' 'I see it.' 'Have you come to 
future restraint?' 'I have come to future restraint.' Aananda, this is agreement 
by a promise, thus too a dispute is settled. 
<P>Aananda, how is the settlement with evil desires? The bhikkhus blame the 
bhikkhu of a grave offence, which merits expulsion or something similar. They 
ask does the venerable one recall committing this grave offence, that merits 
expulsion or something similar. He says, venerable sirs I do not recall 
committing this grave offence, that merits expulsion or something similar. Then 
he should be well bound by explaining, come on venerable one recall whether you 
have done a grave offence or something similar. Then he would say. 'Friends I 
know of a small offence, for which I did not feel. If I had committed a grave 
offence or something similar, why shouldn't I recall it?' 'Then he is told, you 
have done a small offence, not feeling have not declared and acknowledged it. 
Come on! recall whether you have done a grave offence or something similar.' 
Then he would say.'Friends, I remember doing a grave offence, which merits 
expulsion or something similar.' Aananda, thus his evil desires should be 
settled, and the dispute is settled' 
<P>'Aananda, how is it settled by covering up with grass?' Aananda, the bhikkhus 
abide quarrelling, fighting and saying many things, that should not be utterred 
by true recluses. Then all the bhikkhus should get together unitedly. A learned 
bhikkhu on one side should get up, arrange the robe on one shoulder, clasping 
hands should inform the Community. 'Listen to me venerable sirs, when we were 
quarrelling and fighting, many things that should not be utterred by true 
recluses have been utterred, by you and me too. We have done an offence. For the 
good of the Community, you all and me too, may the discussion of the lay people 
and the offence be covered up in the presence of the Community. Then a bhikkhu 
on the other side should get up, arrange the robe on one shoulder, clasping 
hands should inform the Community. 'Listen to me venerable sirs, when we were 
quarrelling and fighting, many things that should not be uttered by a true 
recluse have been uttered, by you and me too. We have done an offence. For the 
good of the Community, you all and me too, may the discussion of the lay people 
and the offence be covered up in the presence of the Community. Aananda, this is 
covering up with grass, and a dispute is settled by covering up with grass. 
<P>Aananda, there are six things that promote unity, gladness and friendship, 
and dispel disputes. What are the six? Aananda, the bhikkhu should be 
established in bodily actions of loving kindness*1) towards co-associates in the 
holy life openly and secretly. The bhikkhu should be established in verbal 
actions of loving kindness*2) towards co-associates in the holy life openly and 
secretly. The bhikkhu should be established in mental actions of loving 
kindness*3) towards co-associates in the holy life openly and secretly. Again 
the bhikkhu shares equally all rightful gains so far as the morsels put in the 
bowl, with the virtuous co-associates in the holy life. Again the bhikkhu 
becomes equal in all virtues that are not spotted, fissured, free of blemish, 
and praised by the wise as conducive to concentration, with the co-associates in 
the holy life. Again the bhikkhu shares the noble view that rightfully destroys 
unpleasantness*4), of one who logically thinks about it, with the co-associates 
in the holy life openly and secretly. Aananda, these six things promote unity, 
gladness and friendship and dispel disputes. Aananda, do you see a single word 
which is not acceptable among these words?' 
<P>'Venerable sir, I do not see.' 
<P>'Therefore Aananda, be accomplished in these six things that promote unity, 
gladness and friendship and dispels disputes, it will be for your welfare for a 
long time.' 
<P>The Blessed One said thus and venerable Aananda delighted in the words of the 
Blessed One. 
<P>Notes 1. Should be established in bodily actions of loving kindness ' metta.m 
kaayakamma.m paccupa.t.thita.m hoti' The doors at which all actions start is the 
six doors of mental contact. So whatever actions start through seeing, hearing, 
smelling. tasting through touch and the mind, should be with thoughts of loving 
kindness. 
<P>2. Should be established in verbal actions of loving kindness. 'metta.m 
vaciikamma.m paccupa.t.thita.m hoti.' Verbal actions start with thinking and 
pondering, With all data that come through the six doors of mental contact, 
there goes on thinking and pondering, before any words leak out. Such then these 
thoughts should be thoughts of loving kindness. 
<P>3. Should be established in mental actions of loving kindness. 'metta.m 
manokamma.m paccupa.t.thita.m hoti.' Mental actions are feelings and 
perceptions. When the aforesaid bodily and verbal actions are those of loving 
kindness, automatically the mental actions of feelings and perceptions become 
those of loving kindness. 
<P>4. The noble view that rightfully destroys unpleasantness, of one who 
logically thinks about it.' yaaya.m di.t.thi ariyaa niiyaanikaa niiyaati 
takkarassa sammaa dukkhakkhaayaati' The noble view that rightfully destroys the 
unpleasantness of one who logically thinks about it, is the right view which 
carries one to the entry of the stream of the Teaching. This in Pali is 
'sotapattimagga' 
<P>The first stage of sainthood of a Buddhist.
