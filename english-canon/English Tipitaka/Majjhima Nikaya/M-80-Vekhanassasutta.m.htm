touches cognizable by body consciousness arousing fondness and sensual desires.

Kaccayana, those perfected bhikkhus, desires destroyed, lived the holy life, 
done what should be done, put down the weight, have attained the highest good, 
have destroyed the desires ‘to be’ and knowing rightly released, would know the 
senses, the sensual pleasures, and the highest sensual

Vekhanassa was angry and displeased and cursed and reviled the Blessed One.’It 
is the recluse gotama who says evil words. In this manner certain recluses and 
brahmins, not knowing the beginning and not seeing the end acknowledge birth is 
destroyed. The holy life is lived, what should be done is done, there is nothing 
more to wish. These their words are empty and foolish.’<O:P></O:P></SPAN>

style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Kaccaayana, leave alone the beginning and the 
end.Let any wise man come, not crafty and fraudulent, is straightforward I will 
instruct him and advise him. If he follows the method as instructed, before long 
he himself will rightfully know. Thus he will be rightfully released from this 
bond of ignorance. Kaccayana, like a toddler who would have strings tied on his 
arms, legs and the neck and when he is grown up and his mental faculties are 
mature those bonds would be broken and he would know. I am free of those bonds. 
In the same manner let any wise man come, who is not crafty and fraudulent, is

over turned is reinstalled. As something covered is made manifest. It is as 
though the path is shown to someone who has lost his way. As though an oil lamp 
is lighted for those who have sight to see forms in the darkness. In various 
ways, the Teaching is explained, by good Gotama.. Now I take refuge in good 
Gotama, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. May I be remembered as a 
lay disciple who has taken refuge from today until I die.<SPAN
