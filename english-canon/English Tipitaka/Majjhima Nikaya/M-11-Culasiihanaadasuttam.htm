<P><B>11 A Minor Lion’s Roar.</B></CENTER>
<P>I heard thus. 
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika 
in Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from there. 

<P>Bhikkhus, it’s only in this dispensation, that there is a recluse. A second 
recluse. A third recluse and a fourth recluse. Other faiths are devoid of 
recluses and devoid of the perfect. Thus the lion’s roar could be rightfully 
roared. It might happen that adherants of other sects would ask with what 
conviction and what powers do the venerable ones say that here only there is a 
recluse, a second recluse, a third recluse and a fourth recluse. Other faiths 
are devoid of recluses and devoid of the perfect. Bhikkhus, to those adherants 
of other sects this is our reply. Friends, there are four things declared by 
that Blessed One, who knows and sees is worthy and rightfully enlightened we 
seeing those four things in ourselves say here only there is a recluse, a second 
recluse, a third recluse and a fourth recluse. Other faiths are devoid of 
recluses and the perfect. What four. Friends, we have faith in the Teacher, we 
have faith in the Teaching, we see the completion of our virtues and we have a 
pleasant and rightful relation between the gone forth and the householders. 
Seeing these in ourselves we say here only there is a recluse, a second recluse, 
a third recluse and a fourth recluse. Other faiths are devoid of recluses and 
the perfect. It might happen that the adherants of other sects would say, we too 
have faith , in our teacher, we too have faith in our teaching, we too have a 
completion in our virtues and we too have a pleasant and rightful relation 
between the gone forth and the housseholders. So what is the difference between 
your teaching and our teaching. To those adherants of other sects who say thus, 
this is our reply. Friends, is the ultimate end a single one or is it manifold. 
If those adherants of other sects reply rightfully, they would say the the 
ultimate end is a single one, not a manifold one. Friends, is that end with 
greed or without greed. If the adherants of other sects reply rightfully, they 
would say : The ultimate end is without greed. Friends, is that ultimate end 
with anger or without anger. If the adherants of other sects reply rightfully, 
they would say. The ultimate end is without anger. Friends, is that ultimate end 
with delusion or without ddelusion. If the adherants of other sects reply 
rightfully, they would say. The ultimate end is without delusion. Friends, is 
that ultimate end with holdings or without holdings. If the adherants of other 
sects reply rightfully, they would say. The ultimate end is without holdings. 
Friends, is that ultimate end for the wise or for the unwise. If the adherants 
of other sects reply rightfully, they would say. The ultimate end is for the 
wise. Friends, is that ultimate end for the not rough and not averse or for the 
rough and averse If the adherants of other sects reply rightfully, they would 
say. The ultimate end is for the not rough and not averse. Friends, is that 
ultimate end for those fond of the diffusedness of the world or for the detached 
from the diffusedness of the worald. If the adherants of other sects reply 
rightfully, they would say. The ultimate end is for the detached from the 
diffusedness of the world. 
<P>Friends, views are twofold. The view ‘to be’ and the view ‘not to be’. Those 
recluses and brahmins that cling to the view ‘to be’ are overcome by that view 
are averse to the view ‘not to be’. Those recluses and brahmins that cling to 
the view ‘not to be’ are overcome by that view are averse to the view ‘to be’. 
Recluse or brahmin who does not know the arising, fading, satisfaction, danger, 
and the escape from these two views as it really is , he is with greed, with 
anger, with delusion, with craving, with holdings, not wise, he is rough and 
averse, is attached to the diffusedness of the world . I say, that he is not 
released from birth, decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasaantness, displeasure 
and distress. I say, he is not released from unpleasantness. Recluse or brahmin 
who knows the arising, fading, satisfaction, danger, and the escape from these 
two views as it really is, he is without greed, without anger, without delusion, 
without craving, without holdings, wise, not rough and averse, not fond of the 
diffusedness of the world. I say, he is released from birth, decay, death, 
grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress. I say, he is released 
from unpleasantness. 
<P>Bhikkhus, fourfold are the holdings, What four. Holding to sensuality, 
holding to views, holding to virtues and holding to the self view. Bhikkhus, 
there are certain recluses and brahmins, who acknowledge they know all holdings 
but are unable to explain all holdings as they really are. They explain the 
holding to sensuality, but not the holding to views not the holding to virtues 
and not the holding to the self view. What is the reason: These good recluses 
and brahmins do not know three holdings as they really are. They explain the 
holding to sensuality not the holding to views, not the holding to virtues and 
not the holding to the self view. So these good recluses and brahmins who 
acknowledge they know all holdings do not explain all holdings rightfully. 
Bhikkhus, there are certain recluses and brahmins, who acknowledge they know all 
holdings but are unable to explain all holdings as they really are. They explain 
the holding to sensuality, and the holding to views, not the holding to virtues 
and not the holding to the self view.What is the reason. These good recluses and 
brahmins do not know two holdings as they really are,they explain the holding to 
sensuality and the holding to views, not the holding to virtues and not the 
holding to the self view. So these good recluses and brahmins who acknowledge 
they know all holdings do not explain all holdings rightfully. .Bhikkhus, there 
are certain recluses and brahmins, who acknowledge they know all holdings but 
are unable to explain all holdings as they really are. They explain the holding 
to sensuality the holding to views and the holding to virtues not the holding to 
the self view. What is the reason. These good recluses and brahmins do not know 
one holding as it really is, they explain the holding to sensuality, the holding 
to views, and the holding to virtues not the holding to the self view. So these 
good recluses and brahmins who acknowledge they know all holdlings do not 
explain all holdings rightfully Bhikkhus, in such a dispensation, the faith in 
the Teacher has not reached the highest point I say. The faith in the Teaching 
has not reached the highest point , I say. The completion of virtues has not 
reached the highest point., I say. And that rightful mutual understanding has 
not reached the highest point. What is the reason: Bhikkhus, it happens in a 
teaching not well proclaimed, not well explained, not leading beyond, not 
leading to appeasement, and taught by one not rightfully enlightened. 
<P>Bhikkhus, the Thus Gone One worthy, rightfully enlightened, acknowledges the 
knowledge of all holdings 
<P>and explains all holdings. Explain the holding to sensuality, the holding to 
views, the holding to virtues and the holding to the self view. Bhikkhus, in 
such a dispensation, the faith in the Teacher has reached the highest point. The 
faith in the Teaching has reached the highest point. The completion of virtues 
has reached the highest point. The rightful mutual understanding has reached the 
highest point. What is the reason. Bhikkhus, it happens in a well proclaimed 
teaching, in a well explained teaching, in a teaching leading beyond, in a 
teaching leading to appeasement, and when taught by one rightfully enlightened. 
<P>Bhikkhus, these four holdings, from what do they originate, from what do they 
rise, from what do they come to birth, and with what do they develop. They 
originate from craving, rise from craving, come to birth from craving, and 
develop with craving. Bhikkhus, this craving, from what does it originate, from 
what does it rise, from what does it come to birth, and with what does it 
develop. Craving originates from feelings, rise from feelings, come to birth 
from feelings and develop with feelings. Bhikkhus, these feelings, from what do 
they originate, from what do they rise, from what do they come to birth, and 
with what do they develop. Feelings originate from contact, rise from contact, 
come to birth from contact, and develop with contact.Bhikkhus, this contact from 
what does it originate, from what does it rise, from what does it come to birth, 
and with what does it develop. Contact originates from the six spheres, rises 
from the six spheres, comes to birth from the six spheres and develops with the 
six spheres. Bhikkhus, these six spheres from what do they originate, from what 
do they rise, from what do they come to birth, and with what do they develop. 
The six spheres originate from name and matter, rise from name and matter, come 
to birth from name and matter and develop with name and matter. Bhikkhus, this 
name and matter, from what does it originate, from what does it rise, from what 
does it come to birth and with what does it develop. Name and matter originates 
from consciousness, rises from consciousness, comes to birth from consciousness 
and develops with consciousness. Bhikkhus, this consciousness, from what does it 
originate, from what does it rise, from what does it come to birth, with what 
does it develop. Consciousness originates from determinations, rises from 
determinations, comes to birth from determinations, and develops with 
determinations. Bhikkhus, these determinations, from what do they originate, 
from what do they rise, from what do they come to birth and with what do they 
develop. Determinations originate from ignorance, rise from ignorance, come to 
birth from ignorance and develop with ignorance. Bhikkhus, when ignorance 
dispelled and turned out science arises, he does not hold to sensuality, does 
not hold to views, does not hold to virtues, and does not hold to the self view. 
Not holding is not worried, not worried, he by himself is extinguished: birth is 
destroyed, the holy life is lived, what should be done is done, there is nothing 
more to wish. 
<P>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the 
Blessed One.
