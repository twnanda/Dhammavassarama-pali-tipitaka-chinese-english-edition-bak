Simile of the Cloth.</FONT></I></B></CENTER>
<P>I heard thus. <BR>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered 
by Anaathapindika in Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi.. 
<P>From there the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: O! Bhikkhus, just as an 
impure stained cloth when dyed into whatever colour, blue, yellow, red or 
crimson would take a bad hue and an impure colour because the cloth is impure 
and stained, in the same manner, bhikkhus, when the mind is defiled a bad state 
could be expected. Just as a pure unstained cloth when dyed into whatever 
colour, blue, yellow, red or crimson, it would take a pure colour and a bright 
hue, in the same manner, bhikkhus, when the mind is pure a good state could be 
expected. 
<P>Bhikkhus, what are the minor defillements of the mind. Covetousness is a 
defilement of the mind. Aversion is a defilement of the mind. Anger is a 
defilement of the mind. Illwill is a defilement of the mind. Contempt is a 
defilement of the mind. Mercilessness is a defilement of the mind. Jealousy is a

mind. Haughty talk is a defilement of the mind. Measuring is a defilelment of 
the mind. Conceit is a defilement of the mind. Intoxication is a defilement of 
the mind. Negligence is a defilement of the mind. 
<P>Bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu knowing covetoussness as a defilement of the mind 
dispels it. Knowing aversion as a defilement of the mind dispels it. Knowing 
anger as a defilelment of the mind dispels it. Knowing illwill as a defilement 
of the mind dispels it. Knowing contempt as a defilement of the mind dispels it. 
Knowing mercilessness as a defilement of the mind dispels it. Knowing jealousy 
as a defilement of the mind dispels it. Knowing selfishness as a defilement of 
the mind dispels it. Knowing hipocrisy as a defilement of the mind dispels it. 
Knowing craftiness as a defilement of the mind dispels it. Knowing stuborness as 
a defilement of the mind dispels it. Knowing haughty talk as a defilement of the 
mind dispels it. Knowing measuring as a defilement of the mind dispels it. 
Knowing conceit as a defilement of the mind dispels it. Knowing intoxication as 
a defilement of the mind, dispels it. Knowing negligence as a defilement of the 
mind dispels it. He is endowed with unwavering faith in enlightenment: That 
Blessed One is worthy, rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and 
conduct, well gone, knower of worlds, the incomparable tamer of those to be 
tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed. Is endowed with 
unwavering faith in the Teaching: The Blessed One’s Teaching is well proclaimed, 
here and now, not a matter of time, inviting for inspection, leading beyond, for 
the wise to be realized by themselves..Is endowed with unwavering faith in the 
Community: The disciples of the Blessed One have fallen to the right path, the 
straightforward path, the wise path, and to the path of mutual understanding. 
They are the four pairs of the eight Great Men. the disciples of the Blessed 
One, worthy of offerings, hospitality, gifts and reverential salutation, the 
highest field of merit for the world. . 
<P>When his mind is cleaned, released and established as far as the limit allows 
he knowing I have unwavering faith in enlightenment, gains meanings in the 
Teaching and experiencs the Teaching, and joy arises, to the joyful there’s 
delight.the delighted mind appeases the body. The appeased body feels pleasant. 
Of the pleasant, the mind concentrates. He knowing I have unwavering faith in 
the Teaching, gains meanings in the Teaching and experiences the Teaching, and 
joy arises, to the joyful there’s delight, the delighted mind appeases the body. 
The appeased body feels pleasant. Of the pleasant the mind concentrates. He 
knowing I have unwavering faith in the Community, gains meanings in the Teaching 
and experiences the Teaching, and joy arises, to the joyful there’s delight, the 
delighted mind appeases the body. The appeased body feels pleasant. Of the

<P>As far as the limit goes my mind is cleaned, released, giving up is 
established, by that the Teaching has beccome meaningful and I experience the 
Teaching, and joy arise, to the joyful there’s delight, the delighted mind 
appeases the body. The appeased body feels pleasant. Of the pleasant, the mind 
concentrates. 
<P>O! Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu with such virtues, thoughts and wisdom were to 
partake of morsel food cooked out of fine rice with dark seeds picked, together 
with various soups and curries, there would not be any danger to him. Just as 
the impure stained cloth is cleaned with pure clean water, Just as pure gold 
comes out of the furnace. Even so bhikkhus, the bhikkhu with such virtues, 
thoughts and wisdom were to partake of morsel food cooked out of fine rice with 
dark seeds picked, together with various soups and curries, there would not be 
any danger to him. 
<P>He abides pervading one direction with a mind of loving kindness, so too the 
second, third, fourth, above, below, across, always, for all purposes, he 
pervades the whole world with loving kindness, with a developed limitless mind 
without enmity and anger. He abides pervading one direction with a compassionate 
mind, so too the second, third, fourth, above, below, across, always, for all 
purposes, he pervades the whole world with compassion, with a developed, 
limitless mind without enmity and anger. He abides pervading one direction with 
intrinsic joy, so too the second, third, fourth, above, below, across, always, 
for all purposes, he pervades the whole world with intrinsic joy, with a 
developed limitless mind without enmity and anger.. He abides pervading one 
direction with equanimity, so too the second, third, fourth, above, below, 
across, always, for all purposes, he pervades the whole world with a developed 
and limitless mind without enmity and anger. 
<P>He knows, in this are unexalted and exalted states, there is a noble escape 
from this pereceptive sphere. When he knows and sees that, his mind seeks 
release from sensual desires, from desires to be, and from desires through 
ignorance. Knowledge arises, am released, birth is destroyed, the holy life is 
lived to the end, what should be done is done, there is nothing more to wish. 
Bhikkhus, to this is called internal cleaning. 
<P>At that time the brahmin Sundarikabhaaradvaaja was sitting near the Blessed 
One, and asked does good Gotama go to Baahuka river to bathe. Brahmin, what is 
river Baahuka, and what will it do. The brahmin said Good Gotama, many people 
consider river Baahuka is the release, River Baahuka is meritorious. 
<P>Many people wash off their demeritorious actions in river Baahuka. Then the 
Blessed One addressed the brahmin Sundarikabhaaradvaaja in verses 
<P>River Baahuka with many precious stones, rivers Gayaa, Sundarikaa, 
<P>And even Sarassatii, Payaaga, and Baahumathie 
<P>Fools may be for ever submerged in these but their dark actions will not be 
washed 
<P>How could Sundarikaa, Payaaga, and Baahuka help angry beings gone wrong 
<P>Their evil actions will not be washed off, 
<P>The pure are always pure, to them every day is a sabbath day 
<P>The pure with pure actions are always bound in virtues 
<P>Brahmin, bathe here itself, develop loving kindness to all beings 
<P>If you do not tell lies, do not hurt living things 
<P>Not take that not given, with faith become not selfish 
<P>What could be done, gone to Gayaa, may drink water there. 
<P>When this was said the brahmin Sundarikabhaaradvaaja said thus to the Blessed 
One: Now I know good Gotama, It seems as though something over turned is 
re-installed, something covered is made manifest, It seems as though the path is 
told to someone who has lost his way. It seems as though a lamp is lighted for 
the darkness, for those who have eyes to see forms. In various ways the Teaching 
is explained by good Gotama.Now I take refuge in good Gotama, in the Teaching 
and the Community. May I gain the going forth and the higher ordination. The 
brahmin Sundarikabhaaradvaaja obtained the going forth and the higher 
ordination. Soon after the higher ordination, venerable Bhaaradvaaja withdrawn 
from the crowd, alone and secluded abode diligent for dispelling. Before long, 
for whatever purpose sons of clansmen go forth from the household, and lead the 
holy life, that highest end of the holy life by himself knowing realizeing 
abode,.here and now, He knew birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived, what 
should be done is done,there is nothing more to wish. Venerable Bhaaradvaaja 
became one of the noble ones.
