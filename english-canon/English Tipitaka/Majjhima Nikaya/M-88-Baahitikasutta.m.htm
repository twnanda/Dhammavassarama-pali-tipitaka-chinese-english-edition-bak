<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>I heard thus.At one 
time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika in Jeta’s 
grove in Saavatthi. Venerable Aananda put on robes in the morning, taking bowl 
and robes entered Saavatthi for alms. After the alms round, when the meal was 
over, approached the palace of Migaara’s mother to spend the day. At that time 
king Pasenadi of Kosala having ascended the elephant Ekapundariika was going 
through Saavatthi during the day. King Pasenadi of Kosala saw venerable Aananda 
coming in the distance and asked the chief minister Siriwadda, ‘Siriwadda, is 
that venerable Aananda?’ ‘Great king, it is venerable Aananda.’ Then king 
Pasenadi of Kosala called a certain man, and said. ‘Good man approach venerable 
Aananda, worship him for my sake, with your head at his feet and tell him. 
Venerable sir, King Pasenadi of Kosala worships you with his head at your feet 
and said. If venerable Aananda has no urgent work to do, would he wait a moment 
for king Pasenadi of Kosala, out of compassion.’ He agreed, approached venerable 
Aananda, worshipped, stood on a side and said, ’venerable sir king Pasenadi of 
Kosala worships you, with his head at your feet and says. If venerable Aananda 
has no urgent work, could he wait a moment for king Pasenadi of Kosala out of 
compassion.’ Venerable Aananda agreed silently. The king went on the elephant’s 
back as far as he could go and descending from the elephant, approached 
venerable Aananda on foot. He worshipped venerable Aananda and stood on a side 
and said. ‘If venerable Aananda has no urgent work, could he approach the bank 
of river Acirawathie, out of compassion. Venerable Aananda accepted it silently, 
approached the bank of river Acirawathie and sat on the prepared seat. The king 
went on the elephant’s back as far as he could go, descending from the elephant, 
approached venerable Aananda on foot, worshipped him and stood on a side. Then 
he said. ‘May venerable Aananda, sit on the elephant rug.’<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Useless, great king, I’m seated, you sit on 
it.’ King Pasenadi of Kosala sat on the prepared seat and said. ‘Venerable 
Aananda, does the Blessed One practise bodily behaviour that is hostile to 
recluses Brahmins and the wise?’ ‘No, great king the Blessed One does not 
practise any bodily behaviour that is hostile to recluses, brahmins and the 
wise. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Sir Aananda, does the 
Blessed One, practise verbal behaviour that is hostile to recluses, brahmins and 
the wise? Does the Blessed One practise mental behaviour that is hostile to 
recluses, brahmins and the wise?’ ‘No, great king the Blessed One does not 
practise any verbal… any mental behaviour that is hostile to recluses and 
brahmins and the wise.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Wonderful and 
surprising venerable sir, this question we could not ask and get an<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>explained, now venerable Aananda has explained 
it to me. Venerable sir, fools who do not think and fathom their words, praise 
or blame others. I do not believe those words. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Sir Aananda, what kind 
of bodily behaviour is hostile to recluses, Brahmins and the wise?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Great king bodily 
behaviour that is demerit.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable sir, what

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Wonderful and 
surprising, I’m pleased with these words of venerable Aananda. I’m so pleased, I 
would offer my jewel of an elephant to venerable Aananda, or my jewel of a 
horse, or even a splendid village, we know that they are not suitable. This warm 
cloth was sent by king<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Ajaatasattu, of 
Magadha. in a case of reeds, it’s sixteen measures by length and eight measures

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Useless, great king, 
my three robes are complete.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable sir, we

flowing flooding the banks. In like manner, venerable Aananda will make his

the co-associates in the holy life, I think. May venerable Aananda accept this 
warm cloth.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Venerable Aananda 
accepted the warm cloth. Then king Pasenadi of Kosala said to venerable Aananda. 
‘Venerable sir, we have to go now, there’s much work to be done.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Great king do, as you 
think fit.’ King Pasenadi<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>of<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Kosala got up from his seat, worshipped and 
circumambulated venerable Aananda and went away. Soon after the king had gone, 
venerable Aananda approached and worshipped the Blessed One, and sat on a side. 
Venerable Aananda informed the Blessed One all the conversation that occurred 
between the king and himself and offered the warm cloth to the Blessed One.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then the Blessed One 
addressed the bhikkhus. ‘Bhikkhus, it is rare and great gain for king Pasenadi 
of Kosala, that he approaches and associates venerable Aananda.’ The bhikkhus 
were pleased with the words of the Blessed One.<SPAN
