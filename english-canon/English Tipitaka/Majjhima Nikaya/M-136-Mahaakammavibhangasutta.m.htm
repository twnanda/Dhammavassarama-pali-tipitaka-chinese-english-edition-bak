Aananda: ‘Aananda, do you see the side track of this foolish man Udaayi? From 
the beginning I knew that foolish Udaayi would intrude unwisely. Aananda, the 
wandering ascetic Potaliyaputta had earlier asked about the three feelings. If 
this foolish man Samiddhi had explained to the wandering ascetic thus. Friend 
Potaliyaputta, doing intentional actions with pleasant feelings, by body, speech 
and mind, he feels pleasant. Doing intentional actions with unpleasant feelings, 
by body, speech and mind, he feels unpleasant. Doing intentional actions with 
neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings, by body, speech and mind, he feels 
neither unpleasant nor pleasant. If he had explained it thus, he would have 
explained it correctly. Yet Aananda, how are these foolish wandering ascetics of 
other sects to understand the Thus Gone One’s detailed classification of 
actions. If you would listen to it I will explain.’<O:P></O:P></SPAN>

1. Thus Aananda, there is impossible action, impossible to shine forth,<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>there is impossible action, possible to shine 
forth,<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>there is possible action, possible 
to shine forth and<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>there is possible

bhabba.m<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>c’eva bhabbaabhaasa.m; atthi 
kamma.m bhabba.m abhabbaabhaasa.m ti’ The most important point in the Detailed 
Classification of actions is, that intention matters everything to one’s 
actions, and much of the results of actions are experienced here and now, or in 
the next birth or in a subsequent birth<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Since intention is so very important, we should 
know that mere intending would not carry us across.eg We may aspire extinction, 
but without that effort and endeavour and without turning our foot steps towards 
it, it is not possible. These are impossible actions, impossible to shine forth. 
There are times when these impossible actions shine forth, when the necessary 
effort and endeavour are put into it. Then there are actions that begin at the 
six doors of mental contact, which we could.handle efficiently and arrive at the 
results here and now. Thus there are possible actions, possible to shine forth. 
These same are sometimes unable to shine forth, as it happened to venerable 
Angulimaala. He did not experience the results of his evil actions, as he over 
rode them, and extinguished.&nbsp;<O:P></O:P></SPAN>
