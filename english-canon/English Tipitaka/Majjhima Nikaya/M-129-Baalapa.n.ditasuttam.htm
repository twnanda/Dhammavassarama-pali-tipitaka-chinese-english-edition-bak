is a fool, an unworthy one. Since the fool thinks, speaks and acts foolishly, 
the wise know he is a fool. The fool experiences unpleasantness and displeasure 
here and now in three ways. Bhikkhus, if the fool is with a crowd, in the street 
corner or a junction, and if the people there were talking some current topic, 
and if he destroyed living things, took the not given, misbehaved sexually, told 
lies and took intoxicating drinks, it occurs to him. These things the people are

flesh from the body, driving a spike from ear to ear, beating to make the body 
like straw, immersing in the boiling oil, giving to the dogs to be eaten, 
raising on a spike alive until death, and cutting the neck with the sword. 
Bhikkhus, then it occurs to the fool, for the reason of doing evil this robber, 
evil doer is punished. If the king gets hold of me, I too will be subjected<SPAN

chair, on the bed or on a cover on the floor, he thinks of his misbehaviours by 
body, speech and mind. At such times they press on him heavily. Like the shadow 
of a huge mountain peak, would fall on the earth heavily in the evening..In the

it occurs to the fool. I did not do good and merit. Didn’t dispel the fear of 
the frightened, did evil bloody faults and later I will reap their results. He 
grieves, laments, beats his breast and comes to bewilderment of mind. Bhikkhus,
