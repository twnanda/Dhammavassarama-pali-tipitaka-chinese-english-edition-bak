Teaching.</B></CENTER>
<P>. 
<P>I heard thus. 
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika 
in Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from there. 
" Bhikkhus, be the inheriters of my Teaching and not the inheriters of my 
material. There’s my compassion towards you. Whatever it is, be the inheriters 
of my Teaching not the inheriters of my material. Bhikkhus, should you become 
the inheriters of my material not the inheriters of my Teaching by that you 
become the examples: The disciples of a Teacher abiding as inheriters of 
material and not as inheriters of the Teaching. By that I too become the Teacher 
who has inherited the disciples with my material and not my Teaching. Bhikkhus, 
be the inheriters of my Teaching and not the inheriters of my material, by that 
you become the example; The disciples of the Teacher abiding as inheriters of 
the Teach ing not as inheriters of material, by that I too become an example As 
the Teacher abiding inheriting the disciples with the Teaching and not 
inheriting material. Therefore bhikkhus abide as inheriters of the Teaching and 
not as inheriters of material. There is my compassion 
<P>towards you. Whatever it is be the inheriters of my Teaching and not the 
inheriters of my material. 
<P>Here, bhikkhus, I have partaken of my meal, satiated not desiring any more, 
and there is some morsel food left over to be thrown away. Then two bhikkhus 
overcome by hunger and weakness come along and I tell them: Bhikkhus, I have 
partaken of my meal, is satiated and do not desire any more, there is some 
morsel food left over to be thrown away, If you desire, partake of it, if you do 
not partake it I will throw it to some place where there is no green, or I will 
put it in some water where there are no living things. To one of those 
<P>bhikkhus, it occurs thus; The Blessed One has partaken of his meal, is 
satiated and does not desire any more of it. There is some morsel food left over 
to be thrown away. If we do not partake of it, he will throw it to some place 
where there is no green, or will put it in some water where there is no life. 
Yet it is told by the Blessed One this: Bhikkhus, be the heirs of my Teaching 
and not the heirs of my material. Morsel food is one of the material, What if I 
spend this day and night bearing up this hunger and discomfort. He not partaking 
that food spends that night and day bearing up that hunger and discomfort. To 
the other bhikkhu it occurs thus: The Blessed One has partaken of his meal, is 
satiated and does not desire any more of it. There is some morsel food left over 
to be thrown away. If we do not partake of it the Blessed One will throw it to a 
place where there is no green or will put it in some water where there are no 
living things- What if I partake of that morsel food and put an end to my hunger 
and discomfort and spend the night and day. So he partakes of that morsel food 
puts an end to his hunger and discomfort and spends the night and day. Bhikkhus, 
whoever the bhikkhu who partook of the morsel food, overcame the hunger and 
discomfort and spent the night and day, yet the earlier bhikkhu is more 
reverential and praiseworthy. What is the reason. Because it conduces to that 
bhikkhu’s few desires,satisfaction, purity, the nature of being suppoted easily, 
and for arousing of effort. Therefore, be the heirs of my Teaching and not the 
heirs of my material.: Bhikkkus, there is my compasssion to you. Any way my 
disciples should be heirs of the Teaching and not the heirs of my material. The 
Blessed One said that and went into the monastery. 
<P>Soon after the Blessed One left, venerable Saariputta addressed the 
bhikkhus:Friends, of a Teacher abiding in seclusion, how do the disciples not 
train in that seclusion. And of a Teacher abiding in seclusion how do the 
disciples train in that same seclusion. Friend, Saariputta, we came from afar to 
learn the meaning of these words from venerable Saariputta, good that it occurs 
to venerable Saariputta, and hearing it from you, the bhikkhus will bear it in 
mind. Then listen friends, bhikkhus: attend carefully. And venerable Saariputta 
said: 
<P>Here, friends, of a Teacher abiding in seclusion, the disciples do not train 
in that seclusion. The things the Teacher said dispel, they would not dispel, 
live in abundance and lethargy, missing the main aim, do not 
<P>yoke themselves to seclusion. For this the elders have to be blamed for three 
things. Of a Teacher abiding in seclusion, the disciples do not train in that 
seclusion. This is the first blame that comes on the elders. 
<P>The things that the Teacher said dispel, they would not dispel. This is the 
second blame that comes on the elders. Living in abundance and lethargy, they 
miss the main aim and do not yoke themselves to seclusion. This is the third 
blame that comes on the elders. The elders have to be blamed for these three 
things. 
<P>The middling bhikkhus, too have to be blamad for these three things. The 
novice bhikkhus too have to be blamed for these three things.Friends, it is in 
this manner, that of a Teacher abiding in seclusion, the disciples do not train 
in that seclusion. 
<P>Friends, of a Teacher abiding in seclusion how do the disciples train in that 
seclusion. Of a Teacher abiding in seclusion, the disciples train in that 
seclusion.The things the Teacher says dispel, they dispel.Not living in 
abundance and lethargy, they do not miss the main aim and yoke themselves to 
seclusion. For this the elders are to be praised for three things. Of a Teacher 
abiding in seclusion the disciples train in that seclusion This is the first 
praise that come to the elders. The things the Teacher said dispel, that they 
dispel. This is the second praise that come to the elders. Not living in 
abundance and lethargy, they do not miss the main aim and yoke themselves to 
seclusion. This is the third praise that come to the elders. The elders are 
praised for these three things. The middling bhikkhus too have to be praised for 
these three. The novice bhikkhus too have to be praised for these three. 
Friends, it is in this manner, that of a Teacher abiding in seclusion, the 
disciples train in that seclusion. . . 
<P>There friends, greed is an evil, anger is an evil. To dispel greed and anger, 
there is the middle path which conduces to wisdom, knowledge enlightenment and 
extinction. It is this same noble eightfold path such as right view, right 
thoughts, right speech, right actions, right livelihood, right effort, right 
mindfulness, and right concentration. Friends, this is the middle path which 
conduces to wisdom, knowledge, enlightenment and extinction. There friends, 
anger is an evil, ill will is an evil, hypocrisy is an evil, mercilessness is an 
evil, envy is an evil, selfishness is an evil, deceit is an evil, craftiness is 
an evil, obstinacy is an evil, haughty talk is an evil, measuring is an evil, 
conceit is an evil, intoxication is an evil, negligence is an evil, To dispel 
intoxication and negligence, there is the middle path which conduces to wisdom, 
knowledge, enlightenment and extinction. It is this same noble eightfold path 
such as right view, right thoughts, right speech, right actions, right 
livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right concentration.. Venerable 
Saariputta said those words and the bhikkhus delighted in his words.
