<P><B>10 Establishing Mindfulness.</B></CENTER>
<P>I heard thus. 
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the hamlet named Kammaassadhamma in the 
Kuru country. From there the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus " Bhikkhus, 
there is only one way for the purification of beings , for ending grief and 
lament,to overcome unpleasantness and displeasure and to realize extinction and 
that is this fourfold establishment of mindfulness. What four: Abiding 
reflecting the body in the body(1), mindful and aware to dispel covetousness and 
displeasure for the world. Abiding reflecting the feeling in feelings,(2) 
mindful and aware to dispel covetousness and displeasure for the world. Abiding 
reflecting the mental state in the mind (3) mindful and aware to dispel 
covetousness and displeasure for the world. Abiding reflecting the thought 
thoughts, mindful and aware, to dispel covetousness and displeasure for the 
world.. . 
<P>Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu abide reflecting the body in the body. Here 
the bhikkhu gone to the forest,to the root of a tree, or to an empty house sits 
cross legged , the body erect and mindfulness established in front.He mindfully 
breathes in and out. Breathing in long knows I breathe in long. Breathing out 
long knows I breathe out long. Breathing in short knows I breathe in short. 
Breathing out short knows I breathe out short. He trains, feeling the whole body 
I breathe in. Feeling the whole body I breathe out 
<P>He trains, calming the bodily determination I breathe in, calming the bodily 
determination I breathe out. Just as a clever turner or his apprentice, pulling 
the bellows long knows, I pull them long, and pulling the bellows short knows I 
pull them short. In the same manner, breathing in long, knows I breathe in long, 
breathing out long, knows I breathe out long. Breathing in short knows I breathe 
in short, and breathing out short knows I breathe out short. He trains, calming 
the bodily determination I breathe in, calming the bodily determination I 
breathe out. Thus he abides reflecting the body in the body internally, or he 
abides reflecting the body in the body exterrnally. Or he abides reflecting the 
body in the body internally and externally. Or he abides reflecting the arising 
of thoughts in the body. Or he abides reflecting the fading of thoughts in the 
body. Or he abides reflecting the arising and fading of thoughts in the body, Or 
he establishes mindfulness, there is a body, and abides not supported on 
anything in the world.Thus too the bhikkhu abides reflecting the body in the 
body. 
<P>Again, the bhikkhu, going knows, I go, standing knows I stand, Sitting knows 
I sit, lying knows I lie. What and whatever posture the body maintains, that and 
that he knows..Thus he abides reflecting the body in the body internally, or he 
abides reflecting the body in the body externally. Or he abides reflecting the 
body in the body internally and externally. Or he abides reflecting the arising 
of thoughts in the body. Or he abides reflecting the fading of thoughts in the 
body. Or he abides reflecting the arising and fading of thoughts in the body. Or 
he establishes mindfulness, there is a body, and abides not supported on 
anything in the world. Thus too the bhikkhu abides reflecting the body in the 
body. 
<P>Again the bhikkhu becomes aware, going forward or turning back, looking on, 
or looking about, bending or stretching, Becomes aware bearing the three robes 
and bowl, Becomes aware enjoying, drinking, eating or tasting. Becomes aware 
going, standing, sitting, lying, speaking, or keeping silence. Thus he abides 
reflecting the body in the body internally. Or he abides reflecting the body in 
the body externally. Or he abides reflecting the body in the body internally and 
externally. Or he abides reflecting the arising of thoughts in the body. Or he 
abides reflecting the fading of thoughts in the body. Or he abides reflecting 
the arising and fading of thoughts in the body. Or he establishes mindfulness 
there is a body, abides not supported on anything in the world. Thus too the 
bhikkhu abides reflecting the body in the body. 
<P>Again, the bhikkhu abides reflecting this body up from the sole, down from 
the hair on the top and surrounded by the skin as full of various impurities. 
There are in this body, hair of the head and body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, 
veins, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, lower 
intestines, bowels, stomach, excreta, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, 
tears, eye secretions, saliva, snot, oil of joints, urine, Just like a bag of 
provisions open on both sides, is filled up with various grains such as rice, 
paddy, green grams, beans, sesame, fine rice. A man who could see would pull it 
out and reflect, this is rice, this paddy, this green grams, this beans, this 
sesame, and this is fine rice. In the same manner the bhikkhu abides reflecting 
this body, up from the sole, down from the hair on the top and surrounded by the 
skin as full of various impurities. There are in this body, hair of the head and 
body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, veins, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, 
liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, lower intestines, bowels, stomach, excreta, bile, 
phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, eye secretions, saliva, snot, oil of 
joints, urine. Thus he abides reflecting the body in the body internally. Or he 
abides reflecting the body in the body externally. Or he abides reflecting the 
body in the body internally and externally. Or he abides reflecting thoughts 
that arise in the body. Or he abides reflecting thoughts that fade in the body. 
Or he abides reflecting the arising and fading of thoughts in the body. Or he 
establishes mindfulness there is a body and abides not supported on anything in 
the world. Thus too the bhikkhu abides reflecting the body in the body. 
<P>Again the bhikkhu abides reflecting this body as elements in whatever posture 
it is. There are in this body, the elements, earth, water, fire and air.Just as 
a clever butcher or his apprentice would be seated in a hut at the four cross 
roads with a killed cow dissecting it into small bits. In the same manner, in 
this body, there are the elements earth, water, fire and air. Thus he abides 
reflecting the body in the body internally. Or he abides reflecting the body in 
the body externally. Or he abides reflecting the body in the body internally and 
externally. Or he abides reflecting the arising of thoughts in the body. Or he 
abides reflecting the fading of thoughts in the body. Or he abides reflecting 
the arising and fading of thoughts in the body. Or he establishes mindfulness, 
there is a body and abides not supported on anything in the world. Thus too the 
bhikkhu abides reflecting the body in the body. 
<P>Again, the bhikkhu reflects this body as a dead body thrown in the charnel 
ground, either after one day, two days or three days, bloated, turned blue and 
festering. This body too is subject to that same, has not gone beyond it. Thus 
he abides reflecting the body in the body internally. Or he abides reflecting 
the body in the body externally. Or he abides reflecting the body in the body 
internally and externally. Or he abides reflecting thearising of thoughts in the 
body, Or he abides reflecting the fading of thoughts in the body. Or he abides 
reflecting the arising and fading of thoughts in the body, Or he establishes 
mindfulness, there is a body, and abides not supported on anything in the world. 
Thus too the bhikkhu abides reflecting the body in the body. 
<P>Again, the bhikkhu abides reflecting this body as a dead body thrown in the

body in the body externally. Or he abides reflecting the body in the body 
internally and externally. Or he abides reflecting the arising of thoughts in 
the body. Or he abides reflecting the fading of thoughts in the body. Or he 
abides reflecting the arising and fading of thoughts in the body. Or he 
establishes mindfulness, there is a body, and abides not supported on anything 
in the world. Thus too the bhikkhu abides reflecting the body in the body. 
<P>Again, the bhikkhu abides reflecting this body as a corpse thrown in the 
charnel ground, a skeleton with flesh and blood and connecting veins. - A 
skeleton without flesh, smeared with blood and connected with veins. - A 
skeleton flesh and blood gone, connected by veins. A disconnected skeleton 
thrown about every where. In one place a hand bone, in another a foot bone, in 
another a knee bone, in another a thigh bone, in another a hip bone, in another

<P>1, Abiding reflecting the body in the body.’<I>kaaye kaayaanupassii 
viharati’</I> ‘In the body’ is the material body of the four primary elements, 
‘the body’ consists of the six internal and external spheres, It is this six 
internal and external spheres that help the body to co-exist. These together 
work as a living person. 
<P>2. Abiding reflecting the feeling in feelings. ‘<I>Vedanaasu vedanaanupassii 
viharati</I>’ In feelings. These are the for ever present feelings that arise 
with every sight, sound, smell, taste, touch and idea. This is a non-stop 
process. On account of some of these feelings certain other feelings arise, eg. 
When one is hurt, or when one is pleased. There arises the feeling in feelings. 
. 
<P>3. Abiding reflecting the mental states in the mind.’<I>citte cittaanupassii 
viharati</I>’ The various mental states are the mind with anger, without anger 
etcetra. So we have to reflect how they rise, fade, and fade for good. 
<P>4. Abiding reflecting thoughts in the thought ‘<I>dhamme dhammaanupassii 
viharati</I>’ With the arising of a thought a train of thoughts follow, so 
thoughts in the thought are thoughts and thought processes. <BR>&nbsp;
