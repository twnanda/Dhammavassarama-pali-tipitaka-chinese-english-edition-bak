<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>I heard thus.At one 
time the Blessed One was abiding in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika 
in<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi. At that time 
about five hundred Brahmins of various states had come to Saavatthi for some 
business and were living in Saavatthi. It occurred to those Brahmins. This 
recluse Gotama declares the purity of the four castes. Who is able to dispute 
with the recluse Gotama on these words? At that time a young man named 
Assalaayana lived in Saavatthi. He was young, shaven headed, sixteen years of 
age, had learned the three Vedas, knew, the rites and rituals as officiating 
priest, the phonology and etymology of words and the marks of a Great Man. Then 
it occurred to those Brahmins. This young man Assalaayana lives in Saavatthi, is 
young, shaven headed, sixteen years of age, is learned in the three Vedas, knows 
the rites and rituals as officiating priest. He knows the phonology and 
etymology of words and the marks of a Great Man. It is possible for him to 
dispute with the recluse Gotama, on these words. Then those Brahmins approached 
the young man Assalaayana and said. ‘Good Assalaayana, the recluse Gotama 
declares the purity of the four castes. Come, good Assalaayana, dispute with the 
recluse Gotama on these words. Then the young man Assalaayana said thus to those 
Brahmins. ‘The recluse Gotama speaks the truth, it is difficult to dispute with 
those speaking the truth. It is not possible that I could dispute this with 
him.’ For the second time the Brahmins entreated the young man Assalaayana, 
saying he was a wandering ascetic. He refused. For the third time the Brahmins 
entreated and the young man Assalaayana, saying he should not accept uncontested 
defeat. 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>When this was said, 
the young man Assalaayana said. ’Indeed I will not win, the good recluse Gotama, 
tells the truth, it is difficult to dispute with those speaking the truth. It is 
not possible that I could dispute this with him. Yet I will go to satisfy you 
good ones.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then the young man 
Assalaayana, together with a large gathering of Brahmins approached the Blessed 
One, exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side. He said to the Blessed 
One.’Good Gotama, Brahmins say, Brahmins are from the highest caste, the others 
are low. Brahmins are pure, the others impure. Brahmins become pure, the others 
do not. Brahmins are the legitimate sons of Brahmaa, born of his mouth, born of 
him, with his sign and heritage. What has good Gotama to say about this?’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Assalaayana, among 
Brahmins I see a woman menstruating, bearing a womb, giving birth and giving 
suck. Born from a womb, do they say, Brahmins are from the highest caste, the 
others are low. Brahmins are pure, the others impure. Brahmins become pure, the 
others do not. Brahmins are the legitimate sons of Brahmaa, born of his mouth,

in huts made of leaves. When they were conversing this evil view arose to them. 
Brahmins are of high caste, all other castes are low..Brahmins are pure, the 
others impure. Brahmins become pure, the others do not. Brahmins are the 
legitimate sons of Brahmaa, born of his mouth, born of him, with his sign and

in brown clothes, dressed in a hardy pair of sandles, taking a golden pole, 
appeared in front of the huts of leaves. There, walking up and down, said. 
‘Where have these Brahmin sages gone? Where have these Brahmin sages gone?’ Then 
it occurred to the Brahmin sages. ‘Why is it said, where have these brahmin 
sages gone?’ when the seven Brahmin sages are walking mindfully like bulls tied 
to a threshing pole. They thought we will curse him and cursed ‘Outcaste, go to 
ashes’ When the sages cursed him, the heavenly sage Asita became more and more 
attractive and pleasant to look at. Then it occurred to the seven Brahmin sages, 
our austerities are useless, our holy life is fruitless. Earlier when we cursed, 
‘Outcaste, go to ashes’ at once it became ashes, here he becomes more and more 
attractive and pleasant to look at.</SPAN>
