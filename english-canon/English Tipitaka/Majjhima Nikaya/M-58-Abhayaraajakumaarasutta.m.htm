<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I heard thus.At One time the 
Blessed One was living in the squirrels’ sanctuary in the bamboo grove in 
Rajagaha. Then the king’s son Abhaya approached Niganthanataputta worshipped and 
sat on a side. Niganthanataputta said to the king’s son: ‘“Come! Prince, arouse 
a dispute with the recluse Gotama. When you argue with a person like the recluse 
Gotama, so powerful and so majestic, your fame will spread.” “Venerable sir, how 
could I arouse a dispute with the recluse Gotama, so powerful and so majestic?” 
“Come prince, approach the recluse Gotama and ask. Venerable sir, does the Thus 
Gone One say, such words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others?” When 
asked thus if, the recluse Gotama replies. “Yes, prince, the Thus Gone One, says 
words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others.” Then you should say. 
“Venerable sir, what is the difference between you and the ordinary one? The 
ordinary one says words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others.” If he 
says, “Prince, the Thus Gone One does not say words that are disagreeable and 
distasteful to others.” Then you should say. “Venerable sir, why did you say 
these words to Devadadtta? Devadatta is in loss, in hell in much difficulty, 
till the end of the world cycle? On account of those words Devadatta was 
displeased.” When this forked question, is asked, he would not be able to 
swallow it or spit it out. A man with an iron ring stuck in the throat would not 
be able to swallow or spit it out. In the same manner when this forked question 
is asked, he would not be able to swallow it or spit it out.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Prince Abhaya agreed with the words of 
Niganthanataputta, got up from his seat, worshipped, circumambulated 
Niganthanataputta and approached the Blessed One. Worshipping the Blessed One he 
sat on a side. The prince considered the time, and thought it is not the proper 
time to arouse a dispute with the Blessed One. He thought, I will invite the 
Blessed One for tomorrow’s meal and arouse the dispute at home. He said. ‘May 
the Blessed One, accept tomorrow’s meal with three others.’ The Blessed One 
accepted in silence and the prince knowing that the Blessed One had accepted the 
invitation, got up from his seat worshipped, circumambulated the Blessed One and 
went away. The Blessed One at the end of that night, putting on robes in the 
morning, taking bowl and robes approached the dwelling of the prince, and sat on 
the prepared seat. Prince Abhaya with his own hands served the nourishing 
eatables and drinks, and after the meal was over, took a low seat and sat on a 
side 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Prince Abhaya then, said to the Blessed. 
‘One.Venerable sir, does the Thus Gone One say words that are disagreeable and 
distasteful to others?’ ‘Prince, in certain respects I do not’.’Venerable sir we 
heard this from the nigantas’. ‘Prince, why do you say, we heard this from the 
nigantas?’ ‘Here venerable sir, I approached Niganthanaataputta worshipped him 
and sat on a side. Then Niganthanaataputta said to me. Come prince, approach the 
recluse Gotama and ask. Venerable sir, does the Thus Gone One say, words that 
are disagreeable and distasteful to others? When asked thus if the recluse 
Gotama replies. The Thus Gone One says words that are disagreeable and 
distasteful to others. Then you say. If that is so venerable sir, what is the 
difference between you and the ordinary one? The ordinary one says words that 
are disagreeable and distasteful to others. If he says, Prince, the Thus Gone 
One does not say words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others. Ask him, 
venerable sir, why did you say these words to Devadatta? Devadatta is in loss, 
in hell, in much difficulty till the end of the world cycle. On account of those 
words Devadatta was displeased. When this forked question is asked, he would not 
be able to swallow it or spit it out. Like a man with an iron ring stuck in the 
throat would not be able to swallow or spit it out. In the same manner when this 
forked question is asked, he would not be able to swallow it or spit it out’. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>At that time a baby boy, a toddler was seated 
on the lap of prince Abhaya, the Blessed One said.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Prince, on account of some negligence of yours 
or the nurse, if this baby swallows a piece of stick or a stone, what would you 
do?’ ‘Venerable sir, I will pull it out. If I could not take it out quickly, 
taking hold of the head with the left hand, would pull it out with the finger of 
the right hand, even while blood is spilt. What is the reason? Venerable sir, 
there is my compassion for the baby’. ‘Prince, in the same manner, when the Thus 
Gone One knows that words are not true, not conductive to good, and are 
disagreeable and distasteful to others, the Thus Gone One does not say those 
words. When the Thus Gone One knows that words are not<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>true, not conductive to good, disagreeable and 
distasteful to others, the Thus Gone One does not say those words. When the Thus 
Gone One knows that the words are true, are conductive to good, disagreeable and 
distasteful to others, the Thus Gone One waits for the right time to explain 
those words. When the Thus Gone one knows that the words are true, conductive to 
good, agreeable and tasteful to others, the Thus Gone One does not say those 
words. When the Thus Gone One knows that the words are true, not conductive to 
good, agreeable and tasteful to others, the Thus one does not say those words. 
When the Thus Gone One knows that the words are true<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>conductive to good, agreeable and tasteful to 
others the Thus Gone One waits for the right time to explain those words. What 
is the reason: Prince there is compassion for beings in the Thus Gone One’. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Venerable sir, wise, warriors, or brahmins, or 
householders, or recluses concoct a question, approach the Thus Gone One and 
question him. Venerable sir, does the Blessed One, know before hand, they would 
approach me and ask these questions? Does it occur to the Thus Gone One, when 
asked thus I will reply thus? Or does the reply at that moment occur to the Thus 
Gone One?’ ‘Then prince, I will ask a question from you on this, you may reply, 
as it pleases you. Prince, are you clever about the large and small parts of a 
chariot?’ ‘Yes, venerable sir, I’m clever in the large and small parts of a 
chariot. Prince, if someone approaches you and asks, about the large and small 
parts of the chariot, would you before hand know these people will approach me 
and ask about these parts of the chariot, and when asked this and other thing I 
will reply thus and thus?’ ‘Venerable sir, I’m a charioteer and I’m clever in 
the large and small parts of the chariot. When asked the reply occurs to me that 
moment.’ ‘Prince, in the same manner, these wise, warriors, brahmins, 
householders, and recluses concoct a question and approach the Thus Gone One, 
and question him. The answer occurs to the Thus Gone One instantly. What is the 
reason?: The element of the Teaching is thoroughly known to the Thus Gone One. 
So the reply to the question occurs to the Thus Gone One that moment.’ 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>When this was said, prince Abhaya said thus to 
the Blessed One. ‘Now I understand it, venerable sir. It is as though something 
over turned is reinstated. Something covered is made manifest. As though the 
path was told to someone who had lost his way. It is like an oil lamp lighted in 
the dark, for those who have sight to see forms. In various ways the Blessed One 
has explained the Teaching. Now I take refuge in the Blessed One, in the 
Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. May I be remembered as a lay disciple 
who has taken refuge from today until life lasts.’<SPAN
