<P class=MsoBodyText>I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One was living in the 
squirrels’ sanctuary in the bamboo grove in Rajagaha. Then the wandering ascetic 
Vacchagotta approached the Blessed One, exchanged friendly greetings and sat on 
a side and said, to the Blessed One. ‘It’s a long time since, we could have a 
conversation with good Gotama. We like to know merit and demerit in short.’ 
‘Vaccha, I will tell you merit and demerit in short and in detail as well. Now 
listen to it in short, I will tell you’. The wandering ascetic Vacchagotta 
agreed and the Blessed One said thus: 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Vaccha, greed is 
demerit, non-greed is merit. Anger is demerit and non-anger is merit. Delusion 
is demerit and non-delusion is merit. Vaccha these three are demerit, and the 
other three are merit. Vaccha, destroying life is demerit, abstaining from 
destroying life is merit. Taking what is not given is demerit, abstaining from 
taking what is not given is merit. Misbehaviour in sexuality is demerit, 
abstaining from misbehaviour in sexuality is merit. Telling lies is demerit, 
abstaining from telling lies is merit. Slandering is demerit, abstaining from 
slandering is merit. Rough talk is demerit, abstaining from rough talk is merit. 
Frivolous talk is demerit and abstaining from frivolous talk is merit. Coveting 
is demerit, abstaining from coveting is merit. Bearing an angry mind is demerit 
and a not angry mind is merit. Wrong view is demerit and right view is 
merit.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Vaccha, these ten are demerit and 
the other ten are merit. Vaccha, when the bhikkhu, dispels craving pulls it out 
with the roots, makes it a palm stump, and makes it a thing that does not grow 
again, that bhikkhu is perfect..He is with desires destroyed, the holy life 
lived, done what should be done, the weight put down He has come to the highest 
good, with the bond ‘to be’ destroyed He rightfully knowing, is released.’. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Good, Gotama, wait! 
Is there a single bhikkhu a disciple of Gotama, who has destroyed desires, has 
released the mind from desires and released through wisdom, abiding, here and 
now?’ ‘Vaccha, not one, not one hundred, not two hundred, not three hundred, not 
four hundred, not five hundred. There are many more bhikkhus, disciples of mine, 
who have destroyed desires, the mind released from desires and released through 
wisdom, here and now abiding.’ ‘Good, Gotama, wait! Let alone bhikkhus. Is there 
a single bhikkhuni a disciple of Gotama, who has destroyed desires has released 
the mind from desires and released through wisdom, here and now, have realised?’ 
‘Vaccha, not one, not one hundred, not two hundred, not three hundred, not four 
hundred, not five hundred. There are many, more bhikkhunis, disciples of mine, 
who have destroyed desires, the mind released from desires and released through 
wisdom, here and now realising abide’. ‘Good, Gotama, wait! Other than bhikkhus, 
and bhikkhunis.Is there a single lay disciple of Gotama, who wearing white 
clothes had led the holy life, has destroyed the five lower bonds to the sensual 
world, and is born spontaneously, not to proceed?’ ‘Vaccha, not one, not one 
hundred, not two hundred, not three hundred, not four hundred, not five hundred. 
There are many more lay disciples of mine, who have destroyed the five lower 
bonds to the sensual world, and born spontaneously would not proceed.’ ‘Good, 
Gotama, wait! Other than<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>bhikkhus, 
bhikkhunis and lay disciples of Gotama, who wear white clothes and lead the holy 
life. Is there a single a lay disciple, who wears white clothes, leads the holy 
life, while partaking sensual pleasures, and doing the work in the dispensation 
has dispelled doubts. Has become confident of what should and should not be 
done, and does not need a teacher any more in the dispensation of the Teacher. 
Vaccha, not one, not one hundred, not two hundred, not three hundred, not four 
hundred, not five hundred. There are many more lay disciples of mine, wearing 
white clothes leading<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>the holy life, while 
partaking sensual pleasures and doing the work in the dispensation have 
dispelled doubts Have become confident of what should and should not be done and 
do not need a teacher any more.’ ‘Good, Gotama, wait! Other than the bhikkhus, 
bhikkhunis, the lay disciples who have arisen spontaneously and will not 
proceed, and the ones who have entered the stream of the Teaching and are 
confident,.is there a single female lay disciple of good Gotama. Who wears white 
clothes leads the holy life has destroyed the five lower bonds to the sensual 
world, and is born spontaneously not to proceed’ ‘Vaccha, not one, not one 
hundred, not two hundred, not three hundred, not four hundred, not five hundred. 
There are many more female lay disciples of mine, who have destroyed the five 
lower bonds to the sensual world, and are born spontaneously not to proceed.’ 
‘Good, Gotama, wait! Other than the bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, lay disciples arisen 
spontaneously who would not proceed and the ones who have entered the stream of 
the Teaching and are confident and the lay female disciples who have arisen 
apontaneously not to proceed is there is a single female lay disciple. Who wears 
white clothes leads the holy life, while partaking sensual pleasures, and<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>doing the work in the dispensation has 
dispelled doubts, has become confident, of what should and should not be done 
and does not need a teacher any more.’‘Vaccha, not one, not one hundred, not two 
hundred, not three hundred, not four hundred, not five hundred. There are many 
more female lay disciples of mine wearing white clothes lead the holy life, 
while partaking sensual pleasures, doing the work in the dispensation have 
dispelled doubts. Have become confident of what should and should not be done. 
They do not need a teacher any more in the dispensation of the Teacher. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Good Gotama, if in 
this Dispensation good Gotama only was perfect and not the bhikkhus, by that 
factor this holy life is incomplete. Since good Gotama, as well the bhikkhus are 
perfcted, this holy life is complete. If in this Dispensation good Gotama 
and<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>the bhikkhus only were perfected and 
not the bhikkhunis by that this holy life is incomplete. Since good Gotama, the 
bhikkhus and the bhikkhunis are perfcted, this holy life is complete. If in this 
Teaching good Gotama, the bhikkhus and the bhikkhunis were perfected and not the 
lay disciples who wear white clothes and lead the holy life by that, this holy

disciples, who wear white clothes are also perfcted, this holy life is complete. 
If in this Dispensation good Gotama, the bhikkhus bhikkhunis and<SPAN

and also lay disciples female who partake sensual pleasures are<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>perfcted, this holy life is complete. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Good Gotama, like 
the Ganges, which bends towards the ocean, and flows straight into the ocean, 
likewise the gathering of good Gotama, those gone forth together with the 
householders are bent towards and stand close to extinction. Good Gotama, now I 
understand. It’s like something over turned is reinstalled. As something covered 
is made manifest. As the path is told to someone who had lost his way. As though 
an oil lamp was lighted for the darkness, for those who have sight to see 
forms.Good Gotama, the Teaching is explained in various ways. Now I take refuge 
in good Gotama, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. May I gain the 
going forth and the higher ordination in the dispensastion of good 
Gotama.’Vaccha, one of another sect desiring the going forth and the higher 
ordination in this dispensation, should wait four months, as a perid of 
probation. At the end of which time the bhikkhus pleased would give him the 
going forth and the higher ordination. It is to test the personal differences’. 
‘Venerable sir, if one of another sect desiring the going forth and the higher 
ordination have to wait four months, on probation. I will be on probation for 
four years. When, the bhikkhus are pleased may they give me the going forth and 
the higher ordination. The wandering ascetic Vacchagotta received the going 
forth and the higher ordination. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Two weeks after 
venerable Vacchagotta receivd the higher ordination, he approached the Blessed 
One, worshipped, sat on a side and said to the Blessed One. ‘Venerable sir, I 
have gained the knowledge of a trainer. May the Blessed One instruct me 
further.’ ‘Then Vaccha, you should develop two things further.Develop calm and 
insight. Vaccha, when calm and insight is developed, it conduces to experiencing 
the various elements.. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Vaccha, when you 
desire, experience the various super-normal powers. One, becoming many and many 
becoming one. Go unobstructd through walls, embankments and mountains, as going 
through air. Dive, in and come out of earth as in water. Walk, unbroken on 
water, as on earth. Sit with legs crossed, in space, as birds small and large 
do. Touch the moon and sun, as powerful as they are. Wield power with the body 
as far as the world of brahma. That will be the eye -witness for the development 
of that and other mental faculty. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Vaccha, when you 
desire, with the heavenly ear element purified beyond human, hear the various 
sounds, heavenly and human, far or near, to you that mindfulness becomes the 
eye-witness in that mental faculty.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Vaccha, if you 
desire, penetrate and know the mental states of others. Know, the mind with 
greed and without greed, the angry mind and the not angry mind. the deluded mind 
and the non-deluded mind, the attentive mind and the distracted mind, the 
developed mind and the undeveloped mind, the mind with a compare and the mind 
without a compare, the concentrated mind, and the unconcentrated mind, the 
released mind, and the unreleased mind. To you that mindfulness becomes the 
eye-witness in that mental faculty. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Vaccha, if you 
desire, recollect the various manifold previous births. Such as one birth, two 
births, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty births, a hundred 
births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, an innumerable forward 
cycle of births, an innumerable backward cycle of births and an innumerable 
forward and backward cycle of births. There I was of such name, clan, 
disposition, supports and experiencing these pleasant and unpleasant feelings 
and with such a life span. Disappearing from there was born here, with such 
name, clan, disposition, supports and experiencing, these pleasant and 
unpleasant feelings. With such a life span.. Disappearing from there is born 
here. Thus recollect the various manifold previous births that mindfulness, is 
the eye witness, in that mental faculty. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Vaccha, if you so 
desire with the heavenly eye element purified beyond human, see beings 
disappearing and appearing unexalted and exalted, beautiful and ugly, in good 
and bad states. Know beings according their actions. These good beings, 
misbehaving by body, speech and mind, blaming noble ones, with wrong view and 
with the wrong view of actions, after death go to loss, go to decrease and are 
born in hell.These good beings, with right conduct by body, speech and mind, not 
blaming noble ones, with right view and with the right view of actions, after 
death go to increase and are born in heaven. Thus with the heavenly eye element 
purified beyond human see beings disappearing and appearing according their 
actions, and that mindfulness becomes the eye-witness to you in that mental 
faculty. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Vaccha, if you so 
desire, with the destruction of desires, release the mind of desires, and be 
released through wisdom, realising it here and now. That mindfulness becomes eye 
witness, in that mental faculty. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Then venerable 
Vacchagotta, delighted with the words of the Blessed One, got up from his seat, 
worshipped and circumambulated the Blessed One and went away.Venerable 
Vacchagotta secluded and withdrawn from the crowd abode diligent for dispelling. 
For whatever reason sons of clansmen leave the household rightfully and go forth 
as a homeless that incomparable end of the holy life he, here and now realised 
and abode. He knew, birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived, what should be 
done is done, there is nothing more to wish. Venerable Vacchagotta became one of 
the perfect ones.. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>At that time many 
bhikkhus were going to see the Blessed One, and venerable Vacchagotta saw those 
bhikkhus in the distance, approached them and said to them: ‘Venerable ones, 
where are you going now?’. ‘Friend, we are going to see the Blessed One’.’If 
that is so, worship the feet of the Blessed One for me and tell –‘Venerable sir, 
the bhikkhu Vacchagotta worships the feet of the Blessed One and says, I’m a 
perfect.one’. The bhikkhus agreed, approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat 
on side and said. ‘Venerable sir, venerable Vacchagotta says he worships the 
feet of the Blessed One and says that he is perfected’ ‘Bhikkhus, even before, I 
knew that venerable Vacchagotta is perfect, I knew it by penetrating his mind. 
Bhikkhus, he is very powerful, knows the three knowledges. Even the gods 
informed me about this’. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The Blessed One said 
this and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One.<SPAN
