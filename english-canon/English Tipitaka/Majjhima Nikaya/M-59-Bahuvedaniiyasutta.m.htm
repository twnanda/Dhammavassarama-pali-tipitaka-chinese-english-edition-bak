<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I heard thus.At one time the 
Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anathapindika in Jeta’s grove 
in Savatthi. The carpenter Pancakanga approached venerable Udayi worshipped and 
sat on a side and asked ‘Venerable sir, how many feelings are made known by the 
Blessed One?’ ‘Householder, three feelings, are made known by the Blessed One. 
They are pleasant feelings, unpleasant feelings and neither unpleasant nor 
pleasant feelings’.’Venerable Udayi, there are only two feelings pointed out by 
the Blessed One. They are pleasant feelings and unpleasant feelings, neither 
unpleasant nor pleasant feelings are an exalted state declared by the Blessed 
One’. For the second time venerable Udayi said to the carpenter Pancakanga. 
‘Householder, not two feelings, the Blessed One has said of three feelings, 
pleasant feelings, unpleasant feelings and neither unpleasant nor pleasant 
feelings’. For the second time, the carpenter Pancakanga said, ‘Venerable Udayi, 
two feelings are made known by the Blessed One and they are pleasant feelings 
and unpleasant feelings. This neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings, is an 
exalted state is said, by the Blessed One’. For the third time venerable Udayi 
said to the carpenter Pancakanga. ‘Householder, the Blessed One has said of 
three feelings, pleasant feelings, unpleasant feelings and neither unpleasant 
nor pleasant feelings’. For the third time, the carpenter Pancakanga said. 
‘Venerable Udayi, only two feelings are pointed out by the Blessed One and they 
are pleasant feelings and unpleasant feelings. The neither unpleasant nor 
pleasant feelings, is an exalted state is said, by the Blessed One’. Venerable 
Udayi could not convince the carpenter Pancakanga and the carpenter Pancakanga 
could not convince venerable Udayi. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Venerable Ananda heard this conversation 
between venerable Udayi and the carpenter Pancakanga and approached the Blessed 
One worshipped the Blessed One and sat on a side and related the complete 
conversation to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One addressed venerable 
Ananda. ‘Two feelings are also declared by me,<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>three in another, five in another, six in 
another, eighteen in another, thirty-six in another and also in another one 
hundred and eight feelings. Thus Ananda, this Teaching is analytically preached. 
Ananda, in this analytical Teaching, if one does not approve another’s view 
appreciating and accepting it, this kind of thing could happen and quarrels, 
fights, disputes and verbal fights would ensue. Therefore you should be united, 
open hearted, should co-operate like milk and water, and should look at each 
other with understanding and abide’. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Ananda, there are five strands of sense 
desires. What five: Pleasant agreeable forms cognizable by eye consciousness 
arousing fondness and sensual desires. Pleasant agreeable sounds—Pleasant 
agreeable smells-- Pleasant agreeable tastes -- Pleasant agreeable touches 
cognizable by body consciousness arousing fondness and sensual desires. Ananda, 
these are the five strands of sensual desires. All pleasure and pleasantness 
that arise on account of the five strands of sensual desires, are said sensual 
pleasures. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Ananda, if someone says, this is the highest 
pleasure, beings experience, I would not second it. What is the reason? Ananda, 
there is a pleasantness which exceeds this, and is more exalted than this. 
Ananda, what is that pleasantness which exceeds this and is more exalted than 
this? Here the bhikkhu secluded from sensual desires, secluded from things of 
demerit, with thoughts and thought processes and with joy and pleasantness born 
from seclusion abides in the first jhaana. Ananda, this exceeds, and is more 
exalted than the previous.. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Ananda, if someone says, this is

reason: Ananda, there is a pleasantness which exceeds this, and is more exalted 
than this. Ananda, what is that pleasantness which exceeds this and is more 
exalted than this? Here, the bhikkhu overcoming thoughts and thought processes, 
and the mind, in one point internally appeased without thoughts and thought 
processes and with joy and pleasantness born of concentration abides in the 
second jhaana Ananda, this pleasantness exceeds and is more exalted than the 
previous.

detachment abides mindful and aware, of pleasantness with the body too and 
abides in the third jhaana. To this the noble ones say, abiding mindfully in 
equanimity. Ananda, this exceeds and is more exalted than the previous.

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Ananda, there is a possibility, for ascetics of 
other sects to question, does the recluse Gotama declare the cessation of 
perceptions and feelings also as a feeling? How could that happen? How could 
that be? This is our reply to those ascetics of other sects. Friends, for the 
matter of only feeling pleasant, the Blessed One does not declare it as 
pleasant. Whenever pleasantness is gained to that the Blessed One declares 
pleasant*. 
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>The Blessed One said thus and venerable 
Aananda, delighted in the words of the Blessed One.<SPAN

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>Notes.* Friends for the matter of only feeling 
pleasant, the Blessed One does not declare it as pleasant. Whenever pleasantness 
is gained, to that the Blessed One declares pleasant.’na kho aavuso bhagavaa 
sukha.myeva vedana.m sandhaaya sukhasmi.m pa~n~naapeti.apica aavuso yattha 
yattha sukha.m upalabhati yahi.m yahi.m ta.m ta.m tathaagato sukhasmi.m 
pa~n~naapeti.’ Yet when pleasantness is gained, to that the Blessed One declares 
pleasant. The<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>discourse shows how the 
least pleasantness in the sensual sphere and the most exalted pleasantness in 
the immaterial sphere is gained,. yet the Blessed One is not pleased clinging to 
even that highest pleasantness. Extinction and enlightenment means giving up 
that too.
