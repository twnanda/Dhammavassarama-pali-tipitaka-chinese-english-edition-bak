<P class=MsoBodyText>I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One was living in the 
monastery offered by Anathapindika in Jeta’s grove in Savatthi. Then the 
wandering ascetic Vacchagotta approached the Blessed One exchanged friendly 
greetings, sat on a side and said to the Blessed One. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Good Gotama, the 
world is eternal this only is the truth and all else is false. Does good Gotama 
hold this view?’ ‘No, Vaccha, I’m not of that view, the world is eternal, this 
only is the truth all else is false’. ‘Good Gotama, the world is not eternal, 
this only is the truth and all else is false Does good Gotama hold this view?’ 
‘No, Vaccha, I’m not of that view, the world is not eternal, this only is the 
truth all else is false’. ‘Good Gotama, the world is limited, this only is the 
truth and all else is false. Does good Gotama hold this view?’ ‘No, Vaccha, I’m 
not of that view, the world is limited, this only is the truth all else is 
false.’ ‘Good Gotama, the world is not-limited, this only is the truth and all 
else is false. Does good Gotama hold this view?’ ‘No, Vaccha, I’m not of that 
view, the world is not limited, this only is the truth all else is false’.’Good 
Gotama, the soul is the body, this only is the truth and all else is false. Does 
good Gotama hold this view?’ ‘No, Vaccha, I’m not of that view, the soul is the 
body, this only is the truth all else is false.’ ‘Good Gotama, the soul is 
different from the body, this only is the truth and all else is false. Does good 
Gotama hold this view?’ ‘No, Vaccha, I’m not of that view, the soul is different 
from the body, this only is the truth all else is false.’ ‘Good Gotama, the Thus 
Gone One is after death- this only is the truth all else is false. Does good 
Gotama hold this view?’ ‘No, Vaccha, I’m not of that view, the Thus Gone One is 
after death, this only is the truth all else is false.’ ‘Good Gotama, the Thus 
Gone One is not after death, this only is the truth and all else is false. Does 
good Gotama hold this view?’ ‘No, Vaccha, I’m not of that view, the Thus Gone 
One is not after death, this only is the truth all else is false.’’Good Gotama, 
the Thus Gone One is, and is not, after death, this only is the truth, all else 
is false. Does good Gotama hold this view.’ ‘No, Vaccha, I’m not of that view, 
the Thus Gone One is, and is not after death, this only is the truth all else is 
false.’ ‘Good Gotama, the Thus Gone One neither is, nor is not after death, this 
only is the truth and all else is false. Does good Gotama hold this view?’ ‘No, 
Vaccha, I’m not of that view, the Thus Gone One neither is, nor is not after 
death, this only is the truth all else is false.’ 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Good Gotama, when 
asked, is good Gotama of the view, the world is eternal, this only is the truth, 
all else is false, it was said you were not of that view. When asked, is good 
Gotama of the view, the world is not eternal, this only is the truth, all else 
is false, it was said, you were not of that view. When asked, is good Gotama of 
the view, the world is limited, this only is the truth, all else is false, it 
was said you were not of that view. When asked, is good Gotama of the view, the 
world is not limited, this only is the truth, all else is false, it was said you 
were not of that view. When asked, is good Gotama of the view, the Thus Gone One 
is and is not after death, this only is the 
<P class=MsoBodyText>truth, all else is false, it was said you were not of that 
view. When asked, is good Gotama of the view, the Thus Gone One neither is, nor 
is not after death, this only is the truth, all else is false, it was said you 
were not of that view. Good Gotama, seeing what danger has thrown out all these 
views?’ 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Vaccha, the view, 
the world is eternal, is a bond of views, is a speculation in views, it is with 
unpleasantness, with trouble, with burning, not leading to giving up, to 
detachment, to appeasement, to knowledge, to enlightenment, to cessation and to 
extinction. The view the world is not eternal,--re - The world is limited,-re- 
the world is not limited ..re..the soul is the body..re..the soul is different 
from the body, ..re.. the Thus Gone One is, after death, ..re..the Thus Gone One 
is not, after death,-re -the Thus Gone One is and is not after death…re.. the 
Thus Gone One neither is, nor is not after death<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>is a bond of views, is a speculation in views, 
it is with unpleasantness, with trouble, with burning, not leading to giving up, 
to detachment, to appesement, to knowledge, to enlightenment, to cessation and 
to extinction.Vaccha, seeing these dangers I have thrown out all these views.’. 
‘Does good Gotama hold any other view?’<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN> 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Vaccha, The Thus 
Gone One has overcome views. This is the view of the Thus Gone One. This is 
matter, this is the arising of matter, and this is the fading of matter. This is 
feeling, this is the arising of feelings and this is the fading of feelings. 
This is perception, this is the arising of perceptions and this is the fading of 
perceptions. These are determinations, this is the arising of determinations and 
this, the fading of determinations. This is consciousness, this is the arising 
of consciousness and this is fading of consciousness. Therefore, I say the Thus 
Gone One has destroyed, is detached, has given up and is released, from all 
imaginings, recollections, and all latent tendencies of me and mine.’ 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Good Gotama, where 
is the thus released mind born?’’Vaccha, is born does not apply’’Then good 
Gotama, is he not born?’’Vaccha, is not born does not apply.’<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Gotama, is he born and not born?’’Vaccha, is 
born and is not born does not apply.’’Then Gotama, is he neither born, nor not 
born?’’Vaccha, is neither born, nor is not born, is<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>not<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>applicable..’. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘When asked where is 
the thus released mind born, it was said, is born does not apply. When asked is 
it not born, it was said not born does not apply. When asked is it born and not 
born, it was said, born and not born does not apply. When asked, is it neither 
born, nor is not born, it was said neither born nor not born, does not apply. 
Good Gotama, in this I am completely ignorant and deluded. Whatever little 
understanding I had with the earlier conversation, has now vanished.’ 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Vaccha, your 
ignorance and delusion is nothing strange. This is deep, difficult to understand 
peaceful and exalted, not for logical thinking. Is clever and shoud be 
experienced by the wise. By one of another sect like you, with some other 
liking, without being yoked in it and living in it, it cannot be understood. So 
then Vaccha, I will question you, on this and you may reply as it pleases you. 
There is a fire burning in front of you, would you know, there is a fire burning 
in front of me?’ ‘Good Gotama, if a fire burns in front of me, I would know, 
there’s a fire burning in front of me.’ ‘Vaccha, if you were asked, this fire 
burning in front of you, on account of what is it burning, how would you 
reply?’’Good Gotama, if I was asked, this fire burning in front of you, on 
account of what is it burning, I would reply, this fire burning in front of me 
is burning on account of grass and sticks.’ ‘Vaccha, if the fire in front of you 
extinguishes, would you know, this fire in front of me has extinguished?’’Good 
Gotama, if the fire in front of me extinguishes, I would know, this fire has 
extinguished’’Vaccha, if you were asked, this fire that has extinguished in 
which direction did it go, to the east, west, north or south?’ ‘Good, Gotama, it 
does not apply. That fire burnt on account of grass and sticks, those supports 
finished, no other supports were supplied, without supports the fire, went 
out.’. 
<P class=MsoBodyText><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>‘Vaccha, in that 
same manner, the matter with which the Thus Gone One is pointed out, is 
dispelled, uprooted, made a palm stump, made a thing not to grow again: Vaccha, 
the Thus Gone One is released from the reckonings of matter. It is deep, 
difficult to fathom, like the great ocean. Is born, does not apply, is not born 
does not apply. Is born and is not born does not apply, neither is born, nor is 
not born does not apply. The feelings, with which the Thus Gone One is pointed, 
are dispelled, uprooted, made palm stumps made things not to grow again: Vaccha, 
the Thus Gone One is released from the reckonings of feelings. It is deep, 
difficult to fathom, like the great ocean. Is born does not apply, is not born 
does not apply. Is born and is not born does not apply. Neither is born nor is 
not born does not apply. The perceptions, with which the Thus Gone One is 
pointed are dispelled, uprooted, made palm stumps, made things not to grow 
again. Vaccha, the Thus Gone One is released from the reckonings of perceptions. 
It is deep, difficult to fathom, like the great ocean. Is born does not apply, 
is not born does not apply, is born and is not born does not apply. Neither is 
born nor is not born does not apply. The determinations with which the Thus Gone 
One is pointed out, are dispelled, uprooted, made palm stumps, made things not 
to grow again: Vaccha, the Thus Gone One is released from the reckonings of 
deterninations. It is deep, difficult to fathom like the great ocean. Is born 
does not apply, is not born does not apply Is born and is not born does not 
apply. Neither is born nor is not born does not apply. The consciousness with 
which the Thus Gone One is pointed out, is dispelled, uprooted, made a palm 
stump, made a thing not to grow again. Vaccha, the Thus Gone One is released 
from the reckonings of consciousness. It is deep, difficult to fathom like the 
great ocean. Is born does not apply, is not born does not apply. Is born and is 
not born does not apply. Neither is born nor is not born does not apply.’ 
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>When this was said the 
wandering ascetic Vacchagotta said thus to the Blessed One, close to the village 
or hamlet, there is a huge Sala tree, because of impermanence, its leaves, 
branches, bark, shoots and sapwood fall off and is left with only the heartwood. 
In the same manner, on account of the words of good Gotama, with my<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></SPAN>leaves and branches pulled out, shoots pulled 
out, the bark removed, the sap removed, I stand as the pure heartwood. I 
understand good Gotama, it is as though something over turned is reinstalled, 
something covered is made manifest. As though the path is shown to someone who 
had lost his way. As though an oil lamp is lighted, for those who have sight to 
see forms in the dark. Now, I take refuge in good Gotama, in the Teaching, in 
the Community of bhikkhus. May the Blessed One bear me as a lay disciple who has 
taken refuge from today until life lasts.
