<HR>
At Savatthi. "Monks, perception of forms is inconstant, changeable, alterable. 
Perception of sounds... Perception of smells... Perception of tastes... 
Perception of tactile sensations... Perception of ideas is inconstant, 
changeable, alterable. 
<P>"One who has conviction &amp; belief that these phenomena are this way is 
called a faith-follower: one who has entered the orderliness of rightness, 
entered the plane of people of integrity, transcended the plane of the 
run-of-the-mill. He is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn 
in hell, in the animal womb, or in the realm of hungry shades. He is incapable 
of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream-entry. 
<P>"One who, after pondering with a modicum of discernment, has accepted that 
these phenomena are this way is called a Dhamma-follower: one who has entered 
the orderliness of rightness, entered the plane of people of integrity, 
transcended the plane of the run-of-the-mill. He is incapable of doing any deed 
by which he might be reborn in hell, in the animal womb, or in the realm of 
hungry shades. He is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit 
of stream-entry. 
<P>"One who knows and sees that these phenomena are this way is called a 
stream-enterer, steadfast, never again destined for states of woe, headed for 
self-awakening."
