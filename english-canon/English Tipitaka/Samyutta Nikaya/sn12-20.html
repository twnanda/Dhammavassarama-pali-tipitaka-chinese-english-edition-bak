Dwelling at <A NAME="savatthi">Savatthi</A>... "Monks, I will teach you <A NAME="dependent">dependent co-arising</A> &amp; dependently co-arisen phenomena. Listen &amp; pay close attention. I will speak."
<p>
"As you say, lord," the monks replied. The Blessed One said:
<p>
"Now what is dependent co-arising? From birth as a requisite condition comes aging &amp; death. Whether or not there is the arising of Tathagatas, this property stands -- this regularity of the Dhamma, this orderliness of the Dhamma, this this/that conditionality. The Tathagata directly awakens to that, breaks through to that. Directly awakening &amp; breaking through to that, he declares it, teaches it, describes it, sets it forth. He reveals it, explains it, makes it plain, &amp; says, 'Look.' From birth as a requisite condition comes aging &amp; death.
<p>
"From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth...
<p>
"From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming...
<p>
"From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance...
<p>
"From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving...
<p>
"From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling...
<p>
"From <A NAME="6media">the six</A> sense media as a requisite condition comes contact...
<p>
"From name-&amp;-form as a requisite condition come the six sense media...
<p>
"From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-&amp;-form...
<p>
"From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness...
<p>
"From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications. Whether or not there is the arising of Tathagatas, this property stands -- this regularity of the Dhamma, this orderliness of the Dhamma, this this/that conditionality. The Tathagata directly awakens to that, breaks through to that. Directly awakening &amp; breaking through to that, he declares it, teaches it, describes it, sets it forth. He reveals it, explains it, makes it plain, &amp; says, 'Look.' From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications. What's there in this way is a reality, not an unreality, not other than what it seems, conditioned by this/that. This is called dependent co-arising.
<p>
"And what are dependently co-arisen phenomena? Aging &amp; death are dependently co-arisen phenomena: inconstant, compounded, dependently co-arisen, subject to ending, subject to passing away, subject to fading, subject to cessation.
<p>
"Birth is a dependently co-arisen phenomenon...
<p>
"Becoming is a dependently co-arisen phenomenon...
<p>
"Clinging/sustenance is a dependently co-arisen phenomenon...
<p>
"Craving is a dependently co-arisen phenomenon...
<p>
"Feeling is a dependently co-arisen phenomenon...
<p>
"Contact is a dependently co-arisen phenomenon...
<p>
"The six sense media are dependently co-arisen phenomena...
<p>
"Name-&amp;-form is a dependently co-arisen phenomenon...
<p>
"Consciousness is a dependently co-arisen phenomenon...
<p>
"Fabrications are dependently co-arisen phenomena...
<p>
"Ignorance is a dependently co-arisen phenomenon: inconstant, compounded, dependently co-arisen, subject to ending, subject to passing away, subject to fading, subject to cessation. These are called dependently co-arisen phenomena.
<p>
"When a disciple of the noble ones has seen well with right discernment this dependent co-arising &amp; these dependently co-arisen phenomena as they are actually present, it is not possible that he would run after the past, thinking, 'Was I in the past? Was I not in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? Having been what, what was I in the past?' or that he would run after the future, thinking, 'Shall I be in the future? Shall I not be in the future? What shall I be in the future? How shall I be in the future? Having been what, what shall I be in the future?' or that he would be inwardly perplexed about the immediate present, thinking, 'Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? Where has this being come from? Where is it bound?' Such a thing is not possible. Why is that? Because the disciple of the noble ones has seen well with right discernment this dependent co-arising &amp; these dependently co-arisen phenomena as they are actually present."
