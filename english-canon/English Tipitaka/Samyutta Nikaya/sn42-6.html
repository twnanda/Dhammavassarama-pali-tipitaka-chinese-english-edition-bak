<hr>
On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="nalanda">Nalanda</A> in the <A NAME="pavarika">Pavarika Mango Grove</A>. Then <A NAME="asi">Asibandhakaputta</A> the headman went to the Blessed One and on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "The brahmins of the Western lands, lord -- those who carry water pots, wear garlands of water plants, purify with water, &amp; worship fire -- can take [the spirit of] a dead person, lift it out, instruct it, &amp; send it to heaven. But the Blessed One, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened, can arrange it so that all the world, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappears in a good destination, the heavenly world."
<p>
"Very well, then, headman, I will question you on this matter. Answer as you see fit. What do you think: There is the case where a man is one who takes life, steals, indulges in illicit sex; is a liar, one who speaks divisive speech, harsh speech, &amp; idle chatter; is greedy, bears thoughts of ill-will, &amp; holds to wrong views. Then a great crowd of people, gathering &amp; congregating, would pray, praise, &amp; circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart [saying,] 'May this man, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in a good destination, the heavenly world!' What do you think: would that man -- because of the prayers, praise, &amp; circumambulation of that great crowd of people -- at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in a good destination, the heavenly world?"
<p>
"No, lord."
<p>
"<A NAME="boulder">Suppose</A> a man were to throw a large boulder into a deep lake of water, and a great crowd of people, gathering &amp; congregating, would pray, praise, &amp; circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart [saying,] 'Rise up, O boulder! Come floating up, O boulder! Come float to the shore, O boulder!' What do you think: would that boulder -- because of the prayers, praise, &amp; circumambulation of that great crowd of people -- rise up, come floating up, or come float to the shore?"
<p>
"No, lord."
<p>
"So it is with any man who takes life, steals, indulges in illicit sex; is a liar, one who speaks divisive speech, harsh speech, &amp; idle chatter; is greedy, bears thoughts of ill-will, &amp; holds to wrong views. Even though a great crowd of people, gathering &amp; congregating, would pray, praise, &amp; circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart -- [saying,] 'May this man, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in a good destination, the heavenly world!' -- still, at the break-up of the body, after death, he would reappear in destitution, a bad destination, the lower realms, hell.
<p>
"Now what do you think: There is the case where a man is one who refrains from taking life, from stealing, &amp; from indulging in illicit sex; he refrains from lying, from speaking divisive speech, from harsh speech, &amp; from idle chatter; he is not greedy, bears no thoughts of ill-will, &amp; holds to right view. Then a great crowd of people, gathering &amp; congregating, would pray, praise, &amp; circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart [saying,] 'May this man, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in destitution, a bad destination, the lower realms, hell!' What do you think: would that man -- because of the prayers, praise, &amp; circumambulation of that great crowd of people -- at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in destitution, a bad destination, the lower realms, hell?"
<p>
"No, lord."
<p>
"<A NAME="jar">Suppose</A> a man were to throw a jar of ghee or a jar of oil into a deep lake of water, where it would break. There the shards &amp; jar-fragments would go down, while the ghee or oil would come up. Then a great crowd of people, gathering &amp; congregating, would pray, praise, &amp; circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart [saying,] 'Sink, O ghee/oil! Submerge, O ghee/oil! Go down, O ghee/oil!' What do you think: would that ghee/oil, because of the prayers, praise, &amp; circumambulation of that great crowd of people sink, submerge, or go down?"
<p>
"No, lord."
<p>
"So it is with any man who refrains from taking life, from stealing, &amp; from indulging in illicit sex; refrains from lying, from speaking divisive speech, from harsh speech, &amp; from idle chatter; is not greedy, bears no thoughts of ill-will, &amp; holds to right view. Even though a great crowd of people, gathering &amp; congregating, would pray, praise, &amp; circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart -- [saying,] 'May this man, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in a destitution, a bad destination, the lower realms, hell!' -- still, at the break-up of the body, after death, he would reappear in a good destination, the heavenly world."
<p>
When this was said, Asibandhakaputta the headman said to the Blessed One: "<A NAME="magnif">Magnificent</A>, lord! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to point out the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has the Blessed One -- through many lines of reasoning -- made the Dhamma clear. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, &amp; to the community of monks. May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward, for life."
