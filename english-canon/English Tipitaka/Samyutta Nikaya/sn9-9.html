<hr>
On one occasion a certain monk, a <A NAME="vajji">Vajjian</A> princeling, was dwelling near <A NAME="vesali">Vesali</A> in a forest thicket. And on that occasion an all-night festival was being held in Vesali. The monk -- lamenting as he heard the resounding din of wind music, string music, &amp; gongs coming from Vesali, on that occasion recited this verse:
<blockquote>
I live in the wilderness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all alone<br>
like a log cast away in the forest.<br>
On a night like this,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who could there be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more miserable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than me?
</blockquote>
Then the devata inhabiting the forest thicket, feeling sympathy for the monk, desiring his benefit, desiring to bring him to his senses, approached him and addressed him with this verse:
<blockquote>
As you live in the wilderness all alone<br>
like a log cast away in the forest,<br>
many are those who envy you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as hell-beings do,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those headed for heaven.
</blockquote>
The monk, chastened by the devata, came to his senses.
