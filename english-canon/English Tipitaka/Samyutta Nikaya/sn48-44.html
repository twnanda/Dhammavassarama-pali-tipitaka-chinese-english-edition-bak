<hr>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in <A NAME="savatthi">Savatthi</A>, at the Eastern Gatehouse. There he addressed <A NAME="sariputta">Ven. Sariputta</A>: "Sariputta, do you take it on conviction that the faculty of conviction, when developed &amp; pursued, plunges into the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal &amp; consummation? Do you take it on conviction that the faculty of persistence...mindfulness...concentration...discernment, when developed &amp; pursued, plunges into the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal &amp; consummation?"
<p>
"Lord, it's not that I take it on conviction in the Blessed One that the faculty of conviction...persistence...mindfulness...concentration...discernment, when developed &amp; pursued, plunges into the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal &amp; consummation. Those who have not known, seen, penetrated, realized, or attained it by means of discernment would have to take it on conviction in others that the faculty of conviction...persistence...mindfulness...concentration...discernment, when developed &amp; pursued, plunges into the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal &amp; consummation; whereas those who have known, seen, penetrated, realized, &amp; attained it by means of discernment would have no doubt or uncertainty that the faculty of conviction...persistence...mindfulness...concentration...discernment, when developed &amp; pursued, plunges into the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal &amp; consummation. And as for me, I have known, seen, penetrated, realized, &amp; attained it by means of discernment. I have no doubt or uncertainty that the faculty of conviction...persistence...mindfulness...concentration...discernment, when developed &amp; pursued, plunges into the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal &amp; consummation."
<p>
"Excellent, Sariputta. Excellent. Those who have not known, seen, penetrated, realized, or attained it by means of discernment would have to take it on conviction in others that the faculty of conviction...persistence...mindfulness...concentration...discernment, when developed &amp; pursued, plunges into the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal &amp; consummation; whereas those who have known, seen, penetrated, realized, &amp; attained it by means of discernment would have no doubt or uncertainty that the faculty of conviction...persistence...mindfulness...concentration...discernment, when developed &amp; pursued, plunges into the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal &amp; consummation."
