<hr>
Staying at Savatthi. "Monks, suppose there were a sharp-bladed spear, and a man were to come along saying, 'With my hand or fist I will bend back this sharp-bladed spear, fold it in two, and roll it up.' What do you think? Would that man be able with his hand or fist to bend back that sharp-bladed spear, fold it in two, and roll it up?"
<p>
"No, lord. Why is that? Because a sharp-bladed spear isn't easy to bend back, fold in two, or roll up. The man would simply reap his share of trouble &amp; vexation."
<p>
"In the same way, monks, when a monk's release of awareness through good-will is cultivated, developed, pursued, given a means of transport, given a grounding, steadied, consolidated, &amp; well-undertaken, any non-human being who would think of possessing that monk's mind would simply reap his share of trouble &amp; vexation. 
<p>
"Thus you should train yourselves: 'Our release of awareness through good-will will be cultivated, developed, pursued, given a means of transport, given a grounding, steadied, consolidated, &amp; well-undertaken. That's how you should train yourselves."
