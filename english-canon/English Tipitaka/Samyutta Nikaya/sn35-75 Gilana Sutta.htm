<HR>
At Savatthi. Then a certain monk went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having 
bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the 
Blessed One, "Lord, in such and such a dwelling a certain monk -- newly 
ordained, not well known -- is diseased, in pain, severely ill. It would be good 
if the Blessed One would visit the monk, out of sympathy for him." 
<P>Then the Blessed One, on hearing the word "newly ordained," on hearing the 
word "diseased," and realizing that the monk was not well known, went to him. 
The monk saw the Blessed One coming from afar and, on seeing him, stirred in his 
bed. Then the Blessed One said to him, "Enough, monk. Don't stir in your bed. 
There are these seats made ready. I will sit down there." 
<P>The Blessed One sat down on a seat made ready and said to the monk, "I hope 
you are getting better, monk. I hope you are comfortable. I hope that your pains 
are lessening and not increasing. I hope that there are signs of their 
lessening, and not of their increasing." 
<P>"I am not getting better, lord. I am not comfortable. My extreme pains are 
increasing, not lessening. There are signs of their increasing, and not of their 
lessening." 
<P>"Then I hope you have no anxiety, monk. I hope you have no anguish." 
<P>"Yes, lord, I do have not a small amount of anxiety, not a small amount of 
anguish." 
<P>"I hope you can't fault yourself with regard to your virtue." 
<P>"No, lord, I can't fault myself with regard to my virtue." 
<P>"Then what are you anxious about? What is your anguish?" 
<P>"I understand that the Blessed One has not taught the Dhamma with purity of 
virtue as its goal." 
<P>"If you understand that I have not taught the Dhamma with purity of virtue as 
its goal, then for what goal do you understand that I have taught the Dhamma?" 
<P>"I understand that the Blessed One has taught the Dhamma with total Unbinding 
through lack of clinging as its goal." 
<P>"Good, good, monk. It's good that you understand that I have taught the 
Dhamma with total Unbinding through lack of clinging as its goal, for I 
<I>have</I> taught the Dhamma with total Unbinding through lack of clinging as 
its goal. 
<P>"What do you think, monk: Is the eye constant or inconstant? 
<P>"Inconstant, lord." 
<P>"And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?" 
<P>"Stressful, lord." 
<P>"And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change 
as: 'This is mine. This is my self. This is what I am'?" 
<P>"No, lord." 
<P>"...Is the ear constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."... 
<P>"...Is the nose constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."... 
<P>"...Is the tongue constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."... 
<P>"...Is the body constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."... 
<P>"What do you think, monk: Is the intellect constant or inconstant?" 
<P>"Inconstant, lord." 
<P>"And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?" 
<P>"Stressful, lord." 
<P>"And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change 
as: 'This is mine. This is my self. This is what I am'?" 
<P>"No, lord." 
<P>"Seeing thus, the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted 
with the eye, disenchanted with the ear, disenchanted with the nose, 
disenchanted with the tongue, disenchanted with the body, disenchanted with the 
intellect. Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, he is 
fully released. With full release, there is the knowledge, 'Fully released.' He 
discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is 
nothing further for this world.'" 
<P>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monk delighted in the 
Blessed One's words. And while this explanation was being given, the mind of 
that monk, through no clinging (not being sustained), was fully released from 
fermentations.
