<HR>
On one occasion <A name=ananda></A>Ven. Ananda and <A name=udayin></A>Ven. 
Udayin were staying near <A name=kosambi></A>Kosambi in <A 
name=ghosita></A>Ghosita's Park. Then in the evening, Ven. Udayin emerged from 
his seclusion and went to Ven. Ananda and exchanged courteous greetings with 
him. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one 
side. As he was sitting there, he said to Ven. Ananda, "In many ways the body 
has been pointed out, revealed, and announced by the Blessed One [with these 
words]: 'For this reason the body is not-self. Can consciousness in the same way 
be declared, taught, described, set forth, revealed, explained, &amp; made plain 
[with these words]: 'For this reason consciousness is not-self'?" 
<P>"It can... Doesn't eye-consciousness arise in dependence on the eye &amp; 
forms?" 
<P>"Yes, friend." 
<P>"And if the cause &amp; reason for the arising of eye-consciousness were to 
cease totally everywhere, totally in every way without remainder, would 
eye-consciousness be discerned?" 
<P>"No, friend." 
<P>"It's in this way, friend, that consciousness has been pointed out, revealed, 
and announced by the Blessed One [with these words]: 'For this reason 
consciousness is not-self.' 
<P>"Doesn't ear-consciousness arise in dependence on the ear &amp; sounds?"... 
<P>"Doesn't nose-consciousness arise in dependence on the nose &amp; aromas?"... 

<P>"Doesn't tongue-consciousness arise in dependence on the tongue &amp; 
flavors?"... 
<P>"Doesn't body-consciousness arise in dependence on the body &amp; tactile 
sensations?"... 
<P>Doesn't intellect-consciousness arise in dependence on the intellect &amp; 
ideas?" 
<P>"Yes, friend." 
<P>"And if the cause &amp; reason for the arising of intellect-consciousness 
were to cease totally everywhere, totally in every way without remainder, would 
intellect-consciousness be discerned?" 
<P>"No, friend." 
<P>"It's in this way, friend, that consciousness has been pointed out, revealed, 
and announced by the Blessed One [with these words]: 'For this reason 
consciousness is not-self.' 
<P><A id=heartwood name=heartwood></A>"It's just as if a man going around 
wanting heartwood, seeking heartwood, searching for heartwood, would take a 
sharp ax and enter a forest. There he would see a large banana tree trunk: 
straight, young, without shoots. He would cut off the roof, cut off the crown, 
and unfurl the coil of the stem. There he wouldn't even find softwood, much less 
heartwood. 
<P>"In the same way, a monk assumes neither a self nor anything pertaining to a 
self in the six spheres of sensory contact. Assuming in this way, he doesn't 
cling to anything in the world. Not clinging, he is not agitated. Unagitated, he 
is totally unbound right within. He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life 
fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'" <!-- #bbinclude "footer.html" --><!-- THE TEXT BELOW IS AUTOMAGICALLY GENERATED FROM AN INCLUDE FILE. --><!-- robots content="none" -->
