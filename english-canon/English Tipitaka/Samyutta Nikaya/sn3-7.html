<hr>
At Savatthi. As he was sitting to one side, King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One: "Just now, lord, as I was sitting in judgment, I saw that even affluent nobles, affluent brahmins, &amp; affluent householders -- rich, with great wealth &amp; property, with vast amounts of gold &amp; silver, vast amounts of valuables &amp; commodities, vast amounts of wealth &amp; grain -- tell deliberate lies with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleasures as the reason, simply for the sake of sensual pleasures. Then, the thought occured to me: 'I've had enough of this judging! Let some other fine fellow be known for his judgments!'"
<p>
"That's the way it is, great king! That's the way it is! Even affluent nobles, affluent brahmins, &amp; affluent householders...tell deliberate lies with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleasures as the reason, simply for the sake of sensual pleasures. That will lead to their long-term harm &amp; pain."
<p>
That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:
<blockquote>
Impassioned &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with sensual possessions,<br>
greedy, dazed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by sensual pleasures,<br>
they don't awaken to the fact<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that they've gone too far -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like fish into trap set out.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterwards it's bitter for them:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; evil for them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the result.
</blockquote>
