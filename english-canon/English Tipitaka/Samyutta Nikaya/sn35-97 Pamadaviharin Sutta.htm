<P>"Monks, I will teach you about one who dwells in heedlessness and one who 
dwells in heedfulness. Listen and pay careful attention, I will speak." </P>
<P>"As you say, lord," the monks responded. </P>
<P>The Blessed One said: "And how does one dwell in heedlessness? When a monk 
dwells without restraint over the faculty of the eye, the mind is stained with 
forms cognizable via the eye. When the mind is stained, there is no joy. There 
being no joy, there is no rapture. There being no rapture, there is no serenity. 
There being no serenity, he dwells in suffering. The mind of one who suffers 
does not become centered. When the mind is uncentered, phenomena (dhammas) don't 
become manifest. When phenomena aren't manifest, one is classed simply as one 
who dwells in heedlessness. </P>
<P>"When a monk dwells without restraint over the ear... nose... tongue... 
body... </P>
<P>"When a monk dwells without restraint over the faculty of the intellect, the 
mind is stained with ideas cognizable via the intellect. When the mind is 
stained, there is no joy. There being no joy, there is no rapture. There being 
no rapture, there is no serenity. There being no serenity, he dwells in 
suffering. The mind of one who suffers does not become centered. When the mind 
is uncentered, phenomena (dhammas) don't become manifest. When phenomena aren't 
manifest, one is classed simply as one who dwells in heedlessness. </P>
<P>"This is how one dwells in heedlessness. </P>
<P>"And how does one dwell in heedfulness? When a monk dwells with restraint 
over the faculty of the eye, the mind is not stained with forms cognizable via 
the eye. When the mind is not stained, there is joy. There being joy, there is 
rapture. There being rapture, there is serenity. There being serenity, he dwells 
in ease. The mind of one at ease becomes centered. When the mind is centered, 
phenomena (dhammas) become manifest. When phenomena are manifest, one is classed 
simply as one who dwells in heedfulness. </P>
