"Develop concentration, monks. A concentrated monk discerns things as they actually are present. And what does he discern as it actually is present?
<p>
"He discerns, as it actually is present, that 'The eye is inconstant'...'Forms are inconstant'...'Eye-consciousness is inconstant'...'Eye-contact is inconstant'...'Whatever arises in dependence on eye-contact, experienced either as pleasure, as pain, or as neither-pleasure-nor-pain, that too is inconstant.'
<p>
"He discerns, as it actually is present, that 'The ear is inconstant'...'The nose is inconstant'...'The tongue is inconstant'...'The body is inconstant"...
<p>
"He discerns, as it actually is present, that 'The intellect is inconstant'...'Ideas are inconstant'...'Intellect-consciousness is inconstant'...'Intellect-contact is inconstant'...'Whatever arises in dependence on intellect-contact, experienced either as pleasure, as pain, or as neither-pleasure-nor-pain, that too is inconstant.'
<p>
"So develop concentration, monks. A concentrated monk discerns things as they actually are present."
