<HR>
At <A name=savatthi>Savatthi</A>. "Monks, any priests or contemplatives who 
recollect their manifold past lives all recollect the five clinging-aggregates, 
or one among them. Which five? When recollecting, 'I was one with such a form in 
the past,' one is recollecting just form. Or when recollecting, 'I was one with 
such a feeling in the past,' one is recollecting just feeling. Or when 
recollecting, 'I was one with such a perception in the past,' one is 
recollecting just perception. Or when recollecting, 'I was one with such mental 
fabrications in the past,' one is recollecting just mental fabrications. Or when 
recollecting, 'I was one with such a consciousness in the past,' one is 
recollecting just consciousness. 
<P>"And why do you call it 'form' <I>(rupa)?</I> Because it is afflicted 
<I>(ruppati),</I> thus it is called 'form.' Afflicted with what? With cold &amp; 
heat &amp; hunger &amp; thirst, with the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, 
&amp; reptiles. Because it is afflicted, it is called form. 
<P>"And why do you call it 'feeling'? Because it feels, thus it is called 
'feeling.' What does it feel? It feels pleasure, it feels pain, it feels 
neither-pleasure-nor-pain. Because it feels, it is called feeling. 
<P>"And why do you call it 'perception'? Because it perceives, thus it is called 
'perception.' What does it perceive? It perceives blue, it perceives yellow, it 
perceives red, it perceives white. Because it perceives, it is called 
perception. 
<P>"And why do you call them 'fabrications'? Because they fabricate fabricated 
things, thus they are called 'fabrications.' What do they fabricate as a 
fabricated thing? From form-ness, they fabricate form as a fabricated thing. 
From feeling-ness, they fabricate feeling as a fabricated thing. From 
perception-hood...From fabrication-hood...From consciousness-hood, they 
fabricate consciousness as a fabricated thing. Because they fabricate fabricated 
things, they are called fabrications. [<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn22-079.html#n1" 
name=1>1</A>] 
<P>"And why do you call it 'consciousness'? Because it cognizes, thus it is 
called consciousness. What does it cognize? It cognizes what is sour, bitter, 
pungent, sweet, alkaline, non-alkaline, salty, &amp; unsalty. Because it 
cognizes, it is called consciousness. 
<P>"Thus an instructed disciple of the noble ones reflects in this way: 'I am 
now being chewed up by form. But in the past I was also chewed up by form in the 
same way I am now being chewed up by present form. And if I delight in future 
form, then in the future I will be chewed up by form in the same way I am now 
being chewed up by present form.' Having reflected in this way, he becomes 
indifferent to past form, does not delight in future form, and is practicing for 
the sake of disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation with regard to present 
form. 
<P>"[He reflects:] ''I am now being chewed up by feeling... perception... 
fabrications... consciousness. But in the past I was also chewed up by 
consciousness in the same way I am now being chewed up by present consciousness. 
And if I delight in future consciousness, then in the future I will be chewed up 
by consciousness in the same way I am now being chewed up by present 
consciousness.' Having reflected in this way, he becomes indifferent to past 
consciousness, does not delight in future consciousness, and is practicing for 
the sake of disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation with regard to present 
consciousness. 
<P>"What do you think, monks -- Is form constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, 
lord." "And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?" "Stressful, 
lord." "And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to 
change as: 'This is mine. This is my self. This is what I am'?" 
<P>"No, lord." 
<P>"... Is feeling constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."... 
<P>"... Is perception constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."... 
<P>"... Are fabrications constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."... 
<P>"What do you think, monks -- Is consciousness constant or inconstant?" 
"Inconstant, lord." "And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?" 
"Stressful, lord." "And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, 
subject to change as: 'This is mine. This is my self. This is what I am'?" 
<P>"No, lord." 
<P>"Thus, monks, any form whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal 
or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: every form is to 
be seen as it actually is with right discernment as: 'This is not mine. This is 
not my self. This is not what I am.' 
<P>"Any feeling whatsoever... 
<P>"Any perception whatsoever... 
<P>"Any fabrications whatsoever... 
<P>"Any consciousness whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal or 
external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: every consciousness 
is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as: 'This is not mine. 
This is not my self. This is not what I am.' 
<P>"This, monks, is called a disciple of the noble ones who tears down and does 
not build up; who abandons and does not cling; who discards and does not pull 
in; who scatters and does not pile up. 
<P>"And what does he tear down and not build up? He tears down form and does not 
build it up. He tears down feeling... perception... fabrications... 
consciousness and does not build it up. 
<P>"And what does he abandon and not cling to? He abandons form and does not 
cling to it. He abandons feeling... perception... fabrications... consciousness 
and does not cling to it. 
<P>"And what does he discard and not pull in? He discards form and does not pull 
it in. He discards feeling... perception... fabrications... consciousness and 
does not pull it in. 
<P>"And what does he scatter and not pile up? He scatters form and does not pile 
it up. He scatters feeling... perception... fabrications... consciousness and 
does not pile it up. 
<P>"Seeing thus, the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted 
with form, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with perception, disenchanted 
with fabrications, disenchanted with consciousness. Disenchanted, he becomes 
dispassionate. Through dispassion, he is fully released. With full release, 
there is the knowledge, 'Fully released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the 
holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.' 
<P>"This, monks, is called a disciple of the noble ones who neither builds up 
nor tears down, but who stands having torn down; who neither clings nor 
abandons, but who stands having abandoned; who neither pulls in nor discards, 
but who stands having discarded; who neither piles up nor scatters, but who 
stands having scattered. 
<P>"And what is it that he neither builds up nor tears down, but stands having 
torn it down? He neither builds up nor tears down form, but stands having torn 
it down. He neither builds up nor tears down feeling... perception... 
fabrications... consciousness, but stands having torn it down. 
<P>"And what is it that he neither clings to nor abandons, but stands having 
abandoned it? He neither clings to nor abandons form, but stands having 
abandoned it. He neither clings to nor abandons feeling... perception... 
fabrications... consciousness, but stands having abandoned it. 
<P>"And what is it that he neither pulls in nor discards, but stands having 
discarded it? He neither pulls in nor discards form, but stands having discarded 
it. He neither pulls in nor discards feeling... perception... fabrications... 
consciousness, but stands having discarded it. 
<P>"And what is it that he neither piles up nor scatters, but stands having 
scattered it? He neither piles up nor scatters form, but stands having scattered 
it. He neither piles up nor scatters feeling... perception... fabrications... 
consciousness, but stands having scattered it. 
<P>"And to the monk whose mind is thus released, the devas, together with <A 
name=indra>Indra</A>, the Brahmas, &amp; <A name=pajapati>Pajapati</A>, pay 
homage even from afar: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>'Homage to you, O thoroughbred man.<BR>Homage to you, O 
  superlative man --<BR>you of whom we don't know even 
  what<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dependent on which<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you're 
  absorbed.'" </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Notes</H3>
<P><B><A name=n1>1</A>.</B> This passage suggests that there is a potential for 
each of the aggregates (form-ness, feeling-ness, etc.) to turn into discernible 
aggregates through the process of fabrication. See <A
