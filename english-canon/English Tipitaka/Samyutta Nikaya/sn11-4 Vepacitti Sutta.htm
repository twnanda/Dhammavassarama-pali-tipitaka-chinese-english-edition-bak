<DIV class=tnote>
<P><B>Translator's note: </B>This noble teaching on how to respond when faced 
with anger is placed in a mythical setting. The story is told by the Buddha of a 
great war between <I>devas</I> (gods) and <I>asuras</I> (demons) that took place 
in ancient times. The <I>devas</I> are ultimately victorious (as they are in the 
Greek and Norse versions of the same myth) and capture Vepacitti, the ruler of 
the <I>asuras</I>. Bound in chains, he is brought to Tavatimsa and into the 
presence of Sakka, ruler of the gods. </P>
<P>Being the demon that he his, Vepacitti hurls a torrent of abuse at his 
captor, calling him all sorts of insulting names (the catalogue of which in the 
commentary is most interesting). Sakka, however, is unmoved, inspiring Matali, 
his charioteer, to begin the following poetic exchange:</P></DIV>
<DIV class=sutta>
<DIV class=verse><PRE><SPAN class=spkr><I>[Matali:]</I></SPAN>
Could it be you're afraid, Sakka,
Or weak, that you forbear like this,
Though hearing such insulting words
From the mouth of Vepacitti?

<SPAN class=spkr><I>[Sakka:]</I></SPAN>
I am neither afraid nor weak,
Yet I forbear Vepacitti.
How is it one who knows, like me,
Would get provoked by such a fool?

<SPAN class=spkr><I>[Matali:]</I></SPAN>
More angry will a fool become
If no one puts a stop to him.
So let the wise restrain the fool
By the use of a mighty stick.

<SPAN class=spkr><I>[Sakka:]</I></SPAN>
This is the only thing, I deem,
That will put a stop to the fool:
Knowing well the other's anger, <!--jtb 050313: i.e., not denying the other's  anger -->
One is mindful and remains calm.

<SPAN class=spkr><I>[Matali:]</I></SPAN>
This very forbearance of yours,
Sakka, I see as a mistake.
For when a fool reckons like this:
"From fear of me he does forbear,"
The dolt will come on stronger still
— Like a bull the more that one flees.

<SPAN class=spkr><I>[Sakka:]</I></SPAN>
Let him think whatever he likes:
"From fear of me he does forbear."
Among ideals and highest goods
None better than patience is found.

For surely he who, being strong,
Forbears the ones who are more weak
— Forever enduring the weak — 
That is called the highest patience.

For whom strength is the strength of fools,
It is said of the strong "He's weak!"
For the strong, guarding the dhamma,
Contentiousness is never found.

It is indeed a fault for one
Who returns anger for anger.
Not giving anger for anger,
One wins a double victory.

He behaves for the good of both:
Himself and the other person.
Knowing well the other's anger,
He is mindful and remains calm.

In this way he is healing both:
Himself and the other person.
The people who think "He's a fool,"
Just don't understand the dhamma.
</PRE></DIV></DIV>

<P><B>Translator's note: </B>The poem is in the prevalent vatta meter, with 
eight syllables per line, and contains much subtle word-play. For example, the 
words bala (fool) and bala (strong) dance with one another throughout the piece 
(appearing fully 17 times), nowhere more intimately than in the frolicking 
alliteration of lines 31 and 32 (<I>abalan-tam balam aahu yassa balaabalam 
balam</I>). The linking of the word <I>titikkhati</I> (forbearance) with the 
similarly sounding <I>tikicchati</I> (healing) is also a poignant touch that is 
hardly accidental. </P>
<P>This exchange shows well how the Buddha adapted the heroic ideals of his 
warrior's heritage to the inner struggle for self-mastery. The strength of the 
victorious Sakka lies in his wisdom and forbearance. The weakness of the 
vanquished <I>asura</I> comes from his lack of understanding (hence the label 
'fool'), which renders him helpless to resist the passions raging within. </P>
<P>Though these verses were penned 2,500 years ago, the truth behind them is 
timeless. It is the same that has helped many non-violent social and political 
reform movements achieve dramatic results in our own century. Conquest is only 
the apparent victory of the short-sighted, while transformation of oneself and 
others is the more lasting victory of the wise. Remaining unprovoked in the face 
of anger and hostility still offers the best hope for healing our troubled 
world. </P></DIV><!-- #bbinclude "c.footer.html" --><!-- =============================================================== --><!-- THE TEXT BELOW IS AUTOMAGICALLY GENERATED FROM AN INCLUDE FILE. --><!-- robots content="none" -->
