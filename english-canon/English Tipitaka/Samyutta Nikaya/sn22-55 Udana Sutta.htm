<H1>Udana Sutta</H1>

<HR>
At <A name=savatthi>Savatthi</A>. There the Blessed One exclaimed this 
exclamation: "'It should not be, it should not occur to me (should not be mine); 
it will not be, it will not occur to me (will not be mine)': a monk set on this 
would break the [five] lower fetters." 
<P>When this was said, a certain monk said to the Blessed One, "In what way 
would a monk set on this -- 'It should not be, it should not occur to me; it 
will not be, it will not occur to me' -- break the [five] lower fetters?" 
<P>"There is the case, monk, where an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person -- 
who has no regard for noble ones, is not well-versed or disciplined in their 
Dhamma; who has no regard for men of integrity, is not well-versed or 
disciplined in their Dhamma -- assumes form to be the self, or the self as 
possessing form, or form as in the self, or the self as in form. 
<P>"He assumes feeling to be the self, or the self as possessing feeling, or 
feeling as in the self, or the self as in feeling. He assumes perception to be 
the self, or the self as possessing perception, or perception as in the self, or 
the self as in perception. He assumes (mental) fabrications to be the self, or 
the self as possessing fabrications, or fabrications as in the self, or the self 
as in fabrications. He assumes consciousness to be the self, or the self as 
possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in the self, or the self as in 
consciousness. 
<P>"He does not discern, as it actually is, inconstant form as 'inconstant 
form.' He does not discern, as it actually is, inconstant feeling as 'inconstant 
feeling' ... inconstant perception as 'inconstant perception' ... inconstant 
fabrications as 'inconstant fabrications' ... inconstant consciousness as 
'inconstant consciousness.' 
<P>"He does not discern, as it actually is, stressful form as 'stressful form' 
... stressful feeling as 'stressful feeling' ... stressful perception as 
'stressful perception' ... stressful fabrications as 'stressful fabrications' 
... stressful consciousness as 'stressful consciousness.' 
<P>"He does not discern, as it actually is, not-self form as 'not-self form' ... 
not-self feeling as 'not-self feeling' ... not-self perception as 'not-self 
perception' ... not-self fabrications as 'not-self fabrications' ... not-self 
consciousness as 'not-self consciousness.' 
<P>"He does not discern, as it actually is, fabricated form as 'fabricated form' 
... fabricated feeling as 'fabricated feeling' ... fabricated perception as 
'fabricated perception' ... fabricated fabrications as 'fabricated fabrications' 
... fabricated consciousness as 'fabricated consciousness.' 
<P>"He does not discern, as it actually is, that 'form will stop being' ... 
'feeling will stop being' ... 'perception will stop being' ... 'fabrications 
will stop being' ... 'consciousness will stop being.' 
<P>"Now, a well-instructed disciple of the noble ones -- who has regard for 
nobles ones, is well-versed &amp; disciplined in their Dhamma; who has regard 
for men of integrity, is well-versed &amp; disciplined in their Dhamma -- does 
not assume form to be the self, or the self as possessing form, or form as in 
the self, or the self as in form. He does not assume feeling to be the self... 
does not assume perception to be the self ... does not assume fabrications to be 
the self... He does not assume consciousness to be the self, or the self as 
possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in the self, or the self as in 
consciousness. 
<P>"He discerns, as it actually is, inconstant form as 'inconstant form' ... 
inconstant feeling as 'inconstant feeling' ... inconstant perception as 
'inconstant perception' ... inconstant fabrications as 'inconstant fabrications' 
... inconstant consciousness as 'inconstant consciousness.' 
<P>"He discerns, as it actually is, stressful form as 'stressful form' ... 
stressful feeling as 'stressful feeling' ... stressful perception as 'stressful 
perception' ... stressful fabrications as 'stressful fabrications' ... stressful 
consciousness as 'stressful consciousness.' 
<P>"He discerns, as it actually is, not-self form as 'not-self form' ... 
not-self feeling as 'not-self feeling' ... not-self perception as 'not-self 
perception' ... not-self fabrications as 'not-self fabrications' ... not-self 
consciousness as 'not-self consciousness.' 
<P>"He discerns, as it actually is, fabricated form as 'fabricated form' ... 
fabricated feeling as 'fabricated feeling' ... fabricated perception as 
'fabricated perception' ... fabricated fabrications as 'fabricated fabrications' 
... fabricated consciousness as 'fabricated consciousness.' 
<P>"He discerns, as it actually is, that 'form will stop being' ... 'feeling 
will stop being' ... 'perception will stop being' ... 'fabrications will stop 
being' ... 'consciousness will stop being.' 
<P>"From the stopping of form, from the stopping of feeling ... of perception 
... of fabrications ... of consciousness, a monk set on this -- 'It should not 
be, it should not occur to me; it will not be, it will not occur to me' -- would 
break the [five] lower fetters." 
<P>"Lord, a monk set on this would break the [five] lower fetters. But for one 
knowing in what way, seeing in what way, is there the immediate ending of 
fermentations?" 
<P>"There is the case where an uninstructed run-of-the-mill person ... falls 
into fear over what is not grounds for fear. There is fear for an uninstructed 
run-of-the-mill person [who thinks], 'It should not be, it should not occur to 
me; it will not be, it will not occur to me.' But an instructed disciple of the 
noble ones does not fall into fear over what is not grounds for fear. There is 
no fear for an instructed disciple of the noble ones [who thinks], 'It should 
not be, it should not occur to me; it will not be, it will not occur to me.' 
<P>"Should consciousness, when standing (still), stand attached to (a physical) 
form, supported by form (as its object), established on form, watered with 
delight, it would exhibit growth, increase, &amp; proliferation. 
<P>"Should consciousness, when standing (still), stand attached to feeling, 
supported by feeling (as its object), established on feeling, watered with 
delight, it would exhibit growth, increase, &amp; proliferation. 
<P>"Should consciousness, when standing (still), stand attached to perception, 
supported by perception (as its object), established on perception, watered with 
delight, it would exhibit growth, increase, &amp; proliferation. 
<P>"Should consciousness, when standing (still), stand attached to fabrications, 
supported by fabrications (as its object), established on fabrications, watered 
with delight, it would exhibit growth, increase, &amp; proliferation. 
<P>"Were someone to say, 'I will describe a coming, a going, a passing away, an 
arising, a growth, an increase, or a proliferation of consciousness apart from 
form, from feeling, from perception, from fabrications,' that would be 
impossible. 
<P>"If a monk abandons passion for the property of form ... 
<P>"If a monk abandons passion for the property of feeling ... 
<P>"If a monk abandons passion for the property of perception ... 
<P>"If a monk abandons passion for the property of fabrications ... 
<P>"If a monk abandons passion for the property of consciousness, then owing to 
the abandonment of passion, the support is cut off, and there is no base for 
consciousness. Consciousness, thus unestablished, not proliferating, not 
performing any function, is released. Owing to its release, it stands still. 
Owing to its stillness, it is contented. Owing to its contentment, it is not 
agitated. Not agitated, he (the monk) is totally unbound right within. He 
discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is 
nothing further for this world.' 
<P>"For one knowing in this way, seeing in this way, monk, there is the 
immediate ending of fermentations."
