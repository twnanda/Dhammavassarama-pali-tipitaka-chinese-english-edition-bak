<H1>Means of Propagation</H1><SMALL>Translated from the Pali by Thanissaro

<HR>
At <A name=savatthi>Savatthi</A>. There the Blessed One addressed the monks: 
"Monks." 
<P>"Yes, lord," the monks responded. 
<P>The Blessed One said: "Monks, there are these five means of propagation. 
Which five? Root-propagation, stem-propagation, joint-propagation, 
cutting-propagation, &amp; seed-propagation as the fifth. And if these five 
means of propagation are not broken, not rotten, not damaged by wind &amp; sun, 
mature, and well-buried, but there is no earth and no water, would they exhibit 
growth, increase, &amp; proliferation?" 
<P>"No, lord." 
<P>"And if these five means of propagation are broken, rotten, damaged by wind 
&amp; sun, immature, and poorly-buried, but there is earth &amp; water, would 
they exhibit growth, increase, &amp; proliferation?" 
<P>"No, lord." 
<P>"And if these five means of propagation are not broken, not rotten, not 
damaged by wind &amp; sun, mature, and well-buried, and there is earth &amp; 
water, would they exhibit growth, increase, &amp; proliferation?" 
<P>"Yes, lord." 
<P>"Like the earth property, monks, is how the four standing-spots for 
consciousness should be seen. Like the liquid property is how delight &amp; 
passion should be seen. Like the five means of propagation is how consciousness 
together with its nutriment should be seen. 
<P>"Should consciousness, when taking a stance, stand attached to (a physical) 
form, supported by form (as its object), established on form, watered with 
delight, it would exhibit growth, increase, &amp; proliferation. 
<P>"Should consciousness, when taking a stance, stand attached to feeling, 
supported by feeling (as its object), established on feeling, watered with 
delight, it would exhibit growth, increase, &amp; proliferation. 
<P>"Should consciousness, when taking a stance, stand attached to perception, 
supported by perception (as its object), established on perception, watered with 
delight, it would exhibit growth, increase, &amp; proliferation. 
<P>"Should consciousness, when taking a stance, stand attached to fabrications, 
supported by fabrications (as its object), established on fabrications, watered 
with delight, it would exhibit growth, increase, &amp; proliferation. 
<P>"Were someone to say, 'I will describe a coming, a going, a passing away, an 
arising, a growth, an increase, or a proliferation of consciousness apart from 
form, from feeling, from perception, from fabrications,' that would be 
impossible. 
<P>"If a monk abandons passion for the property of form... 
<P>"If a monk abandons passion for the property of feeling... 
<P>"If a monk abandons passion for the property of perception... 
<P>"If a monk abandons passion for the property of fabrications... 
<P>"If a monk abandons passion for the property of consciousness, then owing to 
the abandonment of passion, the support is cut off, and there is no base for 
consciousness. Consciousness, thus unestablished, not proliferating, not 
performing any function, is released. Owing to its release, it is steady. Owing 
to its steadiness, it is contented. Owing to its contentment, it is not 
agitated. Not agitated, he (the monk) is totally unbound right within. He 
discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is 
nothing further for this world.'"
