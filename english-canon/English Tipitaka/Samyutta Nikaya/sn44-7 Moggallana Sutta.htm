<HR>
Then Vacchagotta the wanderer went to Ven. Maha Moggallana and, on arrival, 
exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings 
&amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to Ven. 
Maha Moggallana, "Now then, Master Moggallana, is the cosmos eternal?" 
<P>"That has not been declared by the Blessed One, Vaccha: 'The cosmos is 
eternal.'" 
<P>"Well then, Master Moggallana, is the cosmos not eternal?" 
<P>"Vaccha, that too has not been declared by the Blessed One: 'The cosmos is 
not eternal.'" 
<P>"Then is the cosmos finite?"... "Is the cosmos infinite?"... "Is the body the 
same as the soul?"... "Is the body one thing, and the soul another?"... "Does 
the Tathagata exist after death?"... "Does the Tathagata not exist after 
death?"... "Does the Tathagata both exist and not exist after death?"... "Does 
the Tathagata neither exist nor not exist after death?" 
<P>"Vaccha, that too has not been declared by the Blessed One: 'The Tathagata 
neither exists nor does not exist after death." 
<P>"Now, Master Moggallana, what is the cause, what is the reason why -- when 
wanderers of other sects are asked in this way, they answer that 'The cosmos is 
eternal' or 'The cosmos is not eternal' or 'The cosmos is finite' or 'The cosmos 
is infinite' or 'The body is the same as the soul' or 'The body is one thing and 
the soul another' or 'The Tathagata exists after death' or 'The Tathagata does 
not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after 
death" or 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death,' yet 
when Gotama the contemplative is asked in this way, he does not answer that 'The 
cosmos is eternal' or 'The cosmos is not eternal' or 'The cosmos is finite' or 
'The cosmos is infinite' or 'The body is the same as the soul' or 'The body is 
one thing and the soul another' or 'The Tathagata exists after death' or 'The 
Tathagata does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata both exists and does not 
exist after death" or 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after 
death'?" 
<P>"Vaccha, the members of other sects assume of the eye that 'This is mine, 
this is my self, this is what I am.' They assume of the ear... the nose... the 
tongue... the body... the intellect that 'This is mine, this is my self, this is 
what I am.' That is why, when asked in this way, they answer that 'The cosmos is 
eternal'... or that 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after 
death.' But the Tathagata, worthy and rightly self-awakened, does not assume of 
the eye that 'This is mine, this is my self, this is what I am.' He does not 
assume of the ear... the nose... the tongue... the body... the intellect that 
'This is mine, this is my self, this is what I am.' That is why, when asked in 
this way, he does not answer that 'The cosmos is eternal'... or that 'The 
Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'" 
<P>The Vacchagotta the wanderer, getting up from his seat, went to the Blessed 
One and, on arrival, and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. 
After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As 
he was sitting there, he [addressed the same questions to the Blessed One and 
received exactly the same explanation]. 
<P>"Amazing, Master Gotama! Astounding! How the meaning and phrasing of the 
teacher and disciple agree, coincide, and do not diverge from one another with 
regard to the supreme teaching! Just now, Master Gotama, I went to the 
contemplative Moggallana and, on arrival, asked him about this matter, and he 
answered me with the same words, the same phrasing, as Master Gotama. Amazing, 
Master Gotama! Astounding! How the meaning and phrasing of the teacher and 
disciple agree, coincide, and do not diverge from one another with regard to the 
supreme teaching!"
