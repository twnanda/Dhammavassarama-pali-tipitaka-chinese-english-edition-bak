<H1>Bonanzas (3)</H1><SMALL>Translated from the Pali by Thanissaro

<HR>
"Monks, there are these four bonanzas of merit, bonanzas of skillfulness, 
nourishments of bliss. Which four? 
<P>"There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with 
unwavering confidence in the Awakened One: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy 
and rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge &amp; conduct, well-gone, an 
expert with regard to the world, unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to 
be tamed, the Teacher of divine &amp; human beings, awakened, blessed.' This is 
the first bonanza of merit, bonanza of skillfulness, nourishment of bliss. 
<P>"Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with unwavering 
confidence in the Dhamma: 'The Dhamma is well-expounded by the Blessed One, to 
be seen here &amp; now, timeless, inviting verification, pertinent, to be 
realized by the wise for themselves.' This is the second bonanza of merit, 
bonanza of skillfulness, nourishment of bliss. 
<P>"Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with unwavering 
confidence in the Sangha: 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples who have 
practiced well...who have practiced straight-forwardly...who have practiced 
methodically...who have practiced masterfully -- in other words, the four types 
of noble disciples when taken as pairs, the eight when taken as individual types 
-- they are the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples: worthy of gifts, worthy 
of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect, the incomparable field 
of merit for the world.' This is the third bonanza of merit, bonanza of 
skillfulness, nourishment of bliss. 
<P>"Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones is discerning, endowed with 
discernment of arising &amp; passing away -- noble, penetrating, leading to the 
right ending of stress. This is the fourth bonanza of merit, bonanza of 
skillfulness, nourishment of bliss. 
<P>"These are four bonanzas of merit, bonanzas of skillfulness, nourishments of 
bliss."
