Dwelling at <a name="savatthi">Savatthi</a>... Then a certain brahmin went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "What now, Master Gotama: Is the one who acts the same one who experiences [the results of the act]?"
<p>
[The Buddha:] "[To say,] 'The one who acts is the same one who experiences,' is one extreme."
<p>
[The brahmin:] "Then, Master Gotama, is the one who acts someone other than the one who experiences?"
<p>
[The Buddha:] "[To say,] 'The one who acts is someone other than the one who experiences,' is the second extreme. Avoiding both of these extremes, the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma by means of the middle: 
<p>
"From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications. 
<p>
"From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness. 
<p>
"From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-&amp;-form. 
<p>
"From name-&amp;-form as a requisite condition come the six sense media. 
<p>
"From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact. 
<p>
"From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling. 
<p>
"From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving. 
<p>
"From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance. 
<p>
"From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming. 
<p>
"From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth. 
<p>
"From birth as a requisite condition, then aging &amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair come into play. Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress &amp; suffering.
<p>
"Now from the remainderless fading &amp; cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications. From the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness. From the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name-&amp;-form. From the cessation of name-&amp;-form comes the cessation of the six sense media. From the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact. From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling. From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving. From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging/ sustenance. From the cessation of clinging/sustenance comes the cessation of becoming. From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth. From the cessation of birth, then aging &amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair all cease. Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress &amp; suffering."
<p>
When this was said, the brahmin said to the Blessed One: "<A NAME="magnif">Magnificent</A>, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to point out the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama -- through many lines of reasoning -- made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, &amp; to the community of monks. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge  from this day forward, for life."
