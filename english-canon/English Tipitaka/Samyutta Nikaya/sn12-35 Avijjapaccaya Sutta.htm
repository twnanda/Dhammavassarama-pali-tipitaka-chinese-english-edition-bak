<H1>From Ignorance as a Requisite Condition</H1><SMALL>Translated from the Pali

</CENTER>
<HR>
<SMALL><B>Translator's note:</B> In this discourse, the Buddha refuses to answer 
the question of whether there is anyone or anything lying behind the processes 
described in dependent origination. When his interlocutor asks, for each factor 
in the causal process, "Which is the X, and whose is the X?", the Buddha equates 
this with the assumption that "X is one thing, and it is the X of 
someone/something else." He then equates this with the proposition, which he has 
rejected many times elsewhere in the discourses, that the life-principle is one 
thing, and the body is something else, i.e., that there is something unseen 
lying behind the visible processes of life. However, the Buddha has also 
rejected, in as many times, the proposition that the life-principle is the same 
as the body, i.e., that there is nothing unseen lying behind the visible 
processes of life. Avoiding these two extremes, he simply drops the question and 
focuses attention on what is directly perceivable -- the way one factor in 
dependent co-arising functions as a prerequisite for the next. If one were to 
focus on what might or might not lie behind these factors, one would be tied up 
in speculations about what, by definition, can never be experienced. But by 
focusing on the interplay of the factors that are directly perceivable, and -- 
by so doing -- developing dispassion for them, one can overcome the craving and 
ignorance that keep producing stress and suffering, and in that way gain 
release. </SMALL>

<P>Staying at Savatthi... [the Blessed One said,] "From ignorance as a requisite 
condition come fabrications... From birth as a requisite condition, then 
aging-&amp;-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair come into 
play. Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress &amp; suffering." 
<P>When this was said, a certain monk said to the Blessed One: "Which is the 
aging &amp; death, lord, and whose is the aging &amp; death?" 
<P>"Not a valid question," the Blessed One said. "If one were to ask, 'Which is 
the aging &amp; death, and whose is the aging-&amp;-death?' and if one were to 
say, 'Aging &amp; death are one thing, and the aging &amp; death are 
something/someone else's,' both of them would have the same meaning, even though 
their words would differ. When one is of the view that the life-principle is the 
same as the body, there is no leading the holy life. And when one is of the view 
that the life-principle is one thing and the body another, there is no leading 
the holy life. Avoiding these two extremes, the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma via 
the middle: From birth as a requisite condition comes aging &amp; death." 
<P>"Which is the birth, lord, and whose is the birth?" 
<P>"Not a valid question," the Blessed One said... "From becoming as a requisite 
condition comes birth." 
<P>"Which is the becoming, lord, and whose is the becoming?" 
<P>"Not a valid question," the Blessed One said... "From clinging as a requisite 
condition comes becoming." 
<P>"Which is the clinging, lord, and whose is the clinging?" 
<P>"Not a valid question," the Blessed One said... "From craving as a requisite 
condition comes clinging." 
<P>"Which is the craving, lord, and whose is the craving?" 
<P>"Not a valid question," the Blessed One said... "From feeling as a requisite 
condition comes craving." 
<P>"Which is the feeling, lord, and whose is the feeling?" 
<P>"Not a valid question," the Blessed One said... "From contact as a requisite 
condition comes feeling." 
<P>"Which is the contact, lord, and whose is the contact?" 
<P>"Not a valid question," the Blessed One said... "From the six sense media as 
a requisite condition comes contact." 
<P>"Which are the six sense media, lord, and whose are the six sense media?" 
<P>"Not a valid question," the Blessed One said... "From name-&amp;-form as a 
requisite condition come the six sense media." 
<P>"Which is the name-&amp;-form, lord, and whose is the name-&amp;-form?" 
<P>"Not a valid question," the Blessed One said... "From consciousness as a 
requisite condition comes name-&amp;-form." 
<P>"Which is the consciousness, lord, and whose is the consciousness?" 
<P>"Not a valid question," the Blessed One said... "From fabrications as a 
requisite condition comes consciousness." 
<P>"Which are the fabrications, lord, and whose are the fabrications?" 
<P>"Not a valid question," the Blessed One said. "If one were to ask, 'Which are 
the fabrications, and whose are the fabrications?' and if one were to say, 
'Fabrications are one thing, and these fabrications are something/someone 
else's,' both of them would have the same meaning, even though their words would 
differ. When one is of the view that the life-principle is the same as the body, 
there is no leading the holy life. And when one is of the view that the 
life-principle is one thing and the body another, there is no leading the holy 
life. Avoiding these two extremes, the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma via the 
middle: From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications. 
<P>"Now from the remainderless fading &amp; cessation of that very ignorance, 
every one of these writhings &amp; wrigglings &amp; wigglings -- 'Which aging 
&amp; death, and whose aging &amp; death?' or 'Aging &amp; death are one thing, 
and this aging &amp; death are something/someone else's' or 'The life-principle 
is the same as the body,' or 'The life-principle is one thing and the body 
another' -- are abandoned, their root destroyed, like an uprooted palm tree, 
deprived of the conditions of existence, not destined for future arising. 
<P>"From the remainderless fading &amp; cessation of that very ignorance, every 
one of these writhings &amp; wrigglings &amp; wigglings -- 'Which is the 
birth... Which is the becoming... Which is the clinging... Which is the 
craving... Which is the feeling... Which is the contact... Which are the six 
sense media... Which is the name-&amp;-form... Which is the consciousness... 
Which are the fabrications, and whose are the fabrications?' or 'Fabrications 
are one thing, and these fabrications are something/someone else's' or 'The 
life-principle is the same as the body,' or 'The life-principle is one thing and 
the body another' -- are abandoned, their root destroyed, like an uprooted palm 
tree, deprived of the conditions of existence, not destined for future arising."
