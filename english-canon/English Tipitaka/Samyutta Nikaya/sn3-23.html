<hr>
At Savatthi. As he was sitting to one side, <A NAME="pasenadi">King Pasenadi Kosala</A> said to the Blessed One: "How many qualities of the world that, when arising, arise for harm, stress, &amp; discomfort?"
<p>
"Three qualities of the world, great king, when arising, arise for harm, stress, &amp; discomfort. Which three? Greed, great king, is a quality of the world that, when arising, arises for harm, stress, &amp; discomfort. Aversion...Delusion is a quality of the world that, when arising, arises for harm, stress, &amp; discomfort. These are the three qualities of the world, great king, that when arising, arise for harm, stress, &amp; discomfort."
<p>
That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:
<p>
<blockquote>
"<A NAME="reed">Greed</A>, aversion, &amp; delusion<br>
-- born from oneself -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; destroy<br>
the person of evil awareness,<br>
as its own fruit, the reed." 
</blockquote>
