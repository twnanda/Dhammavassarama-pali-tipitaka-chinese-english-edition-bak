I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="savatthi">Savatthi</A> in the Eastern Monastery, the <A NAME="migaramom">palace</A> of Migara's mother. Now on that occasion the Blessed One, on emerging from seclusion in the late afternoon, sat warming his back in the western sun. Then <A NAME="ananda">Ven. Ananda</A> went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, massaged the Blessed One's limbs with his hand and said, "<A NAME="buddha">It's amazing</A>, lord. It's astounding, how the Blessed One's complexion is no longer so clear &amp; bright; his limbs are flabby &amp; wrinkled; his back, bent forward; there's a discernible change in his faculties -- the faculty of the eye, the faculty of the ear, the faculty of the nose, the faculty of the tongue, the faculty of the body."
<p>
"That's the way it is, Ananda. When young, one is subject to aging; when healthy, subject to illness; when alive, subject to death. The complexion is no longer so clear &amp; bright; the limbs are flabby &amp; wrinkled; the back, bent forward; there's a discernible change in the faculties -- the faculty of the eye, the faculty of the ear, the faculty of the nose, the faculty of the tongue, the faculty of the body."
<p>
That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-gone, the Teacher, said further:
<blockquote>
<A NAME="spit">I spit</A> on you, old age -- <br>
old age that makes for ugliness.<br>
The bodily image, so charming,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is trampled by old age.<br>
Even those who live to a hundred<br>
are headed -- all -- to an end in death,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which spares no one,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which tramples all.
</blockquote>
