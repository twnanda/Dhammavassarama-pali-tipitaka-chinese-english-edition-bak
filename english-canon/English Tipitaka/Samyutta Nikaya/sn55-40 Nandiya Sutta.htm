<HR>
On one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the <A name=sakyan>Sakyans</A> 
near <A name=kapilavatthu>Kapilavatthu</A> in Nigrodha's Park. Then Nandiya the 
Sakyan went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to 
one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, "Lord, the 
disciple of the noble ones in whom the factors of stream entry are altogether 
&amp; in every way lacking: Is he called a disciple of the noble ones who lives 
heedlessly?" 
<P>"Nandiya, the person in whom the factors of stream entry are altogether &amp; 
in every way lacking I call an outsider, one who stands in the faction of the 
run-of-the-mill. But as to how a disciple of the noble ones lives heedlessly and 
heedfully, listen well and pay attention, I will speak" 
<P>"As you say, lord," Nandiya the Sakyan responded. 
<P>The Blessed One said, "And how, Nandiya, does a disciple of the noble ones 
live heedlessly? There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones is endowed 
with unwavering confidence in the Awakened One: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is 
worthy and rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge &amp; conduct, 
well-gone, an expert with regard to the world, unexcelled as a trainer for those 
people fit to be tamed, the Teacher of divine &amp; human beings, awakened, 
blessed.' Content with that unwavering confidence in the Awakened One, he does 
not exert himself further in solitude by day or seclusion by night. For him, 
living thus heedlessly, there is no joy. There being no joy, there is no 
rapture. There being no rapture, there is no serenity. There being no serenity, 
he dwells in pain. When pained, the mind does not become centered. When the mind 
is uncentered, phenomena do not become manifest. When phenomena are not 
manifest, he is reckoned simply as one who dwells heedlessly. 
<P>"Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with unwavering 
confidence in the Dhamma: 'The Dhamma is well-expounded by the Blessed One, to 
be seen here &amp; now, timeless, inviting verification, pertinent, to be 
realized by the wise for themselves.' Content with that unwavering confidence in 
the Dhamma, he does not exert himself further in solitude by day or seclusion by 
night. For him, living thus heedlessly, there is no joy. There being no joy, 
there is no rapture. There being no rapture, there is no serenity. There being 
no serenity, he dwells in pain. When pained, the mind does not become centered. 
When the mind is uncentered, phenomena do not become manifest. When phenomena 
are not manifest, he is reckoned simply as one who dwells heedlessly. 
<P>"Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with unwavering 
confidence in the 'The Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced 
well... who have practiced straight-forwardly... who have practiced 
methodically... who have practiced masterfully -- in other words, the four types 
of noble disciples when taken as pairs, the eight when taken as individual types 
-- they are the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples: worthy of gifts, worthy 
of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect, the incomparable field 
of merit for the world.' Content with that unwavering confidence in the Sangha, 
he does not exert himself further in solitude by day or seclusion by night. For 
him, living thus heedlessly, there is no joy. There being no joy, there is no 
rapture. There being no rapture, there is no serenity. There being no serenity, 
he dwells in pain. When pained, the mind does not become centered. When the mind 
is uncentered, phenomena do not become manifest. When phenomena are not 
manifest, he is reckoned simply as one who dwells heedlessly. 
<P>"Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with virtues that are 
appealing to the noble ones: untorn, unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered, 
liberating, praised by the wise, untarnished, leading to concentration. Content 
with those virtues pleasing to the noble ones, he does not exert himself further 
in solitude by day or seclusion by night. For him, living thus heedlessly, there 
is no joy. There being no joy, there is no rapture. There being no rapture, 
there is no serenity. There being no serenity, he dwells in pain. When pained, 
the mind does not become centered. When the mind is uncentered, phenomena do not 
become manifest. When phenomena are not manifest, he is reckoned simply as one 
who dwells heedlessly. 
<P>"This is how a disciple of the noble ones lives heedlessly. 
<P>"And how, Nandiya, does a disciple of the noble ones live heedfully? There is 
the case where a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with unwavering 
confidence in the Awakened One... Not content with that unwavering confidence in 
the Awakened One, he exerts himself further in solitude by day or seclusion by 
night. For him, living thus heedfully, joy arises. In one who has joy, rapture 
arises. In one who has rapture, the body becomes serene. When the body is 
serene, one feels pleasure. Feeling pleasure, the mind becomes centered. When 
the mind is centered, phenomena become manifest. When phenomena are manifest, he 
is reckoned as one who dwells heedfully. 
<P>"Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with unwavering 
confidence in the Dhamma... unwavering confidence in the Sangha... virtues that
