"Monks, suppose that this great earth were totally covered with water, and a man were to toss a yoke with a single hole there. A wind from the east would push it west, a wind from the west would push it east. A wind from the north would push it south, a wind from the south would push it north. And suppose a blind sea-turtle were there. It would come to the surface once every one hundred years. Now what do you think: would that blind sea-turtle, coming to the surface once every one hundred years, stick his neck into the yoke with a single hole?"
<p>
"It would be a sheer coincidence, lord, that the blind sea-turtle, coming to the surface once every one hundred years, would stick his neck into the yoke with a single hole."
<p>
"It's likewise a sheer coincidence that one obtains the human state. It's likewise a sheer coincidence that a Tathagata, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened, arises in the world. It's likewise a sheer coincidence that a doctrine &amp; discipline expounded by a Tathagata appears in the world. Now, this human state has been obtained. A Tathagata, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened, has arisen in the world. A doctrine &amp; discipline expounded by a Tathagata appears in the world.
<p>
"Therefore your duty is the contemplation: 'This is stress...This is the origination of stress...This is the cessation of stress...This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.'"
