<hr>
Setting at Savatthi. Then, in the morning, the bhikkhuni Uppalavanna dressed ... she stood at the foot of a <i>sala</i> tree in full flower.
<p>
Then Mara the Evil One, desiring to arouse fear, trepidation, and terror in the bhikkhuni Uppalavanna, desiring to make her fall away from concentration, approached her and addressed her in verse:
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Having gone to a <i>sala</i> tree with flowering top, <br>
You stand at its foot all alone, bhikkhuni.<br>
There is none whose beauty can rival your own: <br>
Foolish girl, have you no fear of rogues?"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Then it occurred to the bhikkhuni Uppalavanna: [132] "Now who is this...? This is Mara the Evil One ... desiring to make me fall away from concentration."
<p>
Then the bhikkhuni Uppalavanna, having understood, "This is Mara the Evil One," replied to him in verses:
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Though a hundred thousand rogues<br>
Just like you might come here, <br>
I stir not a hair, I feel no terror;<br>
Even alone, Mara, I don't fear you.
<p>
I can make myself disappear <br>
Or I can enter inside your belly.<br>
I can stand between your eyebrows<br>
Yet you won't catch a glimpse of me.
<p>
I am the master of my own mind,<br>
The bases of power are well developed;<br>
I am freed from every kind of bondage,<br>
Therefore I don't fear you, friend."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Then Mara the Evil One, realizing, "The bhikkhuni Uppalavanna knows me," sad and disappointed, disappeared right there.
