I have heard that on one occasion a certain monk was dwelling among the <A NAME="kosala">Kosalans</A> in a forest thicket. Now at that time, he spent the day's abiding thinking evil, unskillful thoughts: i.e., thoughts of sensuality, thoughts of ill will, thoughts of doing harm.
<p>
Then the devata inhabiting the forest thicket, feeling sympathy for the monk, desiring his benefit, desiring to bring him to his senses, approached him and addressed him with this verse:
<blockquote>
From inappropriate attention<br>
you're being chewed by your thoughts.<br>
Relinquishing what's inappropriate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contemplate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appropriately.
<p>
Keeping your mind on the Teacher,<br>
the Dhamma, the Sangha, your virtues,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you will arrive at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; joy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rapture,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pleasure<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without doubt.
<p>
Then,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; saturated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with joy,<br>
you will put an end<br>
to suffering &amp; stress.
</blockquote>
The monk, chastened by the devata, came to his senses.
