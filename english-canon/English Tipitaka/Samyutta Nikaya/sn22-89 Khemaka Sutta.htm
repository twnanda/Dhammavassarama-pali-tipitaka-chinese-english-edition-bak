<HR>
On one occasion many elder monks were staying at <A name=kosambi>Kosambi</A> in 
Ghosita's Park. And at that time Ven. Khemaka was staying at the Jujube Tree 
Park, diseased, in pain, severely ill. Then in the late afternoon the elder 
monks left their seclusion and addressed <A name=dasaka>Ven. Dasaka</A>, 
[saying,] "Come, friend Dasaka. Go to the monk Khemaka and on arrival say to 
him, 'The elders, friend Khemaka, say to you, "We hope you are getting better, 
friend. We hope you are comfortable. We hope that your pains are lessening and 
not increasing. We hope that there are signs of their lessening, and not of 
their increasing."'" 
<P>Replying, "As you say, friends," to the elder monks, Ven. Dasaka went to Ven. 
Khemaka and on arrival said to him: "The elders, friend Khemaka, say to you, 'We 
hope you are getting better, friend. We hope you are comfortable. We hope that 
your pains are lessening and not increasing. We hope that there are signs of 
their lessening, and not of their increasing.'" 
<P>"I am not getting better, my friend. I am not comfortable. My extreme pains 
are increasing, not lessening. There are signs of their increasing, and not of 
their lessening." 
<P>Then Ven. Dasaka went to the elder monks and, on arrival, said to them, "The 
monk Khemaka has said to me, 'I am not getting better, my friend. I am not 
comfortable. My extreme pains are increasing, not lessening. There are signs of 
their increasing, and not of their lessening.'" 
<P>"Come, friend Dasaka. Go to the monk Khemaka and on arrival say to him, 'The 
elders, friend Khemaka, say to you, "Concerning these five clinging-aggregates 
described by the Blessed One -- i.e., form as a clinging-aggregate, feeling as a 
clinging-aggregate, perception as a clinging-aggregate, fabrications as a 
clinging-aggregate, consciousness as a clinging-aggregate: Do you assume 
anything with regard to these five clinging-aggregates to be self or belonging 
to self?"'" 
<P>Replying, "As you say, friends," to the elder monks, Ven. Dasaka went to Ven. 
Khemaka and on arrival said to him, "The elders, friend Khemaka, say to you, 
'Concerning these five clinging-aggregates described by the Blessed One -- i.e., 
form as a clinging-aggregate, feeling as a clinging-aggregate, perception as a 
clinging-aggregate, fabrications as a clinging-aggregate, consciousness as a 
clinging-aggregate: Do you assume anything with regard to these five 
clinging-aggregates to be self or belonging to self?'" 
<P>"Friend, concerning these five clinging-aggregates described by the Blessed 
One -- i.e., form as a clinging-aggregate... feeling... perception... 
fabrications... consciousness as a clinging-aggregate: With regard to these five 
clinging-aggregates, there is nothing I assume to be self or belonging to self." 

<P>Then Ven. Dasaka went to the elder monks and, on arrival, said to them, "The 
monk Khemaka has said to me, 'Friend, concerning these five clinging-aggregates 
described by the Blessed One -- i.e., form as a clinging-aggregate... feeling... 
perception... fabrications... consciousness as a clinging-aggregate: With regard 
to these five clinging-aggregates, there is nothing I assume to be self or 
belonging to self.'" 
<P>"Come, friend Dasaka. Go to the monk Khemaka and on arrival say to him, 'The 
elders, friend Khemaka, say to you, "Concerning these five clinging-aggregates 
described by the Blessed One -- i.e., form as a clinging-aggregate... feeling... 
perception... fabrications... consciousness as a clinging-aggregate: If, with 
regard to these five clinging-aggregates, Ven. Khemaka assumes nothing to be 
self or belonging to self, then Ven. Khemaka is an arahant, devoid of 
fermentations."'" 
<P>Replying, "As you say, friends," to the elder monks, Ven. Dasaka went to Ven. 
Khemaka and on arrival said to him, "The elders, friend Khemaka, say to you, 
'Concerning these five clinging-aggregates described by the Blessed One -- i.e., 
form as a clinging-aggregate... feeling... perception... fabrications... 
consciousness as a clinging-aggregate: If, with regard to these five 
clinging-aggregates, Ven. Khemaka assumes nothing to be self or belonging to 
self, then Ven. Khemaka is an arahant, devoid of fermentations.'" 
<P>"Friend, concerning these five clinging-aggregates described by the Blessed 
One -- i.e., form as a clinging-aggregate... feeling... perception... 
fabrications... consciousness as a clinging-aggregate: With regard to these five 
clinging-aggregates, there <I>is</I> nothing I assume to be self or belonging to 
self, and yet I am not an arahant. With regard to these five 
clinging-aggregates, 'I am' has not been overcome, although I don't assume that 
'I am this.'" 
<P>Then Ven. Dasaka went to the elder monks and, on arrival, said to them, "The 
monk Khemaka has said to me, 'Friend, concerning these five clinging-aggregates 
described by the Blessed One -- i.e., form as a clinging-aggregate... feeling... 
perception... fabrications... consciousness as a clinging-aggregate: With regard 
to these five clinging-aggregates, there <I>is</I> nothing I assume to be self 
or belonging to self, and yet I am not an arahant. With regard to these five 
clinging-aggregates, "I am" has not been overcome, although I don't assume that 
"I am this."'" 
<P>"Come, friend Dasaka. Go to the monk Khemaka and on arrival say to him, 'The 
elders, friend Khemaka, say to you, "Friend Khemaka, this 'I am' of which you 
speak: what do you say 'I am'? Do you say, 'I am form,' or do you say, 'I am 
something other than form'? Do you say, 'I am feeling... perception... 
fabrications... consciousness,' or do you say, 'I am something other than 
consciousness'? This 'I am' of which you speak: what do you say 'I am'?"'" 
<P>Replying, "As you say, friends," to the elder monks, Ven. Dasaka went to Ven. 
Khemaka and on arrival said to him, "The elders, friend Khemaka, say to you, 
'Friend Khemaka, this "I am" of which you speak: what do you say "I am"? Do you 
say, "I am form," or do you say, "I am something other than form"? Do you say, 
"I am feeling... perception... fabrications... consciousness," or do you say, "I 
am something other than consciousness"'? This "I am" of which you speak: what do 
you say "I am"?'" 
<P>"Enough, friend Dasaka. What is accomplished by this running back &amp; 
forth? Fetch me my staff. I will go to the elder monks myself." 
<P>Then Ven. Khemaka, leaning on his staff, went to the elder monks and, on 
arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with them. After an exchange of friendly 
greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the 
elder monks said to him, "Friend Khemaka, this 'I am' of which you speak: what 
do you say 'I am'? Do you say, 'I am form,' or do you say, 'I am something other 
than form'? Do you say, 'I am feeling... perception... fabrications... 
consciousness,' or do you say, 'I am something other than consciousness''? This 
'I am' of which you speak: what do you say 'I am'?" 
<P>"Friends, it's not that I say 'I am form,' nor do I say 'I am something other 
than form.' It's not that I say, 'I am feeling... perception... fabrications... 
consciousness,' nor do I say, 'I am something other than consciousness.' With 
regard to these five clinging-aggregates, 'I am' has not been overcome, although 
I don't assume that 'I am this.' 
<P><A name=lotus>"It's just like the scent of a blue, red, or white lotus</A>: 
If someone were to call it the scent of a petal or the scent of the color or the 
scent of a filament, would he be speaking correctly?" 
<P>"No, friend." 
<P>"Then how would he describe it if he were describing it correctly?" 
<P>"As the scent of the flower: That's how he would describe it if he were 
describing it correctly." 
<P>"In the same way, friends, it's not that I say 'I am form,' nor do I say 'I 
am other than form.' It's not that I say, 'I am feeling... perception... 
fabrications... consciousness,' nor do I say, 'I am something other than 
consciousness.' With regard to these five clinging-aggregates, 'I am' has not 
been overcome, although I don't assume that 'I am this.' 
<P>"Friends, even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters, 
he still has with regard to the five clinging-aggregates a lingering residual 'I 
am' conceit, an 'I am' desire, an 'I am' obsession. But at a later time he keeps 
focusing on the phenomena of arising &amp; passing away with regard to the five 
clinging-aggregates: 'Such is form, such its origin, such its disappearance. 
Such is feeling... Such is perception... Such are fabrications... Such is 
consciousness, such its origin, such its disappearance.' As he keeps focusing on 
the arising &amp; passing away of these five clinging-aggregates, the lingering 
residual 'I am' conceit, 'I am' desire, 'I am' obsession is fully obliterated. 
<P>"<A name=cloth>Just like a cloth</A>, dirty &amp; stained: Its owners give it 
over to a washerman, who scrubs it with salt earth or lye or cow-dung and then 
rinses it in clear water. Now even though the cloth is clean &amp; spotless, it 
still has a lingering residual scent of salt earth or lye or cow-dung. The 
washerman gives it to the owners, the owners put it away in a scent-infused 
wicker hamper, and its lingering residual scent of salt earth, lye, or cow-dung 
is fully obliterated. 
<P>"In the same way, friends, even though a noble disciple has abandoned the 
five lower fetters, he still has with regard to the five clinging-aggregates a 
lingering residual 'I am' conceit, an 'I am' desire, an 'I am' obsession. But at 
a later time he keeps focusing on the phenomena of arising &amp; passing away 
with regard to the five clinging-aggregates: 'Such is form, such its origin, 
such its disappearance. Such is feeling... Such is perception... Such are 
fabrications... Such is consciousness, such its origin, such its disappearance.' 
As he keeps focusing on the arising &amp; passing away of these five 
clinging-aggregates, the lingering residual 'I am' conceit, 'I am' desire, 'I 
am' obsession is fully obliterated." 
<P>When this was said, the elder monks said to Ven. Khemaka, "We didn't 
cross-examine Ven. Khemaka with the purpose of troubling him, just that [we 
thought] Ven. Khemaka is capable of declaring the Blessed One's message, 
teaching it, describing it, setting it forth, revealing it, explaining it, 
making it plain -- just as he has in fact declared it, taught it, described it, 
set it forth, revealed it, explained it, made it plain." 
<P>That is what Ven. Khemaka said. Gratified, the elder monks delighted in his 
words. And while this explanation was being given, the minds of sixty-some 
monks, through no clinging, were fully released from fermentations -- as was 
Ven. Khemaka's. <!-- #bbinclude "footer.html" --><!-- THE TEXT BELOW IS AUTOMAGICALLY GENERATED FROM AN INCLUDE FILE. --><!-- robots content="none" -->
