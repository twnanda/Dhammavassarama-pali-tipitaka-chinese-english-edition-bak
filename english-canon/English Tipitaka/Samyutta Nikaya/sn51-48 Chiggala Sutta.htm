"Monks, suppose that this great earth were totally covered with water, and a man 
were to toss a yoke with a single hole there. A wind from the east would push it 
west, a wind from the west would push it east. A wind from the north would push 
it south, a wind from the south would push it north. And suppose a blind 
sea-turtle were there. It would come to the surface once every one hundred 
years. Now what do you think: would that blind sea-turtle, coming to the surface 
once every one hundred years, stick his neck into the yoke with a single hole?" 
<P>"It would be a sheer coincidence, lord, that the blind sea-turtle, coming to 
the surface once every one hundred years, would stick his neck into the yoke 
with a single hole." 
<P>"It's likewise a sheer coincidence that one obtains the human state. It's 
likewise a sheer coincidence that a Tathagata, worthy &amp; rightly 
self-awakened, arises in the world. It's likewise a sheer coincidence that a 
doctrine &amp; discipline expounded by a Tathagata appears in the world. Now, 
this human state has been obtained. A Tathagata, worthy &amp; rightly 
self-awakened, has arisen in the world. A doctrine &amp; discipline expounded by 
a Tathagata appears in the world. 
<P>"Therefore your duty is the contemplation, 'This is stress... This is the 
origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress.' Your duty is the 
contemplation, 'This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of 
stress.'" <!-- #bbinclude "footer.html" --><!-- THE TEXT BELOW IS AUTOMAGICALLY GENERATED FROM AN INCLUDE FILE. --><!-- robots content="none" -->
