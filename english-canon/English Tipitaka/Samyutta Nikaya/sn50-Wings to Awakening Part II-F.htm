<B><A name=90>§ 90</A>.</B> There are these five strengths. Which five? Strength 
of conviction, strength of persistence, strength of mindfulness, strength of 
concentration, &amp; strength of discernment. These are the five strengths. 
<P>Just as <A name=ganges90>the River Ganges</A> flows to the east, slopes to 
the east, inclines to the east, in the same way when a monk develops &amp; 
pursues the five strengths, he flows to Unbinding, slopes to Unbinding, inclines 
to Unbinding. 
<P>And how is it that when a monk develops &amp; pursues the five strengths, he 
flows... slopes... inclines to Unbinding? 
<P>There is the case where the monk develops strength of conviction dependent on 
seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in letting 
go. He develops strength of persistence... mindfulness... concentration... 
discernment dependent on seclusion... dispassion... cessation, resulting in 
letting go. 
<P>This is how a monk, when developing &amp; pursuing the five strengths, 
flows... slopes... inclines to Unbinding.

<P><BR>
<P><B><A name=91>§ 91</A>.</B> There is a manner of reckoning whereby the five 
faculties are the same as the five strengths, and the five strengths the same as 
the five faculties. And what is that method? 
<P>Whatever is the faculty of conviction, that is the strength of conviction. 
Whatever is the strength of conviction, that is the faculty of conviction. 
Whatever is the faculty of persistence, that is the strength of persistence. 
Whatever is the strength of persistence, that is the faculty of persistence. 
Whatever is the faculty of mindfulness, that is the strength of mindfulness. 
Whatever is the strength of mindfulness, that is the faculty of mindfulness. 
Whatever is the faculty of concentration, that is the strength of concentration. 
Whatever is the strength of concentration, that is the faculty of concentration. 
Whatever is the faculty of discernment, that is the strength of discernment. 
Whatever is the strength of discernment, that is the faculty of discernment. 
<P>Imagine a river -- flowing, sloping, inclining toward the east -- in whose 
midst is an <A name=island91>island</A>. There is a manner of reckoning whereby 
the river is classified as one current, and another manner of reckoning whereby 
it is classified as two. 
<P>And what is the first manner of reckoning? Whatever water lies to the east of 
the island, and whatever water lies to the west. This is the manner of reckoning 
whereby the river is classified as one current. 
<P>And what is the second manner of reckoning? Whatever water lies to the north 
of the island, and whatever water lies to the south. This is the manner of 
reckoning whereby the river is classified as two. 
<P>In the same way, whatever is the faculty of conviction, that is the strength 
of conviction. Whatever is the strength of conviction, that is the faculty of 
conviction... Whatever is the faculty of discernment, that is the strength of 
discernment. Whatever is the strength of discernment, that is the faculty of 
discernment.
