<h1>The Samyutta Nikaya</h1>
<h3>The Grouped Discourses</h3>
</center>
<hr>
The Samyutta Nikaya, the third division of the <A HREF="../sutta.html">Sutta Pitaka</A>, contains 2,889 suttas grouped into five sections <i>(vaggas).</i> Each <i>vagga</i> is further divided into <i>samyuttas,</i> each of which in turn contains a group of suttas on related topics. The <i>samyuttas</i> are named according to the topics of the suttas they contain. For example, the Kosala Samyutta (in the Sagatha Vagga) contains suttas concerning King Pasenadi of Kosala; the Vedana Samyutta (in the Salayatana Vagga) contains suttas concerning feeling <i>(vedana);</i> and so on.
<p>
An excellent modern translation of the Samyutta Nikaya is Bhikkhu Bodhi's <I>The Connected Discourses of the Buddha: A New Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya</I> (Boston: <A HREF="../../other.html#wisdom">Wisdom Publications</A>, 2000).

The Buddha's second discourse, in which he discusses the principle of <i>anatta</i> (not-self) with the group of five ascetics.
