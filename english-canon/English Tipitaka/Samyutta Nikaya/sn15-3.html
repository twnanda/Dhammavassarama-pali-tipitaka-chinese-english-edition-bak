At <A NAME="savatthi">Savatthi</A>. There the Blessed One said: "From an inconstruable beginning comes transmigration. A beginning point is not evident, though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating &amp; wandering on. What do you think, monks: Which is greater, the tears you have shed while transmigrating &amp; wandering this long, long time -- crying &amp; weeping from being joined with what is displeasing, being separated from what is pleasing -- or the water in the four great oceans?"
<p>
"As we understand the Dhamma taught to us by the Blessed One, this is the greater: the tears we have shed while transmigrating &amp; wandering this long, long time -- crying &amp; weeping from being joined with what is displeasing, being separated from what is pleasing -- not the water in the four great oceans."
<p>
"Excellent, monks. Excellent. It is excellent that you thus understand the Dhamma taught by me.
<p>
"This is the greater: the tears you have shed while transmigrating &amp; wandering this long, long time -- crying &amp; weeping from being joined with what is displeasing, being separated from what is pleasing -- not the water in the four great oceans.
<p>
"Long have you (repeatedly) experienced the death of a mother. The tears you have shed over the death of a mother while transmigrating &amp; wandering this long, long time -- crying &amp; weeping from being joined with what is displeasing, being separated from what is pleasing -- are greater than the water in the four great oceans.
<p>
"Long have you (repeatedly) experienced the death of a father...the death of a brother...the death of a sister...the death of a son...the death of a daughter...loss with regard to relatives...loss with regard to wealth...loss with regard to disease. The tears you have shed over loss with regard to disease while transmigrating &amp; wandering this long, long time -- crying &amp; weeping from being joined with what is displeasing, being separated from what is pleasing -- are greater than the water in the four great oceans.
<p>
"Why is that? From an inconstruable beginning comes transmigration. A beginning point is not evident, though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating &amp; wandering on. Long have you thus experienced stress, experienced pain, experienced loss, swelling the cemeteries -- enough to become disenchanted with all fabricated things, enough to become dispassionate, enough to be released."
