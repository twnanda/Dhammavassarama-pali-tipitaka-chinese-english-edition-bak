<HR>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Sakyans 
at <A id=kapilavatthu name=kapilavatthu></A>Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Park. Now 
at that time a new reception hall [<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn35-202.html#n1" 
name=1>1</A>] had just been built by the Kapilavatthu Sakyans, and it had not 
yet been dwelled in by any contemplative, priest, or anyone at all in human 
form. So the Kapilavatthu Sakyans went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, 
having bowed down, sat to one side. As they were sitting there they said to him, 
"Lord, a new reception hall has just been built by the Kapilavatthu Sakyans, and 
it has not yet been dwelled in by any contemplative, priest, or anyone at all in 
human form. May the Blessed One be the first to use it. When the Blessed One has 
used it first, the Kapilavatthu Sakyans will use it afterwards. That will be for 
their long-term welfare &amp; happiness." 
<P>The Blessed One acquiesced with silence. Sensing his acquiescence, the 
Kapilavatthu Sakyans got up from their seats, bowed down to him, circumambulated 
him, and then went to the new reception hall. On arrival, they spread it all 
over with felt rugs, arranged seats, set out a water vessel, and raised an oil 
lamp. Then they went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down, 
stood to one side. As they were standing there they said to him, "Lord, the 
reception hall has been covered all over with felt rugs, seats have been 
arranged, a water vessel has been set out, and an oil lamp raised. It is now 
time for the Blessed One to do as he sees fit." 
<P>So the Blessed One, putting on his robe and taking up his bowl &amp; outer 
robe, went together with a community of monks to the reception hall. On arrival 
he washed his feet, entered the hall, and sat with his back to the central post, 
facing east. The community of monks washed their feet, entered the hall, and sat 
with their backs to the western wall, facing east, ranged around the Blessed 
One. The Kapilavatthu Sakyans washed their feet, entered the hall, and sat with 
their backs to the eastern wall, facing west, ranged around the Blessed One. 
Then the Blessed One -- having spent most of the night instructing, urging, 
rousing, &amp; encouraging the Kapilavatthu Sakyans with a Dhamma talk -- 
dismissed them, saying, "The night is far past, Gotamas. Do what you now think 
it is time to do." 
<P>Responding, "As you say, lord," the Kapilavatthu Sakyans rose from their 
seats, bowed down to the Blessed One, and -- circumambulating him, keeping him 
to their right -- departed. 
<P><A id=mogg name=mogg></A>Then not long after the Kapilavatthu Sakyans had 
left, the Blessed One addressed Ven. Maha Moggallana: "Moggallana, the community 
of monks is free of drowsiness. Give them a Dhamma talk of your own devising. My 
back aches. I will rest it." 
<P>Ven. Maha Moggallana responded, "As you say, lord." 
<P>Then the Blessed One, having arranged his outer robe folded in four, lay down 
on his right side in the lion's sleeping posture, with one foot on top of the 
other, mindful &amp; alert, having made a mental note to get up. 
<P>Then Ven. Maha Moggallana addressed the monks, "Friend monks!" 
<P>"Yes, friend," the monks responded. 
<P>Ven. Maha Moggallana said, "Friends, I will teach you a discourse on being 
soggy and a discourse on not being soggy.[<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn35-202.html#n2" 
name=2>2</A>] Listen and pay careful attention. I will speak." 
<P>"As you say, friend," the monks replied. 
<P>Ven. Maha Moggallana said, "And how is one soggy? There is the case where a 
monk, when seeing a form via the eye, is, in the case of pleasing forms, 
committed to forms and, in the case of displeasing forms, afflicted by forms. He 
remains with body-mindfulness not present, and with limited awareness. And he 
does not discern, as it actually is present, the awareness-release &amp; 
discernment-release where those evil, unskillful qualities that have arisen 
cease without trace. 
<P>"When hearing a sound via the ear ... 
<P>"When smelling an aroma via the nose... 
<P>"When tasting a flavor via the tongue... 
<P>"When touching a tactile sensation via the body... 
<P>"When cognizing an idea via the intellect, he is, in the case of pleasing 
ideas, committed to ideas and, in the case of displeasing ideas, afflicted by 
ideas. He remains with body-mindfulness not present, and with limited awareness. 
And he does not discern, as it actually is present, the awareness-release &amp; 
discernment-release where those evil, unskillful qualities that have arisen 
cease without trace. 
<P>"This is called a monk who is soggy with forms cognizable via the eye, soggy 
with sounds cognizable via the ear, soggy with aromas cognizable via the nose, 
soggy with flavors cognizable via the tongue, soggy with tactile sensations 
cognizable via the body, soggy with ideas cognizable via the intellect. 
<P><A id=mara name=mara></A>"When a monk dwells in this way, then if Mara comes 
to him via the eye, Mara gains entry, Mara gains a foothold. If Mara comes to 
him via the ear... nose... tongue... body... intellect, Mara gains entry, Mara 
gains a foothold. <A id=shack name=shack></A>Just as if there were a shack made 
of reeds or a shack made of grass -- dry, desiccated, more than a year old -- 
and if a man were to come to it from the east with a burning grass torch, fire 
would gain entry, fire would gain a foothold. If a man were to come to it from 
the west... north... south... from below... from above... From whatever 
direction the man would come to it with a burning grass torch, fire would gain 
entry, fire would gain a foothold. In the same way, when a monk dwells in this 
way, then if Mara comes to him via the eye, Mara gains entry, Mara gains a 
foothold. If Mara comes to him via the ear... nose... tongue... body... 
intellect, Mara gains entry, Mara gains a foothold. 
<P>"And when a monk dwells in this way, forms overpower him. He does not 
overpower forms. Sounds overpower him... Aromas... Flavors... Tactile 
sensations... Ideas overpower him. He does not overpower ideas. This is called a 
monk overpowered by forms, overpowered by sounds, overpowered by aromas, 
overpowered by flavors, overpowered by tactile sensations, overpowered by ideas 
-- one overpowered who does not overpower. He is overpowered by evil, unskillful 
qualities that defile, that lead to further becoming, that are miserable, that 
result in suffering &amp; stress, that tend toward future birth, aging, &amp; 
death. 
<P>"It's in this way, friends, that one is soggy. 
<P>"And how is one not soggy? There is the case where a monk, when seeing a form 
via the eye, is not, in the case of pleasing forms, committed to forms nor, in 
the case of displeasing forms, afflicted by forms. He remains with 
body-mindfulness present, and with immeasurable awareness. And he discerns, as 
it actually is present, the awareness-release &amp; discernment-release where 
those evil, unskillful qualities that have arisen cease without trace. 
<P>"When hearing a sound via the ear ... 
<P>"When smelling an aroma via the nose... 
<P>"When tasting a flavor via the tongue... 
<P>"When touching a tactile sensation via the body... 
<P>"When cognizing an idea via the intellect, he is not, in the case of pleasing 
ideas, committed to ideas nor, in the case of displeasing ideas, afflicted by 
ideas. He remains with body-mindfulness present, and with immeasurable 
awareness. And he discerns, as it actually is present, the awareness-release 
&amp; discernment-release where those evil, unskillful qualities that have 
arisen cease without trace. 
<P>"This is called a monk who is not soggy with forms cognizable via the eye, 
not soggy with sounds cognizable via the ear, not soggy with aromas cognizable 
via the nose, not soggy with flavors cognizable via the tongue, not soggy with 
tactile sensations cognizable via the body, not soggy with ideas cognizable via 
the intellect. 
<P>"When a monk dwells in this way, then if Mara comes to him via the eye, Mara 
gains no entry, Mara gains no foothold. If Mara comes to him via the ear... 
nose... tongue... body... intellect, Mara gains no entry, Mara gains no 
foothold. <A id=house name=house></A>Just as if there were a peaked house or 
hall thickly plastered with fine clay, and if a man were to come to it from the 
east with a burning grass torch, fire would gain no entry, fire would gain no 
foothold. If a man were to come to it from the west... north... south... from 
below... from above... From whatever direction the man would come to it with a 
burning grass torch, fire would gain no entry, fire would gain no foothold. In 
the same way, when a monk dwells in this way, then if Mara comes to him via the 
eye, Mara gains no entry, Mara gains no foothold. If Mara comes to him via the 
ear... nose... tongue... body... intellect, Mara gains no entry, Mara gains no 
foothold. 
<P>"And when a monk dwells in this way, he overpowers forms. Forms do not 
overpower him. He overpowers sounds... aromas... flavors... tactile 
sensations... ideas. Ideas do not overpower him. This is called a monk who 
overpowers forms, overpowers sounds, overpowers aromas, overpowers flavors, 
overpowers tactile sensations, overpowers ideas -- one who overpowers and is not 
overpowered. He overpowers evil, unskillful qualities that defile, that lead to 
further becoming, that are miserable, that result in suffering &amp; stress, 
that tend toward future birth, aging, &amp; death. 
<P>"It's in this way, friends, that one is not soggy." 
<P>Then the Blessed One got up and said to Ven. Maha Moggallana, "Good, good, 
Moggallana. What you have said to the monks about the discourse on being soggy 
and the discourse on not being soggy is good." 
<P>That is what Ven. Maha Moggallana said, and the Teacher approved. Gratified, 
the monks delighted in Ven. Maha Moggallana's words.
