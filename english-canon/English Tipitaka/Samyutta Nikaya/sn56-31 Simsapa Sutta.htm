<HR>
Once the Blessed One was staying at <A name=kosambi>Kosambi</A> in the <A 
name=simsapa>Simsapa</A> forest. Then, picking up a few Simsapa leaves with his 
hand, he asked the monks, "What do you think, monks: Which are more numerous, 
the few Simsapa leaves in my hand or those overhead in the Simsapa forest?" 
<P>"The leaves in the hand of the Blessed One are few in number, lord. Those 
overhead in the forest are far more numerous." 
<P>"In the same way, monks, those things that I have known with direct knowledge 
but have not taught are far more numerous [than what I have taught]. And why 
haven't I taught them? Because they are not connected with the goal, do not 
relate to the rudiments of the holy life, and do not lead to disenchantment, to 
dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to 
Unbinding. That is why I have not taught them. 
<P>"And what have I taught? 'This is stress... This is the origination of 
stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the path of practice 
leading to the cessation of stress': This is what I have taught. And why have I 
taught these things? Because they are connected with the goal, relate to the 
rudiments of the holy life, and lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to 
cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to Unbinding. This 
is why I have taught them. 
<P>"Therefore your duty is the contemplation, 'This is stress... This is the 
origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress.' Your duty is the 
contemplation, 'This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of 
stress.'"
