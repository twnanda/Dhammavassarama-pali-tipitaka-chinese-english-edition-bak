"It's a gain for you, monks, a great gain, that you've gained the opportunity to 
live the holy life. I have seen a hell named 'Six Spheres of Contact.' Whatever 
form one sees there with the eye is undesirable, never desirable; displeasing, 
never pleasing; disagreeable, never agreeable. Whatever sound one hears there 
with the ear... Whatever aroma one smells there with the nose... Whatever flavor 
one tastes there with the tongue... Whatever tactile sensation one touches there 
with the body... Whatever idea one cognizes there with the intellect is 
undesirable, never desirable; displeasing, never pleasing; disagreeable, never 
agreeable.

<H3>Note</H3><B><A name=n1>1</A>.</B> The message here is that in realms where 
sense objects are totally disagreeable or totally agreeable it is very difficult 
to practice the holy life, for in the former, one is too distracted by pain; in 
the latter, too distracted by pleasure. [<A
