<HR>
At <A name=savatthi>Savatthi</A>. Sitting to one side, a monk said to the 
Blessed One, "Lord, is there any form that is constant, lasting, eternal, not 
subject to change, that will stay just as it is as long as eternity? Is there 
any feeling... any perception... Are there any fabrications... Is there any 
consciousness that is constant, lasting, eternal, not subject to change, that 
will stay just as it is as long as eternity?" 
<P>"No, monk, there is no form... no feeling... no perception... there are no 
fabrications... there is no consciousness that is constant, lasting, eternal, 
not subject to change, that will stay just as it is as long as eternity." [<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn22-097.html#n1" 
name=1>1</A>] 
<P>Then the Blessed One, picking up a tiny bit of dust with the tip of his 
fingernail, said to the monk, "There isn't even this much form that is constant, 
lasting, eternal, not subject to change, that will stay just as it is as long as 
eternity. If there were even this much form that was constant, lasting, eternal, 
not subject to change, that would stay just as it is as long as eternity, then 
this living of the holy life for the right ending of suffering &amp; stress 
would not be discerned. But because there isn't even this much form that is 
constant, lasting, eternal, not subject to change, that will stay just as it is 
as long as eternity, this living of the holy life for the right ending of 
suffering &amp; stress <I>is</I> discerned. 
<P>"There isn't even this much feeling... 
<P>"There isn't even this much perception... 
<P>"There aren't even this many fabrications... 
<P>"There isn't even this much consciousness that is constant, lasting, eternal, 
not subject to change, that will stay just as it is as long as eternity. If 
there were even this much consciousness that was constant, lasting, eternal, not 
subject to change, that would stay just as it is as long as eternity, then this 
living of the holy life for the right ending of suffering &amp; stress would not 
be discerned. But because there isn't even this much consciousness that is 
constant, lasting, eternal, not subject to change, that will stay just as it is 
as long as eternity, this living of the holy life for the right ending of 
suffering &amp; stress <I>is</I> discerned. 
<P>"What do you think, monk -- Is form constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, 
lord." "And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?" "Stressful, 
lord." "And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to 
change as: 'This is mine. This is my self. This is what I am'?" 
<P>"No, lord." 
<P>"... Is feeling constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."... 
<P>"... Is perception constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."... 
<P>"... Are fabrications constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."... 
<P>"What do you think, monk -- Is consciousness constant or inconstant?" 
"Inconstant, lord." "And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?" 
"Stressful, lord." "And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, 
subject to change as: 'This is mine. This is my self. This is what I am'?" 
<P>"No, lord." 
<P>"Thus, monk, any form whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal 
or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: every form is to 
be seen as it actually is with right discernment as: 'This is not mine. This is 
not my self. This is not what I am.' 
<P>"Any feeling whatsoever... 
<P>"Any perception whatsoever... 
<P>"Any fabrications whatsoever... 
<P>"Any consciousness whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal or 
external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: every consciousness 
is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as: 'This is not mine. 
This is not my self. This is not what I am.' 
<P>"Seeing thus, the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted 
with form, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with perception, disenchanted 
with fabrications, disenchanted with consciousness. Disenchanted, he becomes 
dispassionate. Through dispassion, he is fully released. With full release, 
there is the knowledge, 'Fully released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the 
holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'"
