<hr>
At <a name="savatthi">Savatthi</a>. There the Blessed One said, "Monks, I will teach you clingable phenomena &amp; clinging. Listen &amp; pay close attention. I will speak."
<p>
"As you say, lord," the monks responded.
<p>
The Blessed One said, "And what, monks, are clingable phenomena? What is clinging?
<p>
"Form is a clingable phenomenon. Any desire or passion related to it, is clinging related to it.
<p>
"Feeling is a clingable phenomenon. Any desire or passion related to it, is clinging related to it.
<p>
"Perception is a clingable phenomenon. Any desire or passion related to it, is clinging related to it.
<p>
"Fabrications are clingable phenomena. Any desire or passion related to them, is clinging related to them.
<p>
"Consciousness is a clingable phenomenon. Any desire or passion related to it, is clinging related to it.
<p>
"These are called clingable phenomena. This is clinging."
