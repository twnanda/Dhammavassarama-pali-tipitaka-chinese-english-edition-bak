On one occasion Ven. <A NAME="sari">Sariputta</A> &amp; Ven. <A NAME="kotthita">Maha Kotthita</A> were staying near Varanasi in the Deer Park at <A NAME="isip">Isipatana</A>. Then Ven. Maha Kotthita, emerging from seclusion in the late afternoon, went to Ven. Sariputta and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to Ven. Sariputta, "Sariputta my friend, which things should a virtuous monk attend to in an appropriate way?"
<p>
"A virtuous monk, Kotthita my friend, should attend in an appropriate way to the five aggregates of clinging as inconstant, stressful, a disease, a cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a dissolution, an emptiness, not-self. Which five? Form as an aggregate of clinging, feeling...perception...fabrications...consciousness as an aggregate of clinging. A virtuous monk should attend in an appropriate way to these five aggregates of clinging as inconstant, stressful, a disease, a cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a dissolution, an emptiness, not-self. For it is possible that a virtuous monk, attending in an appropriate way to these five aggregates of clinging as inconstant...not-self, would realize the fruit of stream-entry."
<p>
"Then which things should a monk who has attained stream-entry attend to in an appropriate way?"
<p>
"A monk who has attained stream-entry should attend in an appropriate way to these five aggregates of clinging as inconstant, stressful, a disease, a cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a dissolution, an emptiness, not-self. For it is possible that a monk who has attained stream-entry, attending in an appropriate way to these five aggregates of clinging as inconstant...not-self, would realize the fruit of once-returning."
<p>
"Then which things should a monk who has attained once-returning attend to in an appropriate way?"
<p>
"A monk who has attained once-returning should attend in an appropriate way to these five aggregates of clinging as inconstant, stressful, a disease, a cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a dissolution, an emptiness, not-self. For it is possible that a monk who has attained once-returning, attending in an appropriate way to these five aggregates of clinging as inconstant...not-self, would realize the fruit of non-returning."
<p>
"Then which things should a monk who has attained non-returning attend to in an appropriate way?"
<p>
"A monk who has attained non-returning should attend in an appropriate way to these five aggregates of clinging as inconstant, stressful, a disease, a cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a dissolution, an emptiness, not-self. For it is possible that a monk who has attained non-returning, attending in an appropriate way to these five aggregates of clinging as inconstant...not-self, would realize the fruit of arahantship."
<p>
"Then which things should an arahant attend to in an appropriate way?"
<p>
"An arahant should attend in an appropriate way to these five aggregates of clinging as inconstant, stressful, a disease, a cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a dissolution, an emptiness, not-self. Although, for an arahant, there is nothing further to do, and nothing to add to what has been done, still these things -- when developed &amp; pursued -- lead both to a pleasant abiding in the here-&amp;-now and to mindfulness &amp; alertness."
