Setting at Savatthi. Then, in the morning, the bhikkhuni Cala dressed ... she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day's abiding.
<p>
Then Mara the Evil One approached the bhikkhuni Cala and said to her: "What don't you approve of, bhikkhuni?"
<p>
"I don't approve of birth, friend."

"Why don't you approve of birth?<br>
Once born, one enjoys sensual pleasures.<br>
Who now has persuaded you of this:<br>
'Bhikkhuni, don't approve of birth'?"

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"For one who is born there is death;<br>
Once born, one encounters sufferings -- <br>
Bondage, murder, affliction -- <br>
Hence one shouldn't approve of birth.
<p>
The Buddha has taught the Dhamma,<br>
The transcendence of birth;<br>
For the abandoning of all suffering<br>
He has settled me in the truth. [133]
<p>
As to those beings who fare amidst form,<br>
And those who abide in the formless -- <br>
Not having understood cessation,<br>
They come again to re-becoming."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Then Mara the Evil One, realizing, "The bhikkhuni Cala knows me," sad and disappointed, disappeared right there.
