<hr>
Setting at Savatthi. Then, in the morning, the bhikkhuni Upacala dressed ... she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day's abiding.
<p>
Then Mara the Evil One approached the bhikkhuni Upacala and said to her: "Where do you wish to be reborn, bhikkhuni?"
<p>
"I do not wish to be reborn anywhere, friend."

"There are Tavatimsa and Yama devas,<br>
And devatas of the Tusita realm,<br>
Devas who take delight in creating,<br>
And devas who exercise control.<br>
Direct your mind there<br>
And you'll experience delight."

"There are Tavatimsa and Yama devas,<br>
And devatas of the Tusita realm,<br>
Devas who take delight in creating,<br>
And devas who exercise control.<br>
They are still bound by sensual bondage,<br>
They come again under Mara's control.
<p>
All the world is on fire,<br>
All the world is burning,<br>
All the world is ablaze,<br>
All the world is quaking.
<p>
That which does not quake or blaze,<br>
That to which worldlings do not resort,<br>
Where there is no place for Mara:<br>
That is where my mind delights."

<p>
Then Mara the Evil One, realizing, "The bhikkhuni Upacala knows me," sad and disappointed, disappeared right there.
