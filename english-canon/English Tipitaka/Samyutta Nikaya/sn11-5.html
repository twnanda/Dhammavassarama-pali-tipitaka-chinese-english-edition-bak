On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="savatthi">Savatthi</A> at Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="anatha">Anathapindika</A>'s monastery. There he addressed the monks, "Monks!"
<p>
"Yes, lord," the monks responded.
<p>
The Blessed One said, "Once in the past the devas &amp; asuras[<a HREF="#n1" NAME="1">1</a>] were arrayed for battle. Then <A NAME="vepacitti">Vepacitti</A> the asura-king said to <A NAME="sakka">Sakka</A> the deva-king: 'Let there be victory through what is well spoken.'
<p>
"'Yes, Vepacitti, let there be victory through what is well spoken.'
<p>
"So the devas &amp; asuras appointed a panel of judges, [thinking,] 'These will decide for us what is well spoken &amp; poorly spoken.'
<p>
"Then Vepacitti the asura-king said to Sakka the deva-king, 'Say a verse, deva-king!'
<p>
"When this was said, Sakka the deva-king said to Vepacitti the asura-king, 'But you are the senior deity here, Vepacitti. You say a verse.'
<p>
"When this was said, Vepacitti recited this verse:
<blockquote>
'Fools would flare up even more<br>
if there were no constraints.<br>
Thus an enlightened one<br>
should restrain the fool<br>
with a heavy stick.'
</blockquote>
<p>
"When Vepacitti had said this verse, the asuras applauded but the devas were silent. So Vepacitti said to Sakka, 'Say a verse, deva-king!'
<p>
"When this was said, Sakka recited this verse:
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This, I think,<br>
is the only constraint for a fool:<br>
When, knowing the other's provoked,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you mindfully grow calm.'
</blockquote>
<p>
"When Sakka had said this verse, the devas applauded but the asuras were silent. So Sakka said to Vepacitti, 'Say a verse, Vepacitti!'
<p>
"When this was said, Vepacitti recited this verse:
<blockquote>
'Vasava,[<a HREF="#n2" NAME="2">2</a>] I see a fault<br>
in this very forbearance:<br>
<A NAME="cow">When</A> the fool thinks,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He's forbearing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out of fear of me,"<br>
the idiot pursues you even more -- <br>
as a cow, someone who runs away.'
</blockquote>
<p>
"When Vepacitti had said this verse, the asuras applauded but the devas were silent. So Vepacitti said to Sakka, 'Say a verse, deva-king!'
<p>
"When this was said, Sakka recited this verse:
<blockquote>
'It doesn't matter<br>
whether he thinks,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He's forbearing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out of fear of me."<br>
One's own true good<br>
is the foremost good.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing better<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than patience<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is found.
<p>
Whoever, when strong,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is forbearing<br>
to one who is weak:<br>
that's the foremost patience.<br>
The weak must constantly endure.
<p>
They call that strength<br>
no strength at all:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whoever's strength<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the strength of a fool.<br>
There's no reproach<br>
for one who is strong,<br>
guarding -- guarded by -- Dhamma.
<p>
You make things worse<br>
when you flare up<br>
at someone who's angry.<br>
Whoever doesn't flare up<br>
at someone who's angry<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wins a battle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hard to win.
<p>
You live for the good of both<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -- your own, the other's -- <br>
when, knowing the other's provoked,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you mindfully grow calm.<br>
When you work the cure of both<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -- your own, the other's -- <br>
those who think you a fool<br>
know nothing of Dhamma.'
</blockquote>
<p>
"When Sakka had said this verse, the devas applauded but the asuras were silent. Then the deva &amp; asura panel of judges said, 'The verses said by Vepacitti the asura-king lie in the sphere of swords &amp; weapons -- thence arguments, quarrels, &amp; strife. Whereas the verses said by Sakka the deva-king lies outside the sphere of swords &amp; weapons -- thence no arguments, no quarrels, no strife. The victory through what is well spoken goes to Sakka the deva-king.'
<p>
"And that, monks, is how the victory through what was well spoken went to Sakka the deva-king."

<h3>Notes</h3>
<b><A NAME="n1">1</A>.</b> The devas &amp; asuras were two groups of deities who fought for control of heaven (like the gods &amp; titans in Greek mythology). The devas eventually won. The asuras, known for their fierce anger, later became classed as angry demons and, in some Buddhist cosmologies, are regarded as a class of being lower than human.
