On one occasion the Blessed One, while wandering on tour among the <A id=kosala 
name=kosala></A>Kosalans together with a large community of monks, arrived at <A 
id=nalanda name=nalanda></A>Nalanda. There he stayed at Nalanda in Pavarika's 
Mango Grove. 
<P>Now at that time Nalanda was in the midst of famine, a time of scarcity, the 
crops white with blight and turned to straw. And at that time <A id=nata 
name=nata></A>Nigantha Nataputta was staying in Nalanda together with a large 
following of niganthas. Then <A id=asi name=asi></A>Asibandhakaputta the 
headman, a disciple of the niganthas, went to Nigantha Nataputta and, on 
arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, 
Nigantha Nataputta said to him, "Come, now, headman. Refute the words of the 
contemplative Gotama, and this admirable report about you will spread afar: 'The 
words of the contemplative Gotama -- so mighty, so powerful -- were refuted by 
Asibandhakaputta the headman!'" 
<P>"But how, venerable sir, will I refute the words of the contemplative Gotama 
-- so mighty, so powerful?" 
<P>"Come now, headman. Go to the contemplative Gotama and on arrival say this: 
'Venerable sir, doesn't the Blessed One in many ways praise kindness, 
protection, &amp; sympathy for families?' If the contemplative Gotama, thus 
asked, answers, 'Yes, headman, the Tathagata in many ways praises kindness, 
protection, &amp; sympathy for families,' then you should say, 'Then why, 
venerable sir, is the Blessed One, together with a large community of monks, 
wandering on tour around Nalanda in the midst of famine, a time of scarcity, 
when the crops are white with blight and turned to straw? The Blessed One is 
practicing for the ruin of families. The Blessed One is practicing for the 
demise of families. The Blessed One is practicing for the downfall of families.' 
When the contemplative Gotama is asked this two-pronged question by you, he 
won't be able to swallow it down or spit it up." 
<P>Responding, "As you say, venerable sir," Asibandhakaputta the headman got up 
from his seat, bowed down to Nigantha Nataputta, circumambulated him, and then 
went to the Blessed One. On arrival, he bowed down to the Blessed One and sat to 
one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, "Venerable sir, 
doesn't the Blessed One in many ways praise kindness, protection, &amp; sympathy 
for families?" 
<P>"Yes, headman, the Tathagata in many ways praises kindness, protection, &amp; 
sympathy for families." 
<P>"Then why, venerable sir, is the Blessed One, together with a large community 
of monks, wandering on tour around Nalanda in the midst of famine, a time of 
scarcity, when the crops are white with blight and turned to straw? The Blessed 
One is practicing for the ruin of families. The Blessed One is practicing for 
the demise of families. The Blessed One is practicing for the downfall of 
families." 
<P>"Headman, recollecting back over 91 aeons, I do not know any family to have 
been brought to downfall through the giving of cooked alms. On the contrary: 
Whatever families are rich -- with much wealth, many possessions, a great deal 
of money, a great many accoutrements of wealth, a great many commodities -- all 
have become so from giving, from truth, from restraint. 
<P><A id=eight name=eight></A>"Headman, there are eight causes, eight reasons 
for the downfall of families. Families go to their downfall because of kings, or 
families go to their downfall because of thieves, or families go to their 
downfall because of fire, or families go to their downfall because of floods, or 
their stored-up treasure disappears, or their mismanaged undertakings go wrong, 
or in the family a wastrel is born who squanders, scatters, &amp; shatters its 
wealth, and inconstancy itself is the eighth. These are the eight causes, the 
eight reasons for the downfall of families. Now, when these eight causes, these 
eight reasons are to be found, if anyone should say of me, 'The Blessed One is 
practicing for the ruin of families, the Blessed One is practicing for the 
demise of families, the Blessed One is practicing for the downfall of families' 
-- without abandoning that statement, without abandoning that intent, without 
relinquishing that view -- then as if he were to be carried off, he would thus 
be placed in hell." 
<P><A id=magnif name=magnif></A>When this was said, Asibandhakaputta the headman 
said to the Blessed One: "Magnificent, lord! Magnificent! Just as if he were to 
place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to 
one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could 
see forms, in the same way has the Blessed One -- through many lines of 
reasoning -- made the Dhamma clear. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the 
Dhamma, &amp; to the community of monks. May the Blessed One remember me as a 
lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward, for life."
