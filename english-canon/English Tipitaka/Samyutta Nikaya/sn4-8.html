<b>Translator's note:</b>
In this discourse, Mara and Buddha are speaking different languages. By "acquisitions" Mara means one's family and physical possessions. The Buddha uses the same word to mean a sense of possession for anything -- physical or mental -- at all.
<hr>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery. Then <A NAME="mara">Mara</A> the Evil One went to the Blessed One and recited this verse in his presence:
<blockquote>
Those with children<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delight<br>
because of their children.<br>
Those with cattle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delight<br>
because of their cows.<br>
A person's delight<br>
comes from acquisitions,<br>
since a person with no acquisitions<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't delight.
</blockquote>
<p>
<I>[The Buddha:]</I>
<blockquote>
Those with children<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grieve<br>
because of their children.<br>
Those with cattle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grieve<br>
because of their cows.<br>
A person's grief<br>
comes from acquisitions,<br>
since a person with no acquisitions<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't grieve.
</blockquote>
Then Mara the Evil One -- sad &amp; dejected at realizing, "The Blessed One knows me; the One Well-Gone knows me" -- vanished right there.
