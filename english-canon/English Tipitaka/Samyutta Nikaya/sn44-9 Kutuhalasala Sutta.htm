Then Vacchagotta the wanderer went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged 
courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; 
courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed 
One, "Master Gotama, a few days ago a large number of contemplatives, brahmans, 
and wanderers of various sects were sitting together in the Debating Hall when 
this conversation arose among them: 'This <A name=purana></A>Purana Kassapa -- 
the leader of a community, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, 
honored and famous, esteemed as holy by the mass of people -- describes a 
disciple who has died and passed on in terms of places of rebirth: "That one is 
reborn there; that one is reborn there." Even when the disciple is an ultimate 
person, a foremost person, attained to the foremost attainment, Purana Kassapa 
describes him, when he has died and passed on, in terms of places of rebirth: 
"That one is reborn there; that one is reborn there." 
<P>"'This <A name=makkhali></A>Makkhali Gosala... This <A 
name=nigantha></A>Nigantha Nataputta... This <A name=sanjaya></A>Sa&ntilde;jaya 
Velatthaputta... This <A name=pakudha></A>Pakudha Kaccana... This <A 
name=ajita></A>Ajita Kesakambala -- the leader of a community, the leader of a 
group, the teacher of a group, honored and famous, esteemed as holy by the mass 
of people -- describes a disciple who has died and passed on in terms of places 
of rebirth: "That one is reborn there; that one is reborn there." Even when the 
disciple is an ultimate person, a foremost person, attained to the foremost 
attainment, Ajita Kesakambala describes him, when he has died and passed on, in 
terms of places of rebirth: "That one is reborn there; that one is reborn 
there." 
<P>"This contemplative Gotama -- the leader of a community, the leader of a 
group, the teacher of a group, honored and famous, esteemed as holy by the mass 
of people -- describes a disciple who has died and passed on in terms of places 
of rebirth: "That one is reborn there; that one is reborn there." But when the 
disciple is an ultimate person, a foremost person, attained to the foremost 
attainment, the contemplative Gotama does not describe him, when he has died and 
passed on, in terms of places of rebirth: "That one is reborn there; that one is 
reborn there." Instead, he describes him thus: "He has cut through craving, 
severed the fetter, and by rightly breaking through conceit has made an end of 
suffering &amp; stress."' 
<P>"So I was simply befuddled. I was uncertain: How is the teaching of Gotama 
the contemplative to be understood?" 
<P>"Of course you are befuddled, Vaccha. Of course you are uncertain. When there 
is a reason for befuddlement in you, uncertainty arises. I designate the rebirth 
of one who has sustenance, Vaccha, and not of one without sustenance. <A 
name=fire></A>Just as a fire burns with sustenance and not without sustenance, 
even so I designate the rebirth of one who has sustenance and not of one without 
sustenance." 
<P>"But, Master Gotama, at the moment a flame is being swept on by the wind and 
goes a far distance, what do you designate as its sustenance then?" 
<P>"Vaccha, when a flame is being swept on by the wind and goes a far distance, 
I designate it as wind-sustained, for the wind is its sustenance at that time." 
<P>"And at the moment when a being sets this body aside and is not yet reborn in 
another body, what do you designate as its sustenance then?" 
<P>"Vaccha, when a being sets this body aside and is not yet reborn in another 
body, I designate it as craving-sustained, for craving is its sustenance at that 
time."
