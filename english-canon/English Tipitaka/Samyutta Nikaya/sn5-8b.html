<hr>
Setting at Savatthi. Then, in the morning, the bhikkhuni Sisupacala dressed ... she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day's abiding.
<p>
Then Mara the Evil One approached the bhikkhuni Sisupacala and said to her: "Whose creed do you approve of, bhikkhuni?"
<p>
"I don't approve of anyone's creed, friend."
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Under whom have you shaved your head?<br>
You do appear to be a recluse,<br>
Yet you don't approve of any creed,<br>
So why wander as if bewildered?"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Outside here the followers of creeds<br>
Place their confidence in views.<br>
I don't approve of their teachings;<br>
They are not skilled in the Dhamma. [134]
<p>
But there is a scion of the Sakyan clan,<br>
The Enlightened One, without an equal,<br>
Conqueror of all, Mara's subduer,<br>
Who everywhere is undefeated.
<p>
Everywhere freed and unattached,<br>
The One with Vision who sees all,<br>
Who attained the end of all kamma,<br>
Released in the extinction of acquisitions:<br>
That Blessed One is my Teacher;<br>
His is the teaching I approve."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Then Mara the Evil One, realizing, "The bhikkhuni Sisupacala knows me," sad and disappointed, disappeared right there.
