At Savatthi. Then, early in the morning, Upacala the nun put on her robes and, taking her bowl &amp; outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. When she had gone for alms in Savatthi and had returned from her alms round, after her meal she went to the Grove of the Blind to spend the day. Having gone deep into the Grove of the Blind, she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day's abiding.
<p>
Then Mara the Evil One, wanting to arouse fear, horripilation, &amp; terror in her, wanting to make her fall from solitude, approached her &amp; said, "Where do you want to reappear [be reborn], nun?"
<p>
"I don't want to reappear anywhere, my friend."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; direct your mind there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and it will enjoy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delight.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The devas of the Thirty-three,<br>
the Hours, the Contented,<br>
those who delight in creation,<br>
&amp; those in control:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they are bound<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the bonds of sensuality;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they come again<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under Mara's sway.<br>
The whole world is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; burning.<br>
The whole world is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aflame.<br>
The whole world is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blazing.<br>
The whole world is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provoked.<br>
The Unprovoked, Unblazing<br>
-- that people run-of-the-mill<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; don't partake,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where Mara's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; never been -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that's where my heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; truly delights.
</blockquote>
Then Mara the Evil One -- sad &amp; dejected at realizing, "Upacala the nun knows me" -- vanished right there.
