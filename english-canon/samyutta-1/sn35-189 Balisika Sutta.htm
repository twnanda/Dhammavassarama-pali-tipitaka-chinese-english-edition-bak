<H1>The Fisherman</H1><SMALL>Translated from the Pali by Thanissaro

<HR>
"Monks, <A name=fish></A>just as if a fisherman were to cast a baited hook into 
a deep lake and a fish with its eye out for food would swallow it -- so that the 
fish that had thus swallowed the fisherman's hook would fall into misfortune 
&amp; disaster, and the fisherman could do with it as he will -- in the same 
way, there are these six hooks in the world for the misfortune of beings, for 
the slaughter of those that breathe. Which six? 
<P>"There are forms, monks, cognizable via the eye -- agreeable, pleasing, 
charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing. If a monk relishes them, 
welcomes them, &amp; remains fastened to them, he is said to be a monk who has 
swallowed <A name=mara></A>Mara's hook, who has fallen into misfortune &amp; 
disaster. The Evil One can do with him as he will. 
<P>"There are sounds cognizable via the ear... 
<P>"There are aromas cognizable via the nose... 
<P>"There are flavors cognizable via the tongue... 
<P>"There are tactile sensations cognizable via the body... 
<P>"There are ideas cognizable via the intellect -- agreeable, pleasing, 
charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing. If a monk relishes them, 
welcomes them, &amp; remains fastened to them, he is said to be a monk who has 
swallowed Mara's hook, who has fallen into misfortune &amp; disaster. The Evil 
One can do with him as he will. 
<P>"Now, there are forms cognizable via the eye -- agreeable, pleasing, 
charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing. If a monk does not relish them, 
welcome them, or remain fastened to them, he is said to be a monk who has not 
swallowed Mara's hook, who has snapped the hook, who has broken the hook, who 
has not fallen into misfortune &amp; disaster. The Evil One cannot do with him 
as he will.
