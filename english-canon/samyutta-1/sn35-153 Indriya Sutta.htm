<SMALL><B>Translator's note:</B> This sutta is based on a play on words. In 
everyday Pali, the term "consummate in faculties" is used to describe a person 
whose beauty and health are inspiring. Here the Buddha gives a different meaning 
to the term. </SMALL>
<HR>
Then a certain monk went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down 
to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, 
"'Consummate in faculties, consummate in faculties,' it is said. To what extent 
is one consummate in faculties?" 
<P>"If a monk, while keeping track of arising &amp; passing away with regard to 
the eye-faculty, becomes disenchanted with the eye-faculty; if, while keeping 
track of arising &amp; passing away with regard to the ear-faculty... the 
nose-faculty... the tongue-faculty... the body faculty... the intellect-faculty, 
he becomes disenchanted with the intellect-faculty; and, disenchanted, he 
becomes dispassionate; through dispassion, he is fully released; with full 
release, there is the knowledge, 'Fully released'; he discerns that 'Birth is 
depleted, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for 
this world,' it is to this extent that one is consummate in faculties." <!-- #bbinclude "footer.html" --><!-- THE TEXT BELOW IS AUTOMAGICALLY GENERATED FROM AN INCLUDE FILE. --><!-- robots content="none" -->
