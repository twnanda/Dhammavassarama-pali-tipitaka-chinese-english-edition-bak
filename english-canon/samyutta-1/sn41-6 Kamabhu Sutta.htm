<HR>
On one occasion <A id=kamabhu name=kamabhu>Ven. Kamabhu</A> was living near <A 
id=macchikasanda name=macchikasanda>Macchikasanda</A> in the Wild Mango Grove. 
<A id=citta name=citta></A>Then Citta the householder went to him and, on 
arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he 
said to Ven. Kamabhu, "Venerable sir, how many [types of] fabrications are 
there?" 
<P><A id=fab3 name=fab3></A>"There are three fabrications, householder: 
bodily-fabrications, verbal fabrications, &amp; mental fabrications." 
<P>"Very good, venerable sir." And, delighting in and approving of Ven. 
Kamabhu's answer, Citta asked him a further question: "But what are 
bodily-fabrications? What are verbal fabrications? What are mental 
fabrications?" 
<P>"In-&amp;-out breaths are bodily fabrications. Directed thought &amp; 
evaluation are verbal fabrications. Perceptions &amp; feelings are mental 
fabrications." 
<P>"Very good, venerable sir." And, delighting in and approving of Ven. 
Kamabhu's answer, Citta asked him a further question: "But why are in-&amp;-out 
breaths bodily fabrications? Why are directed thought &amp; evaluation verbal 
fabrications? Why are perceptions &amp; feelings mental fabrications?" 
<P>"In-&amp;-out breaths are bodily; these are things tied up with the body. 
That's why in-&amp;-out breaths are bodily fabrications. Having first directed 
one's thoughts and made an evaluation, one then breaks out into speech. That's 
why directed thought &amp; evaluation are verbal fabrications. Perceptions &amp; 
feelings are mental; these are things tied up with the mind. That's why 
perceptions &amp; feelings are mental fabrications." 
<P>"Very good, venerable sir." And, delighting in and approving of Ven. 
Kamabhu's answer, Citta asked him a further question: "Now, how does the 
attainment of the cessation of perception &amp; feeling come about?" 
<P>"The thought does not occur to a monk as he is attaining the cessation of 
perception &amp; feeling that 'I am about to attain the cessation of perception 
&amp; feeling' or that 'I am attaining the cessation of perception &amp; 
feeling' or that 'I have attained the cessation of perception &amp; feeling.' 
Instead, the way his mind has previously been developed leads him to that 
state." 
<P>"Very good, venerable sir." And, delighting in and approving of Ven. 
Kamabhu's answer, Citta asked him a further question: "When a monk is attaining 
the cessation of perception &amp; feeling, which things cease first: bodily 
fabrications, verbal fabrications, or mental fabrications?" 
<P>"When a monk is attaining the cessation of perception &amp; feeling, verbal 
fabrications cease first, then bodily fabrications, then mental 
fabrications."[<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn41-006.html#n1" 
name=1>1</A>] 
<P>"Very good, venerable sir." And, delighting in and approving of Ven. 
Kamabhu's answer, Citta asked him a further question: "What is the difference 
between a monk who has died &amp; passed away and a monk who has attained the 
cessation of perception &amp; feeling?" 
<P>"In the case of a monk who has died &amp; passed away, his bodily fabrication 
has ceased &amp; subsided, verbal fabrication has ceased &amp; subsided, mental 
fabrication has ceased &amp; subsided, his life force is totally ended, his heat 
is dissipated, and his faculties are shut down. But in the case of a monk who 
has attained the cessation of perception &amp; feeling, his bodily fabrication 
has ceased &amp; subsided, verbal fabrication has ceased &amp; subsided, mental 
fabrication has ceased &amp; subsided, his life force is not ended, his heat is 
not dissipated, and his faculties are bright &amp; clear. This is the difference 
between a monk who has died &amp; passed away and a monk who has attained the 
cessation of perception &amp; feeling."[<A

name=2>2</A>] 
<P>"Very good, venerable sir." And, delighting in and approving of Ven. 
Kamabhu's answer, Citta asked him a further question: "Now, how does emergence 
from the cessation of perception &amp; feeling come about?" 
<P>"The thought does not occur to a monk as he is emerging from the cessation of 
perception &amp; feeling that 'I am about to emerge from the cessation of 
perception &amp; feeling' or that 'I am emerging from the cessation of 
perception &amp; feeling' or that 'I have emerged from the cessation of 
perception &amp; feeling.' Instead, the way his mind has previously been 
developed leads him to that state." 
<P>"Very good, venerable sir." And, delighting in and approving of Ven. 
Kamabhu's answer, Citta asked him a further question: "When a monk is emerging 
from the cessation of perception &amp; feeling, which things arise first: bodily 
fabrications, verbal fabrications, or mental fabrications?" 
<P>"When a monk is emerging from the cessation of perception &amp; feeling, 
mental fabrications arise first, then bodily fabrications, then verbal 
fabrications." 
<P>"Very good, venerable sir." And, delighting in and approving of Ven. 
Kamabhu's answer, Citta asked him a further question: "When a monk has emerged 
from the cessation of perception &amp; feeling, how many contacts make contact?" 

<P>"When a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception &amp; feeling, 
three contacts make contact: contact with emptiness, contact with the signless, 
&amp; contact with the undirected."[<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn41-006.html#n3" 
name=3>3</A>] 
<P>"Very good, venerable sir." And, delighting in and approving of Ven. 
Kamabhu's answer, Citta asked him a further question: "When a monk has emerged 
from the cessation of perception &amp; feeling, to what does his mind lean, to 
what does it tend, to what does it incline?" 
<P>"When a monk has emerged from the cessation of perception &amp; feeling, his 
mind leans to seclusion, tends to seclusion, inclines to seclusion."[<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn41-006.html#n4" 
name=4>4</A>] 
<P>"Very good, venerable sir." And, delighting in and approving of Ven. 
Kamabhu's answer, Citta asked him a further question: "How many mental qualities 
are of great help in the attainment of the cessation of perception &amp; 
feeling?" 
<P>"Actually, householder, you have asked last what should have been asked 
first. Nevertheless, I will answer you. Two qualities are of great help in the 
attainment of the cessation of perception &amp; feeling: tranquillity &amp; 
insight."[<A

<H3>Notes</H3><B><A name=n1>1</A>.</B> According to <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn36-011.html">SN 
XXXVI.11</A>, verbal fabrication grows still on attaining the second jhana; 
bodily fabrication grows still on attaining the fourth jhana; mental fabrication 
grows still on attaining the cessation of perception &amp; feeling. [<A

<P><B><A name=n2>2</A>.</B> This question and answer are not included in <A

44</A>. [<A

back</A>] 
<P><B><A name=n3>3</A>.</B> Emptiness, the signless, &amp; the undirected are 
names for a state of concentration that lies on the threshold of Unbinding. They 
differ only in how they are approached. According to the commentary, they color 
one's first apprehension of Unbinding: a meditator who has been focusing on the 
theme of inconstancy will first apprehend Unbinding as signless; one who has 
been focusing on the theme of stress will first apprehend it as undirected; one 
who has been focusing on the theme of not-self will first apprehend it as 
emptiness. [<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn41-006.html#3">Go 
back</A>] 
<P><B><A name=n4>4</A>.</B> According to the commentary, "seclusion" here stands 
for Unbinding. On emerging from the cessation of perception &amp; feeling, and 
having had contact with emptiness/the signless/the undirected, the mind inclines 
naturally to a direct experience of Unbinding. [<A
