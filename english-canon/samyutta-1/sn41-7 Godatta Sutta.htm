<HR>
On one occasion Ven. Godatta was living near <A id=macchikasanda 
name=macchikasanda></A>Macchikasanda in the Wild Mango Grove. <A id=citta 
name=citta></A>Then Citta the householder went to him and, on arrival, having 
bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, Ven. Godatta said 
to him, "Householder, the immeasurable awareness-release, the nothingness 
awareness-release, the emptiness awareness-release, the themeless 
awareness-release: Are these phenomena different in meaning and different in 
name, or are they one in meaning and different only in name?" 
<P>"Venerable sir, there is a line of reasoning by which these phenomena are 
different in meaning and different in name, and there is a line of reasoning by 
which they are one in meaning and different only in name. 
<P>"And what is the line of reasoning by which they are different in meaning and 
different in name? There is the case where a monk keeps pervading the first 
direction [the east] with an awareness imbued with good will, likewise the 
second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth. Thus above, below, &amp; all 
around, everywhere, in its entirety, he keeps pervading the all-encompassing 
cosmos with an awareness imbued with good will -- abundant, expansive, 
immeasureable, without hostility, without ill will. He keeps pervading the first 
direction with an awareness imbued with compassion ... appreciation... 
equanimity, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth. Thus 
above, below, &amp; all around, everywhere, in its entirety, he keeps pervading 
the all-encompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with equanimity -- 
abundant, expansive, immeasurable, without hostility, without ill will. This is 
called the immeasurable awareness-release. 
<P>"And what is the nothingness awareness-release? There is the case where a 
monk, with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of 
consciousness, thinking, 'There is nothing,' enters &amp; remains in the 
dimension of nothingness. This is called the nothingness awareness-release. 
<P>"And what is the emptiness awareness-release? There is the case where a monk, 
having gone into the wilderness, to the root of a tree, or into an empty 
dwelling, considers this: 'This is empty of self or of anything pertaining to 
self.'[<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn41-007.html#n1" 
name=1>1</A>] This is called the emptiness awareness-release. 
<P>"And what is the themeless awareness-release? There is the case where a monk, 
not attending to any theme (object of awareness) enters &amp; remains in the 
themeless concentration of awareness.[<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn41-007.html#n2" 
name=2>2</A>] This is called the themeless awareness-release. 
<P>"This, venerable sir, is the line of reasoning by which these phenomena are 
different in meaning and different in name. 
<P>"And what, venerable sir, is the line of reasoning by which they are one in 
meaning and different only in name? Passion, venerable sir, is a making of 
measurement, aversion a making of measurement, delusion a making of measurement. 
<A id=palm name=palm></A>For a monk whose fermentations are ended these have 
been abandoned, their root destroyed, like an uprooted palm tree, deprived of 
the conditions of existence, not destined for future arising. To the extent that 
there are immeasurable awareness-releases, the unprovokable awareness-release is 
declared supreme. And that unprovokable awareness-release is empty of passion, 
empty of aversion, empty of delusion. 
<P>"Passion is a something, aversion a something, delusion a something. For a 
monk whose fermentations are ended these have been abandoned, their root 
destroyed, like an uprooted palm tree, deprived of the conditions of existence, 
not destined for future arising. To the extent that there are nothingness 
awareness-releases, the unprovokable awareness-release is declared supreme. And 
that unprovokable awareness-release is empty of passion, empty of aversion, 
empty of delusion. 
<P>"Passion is a making of themes, aversion a making of themes, delusion a 
making of themes. For a monk whose fermentations are ended these have been 
abandoned, their root destroyed, like an uprooted palm tree, deprived of the 
conditions of existence, not destined for future arising. To the extent that 
there are themeless awareness-releases, the unprovokable awareness-release is 
declared supreme. And that unprovokable awareness-release is empty of passion, 
empty of aversion, empty of delusion. 
<P>"This, venerable sir, is the line of reasoning by which these phenomena are 
one in meaning and different only in name." 
<P>"It's a gain for you, householder, a great gain: what your eye of discernment 
plumbs in the deep word of the Buddha."
