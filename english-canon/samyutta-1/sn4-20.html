<hr>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the <A NAME="kosala">Kosalans</A> in a wilderness hut in a <A NAME="himalayas">Himalayan</A> district. Then, as he was alone in seclusion, this train of thought arose in his awareness: "Is it possible to exercise rulership without killing or causing others to kill, without confiscating or causing others to confiscate, without sorrowing or causing others sorrow -- righteously?"
<p>
<A NAME="mara">Then</A> Mara, the Evil One, knowing with his awareness the train of thought in the Blessed One's awareness, went to him and on arrival said to him: "Exercise rulership, Blessed One! Exercise rulership, O One Well-gone! -- without killing or causing others to kill, without confiscating or causing others to confiscate, without sorrowing or causing others sorrow -- righteously!"
<p>
"But what do you see in me, Evil One, that you say to me, 'Exercise rulership, Blessed One! Exercise rulership, O One Well-gone! -- without killing or causing others to kill, without confiscating or causing others to confiscate, without sorrowing or causing others sorrow -- righteously!'?"
<p>
"Lord, the Blessed One has developed the four bases of power, pursued them, given them a means of transport, given them a grounding, steadied them, consolidated them, and undertaken them well. If he wanted to, he could resolve on the Himalayas, king of mountains, as gold, and it would become a mountain of gold."
<p>
<I>[The Buddha:]</I>
<blockquote>
<A NAME="gold">The</A> entirety<br>
of a mountain of gold,<br>
of solid bullion:<br>
even twice that<br>
wouldn't suffice<br>
for one person.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing this,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; live evenly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in tune with the contemplative life.
<p>
When you see stress,<br>
and from where it comes,<br>
how can you incline<br>
to sensual pleasures?<br>
Knowing acquisition<br>
to be a bond in the world,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; train for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its subduing.
</blockquote>
<p>
Then Mara the Evil One -- sad &amp; dejected at realizing, "The Blessed One knows me; the One Well-gone knows me" -- vanished right there.
