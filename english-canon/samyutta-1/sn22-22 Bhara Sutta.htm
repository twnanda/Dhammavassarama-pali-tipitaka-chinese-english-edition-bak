At Savatthi. "Monks, I will teach you the burden, the carrier of the burden, the 
taking up of the burden, and the casting off of the burden. [<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn22-022.html#n1" 
name=1>1</A>] Listen &amp; pay close attention. I will speak." 
<P>"As you say, lord," the monks responded. 
<P>The Blessed One said, "And which is the burden? 'The five 
clinging-aggregates,' it should be said. Which five? Form as a 
clinging-aggregate, feeling as a clinging-aggregate, perception as a 
clinging-aggregate, fabrications as a clinging-aggregate, consciousness as a 
clinging-aggregate. This, monks, is called the burden. 
<P>"And which is the carrier of the burden? 'The person,' it should be said. 
This venerable one with such a name, such a clan-name. This is called the 
carrier of the burden. 
<P>"And which is the taking up of the burden? The craving that makes for further 
becoming -- accompanied by passion &amp; delight, relishing now here &amp; now 
there -- i.e., craving for sensual pleasure, craving for becoming, craving for 
non-becoming. This is called the taking up of the burden. 
<P>"And which is the casting off of the burden? The remainderless fading &amp; 
cessation, renunciation, relinquishment, release, &amp; letting go of that very 
craving. This is called the casting off of the burden." 
<P>That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-gone, the 
Teacher, said further: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A burden indeed<BR>are the five aggregates, <BR>and the carrier of 
  the burden<BR>is the person.<BR>Taking up the burden in the 
  world<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is stressful.<BR>Casting off the 
  burden<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is bliss.<BR>Having cast off the heavy 
  burden<BR>and not taking on another,<BR>pulling up craving,<BR>along with its 
  root,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one is free from hunger,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; totally unbound. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Note</H3>
<P><B><A name=n1>1</A>.</B> This discourse parallels the teaching on the four 
noble truths, but with a twist. The "burden" is defined in the same terms as the 
first noble truth, the truth of suffering &amp; stress. The taking on of the 
burden is defined in the same terms as the second noble truth, the origination 
of stress; and the casting off of the burden, in the same terms as the third 
noble truth, the cessation of stress. The fourth factor, however -- the carrier 
of the burden -- has no parallel in the four noble truths, and has proven to be 
one of the most controversial terms in the history of Buddhist philosophy. When 
defining this factor as the person (or individual, <I>puggala), </I>the Buddha 
drops the abstract form of the other factors, and uses the ordinary, everyday 
language of narrative: the person with such-and-such a name. And how would this 
person translate into more abstract factors? He doesn't say. After his passing 
away, however, Buddhist scholastics attempted to provide an answer for him, and 
divided into two major camps over the issue. One camp refused to rank the 
concept of person as a truth on the ultimate level. This group inspired what 
eventually became the classic Theravada position on this issue: that the 
"person" was simply a conventional designation for the five aggregates. However, 
the other camp -- who developed into the Pudgalavadin (Personalist) school -- 
said that the person was neither a ultimate truth nor a mere conventional 
designation, neither identical with nor totally separate from the five 
aggregates. This special meaning of person, they said, was required to account 
for three things: the cohesion of a person's identity in this lifetime (one's 
person's memories, for instance, cannot become another person's memories); the 
unitary nature of rebirth (one person cannot be reborn in several places at 
once); and the fact that, with the cessation of the khandhas at the death of an 
arahant, he/she is said to attain the Further Shore. However, after that moment, 
they said, nothing further could be said about the person, for that was as far 
as the concept's descriptive powers could go. 
<P>As might be imagined, the first group accused the second group of denying the 
concept of anatta, or not-self; whereas the second group accused the first of 
being unable to account for the truths that they said their concept of person 
explained. Both groups, however, found that their positions entangled them in 
philosophical difficulties that have never been successfully resolved. 
<P>Perhaps the most useful lesson to draw from the history of this controversy 
is the one that accords with the Buddha's statements in <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/majjhima/mn072.html">MN 72</A>, 
where he refuses to get involved in questions of whether a person has a live 
essence separate from or identical to his/her body, or of whether after death 
there is something of an arahant that exists or not. In other words, the 
questions aren't worth asking. Nothing is accomplished by assuming or denying an 
ultimate reality behind what we think of as a person. Instead, the strategy of 
the practice is to comprehend the burden that we each are carrying and to throw 
it off. As <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn22-036.html">SN 
XXII.36</A> points out, when one stops trying to define oneself in any way, one 
is free from all limitations -- and that settles all questions. [<A
