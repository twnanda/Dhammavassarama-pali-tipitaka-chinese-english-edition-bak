<HR>
Dwelling at <A name=savatthi>Savatthi</A>... Then a certain brahman went to the 
Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an 
exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was 
sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "What now, Master Gotama: Is the one 
who acts the same one who experiences [the results of the act]?" 
<P>[The Buddha:] "[To say,] 'The one who acts is the same one who experiences,' 
is one extreme." 
<P>[The brahman:] "Then, Master Gotama, is the one who acts someone other than 
the one who experiences?" 
<P>[The Buddha:] "[To say,] 'The one who acts is someone other than the one who 
experiences,' is the second extreme. Avoiding both of these extremes, the 
Tathagata teaches the Dhamma by means of the middle: From ignorance as a 
requisite condition come fabrications. From fabrications as a requisite 
condition comes consciousness. From consciousness as a requisite condition comes 
name-&amp;-form. From name-&amp;-form as a requisite condition come the six 
sense media. From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact. 
From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling. From feeling as a requisite 
condition comes craving. From craving as a requisite condition comes 
clinging/sustenance. From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes 
becoming. From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth. From birth as a 
requisite condition, then aging &amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, 
distress, &amp; despair come into play. Such is the origination of this entire 
mass of stress &amp; suffering. 
<P>"Now from the remainderless fading &amp; cessation of that very ignorance 
comes the cessation of fabrications. From the cessation of fabrications comes 
the cessation of consciousness. From the cessation of consciousness comes the 
cessation of name-&amp;-form. From the cessation of name-&amp;-form comes the 
cessation of the six sense media. From the cessation of the six sense media 
comes the cessation of contact. From the cessation of contact comes the 
cessation of feeling. From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of 
craving. From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of 
clinging/sustenance. From the cessation of clinging/sustenance comes the 
cessation of becoming. From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of 
birth. From the cessation of birth, then aging &amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, 
pain, distress, &amp; despair all cease. Such is the cessation of this entire 
mass of stress &amp; suffering." 
<P>When this was said, the brahman said to the Blessed One: "<A 
name=magnif>Magnificent</A>, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to 
place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to point out the 
way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with 
eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama -- through many lines of 
reasoning -- made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the 
Dhamma, &amp; to the community of monks. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay 
follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward, for life." <!-- #bbinclude "footer.html" --><!-- THE TEXT BELOW IS AUTOMAGICALLY GENERATED FROM AN INCLUDE FILE. --><!-- robots content="none" -->
