Dwelling at <a name="savatthi">Savatthi</a>. There the Blessed One addressed the monks: "I will teach you the origination of the world &amp; the ending of the world. Listen &amp; pay close attention. I will speak."
<p>
"As you say, lord," the monks responded to the Blessed One.
<p>
The Blessed One said: "And what is the origination of the world? Dependent on the eye &amp; forms there arises eye-consciousness. The meeting of the three is contact. From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling. From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving. From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance. From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming. From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth. From birth as a requisite condition, then aging &amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair come into play. This is the origination of the world.
<p>
"Dependent on the ear &amp; sounds there arises ear-consciousness. The meeting of the three is contact...Dependent on the nose &amp; aromas there arises nose-consciousness. The meeting of the three is contact...Dependent on the tongue &amp; flavors there arises tongue-consciousness. The meeting of the three is contact...Dependent on the body &amp; tactile sensations there arises body-consciousness. The meeting of the three is contact...Dependent on the intellect &amp; mental qualities there arises intellect-consciousness. The meeting of the three is contact. From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling. From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving. From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance. From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming. From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth. From birth as a requisite condition, then aging &amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair come into play. This is the origination of the world.
<p>
"And what is the ending of the world? Dependent on the eye &amp; forms there arises eye-consciousness. The meeting of the three is contact. From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling. From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving. Now, from the remainderless cessation &amp; fading away of that very craving comes the cessation of clinging/sustenance. From the cessation of clinging/sustenance comes the cessation of becoming. From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth. From the cessation of birth, then aging &amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair all cease. Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress &amp; suffering. This is the ending of the world.
