<HR>
On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A name=vesali>Vesali</A> in 
the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest. Then <A name=nandaka>Nandaka</A>, the chief 
minister of the <A name=licchavi>Licchavis</A>, went to the Blessed One and on 
arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there the 
Blessed One said to him: "Nandaka, a disciple of the noble ones endowed with 
four qualities is a stream-winner, steadfast, never again destined for states of 
woe, headed for self-awakening. Which four? 
<P>"There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with 
unwavering confidence in the Awakened One: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy 
and rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge &amp; conduct, well-gone, an 
expert with regard to the world, unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to 
be tamed, the Teacher of divine &amp; human beings, awakened, blessed.' 
<P>"He/she is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Dhamma: 'The Dhamma is 
well-expounded by the Blessed One, to be seen here &amp; now, timeless, inviting 
verification, pertinent, to be realized by the wise for themselves.' 
<P>"He/she is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Sangha: 'The Sangha of 
the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced well...who have practiced 
straight-forwardly...who have practiced methodically...who have practiced 
masterfully-in other words, the four types of noble disciples when taken as 
pairs, the eight when taken as individual types-they are the Sangha of the 
Blessed One's disciples: worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of 
offerings, worthy of respect, the incomparable field of merit for the world.' 
<P>"He/she is endowed with virtues that are appealing to the noble ones: untorn, 
unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered, liberating, praised by the wise, untarnished, 
leading to concentration. 
<P>"A disciple of the noble ones endowed with these four qualities is a 
stream-winner, steadfast, never again destined for states of woe, headed for 
self-awakening. 
<P>"Furthermore, a disciple of the noble ones endowed with these four qualities 
is linked with long life, human or divine; is linked with beauty, human or 
divine; is linked with happiness, human or divine; is linked with status, human 
or divine; is linked with influence, human or divine. 
<P>"I tell you this, Nandaka, not having heard it from any other brahman or 
contemplative. Instead, I tell you this having known, seen, and realized it for 
myself." 
<P>When this was said, a certain man said to Nandaka, the chief minister of the 
Licchavis, "It is now time for your bath, sir." 
<P>[Nandaka responded,] "Enough, I say, with this external bath. I am satisfied 
with this internal bath: confidence in the Blessed One." <!-- #bbinclude "footer.html" --><!-- THE TEXT BELOW IS AUTOMAGICALLY GENERATED FROM AN INCLUDE FILE. --><!-- robots content="none" -->
