<P>Then Ven. Malunkyaputta, who was ardent &amp; resolute, went to the Blessed 
One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was 
sitting there, he said to the Blessed One: "It would be good, lord, if the 
Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief so that, having heard the Dhamma 
from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone in seclusion: heedful, ardent, &amp; 
resolute." </P>
<P>"Here now, Malunkyaputta: What will I say to the young monks when you — aged, 
old, elderly, along in years, come to the last stage of life — ask for an 
admonition in brief?" </P>
<P>"Lord, even though I'm aged, old, elderly, along in years, come to the last 
stage of life, may the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma in brief! May the One 
Well-gone teach me the Dhamma in brief! It may well be that I'll understand the 
Blessed One's words. It may well be that I'll become an heir to the Blessed 
One's words." </P>
<P>"What do you think, Malunkyaputta: the forms cognizable via the eye that are 
unseen by you — that you have never before seen, that you don't see, and that 
are not to be seen by you: Do you have any desire or passion or love there?" 
</P>
<P>"No, lord."<SUP><A

<P>"No, lord." </P>
<P>"Then, Malunkyaputta, with regard to phenomena to be seen, heard, sensed, or 
cognized: In reference to the seen, there will be only the seen. In reference to 
the heard, only the heard. In reference to the sensed, only the sensed. In 
reference to the cognized, only the cognized. That is how you should train 
yourself. When for you there will be only the seen in reference to the seen, 
only the heard in reference to the heard, only the sensed in reference to the 
sensed, only the cognized in reference to the cognized, then, Malunkyaputta, 
there is no <EM>you</EM> in connection with that. When there is no <EM>you</EM> 
in connection with that, there is no <EM>you</EM> there. When there is no 
<EM>you</EM>there, you are neither here nor yonder nor between the two. This, 
just this, is the end of stress."<SUP><A

<DIV class=verse><PRE>Seeing a form
	— mindfulness lapsed —
attending

<P>"Good, Malunkyaputta. Very good. It's good that you understand in detail this 
way the meaning of what I said in brief." </P>

<P><A name=victory></A>Then Ven. Malunkyaputta, having been admonished by the 
admonishment <!--jtb 050203: (sic.) AG says that "admonished by the admonishment from the Blessed One" is how the Pali reads.-->from 
the Blessed One, got up from his seat and bowed down to the Blessed One, circled 
around him, keeping the Blessed One to his right side, and left. Then, dwelling 
alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute, he in no long time reached 
&amp; remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly 
go forth from home into homelessness, knowing &amp; realizing it for himself in 
the here &amp; now. He knew: "Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task 
done. There is nothing further for the sake of this world." And thus Ven. 
Malunkyaputta became another one of the arahants. </P></DIV></DIV>

one has not seen. Strictly speaking, however, the desire is not "there" at the 
unseen sight. Rather, it's there at the present idea of the unseen sight. This 
distinction is important for the purpose of the practice. </P></DIV>
