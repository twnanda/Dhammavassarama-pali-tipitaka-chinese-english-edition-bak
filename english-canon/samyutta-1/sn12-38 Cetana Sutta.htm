Staying at Savatthi... [the Blessed One said,] "What one intends, what one 
arranges, and what one obsesses about:[<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn12-038.html#n1" 
name=1>1</A>] This is a support for the stationing of consciousness. There being 
a support, there is a landing [or: an establishing] of consciousness. When that 
consciousness lands and grows, there is the production of renewed becoming in 
the future. When there is the production of renewed becoming in the future, 
there is future birth, aging &amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, 
&amp; despair. Such is the origination of this entire mass of suffering &amp; 
stress. 
<P>"If one doesn't intend and doesn't arrange, but one still obsesses [about 
something], this is a support for the stationing of consciousness. There being a 
support, there is a landing of consciousness. When that consciousness lands and 
grows, there is the production of renewed becoming in the future. When there is 
the production of renewed becoming in the future, there is future birth, aging 
&amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair. Such [too] is 
the origination of this entire mass of suffering &amp; stress. 
<P>"But when one doesn't intend, arrange, or obsess [about anything], there is 
no support for the stationing of consciousness. There being no support, there is 
no landing of consciousness. When that consciousness doesn't land &amp; grow, 
there is no production of renewed becoming in the future. When there is no 
production of renewed becoming in the future, there is no future birth, aging 
&amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, or despair. Such is the 
cessation of this entire mass of suffering &amp; stress."

<H3 align=left>Note</H3><B><A name=n1>1</A>.</B> The seven obsessions are: the 
obsession of sensual passion, the obsession of resistance, the obsession of 
views, the obsession of uncertainty, the obsession of conceit, the obsession of 
passion for becoming, and the obsession of ignorance. See <A
