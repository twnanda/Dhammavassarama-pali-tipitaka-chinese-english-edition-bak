I have heard that on one occasion a certain monk was dwelling among the <A NAME="kosala">Kosalans</A> in a forest thicket. Now at that time, as he had gone to spend the day [in the thicket], he was thinking unskillful thoughts, connected with the household life.
<p>
Then the devata inhabiting the forest thicket, feeling sympathy for the monk, desiring his benefit, desiring to bring him to his senses, approached him and addressed him with this verse: 
<p>
<blockquote>
"Desiring seclusion<br>
you've entered the forest,<br>
and yet your mind<br>
goes running outside.<br>
You, a person:<br>
subdue your desire for people.<br>
Then you'll be happy, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; free<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from passion.<br>
Dispel discontent,<br>
be mindful.<br>
Let me remind you<br>
of that which is good -- <br>
for the dust<br>
of the regions below<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is hard to transcend.<br>
Don't let the dust<br>
of the sensual<br>
pull<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; down.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A NAME="bird">As a bird</A><br>
spattered with dirt<br>
sheds the adhering dust with a shake,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so a monk<br>
-- energetic &amp; mindful -- <br>
sheds the adhering dust."
</blockquote>
<p> 
The monk, chastened by the devata, came to his senses.
