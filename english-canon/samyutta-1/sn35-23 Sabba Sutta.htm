"Monks, I will teach you the All. Listen &amp; pay close attention. I will 
speak." 
<P>"As you say, lord," the monks responded. 
<P>The Blessed One said, "What is the All? Simply the eye &amp; forms, ear &amp; 
sounds, nose &amp; aromas, tongue &amp; flavors, body &amp; tactile sensations, 
intellect &amp; ideas. This, monks, is called the All. [<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn35-023.html#n1" 
name=1>1</A>] Anyone who would say, 'Repudiating this All, I will describe 
another,' if questioned on what exactly might be the grounds for his statement, 
would be unable to explain, and furthermore, would be put to grief. Why? Because 
it lies beyond range." 
<HR>

<H3>Note</H3>
<P><B><A name=n1>1</A>.</B> The Commentary's treatment of this discourse is very 
peculiar. To begin with, it delineates three other "All's" in addition to the 
one defined here, one of them supposedly larger in scope than the one defined 
here: the Allness of the Buddha's omniscience (literally, All-knowingness). 
This, despite the fact that the discourse says that the description of such an 
all lies beyond the range of explanation. 
<P>Secondly, the Commentary includes nibbana (unbinding) within the scope of the 
All described here -- as a dhamma, or object of the intellect -- even though 
there are many other discourses in the Canon specifically stating that nibbana 
lies beyond the range of the six senses and their objects. <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/suttanipata/snp5-06.html">Sn 
V.6</A>, for instance, indicates that a person who has attained nibbana has gone 
beyond all phenomena <I>(sabbe dhamma),</I> and therefore cannot be described. 
MN 49 discusses a "consciousness without feature"<I> (vi&ntilde;&ntilde;anam anidassanam) 
</I>that does not partake of the "Allness of the All." Furthermore, the 
following discourse (<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn35-024.html">SN 
XXXV.24</A>) says that the "All" is to be abandoned. At no point does the Canon 
say that nibbana is to be abandoned. Nibbana follows on cessation <I>(nirodha), 
</I>which is to be realized. Once nibbana is realized, there are no further 
tasks to be done. 
<P>Thus it seems more this discourse's discussion of "All" is meant to limit the 
use of the word "all" throughout the Buddha's teachings to the six sense spheres 
and their objects. As the following discourse shows, this would also include the 
consciousness, contact, and feelings connected with the sense spheres and their 
objects. Nibbana would lie outside of the word, "all." This would fit in with 
another point made several times in the Canon: that dispassion is the highest of 
all dhammas (<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/iti/iti3.html#90">Iti 
90</A>), while the arahant has gone beyond even dispassion (<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/suttanipata/snp4-06.html">Sn 
IV.6</A>; <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/suttanipata/snp4-10.html">Sn 
IV.10</A>). 
<P>This raises the question, if the word "all" does not include nibbana, does 
that mean that one may infer from the statement, "all phenomena are not-self" 
that nibbana is self? The answer is no. As <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/anguttara/an04-174.html">AN 
IV.174</A> states, to even ask if there is anything remaining or not remaining 
(or both, or neither) after the cessation of the six sense spheres is to 
differentiate what is by nature undifferentiated (or to complicate the 
uncomplicated -- see the Introduction to <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/majjhima/mn018-tb0.html">MN 
18</A>). The range of differentiation goes only as far as the "All." Perceptions 
of self or not-self, which would count as differentiation, would not apply 
beyond the "All." When the cessation of the "All" is experienced, all 
differentiation is allayed. [<A
