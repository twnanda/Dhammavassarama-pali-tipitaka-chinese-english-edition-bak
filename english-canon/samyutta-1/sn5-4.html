<hr>
At Savatthi. Then, early in the morning, Vijaya the nun put on her robes and, taking her bowl &amp; outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. When she had gone for alms in Savatthi and had returned from her alms round, after her meal she went to the Grove of the Blind to spend the day. Having gone deep into the Grove of the Blind, she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day's abiding.
<p>
Then Mara the Evil One, wanting to arouse fear, horripilation, &amp; terror in her, wanting to make her fall away from concentration, approached her &amp; addressed her in verse:
<blockquote>
You, a beautiful young woman.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, a young man.<br>
Come, my lady,<br>
let's enjoy ourselves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the music of a five-piece band.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Then the thought occurred to Vijaya the nun: "Now who has recited this verse -- a human being or a non-human one?" Then it occurred to her: "This is Mara the Evil One, who has recited this verse wanting to arouse fear, horripilation, &amp; terror in me, wanting to make me fall away from concentration."
<p>
Then, having understood that "This is Mara the Evil One," she replied to him in verses:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Lovely sights, sounds,<br>
smells, tastes,<br>
&amp; tactile sensations<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I leave to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you, Mara.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have no need<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for them.<br>
I'm disgusted, ashamed<br>
of this putrid body -- <br>
disintegrating, dissolving.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sensual craving<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is rooted out.<br>
Beings who have come to form,<br>
&amp; those with a share in the formless,<br>
&amp; the peaceful attainments:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their darkness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is completely destroyed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Then Mara the Evil One -- sad &amp; dejected at realizing, "Vijaya the nun knows me" -- vanished right there.
