<P><BR>
<P>The four activities included in this set show how effort can be applied to <A 
name=skill1>developing skillful qualities</A> in the mind. The basic formula 
runs as follows: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>There is the case where a monk generates desire, endeavors, 
  arouses persistence, upholds &amp; exerts his intent: 
  <P>
  <UL>
    <LI>for the sake of the non-arising of evil, unskillful qualities that have 
    not yet arisen... 
    <LI>for the sake of the abandoning of evil, unskillful qualities that have 
    arisen... 
    <LI>for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet 
    arisen...(and) 
    <LI>for the maintenance, non-confusion, increase, plenitude, development, 
    &amp; culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen. 
</LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>These four aspects of effort are also termed guarding, 
abandoning, developing, and maintaining [<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/2c.html#50">§50</A>]. 
All four play a necessary role in bringing the mind to Awakening, although in 
some cases they are simply four sides to a single process. The abandoning of 
unskillful mental qualities can frequently be accomplished simply by focusing on 
the development of skillful ones, such as mindfulness. The same principle can 
also act in reverse: in the skillful eradication of unskillful qualities, the 
skillfulness of the eradication is in and of itself the development of mindful 
discernment. As we will see when we deal with the seven factors for Awakening 
[<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/2g.html">II/G</A>], 
the act of <A name=feed1>nourishing a factor</A> of Awakening can in some cases 
simultaneously starve a hindrance, while the conscious starving of a hindrance 
can foster a factor for Awakening. Ultimately, though, right exertion requires 
more than simply abstaining from what is unskillful, for it must apply the basic 
factors of skillfulness -- mindfulness and discernment -- to gain an 
understanding of how even skillfulness can be transcended [<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/2c.html#61">§61</A>]. 

<P>Perhaps the most important point in developing right exertion is to realize 
that the effort to abandon unskillful qualities and to develop skillful 
qualities must be skillful itself. Unskillful efforts at eradicating unskillful 
states, even if well intended, can many times exacerbate problems instead of 
solving them. Treating hatred with hatred, for instance, is less effective than 
treating it with the kind of understanding developed in the <A 
name=2frame1>second stage of frames-of-reference meditation</A> [<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/2b.html">II/B</A>], 
which sees into causes and effects, and learns how to manipulate causes properly 
so as to get the desired effects. For this reason, the basic formula for right 
exertion includes, both implicitly and explicitly, other factors of the path to 
ensure that the effort is skillfully applied. Three of the qualities that 
activate the mind in these exertions -- desire, persistence, and intent -- are 
also members of the bases of power [<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/2d.html">II/D</A>], 
where they function as dominant factors in the attainment of concentration. <A 
name=discrim1>The ability to discriminate</A> between skillful and unskillful 
qualities, implicit in all of these exertions, requires a certain level of 
mindfulness and discernment. The skillful qualities that are mentioned most 
prominently as worthy of development are the seven factors for Awakening, which 
include mindfulness, analysis of mental qualities, and the factors of jhana, all 
of which must be reinvested in the process of right exertion to bring it to 
higher levels of finesse. 
<P>Passage <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/2c.html#51">§51</A> 
gives an idea of right exertion's range of application by listing seven ways in 
which unskillful qualities can be abandoned: seeing, <A 
name=restrain1>restraining</A>, using, tolerating, avoiding, destroying, and 
developing. The passage is deliberately vague as to which types of unskillful 
qualities respond to which type of treatment, for this is a point that each 
meditator must discover in practice for him or herself. This emphasis on 
personal exploration is crucial to the practice of right effort, for it 
encourages one to be sensitive to what can be discovered with one's own 
mindfulness and discernment. The same point applies to the question of how much 
effort must be applied to the practice. The Buddha notes that some meditators 
will have to undergo painful and slow practice, while others will find that 
their practice is painful and quick, pleasant and slow, or pleasant and quick 
[<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/2e.html#84">§§84-85</A>]. 
Thus each has to adjust the effort applied to the practice accordingly. This 
need for differing levels of effort depends not only on the individual, but also 
on the situation. In some cases, simply watching an unskillful quality with 
equanimity will be enough to make it go away; in other cases, one has to exert a 
conscious effort to get rid of it [<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/2c.html#58">§§58-59</A>]. 
Thus, through observation, one will realize that skillful effort has no room for 
doctrinaire approaches. The polar extremes of constant exertion to the point of 
exhaustion and its opposite, a knee-jerk fear of "efforting," are both misguided 
here, as is the seemingly "middle" way of moderation in all things. The true 
middle way means <A name=tuning1>tuning</A> one's efforts to one's abilities and 
to the task at hand [<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/2e.html#86">§86</A>]. 
In some cases, this entails an all-out effort; in others, simple watchfulness. 
The ability to sense what kind and what level of effort is appropriate in any 
given situation is an important element in developing the basic requirements for 
skill -- mindfulness and discernment -- by putting them to use. 
<P>We have already noted that right exertion is equivalent to the factor of 
ardency in frames-of-reference meditation [<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/2b.html">II/B</A>]. 
In the <A name=1frame1>first stage</A> of that practice, right exertion 
functions by keeping the mind with its frame of reference and by warding off 
unskillful mental qualities that would make it abandon that frame. In the <A 
name=2frame2>second stage</A>, the function of exertion becomes more refined: 
warding off the tendency to get involved with "what" is arising and passing 
away, and keeping the mind applied to its task of manipulating, observing, and 
mastering the <B>process</B> of origination and passing away as one steers the 
mind to the stillness of jhana. In the <A name=3frame1>third stage</A>, the 
function of exertion becomes finer yet, as it maintains a basic "empty" or 
radically <A name=phenom1>phenomenological awareness</A> of the frame of 
reference in order to bring the mind to the state of non-fashioning appropriate 
for the process of Awakening. The equipoise of this state -- beyond the 
categories of effort or non-effort -- explains the paradox expressed in <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/2c.html#62">§62</A>, 
which states that the mind crosses the flood of rebirth by neither "pushing 
forward" nor "staying in place," an equipoise that embodies the ultimate 
skillfulness of right exertion in bringing the mind to a point beyond skill. 
<P>Implicit in this discussion of the effort involved in <A 
name=mastery1>mastering skill</A> to the point of its own transcendence is the 
fact that the goal of the practice is not an effort to return to a supposedly 
pure state of childlike awareness prior to social conditionings. Passage <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/2c.html#61">§61</A> 
makes this fact explicit. According to Buddhist analysis, the state of a child's 
mind is one, not of purity, but of ignorance filled with the potential for many 
unskilled qualities. These qualities show themselves in seemingly innocent ways 
simply because the infant's intellectual and physical powers are weak. Once 
those powers are strengthened, the mind's potentials become manifest. As one 
modern teacher has stated, the childlike mind is the source for the round of 
rebirth. If it were truly pure and fully aware, it would not be susceptible to 
unskillful social conditioning. Thus the way to purity lies, not in renouncing 
one's developed intellectual powers, but in developing those powers to higher 
levels of mastery and skill. This explains why right exertion is a necessary 
part of the practice.

<P><B><A name=49>§ 49</A>.</B> There are these four right exertions. Which four? 
There is the case where a monk generates desire, endeavors, arouses persistence, 
upholds &amp; exerts his intent for the sake of the non-arising of evil, 
unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen... for the sake of the abandoning 
of evil, unskillful qualities that have arisen... for the sake of the arising of 
skillful qualities that have not yet arisen...(and) for the maintenance, 
non-confusion, increase, plenitude, development, &amp; culmination of skillful 
qualities that have arisen. These are the four right exertions. 
<P>Just as <A name=ganges49>the River Ganges</A> flows to the east, slopes to 
the east, inclines to the east, in the same way when a monk develops &amp; 
pursues the four right exertions, he flows to Unbinding, slopes to Unbinding, 
inclines to Unbinding. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>-- SN XLIX.1 </BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>
<P><B><A name=50>§ 50</A>.</B> There are these four exertions. Which four? The 
exertion to guard, the exertion to abandon, the exertion to develop, &amp; the 
exertion to maintain. 
<P>And what is the exertion to guard? There is the case where a monk, on seeing 
a form with the eye, does not grasp at any theme or variations by which -- if he 
were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye -- evil, unskillful 
qualities such as greed or distress might assail him. <A name=restrain2>He 
practices with restraint</A>. He guards the faculty of the eye. He achieves 
restraint with regard to the faculty of the eye. (Similarly with the ear, nose, 
tongue, body, &amp; intellect.) This is called the exertion to guard. 
<P>And what is the exertion to abandon? There is the case where a monk does not 
acquiesce to a thought of sensuality that has arisen [in him]. He abandons it, 
destroys it, dispels it, wipes it out of existence. He does not acquiesce to a 
thought of ill will... a thought of harmfulness... any evil, unskillful 
qualities that have arisen [in him]. He abandons them, destroys them, dispels 
them, wipes them out of existence. This is called the exertion to abandon. 
<P>And what is the exertion to develop? There is the case where a monk develops 
the <I>mindfulness</I> factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion... 
dispassion... cessation, resulting in letting go. He develops the 
<I>investigation of qualities</I> factor for Awakening... the <I>persistence</I> 
factor for Awakening... the <I>rapture</I> factor for Awakening... the 
<I>serenity</I> factor for Awakening... the <I>concentration</I> factor for 
Awakening... the <I>equanimity</I> factor for Awakening dependent on 
seclusion... dispassion... cessation, resulting in letting go. This is called 
the exertion to develop. 
<P>And what is the exertion to maintain? There is the case where a monk 
maintains a favorable theme of concentration -- the skeleton perception, the 
worm-eaten perception, the livid perception, the festering perception, the 
falling-apart perception, the bloated perception. This is called the exertion to 
maintain. [<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/2b.html#30">§30</A>] 

<P>These are the four exertions. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Guarding &amp; abandoning,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; developing &amp; 
  maintaining:<BR>these four exertions, taught<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the 
  Kinsman of the Sun<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [the Buddha]. 
  <P>A monk who strives<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ardently at them<BR>reaches the 
  ending<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of stress. 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>-- AN IV.14 </BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BR>
<P><B><A name=51>§ 51</A>.</B> The ending of the <A name=asava1>effluents</A> is 
for one who knows &amp; sees, I tell you, not for one who does not know &amp; 
does not see. For one who knows what &amp; sees what? <A 
name=yoniso1>Appropriate attention</A> &amp; inappropriate attention. When a 
monk attends inappropriately, unarisen effluents arise, and arisen effluents 
increase. When a monk attends appropriately, unarisen effluents do not arise, 
and arisen effluents are abandoned. There are effluents that are to be abandoned 
by seeing, those that are to be abandoned by restraining, those that are to be 
abandoned by using, those that are to be abandoned by tolerating, those that are 
to be abandoned by avoiding, those that are to be abandoned by destroying, and 
those that are to be abandoned by developing. 
<P>And what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by seeing? There is the 
case where an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person... does not discern what 
ideas are fit for attention, or what ideas are unfit for attention. This being 
so, he does not attend to ideas fit for attention, and attends [instead] to 
ideas unfit for attention. And what are the ideas unfit for attention that he 
attends to? Whatever ideas such that, when he attends to them, the unarisen 
effluent of sensuality arises, and the arisen effluent of sensuality increases; 
the unarisen effluent of becoming... the unarisen effluent of ignorance arises, 
and the arisen effluent of ignorance increases... This is how he attends 
inappropriately: 'Was I in the past? Was I not in the past? What was I in the 
past? How was I in the past? Having been what, what was I in the past? Shall I 
be in the future? Shall I not be in the future? What shall I be in the future? 
How shall I be in the future? Having been what, what shall I be in the future?' 
Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present: 'Am I? Am I not? 
What am I? How am I? Where has this being come from? Where is it bound?' 
<P>As he attends inappropriately in this way, one of six kinds of view arises in 
him: The view <I>I have a self</I> arises in him as true &amp; established, or 
the view<I> I have no self</I>... or the view<I> It is precisely by means of 
self that I perceive self</I>... or the view <I>It is precisely by means of self 
that I perceive <A name=notself1>not-self</A></I>... or the view <I>It is 
precisely by means of not-self that I perceive self</I> arises in him as true 
&amp; established, or else he has a view like this: <I>This very self of mine -- 
the knower that is sensitive here &amp; there to the ripening of good &amp; bad 
actions -- is the self of mine that is constant, everlasting, eternal, not 
subject to change, and will endure as long as eternity.</I> <A 
name=thicket1>This</A> is called a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a 
contortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views. Bound by a fetter 
of views, the uninstructed run-of-the-mill person is not freed from birth, 
aging, &amp; death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair. He 
is not freed, I tell you, from stress. [<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/3h3.html#218">§218</A>] 

<P>The well-taught disciple of the noble ones... discerns what ideas are fit for 
attention, and what ideas are unfit for attention. This being so, he does not 
attend to ideas unfit for attention, and attends [instead] to ideas fit for 
attention... And what are the ideas fit for attention that he attends to? 
Whatever ideas such that, when he attends to them, the unarisen effluent of 
sensuality does not arise, and the arisen effluent of sensuality is abandoned; 
the unarisen effluent of becoming... the unarisen effluent of ignorance does not 
arise, and the arisen effluent of ignorance is abandoned... He attends 
appropriately, <I>This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is 
the cessation of stress... This is the way leading to the cessation of 
stress.</I> As he attends appropriately in this way, three fetters are abandoned 
in him: identity-view, <A name=doubt1>doubt</A>, and grasping at precepts &amp; 
practices. These are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by seeing. 
<P><A name=restrain3>And what are the effluents</A> that are to be abandoned by 
restraining? There is the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, dwells 
restrained with the restraint of the eye-faculty. The effluents, vexation, or 
fever that would arise if he were to dwell unrestrained with the restraint of 
the eye-faculty do not arise for him when he dwells restrained with the 
restraint of the eye-faculty. (Similarly with the ear, nose, tongue, body, &amp; 
intellect-faculties.) These are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by 
restraining. 
<P>And what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by using? There is the 
case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, uses the robe simply to counteract 
cold, to counteract heat, to counteract the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, 
sun, &amp; reptiles; simply for the purpose of covering the parts of the body 
that cause shame. 
<P>Reflecting appropriately, he uses almsfood, not playfully, nor for 
intoxication, nor for putting on bulk, nor for beautification; but simply for 
the survival &amp; continuance of this body, for ending its afflictions, for the 
support of the holy life, thinking, 'Thus will I destroy old feelings [of 
hunger] and not create new feelings [from overeating]. I will maintain myself, 
be blameless, &amp; live in comfort.' 
<P>Reflecting appropriately, he uses lodging simply to counteract cold, to 
counteract heat, to counteract the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, &amp; 
reptiles; simply for protection from the inclemencies of weather and for the 
enjoyment of seclusion. 
<P>Reflecting appropriately, he uses medicinal requisites for curing illness 
simply to counteract any pains of illness that have arisen and for maximum 
freedom from disease. 
<P>The effluents, vexation, or fever that would arise if he were not to use 
these things [in this way] do not arise for him when he uses them [in this way]. 
These are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by using. 
<P>And what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by tolerating? There is 
the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, endures. He tolerates cold, 
heat, hunger, &amp; thirst; the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, &amp; 
reptiles; ill-spoken, unwelcome words &amp; bodily feelings that, when they 
arise, are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, disagreeable, displeasing, &amp; 
menacing to life. The effluents, vexation, or fever that would arise if he were 
not to tolerate these things do not arise for him when he tolerates them. These 
are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by tolerating. 
<P>And what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by avoiding? There is the 
case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, avoids a wild elephant, a wild 
horse, a wild bull, a wild dog, a snake, a stump, a bramble patch, a chasm, a 
cliff, a cesspool, an open sewer. Reflecting appropriately, he avoids sitting in 
the sorts of unsuitable seats, wandering to the sorts of unsuitable habitats, 
and associating with the sorts of bad friends that would make his knowledgeable 
friends in the holy life suspect him of evil conduct. The effluents, vexation, 
or fever that would arise if he were not to avoid these things do not arise for 
him when he avoids them. These are called the effluents that are to be abandoned 
by avoiding. 
<P>And what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by destroying? There is 
the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, does not tolerate an arisen 
thought of sensuality. He abandons it, destroys it, dispels it, &amp; wipes it 
out of existence. (Similarly with thoughts of ill will, thoughts of cruelty, 
&amp; evil, unskillful mental qualities.) The effluents, vexation, or fever that 
would arise if he were not to destroy these things do not arise for him when he 
destroys them. These are called the effluents that are to be abandoned by 
destroying. 
<P>And what are the effluents that are to be abandoned by developing? There is 
the case where a monk, reflecting appropriately, develops the <I>mindfulness</I> 
as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion... dispassion... cessation, 
resulting in letting go. He develops the <I>analysis of qualities</I> as a 
factor for Awakening... the <I>persistence</I> as a factor for Awakening... the 
<I>rapture</I> as a factor for Awakening... the <I>serenity</I> as a factor for 
Awakening... the <I>concentration</I> as a factor for Awakening... the 
<I>equanimity</I> as a factor for Awakening dependent on seclusion... 
dispassion... cessation, resulting in letting go. The effluents, vexation, or 
fever that would arise if he were not to develop these qualities do not arise 
for him when he develops them. These are called the effluents that are to be 
abandoned by developing. 
<P>When a monk's effluents that should be abandoned by seeing have been 
abandoned by seeing, his effluents that should be abandoned by restraining have 
been abandoned by restraining, 
<P>his effluents that should be abandoned by using have been abandoned by using, 

<P>his effluents that should be abandoned by tolerating have been abandoned by 
tolerating, 
<P>his effluents that should be abandoned by avoiding have been abandoned by 
avoiding, 
<P>his effluents that should be abandoned by destroying have been abandoned by 
destroying, 
<P>his effluents that should be abandoned by developing have been abandoned by 
developing, 
<P>then he is called a monk who dwells restrained with the restraint of all the 
effluents. He has severed craving, thrown off the fetters, and -- through the 
right penetration of conceit -- has made an end of suffering &amp; stress.

<P><B><A name=52>§ 52</A>.</B> These are the five factors for exertion. Which 
five? 
<P>[a] There is the case where a monk has conviction, is convinced of the 
Tathagata's Awakening: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy and rightly 
self-awakened, consummate in knowledge &amp; conduct, well-gone, an expert with 
regard to the world, unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed, 
the Teacher of divine &amp; human beings, awakened, blessed.' [<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/2e.html#71">§§71-72</A>] 

<P>[b] The monk is free from illness &amp; discomfort, endowed with good 
digestion -- not too cold, not too hot, of moderate strength -- fit for 
exertion. 
<P>[c] He is neither fraudulent nor deceitful. He declares himself to the 
Teacher or to his wise friends in the holy life in line with what he actually 
is. 
<P>[d] He keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental 
qualities and taking on skillful mental qualities. He is steadfast, solid in his 
effort, not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualities. 
<P>[e] He is discerning, endowed with discernment leading to the arising of the 
goal -- noble, penetrating, leading to the right ending of stress. 
<P>These are the five factors for exertion.

capable of self-awakening, capable of Unbinding, capable of attaining the

<P><A name=kassapa56>Maha Kassapa</A>: There is the case where a monk thinks, 
'The arising of unarisen evil, unskillful qualities would lead to what is 
unbeneficial,' yet he arouses no ardor. 'The non-abandoning of arisen evil, 
unskillful qualities would lead to what is unbeneficial,' yet he arouses no 
ardor. 'The non-arising of unarisen skillful qualities would lead to what is 
unbeneficial,' yet he arouses no ardor. 'The ceasing of arisen skillful 
qualities would lead to what is unbeneficial,' yet he arouses no ardor. This is 
what it means to be a person without ardor. 
<P>And how is one a person without concern? There is the case where a monk 
thinks, 'The arising of unarisen evil, unskillful qualities would lead to what

unskillful qualities... The non-arising of unarisen skillful qualities... The

<P><B><A name=58>§ 58</A>.</B> Even if a monk is not skilled in the ways of the 
minds of others (not skilled in reading the minds of others), he should train 
himself: 'I will be skilled in reading my own mind.' 
<P>And how is a monk skilled in reading his own mind? Imagine a <A 
name=young58>young</A> woman -- or man -- fond of adornment, examining the <A 
name=reflection1>image of her own face</A> in a bright, clean mirror or bowl of 
clear water: If she saw any dirt or blemish there, she would try to remove it. 
If she saw no dirt or blemish there, she would be pleased, her resolves 
fulfilled: 'How fortunate I am! How clean I am!' In the same way, a monk's 
self-examination is very productive in terms of skillful qualities [if he 
conducts it in this way]: Do I usually remain covetous or not? With thoughts of 
ill will or not? Overcome by sloth &amp; drowsiness or not? Restless or not? 
Uncertain or gone beyond uncertainty? Angry or not? With soiled thoughts or 
unsoiled thoughts? With my body aroused or unaroused? Lazy or with persistence 
aroused? Unconcentrated or concentrated?' 
<P>If, on examination, a monk knows, 'I usually remain covetous, with thoughts 
of ill will, overcome by sloth &amp; drowsiness, restless, uncertain, angry, 
with soiled thoughts, with my body aroused, lazy, or unconcentrated,' then he 
should put forth extra desire, effort, diligence, endeavor, undivided 
mindfulness, &amp; alertness for the abandoning of those very same evil, 
unskillful qualities, <A name=turban1>just as</A> when a person whose turban or 
head was on fire would put forth extra desire, effort, diligence, endeavor, 
undivided mindfulness, &amp; alertness to put out the fire on his turban or 
head... 
<P>But if, on examination, a monk knows, 'I usually remain uncovetous, without 
thoughts of ill will... &amp; concentrated,' then his duty is to make an effort 
in establishing ('<A name=tuning2>tuning</A>') those very same skillful 
qualities to a higher degree for the ending of the effluents.

<P><B><A name=59>§ 59</A>.</B> "And how is striving fruitful, how is exertion 
fruitful? There is the case where a monk, when not loaded down, does not load 
himself down with pain, nor does he reject pleasure that accords with the 
Dhamma, although he is not infatuated with that pleasure. He discerns that 'When 
I exert a [mental] fabrication against this cause of stress, then from the 
fabrication of <I>exertion</I> there is dispassion (fading away). When I look on 
with equanimity at that cause of stress, then from the development of 
<I>equanimity</I> there is dispassion.' So he exerts a mental fabrication 
against the [first] cause of stress... and develops equanimity with regard to 
the [second] cause of stress... Thus the stress [coming from any cause of the 
first sort] is abolished... &amp; the stress [coming from any cause of the 
second sort] is abolished. 
<P>"Suppose that a <A name=maninlove59>man</A> is in love with a woman, his mind 
ensnared with intense desire &amp; passion. He sees her standing with another 
man, chatting, joking, &amp; laughing. What do you think, monks: Would he... 
feel sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair?" 
<P>"Yes, lord..." 
<P>"Now suppose the thought were to occur to him, 'I am in love with this 
woman... When I see her standing with another man, chatting, joking, &amp; 
laughing, I feel sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair. Why don't I 
abandon my desire &amp; passion for that woman?' So he abandons his desire &amp; 
passion for that woman, and afterwards sees her standing with another man, 
chatting, joking, &amp; laughing. What do you think, monks: Would he... feel 
sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair?" 
<P>"No, lord..."

[second] cause of stress... Thus the stress [coming from any cause of the first 
sort] is abolished... &amp; the stress [coming from any cause of the second 
sort] is abolished. 
<P>"Furthermore, the monk notices this: 'When I live according to my pleasure, 
unskillful mental qualities increase in me &amp; skillful qualities decline. 
When I exert myself with stress &amp; pain, though, unskillful qualities decline 
in me &amp; skillful qualities increase. Why don't I exert myself with stress 
&amp; pain?' So he exerts himself with stress &amp; pain, and while he is 
exerting himself with stress &amp; pain, unskillful qualities decline in him, 
&amp; skillful qualities increase. Then at a later time he would no longer exert 
himself with stress &amp; pain. Why is that? Because he has attained the goal 
for which he was exerting himself with stress &amp; pain... 
<P>"Suppose that a <A name=fletcher59>fletcher</A> were to heat &amp; warm an 
arrow shaft between two flames, making it straight &amp; pliable. Then at a

name=mundika61>Mundika</A> the contemplative (or: the shaven contemplative -- a 
Jain?), was staying and on arrival, after exchanging pleasantries, sat to one 
side. As he was sitting there, Uggahamana said to him, 'I describe an individual 
endowed with four qualities as being <A name=mastery2>consummate in what is 
skillful</A>, foremost in what is skillful, an invincible contemplative attained 
to the highest attainments. Which four? There is the case where he does no evil 
action with his body, speaks no evil speech, resolves on no evil resolve, and 
maintains himself with no evil means of livelihood. An individual endowed with 
these four qualities I designate as being consummate in what is skillful... an 
invincible contemplative attained to the highest attainments.' 
<P>Then Pañcakanga the carpenter neither delighted in Uggahamana's words nor did 
he scorn them. Expressing neither delight nor scorn, he got up from his seat 
&amp; left, thinking, 'I will learn the meaning of this statement in the 
presence of the Blessed One.' 
<P>Then the carpenter went to where the Blessed One was staying and on arrival, 
after bowing down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he told the 
Blessed One the entire conversation he had had with Uggahamana. 
<P>When this was said, the Blessed One addressed Pañcakanga, saying, 'In that 
case, then according to Uggahamana's words a <A name=googoo61>stupid baby 
boy</A>, lying on its back, is consummate in what is skillful, foremost in what 
is skillful, an invincible contemplative attained to the highest attainments. 
For even the thought "body" does not occur to a stupid baby boy lying on its 
back, so from where would it do any evil action with its body, aside from a 
little kicking? Even the thought "speech" does not occur to it, so from where 
would it speak any evil speech, aside from a little crying? Even the thought 
"resolve" does not occur to it, so from where would it resolve on any evil 
resolve, aside from a little bad temper? Even the thought "livelihood" does not 
occur to it, so from where would it maintain itself with any evil means of 
livelihood, aside from its mother's milk? So according to Uggahamana's words a 
stupid baby boy, lying on its back, is... an invincible contemplative attained 
to the highest attainments. 
<P>'If an individual is endowed with these four qualities, I do not designate 
him as... an invincible contemplative attained to the highest attainments. 
Rather, he stands on the same level as a stupid baby boy lying on its back... 
<P>'I describe an individual endowed with ten qualities as being consummate in

The mind... Which mind? -- for the mind has many modes &amp; permutations... Any

Now where do unskillful habits cease without remainder?... There is the case 
where a monk abandons wrong bodily conduct &amp; develops right bodily conduct,

wrong livelihood &amp; maintains his life with right livelihood. This is where

skillful habits. Now where do skillful habits cease without remainder?... There 
is the case where a monk is virtuous, but is not entirely defined by his virtue. 
He discerns, as it actually is, the awareness-release &amp; discernment-release 
where his skillful habits cease without remainder. And what sort of practice is

Which perception? -- for perception has many modes &amp; permutations... Any 
sensuality-perception, ill will-perception or harmfulness-perception: That is 
the cause of unskillful resolves. Now where do unskillful resolves cease without 
remainder?... There is the case where a monk, quite withdrawn from sensuality, 
withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities, enters &amp; remains in the first <A 
name=jhana2>jhana</A>: rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied 
by directed thought &amp; evaluation. This is where unskillful resolves cease 
without remainder. And what sort of practice is the practice leading to the

leading to the cessation of unskillful resolves. 
<P>'And what are skillful resolves? Being resolved on renunciation (freedom from 
sensuality), on non-ill will, on harmlessness... What is the cause of skillful 
resolves?... Perception... Which perception? -- for perception has many modes 
&amp; permutations... Any renunciation-perception, non-ill will-perception or 
harmlessness-perception: That is the cause of skillful resolves. Now where do 
skillful resolves cease without remainder?... There is the case where a monk, 
with the stilling of directed thought &amp; evaluation, enters &amp; remains in 
the second jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure, unification of 
awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation -- internal assurance. 
This is where skillful resolves cease without remainder. And what sort of

<P>'Now, an individual endowed with which ten qualities is one whom I describe

the right view of one beyond training, the right resolve of one beyond training,
