<H1>Raja Sutta</H1>

<HR>
<A name=savatthi>At Savatthi</A>. There the Blessed One said, "Monks, even 
though a wheel-turning emperor, having exercised sovereign lordship over the 
four continents, on the break-up of the body, after death, reappears in the good 
destination, the heavenly world, in the company of the devas of the 
Thirty-three, and enjoys himself there in the <A name=nandana>Nandana grove</A>, 
surrounded by a consort of nymphs, supplied and endowed with the five strings of 
heavenly sensual pleasure, still -- because he is not endowed with four 
qualities -- he is not freed from [the possibility of going to] hell, not freed 
from the animal womb, not freed from the realm of hungry shades, not freed from 
the plane of deprivation, the bad destinations, the lower realms. 
<P>"And even though a disciple of the noble ones lives off lumps of alms food 
and wears rag-robes, still -- because he is endowed with four qualities -- he is 
freed from hell, freed from the animal womb, freed from the realm of hungry 
shades, freed from the plane of deprivation, the bad destinations, the lower 
realms. 
<P>"And what are the four? There is the case where the disciple of the noble 
ones is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Awakened One: 'Indeed, the 
Blessed One is worthy and rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge &amp; 
conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the world, unexcelled as a trainer 
for those people fit to be tamed, the Teacher of divine &amp; human beings, 
awakened, blessed.' 
<P>"He/she is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Dhamma: 'The Dhamma is 
well-expounded by the Blessed One, to be seen here &amp; now, timeless, inviting 
verification, pertinent, to be realized by the wise for themselves.' 
<P>"He/she is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Sangha: 'The Sangha of 
the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced well...who have practiced 
straight-forwardly...who have practiced methodically...who have practiced 
masterfully -- in other words, the four types of noble disciples when taken as 
pairs, the eight when taken as individual types[<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn55-001.html#n1" 
name=1>1</A>] -- they are the Sangha of the Blessed One's disciples: worthy of 
gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect, the 
incomparable field of merit for the world.' 
<P>"He/she is endowed with virtues that are appealing to the noble ones: untorn, 
unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered, liberating, praised by the wise, untarnished, 
leading to concentration. 
<P>"He/she is endowed with these four qualities.[<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn55-001.html#n2" 
name=2>2</A>] 
<P>"And between the gaining of the four continents and the gaining of these four 
qualities, the gaining of the four continents is not equal to one sixteenth of 
the gaining of these four qualities."[<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn55-001.html#n3" 
name=3>3</A>] 
<HR>

<H3>Notes</H3><B><A name=n1>1</A>.</B> The four pairs are (1) the person on the 
path to stream-entry, the person experiencing the fruit of stream-entry; (2) the 
person on the path to once-returning, the person experiencing the fruit of 
once-returning; (3) the person on the path to non-returning, the person 
experiencing the fruit of non-returning; (4) the person on the path to 
arahantship, the person experiencing the fruit of arahantship. The eight 
individuals are the eight types forming these four pairs. [<A
