<H1>The Log</H1><SMALL>Translated from the Pali by Thanissaro

<HR>
On one occasion the Blessed One was staying at <A id=ajjheya></A>Ajjheya on the 
bank of the river <A id=ganges></A>Ganges. He saw a large log being carried 
along by the current near the bank of the river Ganges, and on seeing it said to 
the monks: "Monks, do you see that large log being carried along by the current 
of the river Ganges?" 
<P>"Yes, lord." 
<P><A id=streamsimiles></A>"Monks, if that log doesn't veer toward the near 
shore, doesn't veer toward the far shore, doesn't sink in the middle, doesn't 
get washed up on high ground, doesn't get snared by human beings, doesn't get 
snared by non-human beings, doesn't get snared in a whirlpool, and doesn't 
become rotten inside, it will tend to the ocean, tilt to the ocean, incline to 
the ocean. Why is that? Because the current of the river Ganges tends to the 
ocean, tilts to the ocean, inclines to the ocean. 
<P>"In the same way, monks, if you don't veer toward the near shore, don't veer 
toward the far shore, don't sink in the middle, don't get washed up on high 
ground, don't get snared by human beings, don't get snared by non-human beings, 
don't get snared in a whirlpool, and don't become rotten inside, you will tend 
to Unbinding, tilt to Unbinding, incline to Unbinding. Why is that? Because 
right view tends to Unbinding, tilts to Unbinding, inclines to Unbinding." 
<P>When this was said, a certain monk addressed the Blessed One: "What, lord, is 
the near shore? What is the far shore? What is sinking in the middle? What is 
being washed up on high ground? What is being snared by human beings? What is 
being snared by non-human beings? What is being snared by a whirlpool? What is 
becoming rotten inside?" 
<P>"'The near shore,' monks, stands for the six internal sense media. 'The far 
shore' stands for the six external sense media. 'Sinking in the middle' stands 
for passion &amp; delight. 'Being washed up on high ground' stands for the 
conceit, 'I am.' 
<P>"And what, monks, is being snared by human beings? There is the case where a 
monk lives entangled with householders, delighting with them and sorrowing with 
them, happy when they are happy, pained when they are in pain, taking on their 
affairs as his own duty. This is called being snared by human beings. 
<P>"And what, monks, is being snared by non-human beings? There is the case 
where a certain monk lives the holy life in hopes of a certain company of devas, 
[thinking,] 'By means of this virtue or practice or austerity or holy life I 
will become one sort of deva or another.' This is called being snared by 
non-human beings. 
<P>"'Being snared by a whirlpool' stands for the five strings of sensuality. 
<P>" And what, monks, is becoming rotten inside? There is the case where a 
certain monk is unprincipled, evil, unclean and suspect in his undertakings, 
hidden in his actions, not a contemplative though claiming to be one, not 
leading the holy life though claiming to do so, inwardly rotten, oozing with 
desire, filthy by nature. This is called becoming rotten inside." 
<P><A id=ordains></A>Now at that time Nanda the cowherd was standing not far 
from the Blessed One. Then he said to the Blessed One, "Lord, I don't veer 
toward the near shore, I don't veer toward the far shore, I won't sink in the 
middle, I won't get washed up on high ground, I won't get snared by human 
beings, I won't get snared by non-human beings, I won't get snared in a 
whirlpool, and I won't become rotten inside. It would be good, lord, if I could 
obtain the Going-forth, if I could obtain the Full Acceptance (as a monk). 
<P>"In that case, Nanda, lead the cows back to their owners." 
<P>"The cows will go back, lord, out of attachment for their calves." 
<P>"Lead the cows back to their owners, Nanda." 
<P>Then, having led the cows back to their owners, Nanda the cowherd went to the 
Blessed One and, on arrival, told him, "The cows, lord, have been led back to 
their owners. Let me obtain the Going-forth in the Blessed One's presence! Let 
me obtain the Full Acceptance!" 
<P><A id=victory></A>So Nanda the cowherd obtained the Going-forth in the 
Blessed One's presence, he obtained the Full Acceptance. And not long after his 
Acceptance -- dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute -- he in 
no long time reached &amp; remained in the supreme goal of the holy life, for 
which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing &amp; 
realizing it for himself in the here &amp; now. He knew: "Birth is ended, the 
holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for the sake of 
this world." And thus Ven. Nanda became another one of the arahants.
