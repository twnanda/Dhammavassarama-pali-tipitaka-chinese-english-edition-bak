<HR>
On one occasion Ven. Sariputta and Ven. Maha Kotthita were staying near Varanasi 
in the Game Refuge at Isipatana. Then in the evening, Ven. Maha Kotthita emerged 
from his seclusion and went to Ven. Sariputta and exchanged courteous greetings 
with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to 
one side. As he was sitting there, he said to Ven. Sariputta, "Now then, friend 
Sariputta, does the Tathagata exist after death?" 
<P>"That, friend, has not been declared by the Blessed One: 'The Tathagata 
exists after death.'" 
<P>"Well then, friend Sariputta, does the Tathagata not exist after death?" 
<P>"Friend, that too has not been declared by the Blessed One: 'The Tathagata 
does not exist after death.'" 
<P>"Then does the Tathagata both exist and not exist after death?" 
<P>"That has not been declared by the Blessed One: 'The Tathagata both exists 
and does not exist after death.'" 
<P>"Well then, does the Tathagata neither exist nor not exist after death?" 
<P>"That too has not been declared by the Blessed One: 'The Tathagata neither 
exists nor does not exist after death.'" 
<P>"Now, friend Sariputta, when asked if the Tathagata exists after death, you 
say, 'That has not been declared by the Blessed One: "The Tathagata exists after 
death."' When asked if the Tathagata does not exist after death... both exists 
and does not exist after death... neither exists nor does not exist after death, 
you say, 'That too has not been declared by the Blessed One: "The Tathagata 
neither exists nor does not exist after death."' Now, what is the cause, what is 
the reason, why that has not been declared by the Blessed One?" 
<P>"For one who does not know &amp; see form as it actually is present, who does 
not know &amp; see the origination of form... the cessation of form... the path 
of practice leading to the cessation of form, as it actually is present, there 
occurs the thought, 'The Tathagata exists after death' or 'The Tathagata does 
not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after 
death' or 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death.' 
<P>"For one who does not know &amp; see feeling as it actually is present... 
<P>"For one who does not know &amp; see perception as it actually is present... 
<P>"For one who does not know &amp; see fabrications as they actually are 
present... 
<P>"For one who does not know &amp; see consciousness as it actually is present, 
who does not know &amp; see the origination of consciousness... the cessation of 
consciousness... the path of practice leading to the cessation of consciousness, 
as it actually is present, there occurs the thought, 'The Tathagata exists after 
death' or 'The Tathagata does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata both 
exists and does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does 
not exist after death.' 
<P>"But for one who knows &amp; sees form as it actually is present, who knows 
&amp; sees the origination of form... the cessation of form... the path of 
practice leading to the cessation of form, as it actually is present, the 
thought, 'The Tathagata exists after death' or 'The Tathagata does not exist 
after death' or 'The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death' or 
'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death' doesn't occur. 
<P>"For one who knows &amp; sees feeling as it actually is present... 
<P>"For one who knows &amp; sees perception as it actually is present... 
<P>"For one who knows &amp; sees fabrications as they actually are present... 
<P>"For one who knows &amp; sees consciousness as it actually is present, who 
knows &amp; sees the origination of consciousness... the cessation of 
consciousness... the path of practice leading to the cessation of consciousness, 
as it actually is present, the thought, 'The Tathagata exists after death' or 
'The Tathagata does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata both exists and 
does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist 
after death' doesn't occur. 
<P>"This is the cause, this is the reason, why that has not been declared by the 
Blessed One."
