I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A 
name=savatthi></A>Savatthi in Jeta's Grove. Then he addressed the monks, <A 
name=vipers></A>"Monks, suppose there were four vipers of utmost heat &amp; 
horrible venom. Then a man would come along -- desiring life, desiring not to 
die, desiring happiness, &amp; loathing pain -- and people would tell him: 'Good 
man, these four vipers, of utmost heat &amp; horrible venom, are yours. Time 
after time they must be lifted up, time after time they must be bathed, time 
after time they must be fed, time after time put to rest. And if any of these 
vipers ever gets angered with you, then you will meet with death or death-like 
suffering. Do what you think should be done.' 
<P><A name=executioners></A>Then the man -- afraid of the four vipers of utmost 
heat &amp; horrible venom -- would flee this way or that. They would tell him, 
'Good man, there are five enemy executioners chasing right on your heels, 
[thinking,] "Wherever we see him, we'll kill him right on the spot." Do what you 
think should be done.' 
<P><A name=exec6></A>Then the man -- afraid of the four vipers of utmost heat 
&amp; horrible venom, afraid of the five enemy executioners -- would flee this 
way or that. They would tell him, 'Good man, there is a sixth executioner, a 
fellow-traveler, chasing right on your heels with upraised sword, [thinking,] 
"Wherever I see him, I'll kill him right on the spot." Do what you think should 
be done.' 
<P><A name=emptyvillage></A>Then the man -- afraid of the four vipers of utmost 
heat &amp; horrible venom, afraid of the five enemy executioners, afraid of the 
sixth fellow-traveling executioner with upraised sword -- would flee this way or 
that. He would see an empty village. Whatever house he entered would be 
abandoned, void, &amp; empty as he entered it. Whatever pot he grabbed hold of 
would be abandoned, void, &amp; empty as he grabbed hold of it. They would tell 
him, <A name=bandits></A>'Good man, right now, village-plundering bandits are 
entering this empty village. Do what you think should be done.' 
<P><A name=shore></A>Then the man -- afraid of the four vipers of utmost heat 
&amp; horrible venom, afraid of the five enemy executioners, afraid of the sixth 
fellow-traveling executioner with upraised sword, afraid of the 
village-plundering bandits -- would flee this way or that. He would see a great 
expanse of water, with the near shore dubious &amp; risky, the further shore 
secure &amp; free from risk, but with neither a ferryboat nor a bridge going 
from this shore to the other. The thought would occur to him, 'Here is this 
great expanse of water, with the near shore dubious &amp; risky, the further 
shore secure &amp; free from risk, but with neither a ferryboat nor a bridge 
going from this shore to the other. <A name=raft></A>What if I were to gather 
grass, twigs, branches, &amp; leaves and, having bound them together to make a 
raft, were to cross over to safety on the other shore in dependence on the raft, 
making an effort with my hands &amp; feet?' Then the man, having gathered grass, 
twigs, branches, &amp; leaves, having bound them together to make a raft, would 
cross over to safety on the other shore in dependence on the raft, making an 
effort with his hands &amp; feet. Crossed over, having gone to the other shore, 
he would stand on high ground, a brahman. 
<P>"Monks, I have made this simile to convey a meaning. Here the meaning is 
this: 'The four vipers of utmost heat &amp; horrible venom' stands for the four 
great existents: the earth property, the liquid property, the fire-property, 
&amp; the wind property. 'The five enemy executioners' stands for the five 
clinging-aggregates: the form clinging-aggregate, the feeling 
clinging-aggregate, the perception clinging-aggregate, the fabrications 
clinging-aggregate, the consciousness clinging-aggregate. 'The sixth 
fellow-traveling executioner with upraised sword' stands for passion &amp; 
delight. 
<P><A name=properties4></A><A name=khandha5></A><A name=senses6></A>"'The empty 
village' stands for the six internal sense media. If a wise, competent, 
intelligent person examines them from the point of view of the eye, they appear 
abandoned, void, &amp; empty. If he examines them from the point of view of the 
ear... the nose... the tongue... the body... the intellect, they appear 
abandoned, void, &amp; empty. 'The village-plundering bandits' stands for the 
six external sense-media. The eye is attacked by agreeable &amp; disagreeable 
forms. The ear is attacked by agreeable &amp; disagreeable sounds. The nose is 
attacked by agreeable &amp; disagreeable aromas. The tongue is attacked by 
agreeable &amp; disagreeable flavors. The body is attacked by agreeable &amp; 
disagreeable tactile sensations. The intellect is attacked by agreeable &amp; 
disagreeable ideas. 
<P>"'The great expanse of water' stands for the fourfold flood: the flood of 
sensuality, the flood of becoming, the flood of views, &amp; the flood of 
ignorance. 
<P>'The near shore, dubious &amp; risky' stands for self-identification. 'The 
further shore, secure and free from risk' stands for Unbinding. 'The raft' 
stands for just this noble eightfold path: right view, right resolve, right 
speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right 
concentration. 'Making an effort with hands &amp; feet' stands for the arousing 
of persistence. 'Crossed over, having gone to the other shore, he would stand on 
high ground, a brahman' stands for the arahant."
