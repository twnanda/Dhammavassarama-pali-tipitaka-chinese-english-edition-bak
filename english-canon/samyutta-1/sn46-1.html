"Monks, it is in dependence on the <A NAME="himalayas">Himalayas</A>, the king of mountains, that serpents (nagas) grow in body and gain in strength. Having grown in body and gained strength there, they descend to the small lakes. Having descended to the small lakes, they descend to the large lakes...the small rivers...the large rivers...to the great ocean. There they attain greatness &amp; prosperity in terms of the body.
<p>
"In the same way, it is in dependence on virtue, established on virtue, having developed &amp; pursued the <A NAME="7fac">seven factors</A> of awakening, that a monk attains to greatness &amp; prosperity in terms of mental qualities. And how is it that a monk -- in dependence on virtue, established on virtue, having developed &amp; pursued the seven factors of awakening -- attains to greatness &amp; prosperity in terms of mental qualities?
<p>
"There is the case where a monk develops <i>mindfulness</i> as a factor of awakening dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in relinquishment. He develops <i>analysis of qualities</i> as a factor of awakening...<i>persistence</i> as a factor of awakening...<i>rapture</i> as a factor of awakening...<i>serenity</i> as a factor of awakening...<i>concentration</i> as a factor of awakening...<i>equanimity</i> as a factor of awakening dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in relinquishment. This is how a monk -- in dependence on virtue, established on virtue, having developed &amp; pursued the seven factors of awakening -- attains to greatness &amp; prosperity in terms of mental qualities."
