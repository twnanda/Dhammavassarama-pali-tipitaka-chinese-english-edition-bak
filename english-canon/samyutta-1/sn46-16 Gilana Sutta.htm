<HR>
Thus have I heard: 
<P>On one occasion the Blessed One was living near <A name=rajagaha>Rajagaha</A> 
in the bamboo grove in the squirrels' feeding ground. At that time, he was 
afflicted with a disease, was suffering therefrom, and was gravely ill. 
<P>Then the Venerable Maha Cunda[<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn46-016.html#n-s14-2" 
name=s14-2>1</A>] 'arising from his solitude at eventide'[<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn46-016.html#n-s14-3" 
name=s14-3>2</A>] approached the Blessed One, saluted him, and sat down beside 
him. 
<P>To the Venerable Maha Cunda thus seated, the Blessed One said: 
<P>"O Cunda, let the factors of enlightenment occur to your mind." 
<P>"These seven factors of enlightenment, <I>bhante</I> (Ven. Sir), are well 
expounded and are cultivated and fully developed by the Blessed One. They 
conduce to perfect understanding, to full realization and to Nibbana. What are 
the seven? 
<P>i. "Mindfulness, the factor of enlightenment, <I>bhante,</I> is well 
expounded by the Blessed One, and is cultivated and fully developed by the 
Blessed One. It conduces to perfect understanding, to full realization and to 
Nibbana. 
<P>ii. "Investigation of the Dhamma, the factor of enlightenment, <I>bhante,</I> 
is well expounded by the Blessed One and is cultivated and fully developed by 
the Blessed One. It conduces to perfect understanding, to full realization and 
to Nibbana. 
<P>iii. "Persevering effort, the factor of enlightenment, <I>bhante,</I> is well 
expounded by the Blessed One and is cultivated and fully developed by the 
Blessed One. It conduces to perfect understanding, to full realization and to 
Nibbana. 
<P>iv. "Rapture, the factor of enlightenment, <I>bhante,</I> is well expounded 
by the Blessed One and is cultivated and fully developed by the Blessed One. It 
conduces to perfect understanding, to full realization and to Nibbana. 
<P>v. "Calm, the factor of enlightenment, <I>bhante,</I> is well expounded by 
the Blessed One and is cultivated and fully developed by the Blessed One. It 
conduces to perfect understanding, to full realization and to Nibbana. 
<P>vi. "Concentration, the factor of enlightenment, <I>bhante,</I> is well 
expounded by the Blessed One and is cultivated and fully developed by the 
Blessed One. It conduces to perfect understanding, to full realization and to 
Nibbana. 
<P>vii. "Equanimity, the factor of enlightenment, <I>bhante,</I> is well 
expounded by the Blessed One, and is cultivated and fully developed by the 
Blessed One. It conduces to perfect understanding, to full realization and to 
Nibbana.These seven factors of enlightenment, <I>bhante,</I> are well expounded 
and cultivated and fully developed by the Blessed One. They conduce to perfect 
understanding, to full realization and to Nibbana." 
<P>"Most assuredly Cunda, they are factors of enlightenment. Most assuredly, 
Cunda, they are factors of enlightenment." 
<P>Thus said the Venerable Maha Cunda, and the Master approved of it. Then the 
Blessed One recovered from his affliction, and thus disappeared his affliction.
