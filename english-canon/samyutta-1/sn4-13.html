I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="rajagaha">Rajagaha</A> at the <A NAME="maddakucchi">Maddakucchi</A> Deer Reserve. Now at that time his foot had been pierced by a stone sliver. Excruciating were the bodily feelings that developed within him -- painful, fierce, sharp, wracking, repellent, disagreeable -- but he endured them mindful, alert, &amp; unperturbed. Having had his outer robe folded in four and laid out, he lay down on his right side in the lion's posture -- with one foot placed on top of the other -- mindful &amp; alert.
<p>
Then Mara the Evil One went to the Blessed One and recited this verse in his presence:
<blockquote>
"Are you lying there in a stupor,<br>
or drunk on poetry?<br>
Are your goals so very few?<br>
All alone in a secluded lodging,<br>
what is this dreamer, this sleepy-face?"
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>The Buddha:</i>
<blockquote>
"I lie here,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not in a stupor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor drunk on poetry.<br>
My goal attained,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sorrow-free.<br>
All alone in a secluded lodging,<br>
I lie down with sympathy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for all beings.
<p>
Even those pierced in the chest<br>
with an arrow,<br>
their hearts rapidly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rapidly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beating:<br>
even they with their arrows<br>
are able to sleep.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So why shouldn't I,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with my arrow&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; removed?
<p>
I'm not awake with worry,<br>
nor afraid to sleep.<br>
Days &amp; nights<br>
don't oppress me.<br>
I see no threat of decline<br>
in any world at all.<br>
That's why I sleep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with sympathy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for all beings."
</blockquote>
Then Mara the Evil One -- sad &amp; dejected at realizing, "The Blessed One knows me; the One Well-Gone knows me" -- vanished right there.
