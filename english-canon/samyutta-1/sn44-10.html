<hr>
Then the wanderer <A NAME="vacchagotta">Vacchagotta</A> went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat down to one side. As he was sitting there he asked the Blessed One: "Now then, Venerable Gotama, is there a self?"
<p>
When this was said, the Blessed One was silent.
<p>
"Then is there no self?"
<p>
A second time, the Blessed One was silent.
<p>
Then Vacchagotta the wanderer got up from his seat and left.
<p>
Then, not long after Vacchagotta the wanderer had left, <A NAME="ananda">Ven. Ananda</A> said to the Blessed One, "Why, lord, did the Blessed One not answer when asked a question by Vacchagotta the wanderer?"
<p>
"Ananda, if I -- being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is a self -- were to answer that there is a self, that would be conforming with those priests &amp; contemplatives who are exponents of eternalism [the view that there is an eternal, unchanging soul]. If I -- being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is no self -- were to answer that there is no self, that would be conforming with those priests &amp; contemplatives who are exponents of annihilationism [the view that death is the annihilation of consciousness]. If I -- being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is a self -- were to answer that there is a self, would that be in keeping with the arising of knowledge that all phenomena are not-self?"
<p>
"No, lord."
<p>
"And if I -- being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is no self -- were to answer that there is no self, the bewildered Vacchagotta would become even more bewildered: 'Does the self I used to have now not exist?'"
