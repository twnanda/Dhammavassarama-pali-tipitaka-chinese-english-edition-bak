Thus have I heard: 
<P>On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi, at Jetavana at 
Anathpindika's monastery. At that time Candima, the moon deity, was seized by 
Rahu, lord of Asura. Thereupon calling to mind the Blessed One, Candima, the 
moon deity, recited this stanza: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>i. "O Buddha, the Hero, thou art wholly free from all evil. My 
  adoration to thee. I have fallen into distress. Be thou my refuge." 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Thereupon the Blessed One addressed a stanza to Rahu, Lord of Asuras, on 
behalf of Candima, thus: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ii. "O Rahu, Candima has gone for refuge to the Tathagata, the 
  Consummate One. Release Candima. The Buddhas radiate compassion on the world 
  (of beings)." </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Thereupon Rahu, Lord of Asuras, released Candima, the deity, and immediately 
came to the presence of Vepacitta, Lord of Asuras, and stood beside him 
trembling with fear and with hair standing on end. Then Vepacitta addressed Rahu 
in this stanza. 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>iii. "Rahu. Why did you suddenly release Candima? Why have you 
  come trembling, and why are you standing here terrified?" </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>iv. "I have been spoken to by the Buddha in a stanza (requesting 
  me to release Candima). If I had not released Candima my head would have split 
  into seven pieces. While yet I live, I should have had no happiness. 
  (Therefore I released Candima)." </BLOCKQUOTE>
