<HR>
<SMALL><B>Translator's Note:</B> Passages in the Vinaya show that Ven. Channa -- 
apparently, Prince Siddhattha's horseman on the night of his Great Renunciation 
-- was proud and obdurate. After becoming a monk, he was unwilling to accept 
instruction from any of the other monks. (See the origin stories to <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/bmc1/ch05.html#12">Sanghadisesa 
12</A> and <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/bmc1/ch08-2.html#12">Pacittiya 
12</A>.) <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/digha/dn16a.html#channa">DN 
16</A> tells of how the Buddha, on the night of his parinibbana, imposed the 
brahma-punishment on him: he was to be left to his own ways without anyone to 
teach or correct him. According to Cv.XI, news of this punishment so shocked 
Ven. Channa that he fainted. He then went off into seclusion and practiced 
diligently to the point of attaining arahantship. As Ven. Ananda later told him, 
his attainment nullified the punishment. This sutta tells a different version of 
Channa's change of heart. </SMALL>
<HR>
On one occasion many elder monks were staying near <A name=varanasi>Varanasi</A> 
in the Deer Park at <A name=isipatana>Isipatana</A>. Then in the late afternoon 
Ven. Channa left his seclusion and, taking his key, went from dwelling to 
dwelling, saying to the elder monks, "May the venerable elders exhort me, may 
the venerable elders teach me, may the venerable elders give me a Dhamma talk so 
that I might see the Dhamma." 
<P>When this was said, the elder monks said to Ven. Channa, "Form, friend 
Channa, is inconstant. Feeling is inconstant. Perception is inconstant. 
Fabrications are inconstant. Consciousness is inconstant. Form is not-self. 
Feeling is not-self. Perception is not-self. Fabrications are not-self. 
Consciousness is not-self. All fabrications are inconstant. All phenomena are 
not-self." 
<P>Then the thought occurred to Ven. Channa, "I, too, think that form is 
inconstant, feeling is inconstant, perception is inconstant, fabrications are 
inconstant, consciousness is inconstant; form is not-self, feeling is not-self, 
perception is not-self, fabrications are not-self, consciousness is not-self; 
all fabrications are inconstant; all phenomena are not-self. But still my mind 
does not leap up, grow confident, steadfast, &amp; released <I>(alternate 
reading: </I>firm) in the resolution of all fabrications, the relinquishing of 
all acquisitions, the ending of craving, dispassion, cessation, Unbinding. 
Instead, agitation &amp; clinging arise, and my intellect pulls back, thinking, 
'But who, then, is my self?' But this thought doesn't occur to one who sees the 
Dhamma. So who might teach me the Dhamma so that I might see the Dhamma?" 
<P>Then the thought occurred to Ven. Channa, "This <A name=ananda>Ven. 
Ananda</A> is staying at Kosambi in Ghosita's Park. He has been praised by the 
Teacher and is esteemed by his knowledgeable fellows in the holy life. He is 
capable of teaching me the Dhamma so that I might see the Dhamma, and I have 
sudden trust in him. Why don't I go to Ven. Ananda?" 
<P>So, setting his lodgings in order and carrying his robes &amp; bowl, Ven. 
Channa went to Kosambi to where Ven. Ananda was staying in Ghosita's Park. On 
arrival, he exchanged courteous greetings with them Ven. Ananda After an 
exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was 
sitting there, he [told Ven. Ananda what had happened and added], May Ven. 
Ananda exhort me, may Ven. Ananda teach me, may Ven. Ananda give me a Dhamma 
talk so that I might see the Dhamma." 
<P>"Even this much makes me feel gratified &amp; satisfied with Ven. Channa, 
that he opens up &amp; breaks down his stubbornness. So lend ear, friend Channa. 
You are capable of understanding the Dhamma." 
<P>Then a sudden great rapture &amp; joy welled up in Ven. Channa at the 
thought, "So I am capable of understanding the Dhamma!" 
<P>"Face-to-face with the Blessed One have I heard this, friend Channa. 
Face-to-face with him have I learned the exhortation he gave to the bhikkhu <A 
name=kaccayana>Kaccayanagotta</A> [<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/samyutta/sn12-015.html">SN 
XII.15</A>]: 'By &amp; large, Kaccayana, this world is supported by (takes as 
its object) a polarity, that of existence &amp; non-existence. But when one sees 
the origination of the world as it actually is with right discernment, 
"non-existence" with reference to the world does not occur to one. When one sees 
the cessation of the world as it actually is with right discernment, "existence" 
with reference to the world does not occur to one. 
<P>"'By &amp; large, Kaccayana, this world is in bondage to attachments, 
clingings (sustenances), &amp; biases. But one such as this does not get 
involved with or cling to these attachments, clingings, fixations of awareness, 
biases, or obsessions; nor is he resolved on "my self." He has no uncertainty or 
doubt that, when there is arising, only stress is arising; and that when there 
is passing away, stress is passing away. In this, one's knowledge is independent 
of others. It is to this extent, Kaccayana, that there is right view. 
<P>"'"Everything exists": That is one extreme. "Everything doesn't exist": That 
is a second extreme. Avoiding these two extremes, the Tathagata teaches the 
Dhamma via the middle: From ignorance as a requisite condition come 
fabrications. From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness. 
From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-&amp;-form. From 
name-&amp;-form as a requisite condition come the six sense media. From the six 
sense media as a requisite condition comes contact. From contact as a requisite 
condition comes feeling. From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving. 
From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance. From 
clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming. From becoming as a 
requisite condition comes birth. From birth as a requisite condition, then aging 
&amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair come into play. 
Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress &amp; suffering. 
<P>"'Now from the remainderless fading &amp; cessation of that very ignorance 
comes the cessation of fabrications. From the cessation of fabrications comes 
the cessation of consciousness. From the cessation of consciousness comes the 
cessation of name-&amp;-form. From the cessation of name-&amp;-form comes the 
cessation of the six sense media. From the cessation of the six sense media 
comes the cessation of contact. From the cessation of contact comes the 
cessation of feeling. From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of 
craving. From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of 
clinging/sustenance. From the cessation of clinging/sustenance comes the 
cessation of becoming. From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of 
birth. From the cessation of birth, then aging &amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, 
pain, distress, &amp; despair all cease. Such is the cessation of this entire 
mass of stress &amp; suffering.' 
<P>"That's how it is, friend Ananda, for those who have friends in the holy life 
like Ven. Ananda -- sympathetic, helpful, exhorting, &amp; teaching. Just now, 
for me, listening to Ven. Ananda's Dhamma-teaching, has the Dhamma been 
penetrated." <!-- #bbinclude "footer.html" --><!-- THE TEXT BELOW IS AUTOMAGICALLY GENERATED FROM AN INCLUDE FILE. --><!-- robots content="none" -->
