<hr>
Setting at Savatthi. Then, in the morning, the bhikkhuni Vijaya dressed ... she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day's abiding.
<p>
Then Mara the Evil One, desiring to arouse fear, trepidation, and terror in the bhikkhuni Vijaya, <br>
desiring to make her fall away from concentration, approached her and addressed her in verse: [131]
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"You are so young and beautiful,<br>
And I too am in the bloom of youth.<br>
Come, noble lady, let us rejoice<br>
With the music of a fivefold ensemble."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Then it occurred to the bhikkhuni Vijaya: "Now who is this...? This is Mara the Evil One ... desiring to make me fall away from concentration."
<p>
Then the bhikkhuni Vijaya, having understood, "This is Mara the Evil One," replied to him in verses:
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Forms and sounds, tastes and odours,<br>
Tactile objects that delight the mind:<br>
I offer them right back to you, <br>
For I, O Mara, do not need them.
<p>
I am repelled and humiliated<br>
By this foul, putrid body,<br>
Subject to break up, fragile:<br>
I've uprooted sensual craving.
<p>
As to those beings who fare amidst form, <br>
And those who abide in the formless,<br>
And those peaceful attainments too:<br>
Everywhere darkness has been destroyed."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Then Mara the Evil One, realizing "The bhikkhuni Vijaya knows me," sad and disappointed, disappeared right there.
