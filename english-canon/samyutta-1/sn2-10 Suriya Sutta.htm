Thus have I heard: 
<P>On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at 
Anathapindika's monastery. At that time Suriya, the sun deity, was seized by 
Rahu, Lord of Asuras. Thereupon calling to mind the Blessed One, Suriya, the Sun 
deity, recited this stanza: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>i. "O Buddha, the Hero, thou art wholly free from all evil. My 
  adoration to thee. I have fallen into distress. Be thou my refuge." 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Thereupon the Blessed One addressed a stanza to Rahu, Lord of Asuras, on 
behalf of Suriya thus: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ii. "O Rahu, Suriya has gone for refuge to the Tathagata, the 
  Consummate One. Release Suriya. The Buddhas radiate compassion on the world 
  (of beings). </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>iii. "O Rahu, swallow not the dispeller of darkness, the shining 
  one, the radiant and effulgent traveler through the sky. Rahu, release Suriya, 
  my son." </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Thereupon Rahu, Lord of Asuras, released Suriya, and immediately came to the 
presence of Vepacitta, Lord of Asuras, and stood beside him trembling with fear 
and with hair standing on end. Then Vepacitta addressed Rahu in this stanza: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>iv. "Rahu, why did you suddenly release Suriya? Why have you come 
  trembling, and why are you standing here terrified?" </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>"I have been spoken to by the Buddha in a stanza (requesting me release 
Suriya). If I had not released Suriya my head would have split into seven 
pieces. While yet I live, I should have had no happiness. (Therefore I released 
Suriya)."
