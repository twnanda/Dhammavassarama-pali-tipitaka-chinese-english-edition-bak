I have heard that on one occasion <A NAME="anuruddha">Ven. Anuruddha</A> was dwelling among the <A NAME="kosala">Kosalans</A> in a forest thicket. Now at that time, a devata from the retinue of the heaven of the Thirty-three named <A NAME="jalini">Jalini</A>, one of Ven. Anuruddha's former consorts, went to him and, on arrival, addressed him with this verse:
<blockquote>
Direct your mind<br>
to where you used to live,<br>
among the devas of the Thirty-three,<br>
empowered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with all sensual pleasures.<br>
Honored, surrounded<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by deva maidens,<br>
you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will shine.
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>[Ven. Anuruddha:]</i>
<blockquote>
They've gone astray,<br>
deva maidens<br>
established in self-identity.<br>
And they've gone astray,<br>
those beings with deva maidens<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as their aim.
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>[Jalini:]</i>
<blockquote>
<A NAME="nandana">They</A> don't know bliss<br>
who haven't seen Nandana,<br>
abode of the eminent devas,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; glorious,<br>
of the Thirty-three.
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>[Ven. Anuruddha:]</i>
<blockquote>
You fool, don't you know<br>
the arahants' maxim? --<br>
'How inconstant are compounded things!<br>
Their nature: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to arise &amp; pass away.<br>
They disband &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as they are arising.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their total stilling is bliss.'
<p>
Jalini, there is now<br>
in deva company<br>
no further abode<br>
[for me].<br>
With the utter ending<br>
of wandering on in birth,<br>
there is now<br>
no further becoming.
</blockquote>
