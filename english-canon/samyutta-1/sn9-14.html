<hr>
I have heard that on one occasion a certain monk was dwelling among the <A NAME="kosala">Kosalans</A> in a forest thicket. Now at that time, after his meal, returning from his almsround, he went down to a lotus pond and sniffed a red lotus.
<p>
Then the devata inhabiting the forest thicket, feeling sympathy for the monk, desiring his benefit, desiring to bring him to his senses, approached him and addressed him with this verse:
<p>
"You sniff this water-born flower<br>
that hasn't been given to you.<br>
This, dear sir,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a factor of stealing.<br>
You &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are a thief of a scent."
<p>
<i>[The monk:]</i>
<blockquote>
"I don't take, don't damage.<br>
I sniff at the lotus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from far away.<br>
So why do you call me<br>
a thief of a scent?
<p>
One who<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; digs up the stalks,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; damages flowers,<br>
one of such ruthless behavior:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; why don't you say it of him?"
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>The devata:</i>
<blockquote>
"A person ruthless &amp; grasping,<br>
smeared like a nursing diaper:<br>
to him<br>
I have nothing to say.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to whom I should speak.
<p>
To a person unblemished,<br>
constantly searching for purity,<br>
a hair-tip's worth of evil<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seems as large<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a cloud."
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>[The monk:]</i>
<blockquote>
"Yes, yakkha, you understand me<br>
and show me sympathy.<br>
Warn me again, yakkha,<br>
whenever again<br>
you see something like this."
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>[The devata:]</i>
<blockquote>
"I don't depend on you<br>
for my living<br>
nor am I<br>
your hired hand.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You, monk,<br>
you yourself should know<br>
how to go to the good destination."
</blockquote>
<p>
The monk, chastened by the devata, came to his senses.
