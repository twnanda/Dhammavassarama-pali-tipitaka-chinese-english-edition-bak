    Nikaya</i></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>his Collection of Discourses,
    Anguttara Nikaya, containing 9,557 short suttas is divided into eleven divisions known as
    nipatas. Each nipata is divided again into groups called vaggas which usually contain ten
    suttas. The discourses are arranged in progressive numerical order, each nipata containing
    suttas with items of dhamma, beginning with one item and moving up by units of one till
    there are eleven items of dhamma in each sutta of the last nipata. Hence the name
    Anguttara meaning 'increasing by one item'. The first nipata, Ekaka Nipata, provides in
    each sutta single items dhamma called the Ones; the second nipata, Duka Nipata, contains
    in each sutta two items of dhamma called the Twos, and the last nipata, Ekadasaka Nipata,
    is made up of suttas with eleven items of dhamma in each, called the Elevens.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Anguttara Nikaya constitutes an important source book on
    Buddhist psychology and ethics, which provides an enumerated summary of all the essential
    features concerning the theory and practice of the Dhamma. A unique chapter entitled
    Etadagga Vagga of Ekaka Nipata enumerates the names of the foremost disciples amongst the
    bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, upasakas, upasikas, who had achieved pre-eminence in one sphere of
    attainment or meritorious activity, e.g. the Venerable Sariputta in Intuitive Wisdom and
    Knowledge (Panna); the Venerable Maha Moggallana in supernormal powers (Iddhi); Bhikkhuni
    Khema in Panna, Bhikkhuni Uppalavanna in Iddhi; the Upasaka Anathapindika and the Upasika
    Visakha in alms-giving (Dana); and so on. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font COLOR="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(1) Ekaka Nipata Pali</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This group contains single items of dhamma which form the
    subject matter of discourses given by the Buddha at Savatthi to the numerous bhikkhus
    residing there. But some of the suttas were given by the Venerable Sariputta or the
    Venerable Ananda.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> (a) There is no one sight, sound, smell, taste and touch
    other than that of a woman which can captivate and distract the mind of a man; conversely
    there is no one sight, sound, smell, taste ,and touch other then that of a man which can
    captivate and distract the mind of a woman. (paras 1 to 10 )</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(b) There is no other single thing that brings about so
    much disadvantage and unhappiness as an undeveloped and uncultivated mind. A developed and
    cultivated mind brings about benefit and happiness. (paras 28 to 31)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(c) No other single thing changes so quickly as the mind.
    The mind is intrinsically pure and bright; it is defiled by greed, hatred and ignorance.
    (paras 48, 49)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(d) If a bhikkhu practises the meditation of
    loving-kindness, and develops it oven for the short duration of a fingersnap, he is
    regarded as following the advice of the Buddha, acting according to his instructions. Such
    a bhikkhu deserves to eat the alms-food offered by the people. (paras 53, 54)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(e) There is only one person whose appearance in the world
    brings welfare and happiness to the many, brings benefit, welfare and happiness to devas
    and men. It is a Tathagata, a fully Enlightened Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is impossible for two Enlightened Buddhas to appear
    simultaneously in the same world system. (paras 170 to 174)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(f) It is impossible for a person possessed of right
    views, i.e. a Sotapanna, to regard any conditioned formation as permanent, happiness, Self
    (nicca, sukha, atta). It is possible only for an uninstructed worldling to regard anything
    as permanent, happiness, Self. (paras 268 to 270)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(g) If one thing is developed and frequently practised,
    the body is calmed, the mind is calmed, discursive thinking is stilled, ignorance is shed,
    knowledge arises, delusion of self is eliminated, evil tendencies are eradicated, the
    fetters are removed. That one thing is the mindful contemplation of the body. (paras 571
    to 576)</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font COLOR="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(2) Duka Nipata Pali</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(a) There are two things to be borne in mind: not to be
    content with what has been achieved in the process of development, i.e. even with the
    attainment of jhanas or inner lights (which indicates a certain stage of Insight
    meditation), and to resolve to struggle unremittingly and strenuously until realization of
    the goal, the enlightenment. (para 5)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(b) There are two potentialities of men, to do good or to
    do evil. It is possible to abandon evil; abandoning of evil brings benefit and happiness.
    It is also possible to cultivate the good. Cultivation of the good brings benefit and
    happiness too. (para 19)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(c) Two things are conducive to attainment of liberation
    in two ways: Concentration Meditation and Insight Meditation. If concentration is
    developed, the mind becomes developed and passion fades away resulting in liberation of
    mind. If insight is developed, wisdom is developed and ignorance fades away resulting in
    liberation by knowledge. (para 32)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(d) There are two persons one can never repay: mother and
    father. Even if one should live a hundred years during which one attends upon one's mother
    and father, heaps all one's attention, love and personal service on them, one can never
    repay them for having brought up, fed and guided one through this life. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But if a person causes his parents who are non-believers
    to become established in the faith and to take refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the
    Samghas; if he causes his parents who do not observe the precepts to become established in
    morality; if he causes his miserly parents to become generous so that they come to share
    their wealth with the poor and the needy; if he causes his ignorant parents to become
    established in the knowledge of the Four Truths, then such a person repays and more than
    repays his parents for what they have done for him. (paras 33, 34)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(e) There are two kinds of happiness. The happiness of the
    home life and the happiness of homelessness; the happiness of homelessness is superior.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The happiness of the senses and the happiness of
    renunciation; the happiness of renunciation is superior. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Tainted happiness and untainted happiness;....... Carnal
    and non-carnal happiness;.., and ignoble and noble happiness;..... Bodily and mental
    happiness; mental happiness is superior. (paras 65 to 71)</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font COLOR="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(3) Tika Nipata Pali</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(a) The fool can be known by three things, by his conduct
    in deed, word and thought, so also the wise man can be known by three things, by his
    conduct in deed, word and thought. (para 3)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(b) There are three places a sovereign king should not
    forget: his birth place, the place where he was crowned as king and the site of battle in
    which he conquered his enemies. There are three places a bhikkhu should not forget: the
    place of renunciation, the place where he achieved the knowledge of the Four Noble Truths
    and the place where he attained Arahatship. (para 12)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(c) He who devotes himself earnestly to his business in
    the morning, in the daytime and in the evening, will prosper, and grow in wealth; the
    bhikkhu who devotes himself earnestly to development of concentration in the morning, in
    the daytime and in the evening will progress and gain advancement in his spiritual work.
    (para 19)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(d) These three typos of persons are found in the world:
    One with a mind like an open sore; one with a mind like a flash of lightning; one with a
    mind like a diamond.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One who is irascible and very irritable, displaying anger,
    hatred and sulkiness; such a one is said to be a person with a mind like an open sore.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One who understands the Four Noble Truths correctly is
    said to have a mind like a flash of lightning. One who has destroyed the mind-intoxicating
    defilements and realized the liberation of' mind and the liberation by knowledge is said
    to have a mind like a diamond. (para 25)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(e) There are these three kinds of individuals in the
    world: One who speaks words reeking with foul smell; one who speaks words of fragrance;
    and one who speaks words sweet as honey. (para 28)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(f) There are three root causes for the origination of
    actions (kamma): Greed, hatred and ignorance. An action done in greed, hatred and
    ignorance will ripen wherever the individual is reborn; and wherever the action ripens,
    there the individual reaps the fruit (vipaka) of that action, be it in this life, in the
    next life or in future existences. (para 38)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(g) He who prevents another from giving alms hinders and
    obstructs three persons. He causes obstruction to the meritorious act of the donor; he
    obstructs the recipient in getting his gift; he undermines and harms his own character.
    (para 58)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(h) Three dangers from which a mother cannot shield her
    son nor the son his mother: Old age, disease and death. (para 63)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(i) The well-known sutta, Kesamutti Sutta also known as
    Kalama Sutta, appears as the fifth sutta in the Mahavagga of the Tika Nipata. At
    Kesamutta, a small town in the Kingdom of Kosala, the Buddha thus exhorted the Kalamas,
    the inhabitants of the town: &quot;Do not be led by reports or traditions, or hearsay. Do
    not be led by the authority of religious texts, nor by mere logic or inference, nor by
    considering appearances, nor by speculative opinion, nor by seeming possibilities, nor
    because one's own teacher has said so. O Kalamas, when you know for yourselves that
    certain things are wrong, unwholesome, bad, then give them up; when you know for
    yourselves that certain things are right, wholesome, good, then accept them, follow
    them.&quot; (para 66)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(j) A bhikkhu devoted to the holy life should pay equal
    attention to three factors in turn, namely, concentration, energetic effort and
    equanimity, and not exclusively to one of these factors only. If he gives regular
    attention to each of them, his mind will become soft, pliant, malleable, lucid and well
    concentrated, ready to be directed to whatever mental states is realizable by supernormal
    knowledge. (para 103)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(k) There are three rare persons in the world: a Tathagata
    who is perfectly Enlightened One is rare in the world: a person who can expound the
    Teaching and Discipline as taught by the Buddha is rare in this world; and a person who is
    grateful and thankful is rare in the world. (para 115)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(l) Whether a Tathagata appears in the world or not, the
    fact remains as a firm and inevitable condition of existence that all conditioned
    formations are impermanent, that all conditioned formations are subject to suffering, that
    all things are devoid of self. (para 137)</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font COLOR="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(4) Catukka Nipata Pali </b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(a) These four persons are found in the world: he who goes
    with the stream; he who goes against the stream; he who stands firm; he who has crossed
    over to the other shore and stands on dry land.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The person who indulges in sense desires and commits wrong
    deeds is one who goes with the stream. He who does not indulge in sense desires or commit
    wrong deeds, but lives the pure, chaste life, struggling painfully and with difficulty to
    do so, is one who goes against the stream. He who stands firm is the person, who having
    destroyed the five lower fetters is reborn spontaneously in Brahma realm, whence he
    realises Nibbana without ever returning to the sensuous sphere. The one who has gone to
    the other shore standing on dry land is the person who has destroyed all the mental
    intoxicants, and who has realized, in this very life, by himself, the liberation of the
    mind and liberation by knowledge. (para 5)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(b) There are four right efforts: (i) The energetic effort
    to prevent evil, unwholesome states of mind from arising; (ii) the energetic effort to get
    rid of evil, unwholesome states of mind that have already arisen; (iii) the energetic
    effort to arouse good, wholesome states of mind that have not yet arisen; (iv) the
    energetic effort to develop and bring to perfection the good and wholesome states of mind
    already arisen. (para 13)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(c) As a Tathagata speaks, so he acts; as he acts, so he
    speaks. Therefore he is called a Tathagata. (para 23)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(d) There are four highest kinds of faith: The Tathagata,
    the holiest and fully enlightened, is the highest among all living beings. Among all
    conditioned things, the Noble Path of Eight Constituents is the highest. Among all
    conditioned and unconditioned things, Nibbana is the highest, Amongst all groups of men,
    the Order of the Tathagata, the Samgha made up of the four pairs of noble men, the eight
    Ariyas, is the highest.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For those who have faith in the highest, namely, the
    Buddha, the Path, the Nibbana and the Ariyas the highest resultant effects (result of
    action) will be theirs. (para 34)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(e) There are four ways of dealing with questions:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(i) Some should be given direct answers, </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) others should be answered by way of analysing them,</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) some questions should be answered by
      counter-questions, </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) lastly, some questions should simply be put aside.
      (para 42)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(f) There are four distortions (vipallasas) in perception,
    thought and view. To hold that there is permanence in the impermanence; to hold that there
    is happiness in suffering; to hold that there is atta where there is no atta; to hold that
    there is pleasantness (sukha) in that which is foul. (para 49) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(g) When Nakulapita and Nakulamata express their wish to
    the Buddha to be in one another's sight as long as the present life lasts and in the
    future life as well, the Buddha advises them to try to have the same faith, the same
    virtue, the same generosity and the same wisdom; then they will have their wish fulfilled.
    (paras 55-56)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(h) He who gives food gives four things to those who
    receive it. He gives them long life, beauty, happiness and strength. The donor himself
    will be endowed with long life, beauty, happiness and strength wherever he is born in the
    human or the deva world. (para 57)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(i) There are four subjects not fit for speculative
    thought (Acinteyyani). They are: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">the specific qualities of a Buddha (Buddhavisayo); <br>
      a person's jhana attainment; <br>
      the results of Kamma; and <br>
      the nature of the world (loka cinta). </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These imponderables are not to be pondered upon; which, if
    pondered upon; would lend one to mental distress and insanity. (para 77)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(j) There are four things concerning which no one whether
    samana, brahmana, deva, Mara or anyone else in the world can give a guarantee:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(i) That what is liable to decay should not decay; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) that what is liable to illness should not fall ill; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) that what is liable to die should not die; and </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) that no resultant effects should come forth from
      those evil deeds done previously. (para 182) </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(k) There are four ways by which a person's character may
    be judged:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">His virtue can be known by a wise and intelligent person
    paying close attention after living together with him for a very long time. His integrity
    can be known by a wise and intelligent person by having dealings with him, paying close
    attention over a long period of time. His fortitude can be known by a wise and intelligent
    person by observing him with close attention in times of misfortune. His wisdom can be
    judged by a wise and intelligent person when conversing with him on various subjects over
    a long period of time. (para 192) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(l) There are four things conducive to the growth of
    wisdom: associating with a good person; hearing the good Dhamma; maintaining a right
    attitude of mind and leading a life in accordance with the Dhamma. (para 248) </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font COLOR="#0000FF">(5) Pancaka Nipata
    Pali</font></b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(a) There are five strengths possessed by a person in
    training for higher knowledge: faith, shame (to do evil), moral dread, energy and
    insight-knowledge. He believes in the enlightenment of the Buddha; he feels ashamed of
    wrong conduct in deed, word and thought; he dreads anything evil and unwholesome; he
    arouses energy to abandon everything unwholesome and to acquire every thing that is
    wholesome; he perceives the phenomenon of constant rising and ceasing and is thus equipped
    with insight which will finally lead him to Nibbana, destruction of suffering. (para 2)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(b) There are also other five strengths, namely, faith,
    energy, mindfulness, concentration and insight-knowledge. The strength of faith is seen in
    the four characteristic qualities of a Stream-winner; the strength of energy is seen in
    the four Right Efforts; the strength of mindfulness is seen in the Four Methods of
    Steadfast Mindfulness and the strength of concentration is seen in the four jhanas; the
    strength of insight-knowledge is seen in the perception of the phenomenon of constant
    rising and ceasing, an insight which will finally lead to Nibbana. (para 14)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(c) Impurities that defile gold are iron, tin, lead,
    silver, and other metals. Impurities that defile mind are sensuous desire, ill will, sloth
    and torpor, restlessness and worry, sceptical doubts. (pare 23)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(d) A giver of alms surpasses a non-giver in five aspects,
    namely, in life-span, beauty, happiness, fame and power, whether both be reborn in the
    deva world or the human world. This difference in five aspects will persist till
    liberation is achieved. There is then no distinction between the liberation of one and the
    other or between one arahat and the other. (para 31) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(e) There are five contemplations which ought to be
    practised by everyone, bhikkhus or layfolks, men and women:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">'I am certain to become old. I cannot avoid ageing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> I am certain to become ill and diseased. I can not avoid
      illness. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> 'I am certain to die. I cannot avoid death.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> 'All things dear and beloved will not last. They will be
      subject to change and separation. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> 'My kamma (past and present actions) is not only
      property, kamma is my only heritage, kamma is the only cause of my being, kamma is my only
      kin, my only protection. Whatever actions I do, good or bad, I shall become their heir.'
      (para 57)</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(f) Five standards which should be set up for teaching the
    Dhamma: the Dhamma should be taught in graduated discourses; the Dhamma should be given as
    a well-reasoned discourse; the Dhamma should be given out of compassion and sympathy; the
    Dhamma should not be given for the sake of worldly gain and advantage; the Dhamma should
    be taught without alluding to oneself or others. (para 159)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(g) There are five ways of getting rid of a grudge: If a
    grudge arises towards any person, then one should cultivate loving-kindness, or compassion
    or equanimity to wards him. Or one should pay no attention to him and give no thought to
    him. Or one may apply the thought: his only property is his actions; whatever he does,
    good or bad, he will be heir to that. In these ways, all grudges that have arisen can be
    removed. (para 161)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(h) Wrong occupations which should not be followed by a
    lay disciple: Trading in arms and weapons; trading in living beings; trading in meat;
    trading in intoxicants; trading in poison. (para 177)</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font COLOR="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(6) Chakka Nipata Pa1i </b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(a) There are six things which are unsurpassed: The
    noblest things seen, the noblest things heard, the noblest gain, the noblest learning, the
    noblest service, and the noblest reflection. The sight of the Tathagata or the Tathagata's
    disciples is the noblest thing seen. The hearing, of the Dhamma from the Tathagata or his
    disciples is the noblest thing heard. Faith in the Tathagata or his disciples is the
    noblest gain. Learning supreme virtue (adhisila), supreme mind development (adhicitta),
    supreme wisdom (adhipapanna) is the noblest learning. Serving the Tathagata or his
    disciples is the noblest service. Reflecting on the virtues of the Tathagata or his
    disciples is the noblest reflection. (para 30)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(b) There are six kinds of suffering in the world for one
    who indulges in sense-pleasures: poverty, indebtedness, owing interest, being demanded
    repaying, being pressed and harassed by creditors, imprisonment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Similarly in the Teaching of the Ariyas, a person is
    regarded to be poor and destitute who lacks faith in things that are meritorious, who has
    no shame and no scruples, no energy and no understanding of things that are good, and who
    conducts himself badly in deed, word and thoughts. (para 45) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(c) There are six steps to gain liberation: Sense-control
    provides the basis for morality. Morality gives the foundation to Right Concentration.
    Right Concentration provides the basis for understanding of the true nature of physical
    and mental phenomenon. With understanding of the true nature of physical and mental
    phenomena comes disenchantment and non-attachment. Where there is disenchantment and
    non-attachment, there arises the knowledge and vision of liberation. (para 50) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(d) There are six things to be known: Sense-desires,
    feelings, perceptions, moral intoxicants (asavas), kamma and dukkha should be known, their
    causal origin should be known, their diversity, their resulting effects, their cessation
    and the way leading to their cessation should be known.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The way leading to the cessation of all these dhammas is
    the Noble Path of Eight Constituents. (para 63)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(e) There are six things which appear very rarely in the
    world: Rare is the appearance in the world of a Perfectly Enlightened Buddha; rare is the
    appearance of one who teaches the Dhamma and Vinaya as proclaimed by the Buddha; rare it
    is to be reborn in the land of the Ariyas; rare it is to be in possession of unimpaired
    physical and mental faculties; rare it is to be free from dumbness and stupidity; rare it
    is to be endowed with the desire for doing good, wholesome things. (para 96)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(f) There are six benefits in realizing the Sotapatti
    Fruition: (i) firm faith in the Dhamma (ii) impossibility of falling back; (iii) limit to
    suffering in the round of existences (only seven more existences); (iv) being endowed with
    supramundane knowledge which is not shared by the common worldling; (v) and (vi) clear
    Understanding of causes and phenomena arising therefrom. (pare 97)</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font COLOR="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(7) Sattaka Nipata Pali</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(a) There are seven factors for winning respect and esteem
    of fellow bhikkhus: having no desire for gain; not wanting to be shown reverence but
    indifferent to attention; being ashamed of doing evil; being fearful of doing evil; and
    having little want; and having the right view. (para 1 )</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(b) A bhikkhu becomes an eminent field for sowing seeds of
    merit, when he knows the text of the Teaching, knows the meaning of the Teaching, also
    knows himself, knows the proper limit for acceptance of offerings, knows the proper time
    for various activities, knows his audience, and knows the spiritual tendency of an
    individual. (para 68)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(c) If a bhikkhu develops his mind in the four methods of
    Steadfast Mindfulness, the four Right Efforts, the four bases of Psychic Power, the five
    Faculties, the five Strengths, the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, the Noble Path of Eight
    Constituents, he will be freed of the mental intoxicants, without any attachment, whether
    he wishes or not for liberation. (para 71 )</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(d) Short is the life of man, just like the dew-drop on
    the tip of a blade of grass; a bubble appearing on the water when rain falls; a line drawn
    on water with a stick; a mountain stream; a lump of spittle on the tip of the tongue; a
    piece of meat thrown into an extremely hot iron pot; and a cow being led to be
    slaughtered, whenever she lifts a leg, she will be closer to slaughter, closer to death.
    (para 74)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(e) Those teachings that lead to disenchantment, entire
    turning away from worldliness, non-attachment, cessation and calm, direct knowledge,
    enlightenment and Nibbana - such teachings may be taken as the true Dhamma and Discipline,
    as the Buddha's Teaching. (para 83)</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font COLOR="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(8) Atthaka Nipata Pali </b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(a) There are eight benefits accruing from practice of
    meditation on loving-kindness: Whosoever practises meditation on loving-kindness enjoys
    sound sleep, wakes up fresh and well, is not disturbed by bad dreams, is regarded with
    esteem by men, is treated with respect by non-humans, is accorded protection by devas, is
    not hurt by fire, poison or weapons and is destined to reappear in the Brahma realm. (para
    1 ) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(b) There are eight worldly conditions, the vicissitudes
    of life that keep the world turning round: gain, loss, fame, disrepute, praise, blame,
    happiness, suffering. (para 546)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(c) There are eight strengths: The strength of a child
    lies in crying; of a woman in her anger; of a bandit in his arms; of a king in his
    sovereignty; of an unwise man in censure and reviling; of a wise man in careful
    consideration of pros and cons; of a man of knowledge in caution; and the strength of a
    bhikkhu lies in his fortitude and forbearance. (para 27)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(d) Eight great reflections of the Venerable Anuruddha on
    the Dhamma: This Dhamma is for one with few wants, not for one who wants much. This Dhamma
    is for the contented, not for one hard to be satisfied. This Dhamma is for one who loves
    solitude, not for one who loves company. This Dhamma is for the energetic, not for the
    indolent. This Dhamma is for one of vigilant mindfulness, not for the heedless. This
    Dhamma is for one of concentrated mind, not for the distracted. This Dhamma is for the
    wise, not for the unintelligent. This Dhamma is for one who delights in Nibbana, not for
    one who rejoices in worldliness (conceit, craving and wrong view). (para 30)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(e) There are eight types of speech by an Ariya:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having not seen, he says he has not seen; having not
    heard, he says he has not heard; having not sensed, he says he has not sensed; having not
    known, he says he has not known. Having seen, he says he has seen; having heard, says he
    has heard; having sensed, he says he has sensed and having known, he says he has known.
    (para 68)</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font COLOR="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(9) Navaka Nipata Pali </b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(a) Nine practices not indulged in by Arahats: An Arahat
    does not intentionally take the life of a being; does not take, with the intention of
    stealing, what is not given; does not engage in sexual intercourse; does not speak what is
    not true knowing that it is not true; does not enjoy the pleasures of the senses; is not
    biased through favouritism, through hatred, through delusion or through fear. (para 7) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(b) There are nine characteristics of a layman's residence
    which a bhikkhu should not visit or stay in:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Where a bhikkhu is not greeted or shown signs of welcome,
    or offered a seat; where alms are kept hidden; where little is given away although much
    can be afforded; where inferior alms are offered although better alms are available; where
    the offering is made in a disrespectful manner; where the layman does not come near the
    bhikkhu to listen to the dhamma, and where little interest is shown in the exposition of
    the dhamma. (para 17)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(c) There are nine ways in which grudge is formed: He has
    done me harm, he is doing me harm, he will do me harm; he has done harm to one dear to me,
    he is doing harm to one dear to me, he will do harm to one dear to me; he has done good to
    one disliked by me; ha is doing good to one disliked by me; he will do good to one
    disliked by me. (para 29)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(d) There are nine things which should be eliminated in
    order to achieve realization of Arahatta Phala: Lust, ill will, ignorance, anger, grudge,
    ingratitude, envy, Jealousy, meanness. (para 62)</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font COLOR="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(10) Dasaka Nipata Pali </b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(a) There are ten benefits of being established in sila,
    morality: One who is established in sila feels pleased; feeling pleased he feels glad;
    feeling glad, he is delightfully satisfied; being delightfully satisfied he becomes calm;
    when he is calm, he feels happiness; when he feels happiness, his mind becomes
    concentrated; with concentrated mind, he sees things as they really are; seeing things as
    they really are, he becomes disenchanted and dispassionate towards them; when there is no
    more passion or attachment, he achieves liberation of mind and liberation by knowledge.
    (para 1)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(b) There are ten fetters: Personality belief
    (Sakkyaditthi), sceptical doubts, mistaking mere rites and ceremony as the true path,
    sense-desire, ill will, attachment to Rupa realm, attachment to Arupa realm, coneceit,
    restlessness, and ignorance. (para 12)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(c) Just as a young man or a woman looks into the mirror
    to find out if there are any blemishes on the face, so also it is necessary for a bhikkhu
    to engage in occasional self-examination to see whether covetousness, ill will, sloth and
    torpor have arisen in him or not; whether worry and excitement, and doubts exist in him;
    whether he is free from anger and his mind is defiled or not by unwholesome thoughts;
    whether his body is at ease without restlessness; whether he is beset by laziness or not;
    and whether he has concentration of mind with clear comprehension. (para 51) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(d) There are ten dhammas possessed by one who has become
    accomplished, an Arahat: Right View, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right
    Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration, Right Knowledge, Right
    Liberation. (pare 112) </font></p>

    Pali </b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(a) There are eleven kinds of destruction any one of which
    is likely to befall a bhikkhu who reviles the fellow bhikkhus of the community: Lack of
    progress in his efforts; declining from the stage already achieved; tainted and defiled
    understanding of the Dhamma; Being over come by his own conceit; unhappiness in leading
    the holy life; liability to commit offences against the disciplinary rules; likelihood of
    reverting to the household life; likelihood of being afflicted with an incurable disease;
    likelihood of becoming mentally deranged; dying with a confused mind and likelihood of
    being reborn in the Nether Worlds. (para 6)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(b) There are eleven benefits derived from cultivation and
    development of loving-kindness, when frequently practised and firmly established: One
    sleeps soundly and wakes peacefully with no bad dreams; one is regarded with esteem by
    men; is treated with respect by non-humans; is protected by devas; is unharmed by fire,
    poison or weapons; his mind is easily concentrated; the features of his face are serene;
    he will die with a unconfused mind; if he does not attain to Arahatship, he will be reborn
    in the Brahma realm (para 15).</font></p>
