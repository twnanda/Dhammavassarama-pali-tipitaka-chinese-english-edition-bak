    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="+1" face="Times New Roman"><strong><i>I. The
    Dhammasangani Pali</i></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Dhammasangani, the first book of the Abhidhamma, and
    the Patthana, the last book, are the most important of the seven treatises of Abhidhamma,
    providing as they do the quintessence of the entire Abhidhamma.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Scheme of Classification in the
    Dhammasangani</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>(1) The Matika</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Dhammasangani enumerates all the dhammas (phenomena)
    i.e., all categories of nama, namely, Consciousness and mental concomitant, and , rupa,
    Corporeality. Having enumerated the phenomena, they are arranged under different heads to
    bring out their exact nature, function and mutual relationship both internally (in our own
    being) and with the outside world. The Dhammasangani begins with a complete list of heads
    called the Matika. The Matika serves as a classified table of mental constituents treated
    not only in the Dhammasangani but in the entire system of the Abhidhamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Matika consists altogether of one hundred and twenty
    two groups, of which the first twenty two are called the Tikas or Triads, those that are
    divided under three heads; and the remaining one hundred are called the Dukas or Dyads,
    those that are divided under two heads.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Examples of Triads are:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(a) Kusala Tika: dhammas </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(i) that are moral, kusala,<br>
      (ii) that are immoral, akusala,<br>
      (iii) that are inderterminate, abyakata.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(b) Vedana Tika: dhammas that are associated </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(i) with pleasant feeling,<br>
      (ii) with painful feeling, <br>
      (iii) with neutral feeling. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Examples of Dyads are:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(a) Hetu Duka: dhammas </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(i) that are roots, hetus <br>
      (ii) that are not roots, ne-hetu.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(b) Sahetuka Duka: dhammas </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(i) that are associated with the hetus<br>
      (ii) that are not associated with the hetus.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Matika concludes with a list of the categories of
    dhamma entitled Suttantika Matika made up of' forty two groups of dhamma found in the
    suttas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>(2) The four Divisions</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Based on these Matikas of Tikas and Dukas, the
    Dhammasangani is divided into four Divisions:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(i) Cittuppada Kanda. Division on the arising of
      consciousness and mental concomitants.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) Rupa Kanda, Division concerning corporeality.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> (iii) Nikkhepa Kanda, Division that avoids elaboration.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> (iv) Atthakatha Kanda, Division of Supplementary Digest</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of the four divisions, the first two, namely, Cittuppada
    Kanda and Rupa Kanda form the main and the essential portion of' the book. They set the
    model of thorough investigation into the nature, properties, function and
    interrelationship of each of the dhammas listed in the Matika, by providing a simple
    analysis and review of the first Tika, namely, the Kusala Tika of Kusala, Akusala and
    Abyakata Dhamma. Cittuppada Kanda deals with a complete enumeration of all the states of
    mind that come under the headings of Kusala and Akusala; the Rupa Kanda is concerned with
    all states of matter that come under the heading of Abyakata; mention is also made of
    Asankhata Dhatu (Nibbana) without discussing it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Nikkhepa Kanda, the third division, gives, not too
    elaborately nor too briefly, the summary of distribution of all the Tikas and Dukas, so
    that their full contents and significance will become comprehensible and fully covered. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Atthakatha Kanda, the last division of the book, is of the
    same nature as the third division, giving a summary of the dhammas under the different
    heads of the Tika and the Duka groups. But it provides it in a more condensed manner, thus
    forming a supplementary digest of the first book of the Abhidhamma for easy memorizing. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> <b>(3) Order and classification of the types of
    Consciousness as discussed in Cittuppada Kanda.</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Cittuppada Kanda first gives a statement of the types
    of Consciousness arranged under the three heads of the first Tika, namely, (i) Kusala
    Dhamma i.e., Meritorious Consciousness and its concomitants (ii) Akusala Dhamma i.e.,
    Demeritorious Consciousness and its concomitants (iii) Abyakata Dhamma i.e., Indeterminate
    Consciousness and its concomitants. The list of mental concomitants for each dhamma is
    fairly long and repetitive.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The statement of the types of Consciousness is followed by
    identification of the particular type, e.g. Kusala Dhamma, in the form of question and
    answer, with regard to the plane or sphere (bhumi) of Consciousness: Kamavacara, sensuous
    plane; Rupavacara, plane of form; Arupavacara, plane of no-form; Tebhumaka, pertaining to
    all the three planes; or Lokuttara, supramundane, not pertaining to the three planes.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The type of Consciousness for each plane is further
    divided into various kinds e.g., there are eight kinds of Kusala Dhamma for the sensuous
    plane: first Kusala Citta, second Kusala Citta etc.; twelve kinds of Akusala Citta; eight
    kinds of Ahetuka Kusala Vipaka Citta and eight kinds of Sahetuka Vipaka Citta under the
    heading of Abyakata Dhamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Then these various kinds are further analysed according
    to:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> (i) Dhamma Vavatthana Vara e.g., the particular quality,
      whether accompanied by joy etc. i.e., somanassa, domannassa, sukha, dukkha or upekkha. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> (ii) Kotthgsa Vara, the grouping of dhammas. There are
      twenty three categories of dhammas which result from synthetical grouping of dhammas into
      separate categories such as khandhas, ayatanas, dhatus etc.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) Sunnata Vara, which lays stress on the fact that
      there is no 'self' (atta) or jiva behind all these dhammas; they are only composites,
      causally formed. and conditioned, devoid of any abiding substance.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The same method of treatment is adopted for the akusala
    and abyakata types of Consciousness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>(4) Rupa Kanda</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because Dhammasangani treats all the dhammas (namas as
    well as rupas) in the same uniform system of classification, Rupa Kanda is only a
    continuation of the distribution of the Dhamma under the heads of the first Tiks which
    begins in the first division, Cittuppada Kanda. In the Cittuppada Kanda, the enumeration
    of the Dhamma under the head 'Abyakata' has been only partially done, because abyakata
    type of Dhamma includes not only all the states of mind which are neither meritorious nor
    demeritorious but also all states of matter and the Asankhata Dhatu or Nibbana. The
    portion of Dhamma under the heading of Abyakata, which has been left out from cittuppada
    Kanda is attended to in this Kanda.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The method of-treatment here is similar, with the
    difference that instead of mental concomitants, the constituents of matter, namely, the
    four primary elements and the material qualities derived from them with their properties
    and their relationships are analysed and classified.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="+1" face="Times New Roman"><strong><i>II.
    Vibhanga Pali: Book of Analysis</i></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second book of the Abhidhamma Pitaka, Vibhanga,
    together with the first book Dhammasangani and the third book Dhatukatha, forms a closely
    related foundation for the proper and deep understanding of the Buddha's Dhamma. Whereas
    Dhammasangani provides a bird's eye view of the whole of the Tika and Duka groups with
    further systematic arrangements under classified heads, Vibhanga and Dhatukatha give a
    closer view of selected portions of those groups bringing out minute details. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, Kotthasa Vara in Dhammasangani explains what and how
    many khandha, ayatana, dhatu, ahara, indriya, jhanange etc. are included in the Tika and
    Duka groups. But it does not furnish complete information about these dhammas. It is
    Vibhanga which provides full knowledge concerning them, stating the exact nature of each
    dhamma. Its constituents and its relationship to other dhammas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Vibhanga is divided into eighteen Chapters each
    dealing with a particular aspect of the Dhamma; its full analysis and investigation into
    each constituesn. The arrangement and classification into groups and heads follow the same
    system as in the Dhammasangani. Vibhanga may therefore be regarded as complementary to
    Dhammasangani.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Vibhanga explains comprehensively the following
    categories of Dhamma:</font></p>

    </center></div><p><font face="Times New Roman"> Each category is analysed and discussed in
    two or all the three of the following methods of analysis:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Suttanta bhajaniya - the meaning of the terms and the
    classification of the dhammas determined according to the Suttanta methods; Abhidhamma
    bhijaniya - the meaning of the terms and the classification of the dhammas determined
    according to the Abhidhamma method; Panha pucchaka, discussions in the form of questions
    and answers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> It may be seen from the above list of the eighteen
    categories that they may be divided into three separate groups. The first group containing
    numbers (i)-(vi) deals with mental and corporeal constituents of beings and two laws of
    nature to which they are constantly subjected viz: the Law of Impermanence and the Law of
    Dependent Origination. The second group containing numbers (vii)-(xii) is concerned with
    the practice of the holy life which will take beings out of suffering and rounds of
    existence. The remaining six categories serve as a supplement to the first two groups,
    supplying fuller information and details where necessary.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="+1" face="Times New Roman"><strong><i>III.
    Dhatukatha Pali</i></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although this third book of Abhidhamma Pitaka is a small
    treatise, it ranks with the first two books forming an important trilogy, which must be
    thoroughly digested for the complete understanding of the Abhidhamma. Vibhanga, the second
    book, has one complete chapter devoted to the analysis of dhatus, but the subject matter
    of dhatu is so important that this separate treatise is devoted to it for a thorough
    consideration. The method of analysis here is different from that employed in the
    Vibhanga.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Dhatukatha studies how the dhammas listed in the Tikas
    and Dukas of the Matika are related to the three categories of khandha, ayatana and dhatu
    in their complete distribution i.e., five khandhas, twelve ayatana and eighteen dhatus.
    These are discussed in fourteen ways of analytical investigations which constitute the
    fourteen chapters of Dhatukatha.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="+1" face="Times New Roman"><strong><i>IV.
    Puggalapannatti Pali</i></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Abhidhamma is mainly concerned with the study of abstract
    truths in absolute terms. But in describing the dhammas in their various aspects, it is
    not possible to keep to absolute terms only. Inevitably, conventional terms of every day
    language have to be employed in order to keep the lines of communication open all.
    Abhidhamma states that there are two main types of conventional usage; the first type is
    concerned with terms which express things that actually exist in reality and the second
    type describes things which have no existence in reality.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The first three books of the Abhidhamma investigate the
    absolute Truth of Dhamma in a planned system of detailed analysis employing such terms as
    Khandha, Ayatana, Dhatu, Sacca and Indriya. These terms are mere designations which
    express things that exist in reality and are therefore classed as the conventional usage
    of the first type. To the second type of conventional usage belong such expressions as
    man, woman, deva, individual etc., which have no existence in reality, but nevertheless
    are essential for communication of thoughts.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> It becomes necessary therefore to distinguish between
    these two types of apparent truths. But as the terms Khandha, Ayatana, Dhatu, Sacca and
    Indriya have been elaborately dealt with in the first three books, they are dealt with
    here only briefly. The terms used in the second type concerning individuals are given more
    weight and space in the treatise, hence its title Puggalapannatti, designation of
    individuals. Different types of individuals are classified, in ten chapters of the book,
    after the manner of enumeration employed in Anguttara Nikaya.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="+1" face="Times New Roman"><strong><i>V.
    Kathavatthu Pali</i></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kathavatthu, like Puggalapannatti, falls outside the
    regular system of the Abhidhamma. It does not directly deal with the abstruse nature of
    the Dhamma. It is mainly concerned with wrong views such as &quot;Person exists; Self
    exists; Jiva exists&quot; which were prevalent even in the Buddha's time, or wrong views
    such as &quot;Arahat falls away from Arahatship&quot; which arose after the Parinibbana of
    the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> About two hundred and eighteen years after the
    Parinibbana of the Buddha there were altogether eighteen Sects, all claiming to be
    followers of the Buddha's Teaching. Of these only the Theravadins were truly orthodox,
    while the rest were all schismatic. The Emperor Asoka set about removing the impure
    elements from the Order with the guidance and assistance of the Elder Moggaliputtatissa
    who was an accomplished Arahat. Under his direction, the Order held in concord the
    Uposatha ceremony which had not been held for seven years be cause of dissensions and the
    presence of false bhikkhus in the Order. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> At that assembly, the Venerable Moggaliputtatissa
    expounded on points of views, made up of five hundred orthodox statements and five hundred
    statements of other views, in order to refute the wrong views that had crept into the
    Samgha and that might in the future arise. He followed the heads of discourses, Matika,
    outlined by the Buddha himself and analysed them in detail into one thousand statements of
    views. This collection of statements of views was recited by one thousand selected theras
    who formed the Third Great Synod, to be incorporated in the Abhidhamma Pitaka.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The style of compilation of this treatise is quite
    different from that of other treatises, writter as it is in the form of dialogue between
    two imaginary debators, one holding the heterodox views of different sects and the other
    representing the orthodox views.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="+1" face="Times New Roman"><strong><i>VI.
    Yamaka Pali</i></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Dhammasangani, the Vibhanga and the Dhatu katha
    examine the Dhamma and their classifications as they exist in the world of reality, named
    Sankharaloka. Puggalapannatti and Kathavatthu deal with beings and individuals which also
    exist in their own world of apparent reality, known as Sattaloka. Where the dhamma of
    Sankharaloka and beings of the Sattaloka co-exist is termed the Okasaloka. Yamaka sets out
    to define and analyse the interrelationship of dhammas and puggalas as they exist in these
    three worlds.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This is accomplished in the form of pairs of questions,
    which gives it the title of Yamaka. The logical process of conversion (anuloma) and
    complete inversion (patiloma) is applied to determine the complete import and limit of a
    term in its relationship with the others. An equivocal nature of a term (samsaya) is
    avoided by showing through such arrangement of questions how other meanings of the term do
    not fit for a particular consideration.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The following pairs of questions may be taken as an
    example:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> To the question &quot;May all rupa be called
    Rupakkhandha?&quot; the answer is 'Rupa is also used in such expressions as piva rupa
    (loveable nature), eva rupa (of such nature), but there it does not mean Rupakkhandha.'</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> But to the question 'May all Rupakkhandha be called
    rupa?' the answer is 'yes', because Rupakkhandha be is a very wide term and includes such
    terms as piya rupa. eva rupa etc.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font COLOR="#0000FF" SIZE="+1" face="Times New Roman"><strong><i>VII.
    Patthana Pali </i></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Patthana Pali, the seventh and last book of the
    Abhidhamma, is called the Haha Pakarana. the 'Great Book' announcing the supreme position
    it occupies and the height of excellence it has reached in its investigations into the
    ultimate nature of all the dhammas in the Universe.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Dhammasangani gives an enumeration of these dhammas
    classifying them under the Tika and Duke groups. Vibhanga analyses them to show what
    dhammas are contained in the major categories of khandhas, ayatanas, dhatus etc.
    Dhatukatha studies the relationship of dhammas listed in the Matika with each component of
    these major categories of khandhas, ayatanas and dhatus. Yamaka resolves ambiguity in the
    internal and external relationship of each dhamma. Patthana forming the last book of the
    Abhidhamma brings together all such relationship in a co-ordinated form to show that the
    dhammas do not exist as isolated entities but they constitute a well ordered system in
    which the smallest unit conditions the rest of it and is also being conditioned in return.
    The arrangement of the system is so very intricate, complex, highly thorough and complete
    that it earns for this treatise the reputation of being deep, profound and unfathomable.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+1" face="Times New Roman">An outline of the Patthana system
    of relations.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Patthana, made up of the words&quot;pa and thana&quot;,
    means a system of relations. The Great Treatise of Patthana arranges all conditioned
    things, (twenty-two Tikas and one hundred Dukas of the Matika), under twenty-four kinds of
    relations, describes and classifies them into a complete system for understanding the
    mechanics of the universe of Dhamma. The whole work is divided into four great divisions,
    namely:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(i) Anuloma Patthana which studies the instances in which
    paccaya relations do exist between the dhammas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) Paccaniya Patthana which studies the in stances in
    which paccaya relations do not exist between the dhammas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) Anuloma Paccaniya Patthana which studies the
    instances in which some of the paccaya relations do exist between the dhammas but the
    others do not. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) Paccaniya Anuloma Patthana which studies the
    instances in which some of the paccaya relations do not exist between the dhammas, but the
    others do exist.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The twenty four paccayas relations are applied to these
    four great divisions in the following six ways: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(i) Tika Patthana<br>
      (ii) Duka Patthana<br>
