    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>he Suttanta Pitaka is a collection
    of all the discourses in their entirety delivered by the Buddha on various occasions. (A
    few discourses delivered by some of the distinguished disciples of the Buddha, such as the
    Venerable Sariputta, Maha Moggallana, Ananda, etc., as well as some narratives are also
    included in the books of the Suttanta Pitaka.) The discourses of the Buddha compiled
    together in the Suttanta Pitaka were expounded to suit different occasions, for various
    persons with different temperaments. Although the discourses were mostly intended for the
    benefit of bhikkhus, and deal with the practice of' the pure life and with the exposition
    of the Teaching, there are also several other discourses which deal with the material and
    moral progress of the lay disciples. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Suttanta Pitaka brings out the meaning of the Buddha's
    teachings, expresses them clearly, protects and guards them against distortion and
    misconstruction. Just like a string which serves as an plumb-line to guide the carpenters
    in their work, just like a thread which protects flowers from being scattered or dispersed
    when strung together by it, likewise by means of' suttas, the meaning of Buddha's
    teachings may be brought out clearly, grasped and understood correctly and given perfect
    protection from being misconstrued. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Suttanta Pitaka is divided into five separate
    collections known as Nikayas. They are Digha Nikaya, Majjhima Nikaya, Samyutta Nikaya,
    Anguttara Nikaya and Khuddaka Nikaya.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><strong><i>(a) Observances
    and Practices in the Teaching of the Buddha</i></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the Suttanta Pitaka are found not only the fundamentals
    of the Dhamma but also pragmatic guidelines to make the Dhamma meaningful and applicable
    to daily life. All observances and practices which form practical steps in the Buddha's
    Noble Path of Eight Constituents lead to spiritual purification at three levels: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sila moral: purity through right conduct, </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Samadhi: purity of mind through concentration (Samatha), </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Panna: purity of Insight through Vipassana</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">To begin with, one must make the right resolution to take
    refuge in the Buddha, to follow the Buddha's Teaching, and to be guided by the Samgha. The
    first disciples who made the declaration of faith in the Buddha and committed themselves
    to follow his Teaching were the two merchant brothers, Tapussa and Bhallika. They were
    travelling with their followers in five hundred carts when they saw the Buddha in the
    vicinity of' the Bodhi free after his Enlightenment. The two merchants offered him honey
    rice cakes. Accepting their offering and thus breaking the fast he had imposed on himself
    for seven weeks, the Buddha made them his disciples by letting them recite after him: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<i>Buddham Saranam Gacchami</i> (I take refuge in
    the Buddha).&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;<i> Dhamman Saranam Gacchami</i> (I take refuge in
    the Dhamma ) &quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This recitation became the formula of declaration of faith
    in the Buddha and his Teaching. Later when the Samgha became established, the formula was
    extended to include the third commitment: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;Samgha Saranam Gacchami.</i> (I take refuge in
    the Samgha).&quot;</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><font color="#0000FF"><i>(b) On the
    right way to give alms.</i></font> </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a practical step, capable of immediate and fruitful use
    by people in all walks of life, the Buddha gave discourses on charity, alms-giving,
    explaining its virtues and on the right way and the right attitude of mind with which an
    offering is to be made for spiritual uplift. The motivating force in an act of charity is
    the volition, the will to give. Charity is a meritorious action that arises only cut of
    volition. Without the will to give, there is no act of giving. Volition in giving alms is
    of three types: </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(i) The volition that starts with the thought 'I shall
    make an offering' and that exists during the period of preparations for making the
    offering - Pubba Cetana, volition before the act. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) The volition that arises at the moment of making the
    offering while handing it over to the donee - Munca Cetana, volition during the act. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) The volition accompanying the joy and rejoicing
    which arise during repeated recollection of or reflection on the act of giving - Apara
    Cetana, volition after the act. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Whether the offering is made in homage to the living
    Buddha or to a minute particle of his relics after his passing away, it is the volition,
    its strength and purity that determine the nature of the result thereof. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is also explained in the discourses the wrong
    attitude of mind with which no act of charity should be performed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A donor should avoid looking down on others who cannot
    make a similar offering; nor should he exult over his own charity. Defiled by such
    unworthy thoughts, his volition is only of inferior grade. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the act of charity is motivated by expectations of
    beneficial results of immediate prosperity and happiness, or rebirth in higher existences,
    the accompanying volition is classed as mediocre.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is only when the good deed of alms-giving is performed
    out of a spirit of renunciation, motivated by thoughts of pure selflessness, aspiring only
    for attainment to Nibbana where all suffering ends, that the volition that brings about
    the act is regarded as of superior grade. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Examples abound in the discourses concerning charity and
    modes of giving alms.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><strong><i>(c) Moral Purity
    through right conduct, Sila.</i></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Practice of Sila forms a most fundamental aspect of
    Buddhism. It consists of practice of Right Speech, Right Action and Right Livelihood to
    purge oneself of impure deeds, words and thoughts. Together with the commitment to the
    Threefold Refuge (as described above) a Buddhist lay disciple observes the Five Precepts
    by making a formal vow: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(i) I undertale to observe the precept of abstaining from
      killings </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) I undertake to observe the precept of abstaining from
      stealing. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) I undertake to observe the precept of abstaining
      from sexual misconduct. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(vi) I undertake to observe the precept of abstaining from
      telling lies. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(v) I undertake to observe the precept of abstaining from
      alcoholic drinks, drugs or intoxicants that becloud the mind. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to the negative aspect of the above formula
    which emphasizes abstinence, there is also the positive aspect of sila. For instance, we
    find in many discourses the statement: 'He refrains from killing, puts aside the cudgel
    and the sword; full of kindness and compassion he lives for the welfare and happiness of
    all living things.' Every precept laid down in the formula has these two aspects. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Depending upon the individual and the stage of one's
    progress, other forms of precepts, namely, Eight Precepts, Ten Precepts etc., may be
    observed. For the bhikkhus of the Order, higher and advanced types of practices of
    morality are laid down. The Five Precepts are to be always observed by lay disciples who
    may occasionally enhance their self-discipline by observing the Eight or Ten Precepts. For
    those who have already embarked on the path of a holy life, the Ten Precepts are essential
    preliminaries to further progress. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sila of perfect purity serves as a foundation for the next
    stage of progress, namely, Samadhi - purity of mind through concentration-meditation. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><strong><i>(d) Practical
    methods of mental cultivation for develop ment of concentration, samadhi. </i></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mental cultivation for spiritual uplift consists of two
    steps. The first step is to purify the mind from all defilements and corruption and to
    have it focused on a point. A determined effort (Right Exertion) must be made to narrow
    down the range of thoughts in the wavering, unsteady mind. Then attention (Right
    Mindfulness or Attentiveness) must be fixed on a selected object of meditation until
    one-pointedness of mind (Right concentration) is achieved. In such a state, the mind
    becomes freed from hindrances, pure, tranquil, powerful and bright. It is then ready to
    advance to the second step by which Magga Insight and Fruition may be attained in order to
    transcend the state of woe and sorrow. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Suttanta Pitaka records numerous methods of Meditation
    to bring about one-pointedness of mind. In the Suttas of the Pitaka are dispersed these
    methods of meditation, explained by the Buddha sometimes singly, sometimes collectively to
    suit the occasion and the purpose for which they are recommended. The Buddha knew the
    diversity of character and mental make-up of each individual, the different temperaments
    and inclinations of those who approached him for guidance. Accordingly he recommended
    different methods to different persons to suit the special character and need of each
    individual. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The practice of mental cultivation which results
    ultimately in one-pointedness of mind is known as Samadhi Bhavana. Whoever wishes to
    develop Samadhi Bhavana must have been established in the observance of the precepts, with
    the senses controlled, calm and self-possessed, and must be contented. Having been
    established in these four conditions he selects a place suitable for meditation, a
    secluded spot. Then he should sit cross-legged keeping his body erect and his mind alert;
    he should start purifying his mind of five hindrances, namely, sensual desire, ill will,
    sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry, and doubt, by choosing a meditation method
    suitable to him, practising meditation with zeal and ardour. For instance, with the
    Anapana method he keeps watching the incoming and outgoing breath until he can have his
    mind fixed securely on the breath at the tip of the nose. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he realizes that the five hindrances have been got
    rid of, he becomes gladdened, delighted, calm and blissful. This is the beginning of
    samadhi, concentration, which will further develop until it attains one-pointedness of
    mind.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus one-pointedness of mind is concentration of mind when
    it is aware of one object, and only one of a wholesome, salutary nature. This is attained
    by the practice of meditation upon one of the subjects recomended for the purpose by the
    Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><strong><i>(e) Practical methods of mental
    cultivation for development of Insight Knowledge, panna.</i></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The subject and methods of meditation as taught in the
    suttas of the Pitaka are designed both for attainment of samadhi as well as for
    development of Insight Knowledge, Vipassana as a direct path to Nibbana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a second step in the practice of meditation, after
    achieving samadhi, when the concentrated mind has become purified, firm and imperturbable,
    the meditator directs and inclines his mind to Insight Knowledge, Vipassana Nana. With
    this Insight Knowledge he discerns the three characteristics of the phenomenal world,
    namely, Impermanence (Anicca), Suffering (Dukkha) and Non-Self (Anatta). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As he advances in his practice and his mind be comes more
    and more purified, firm and imperturbable, he directs and inclines his mind to the
    knowledge of the extinction of moral intoxicants, Asavakkhaya Nana. He then truly
    understands dukkha, the cause of dukkha, the cessation of dukkha and the path leading to
    the cessation of dukkha. He also comes to understand fully the moral intoxicants (asavas)
    as they really are, the cause of asavas, the cessation of asavas and the path leading to
    the cessation of the asavas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With this knowledge of extinction of asavas he becomes
    liberated. The knowledge of liberation arises in him. He knows that rebirth is no more,
    that he has lived the holy life; he has done what he has to do for the realization of
    Magga; there is nothing more for him to do for such realization. The Buddha taught with
    only one object - the extinction of Suffering and release from conditioned existence. That
    object is to be obtained by the practice of meditation (for Calm and Insight) as laid down
    in numerous suttas of the Suttanta Pitaka. </font></p>
