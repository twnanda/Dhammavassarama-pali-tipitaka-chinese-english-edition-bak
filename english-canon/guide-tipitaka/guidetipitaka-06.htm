    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="6">T</font>his collection of discourses in the
    Suttanta pitaka known as Samyutta Nikaya has 7762 suttas of varied length, generally
    short, arranged in a special order according to subject matter into five major divisions:
    (a) Sagatha Vagga, (b) Nidana Vagga, (c) Khandha vagga, (d) Salayatana Vagga and (e) Maha
    vagga. Each major vagga is divided into fifty six groups known as samyuttas &amp;mdash;
    related subjects grouped together. The samyuttas are named after the subjects they deal
    with, for example, Bojjhanga Samyutta on the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, or after some
    principal personalities such as the Venerable Sariputta, King Pasenadi of Kosala, or
    Sakka. Kosala Samyutta is a group of discourses concerning King Pasenadi of Kosala, and
    Devata Samyutta deals with devas like Sakka, Indra, Brahma, etc. Each samyutta is further
    divided into sections which are made up of' individual suttas. Thus the well-known
    Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta is the first discourse (sutta) in the second section of Sacca
    Samyutta which comes under the Mahavagga division of Samyutta Nikaya. In the following
    excerpts from Samyutta Nikaya, only a few suttas representing each major division are
    given. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font COLOR="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(a) Sagatha Vagga
    Samyutta Pali</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This major division of Sagatha Vagga Samyutta Pali
    contains eleven samyuttas with discourses grouped according to characters appearing in
    them, the king of devas, the devas, the Brahma, Mara, King of Kosala, bhikkhus and
    bhikkhunis. The name of the Vagga, Sagatha is derived from the fact that various
    personalities appearing in the discourses conducted their dialogues or interviews with the
    Buddha mostly in verse.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><i>Devata Samyutta</i></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the request of a Brahma, the Buddha explains in the <strong><b>Oghatarana
    Sutta</b></strong> of this samyutta that he crosses over the flood of sensuous desire, of
    existence, of wrong views and of ignorance neither by remaining inactive, nor by making
    strenuous efforts. By remaining inactive he will be sucked into the whirlpool; by making
    frantic efforts he will be swept away in the current of the flood. He follows a middle
    course.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha also teaches in other suttas of this samyutta
    that all beings are entangled in the mesh of attachments brought about by six internal
    sense bases and six external sense objects. The way to escape from these entanglements is
    to become established in sila, to develop Concentration Meditation and Insight Meditation
    in order to be fully accomplished in the higher knowledge of liberation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Until one becomes fully developed in the knowledge of the
    Path, tanha can still give rise to rebirth. This fact is borne out by the story of a deva
    named Samana, given in <b>Acchara Sutta</b>. A certain young men having faith in the
    Teaching of the Buddha gets himself admitted into the Order. Then taking a meditation
    Subject of his choice, he repairs to a solitary abode in the forest and devotes himself
    incessantly to the practice of meditation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">His efforts at meditation are very strenuous. Thus
    striving day and night and getting enervated by lack of sufficient nourishing food, he is
    suddenly seized with a paralytic stroke which causes him instant death. Although he has
    put in a great deal of effort in the practice of meditation, he passes away without even
    attaining the stage of Sotapanna, the Stream-winner.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Because of tanha which he has not yet eradicated, he has
    to go through the round of existences again; but in consequence of the merit he has
    acquired in the practice of meditation, a magnificent celestial palace awaits him in the
    celestial abode of the Tavatimsa.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">By spontaneous manifestation, he appears as if just
    awakened from sleep, at the entrance of the palace, a celestial being resplendent in full
    celestial attire. He does not realize that he has taken a new existence in a new world. He
    thinks he is still a bhikkhu of the human world. The celestial maidens, who are waiting
    his arrival, bring a body-length mirror and place it in front of the deva. On seeing his
    reflection in the mirror, he finally realizes that he has left the bhikkhus existence and
    has risen in the celestial realm.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Samana Deva is greatly perturbed then, he reflects
    that he has taken up meditation not to be reborn in the celestial land but to attain the
    goal of Arahatta Fruition. So without entering the palatial building, he repairs hastily
    to the presence of the Buddha. He asks of the Buddha how to avoid, and proceed past the
    Mohana garden, the Tavatimsa celestial abode, full of celestial maidens who to him appear
    as demons. The Buddha advises him that the straight path for a quick escape is the Noble
    Path of Eight Constituents using the two-wheeler <b>Vipassana</b> carriage, fitted with
    the two wheels of physical exertion and mental exertion. While the Buddha is teaching the
    Dhamma in three verses, Samana Deva, is able to develop quickly successive <b>Vipassana
    Nana</b> step by step until he attains the first Path and fruition.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><i>Devaputta Samyutta</i> </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In <b>Rohitassa Sutta</b> of this samyutta, Rohitassa Deva
    comes to the Buddha with another problem. He tells the Buddha that he was in a former
    existence a hermit endowed with supernormal psychic power which enabled him to traverse
    throughout the universe with immense speed. He had travelled with that speed for over one
    hundred years to reach the end of the world but he did not succeed. He wants to know
    whether it would be possible to know or see or reach the end of the world where there is
    no birth nor death by travelling there. The Buddha says he does not declare that there is
    a world's end where there is no birth nor death to be known or seen or reached by
    travelling there. Yet he does not say that there is an ending of suffering without
    reaching Nibbana. It is in the fathom long body of oneself with its perception and its
    mind that the Buddha describes the world, the origin of the world, the cessation of the
    world and the way leading to the cessation of the world. The Buddha's way leading to the
    cessation of the world is the Noble Path of Eight Constituents. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><i>Kosala Samyutta</i></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this samyutta are interesting suttas which describe
    frequent meetings of the Buddha with King Pasenadi of Kosala. The king has heard of the
    fame of the Buddha from his queen Mallika but has not yet met him. But when at last he
    meets the Buddha as described in the <b>Dahara Sutta</b>, he puts a direct question
    whether the Venerable Gotama claims to have attained the Supreme Enlightenment. He says
    that there are other religious teachers such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Nigantha
    Nataputta, Sancaya, Pakudha and Ajita, with their own order, with their own followers, who
    are much older than the Buddha and are generally regarded to be Arahats. Even these
    teachers do not make claim to Supreme Enlightenment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha replies that if it can be rightly said of
    anyone to have attained the Supreme Enlightenment; then it is only of himself that it can
    rightly be said. The Buddha adds that there are four things that should not be looked down
    upon and, despised because they are young. They are a young prince, a serpent, a fire and
    a bhikkhu. A young prince of noble parentage should not be despised. He might one day
    become a powerful ruler and wreak royal vengeance. A writhing snake moves very fast; it
    might attack and bite a heedless man. A small fire, when heedlessly ignored might grow in
    intensity and cause untold damage. A man treating a virtuous bhikkhu with contempt might
    bring upon himself unwholesome results such as dwindling prosperity and lack of off spring
    to inherit from him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Dutiya Aputtaka Sutta</b> describes another occasion
    when King Pasenadi calls on the Buddha after he has just taken over an immense
    accumulation of wealth belonging to a multi-millionaire who has died recently. The dead
    man has left behind treasure worth over one hundred lakhs which, in the absence of any
    heirs to claim, becomes the king's property. The king reports that the dead millionaire
    was a great miser, a niggardly person, begrudging even to himself the luxury of
    comfortable living. He wore only very rough, thread-bare clothes, eating poor, coarse food
    and travelled about in an old, roofless rickety carriage.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha confirms that what the king says about the
    millionaire is quite true and tells the king the reason for the millionaire's miserliness.
    In one of his past existences, he met a Paccekabuddha going round for alms-food. He gave
    permission to his family to offer food to the Paccekabuddha and went out to attend to some
    business. On his way back, he met the Paccekabuddha whom he asked whether he had been
    given any alms-food by his, family, and looked into the bowl. On seeing the delicious food
    in the bowl, an unwholesome thought suddenly arose in his mind that it would have been
    more profitable to feed his servants with such food than to give it away to a
    Paccekabuddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For his good deed of allowing his family to make the
    offering to a Paccekabuddha he was reborn in the deva world seven times and, became a
    millionaire seven times in the Human world. But as a result of the ill thought he had
    entertained in that previous existence he never had the inclination to live a luxurious
    life enjoying fine clothes, good food, and riding in comfortable carriages.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The millionaire has now exhausted the good as well as the
    bad effects of his thoughts and actions with regard to the offering of food to the
    Paccekabuddha. But unfortunately he has to face the consequences of a more serious evil
    deed, that of causing the death of his own nephew in a pest existence.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha tells the king that he is therefore reborn,
    after his death in the human world, in the state of the most intense suffering,
    Maharoruva.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em><b>Brahmana Samyutta</b></em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many brahmins of' Bharadvaja clan become devoted disciples
    of the Buddha, ultimately attaining Arahatship. At first, all of them are quite
    unfriendly, if not openly hostile. Bharadvaja Gotta, mentioned in <b>Dhananjani Sutta</b>,
    is such a brahmin. Although his wife Dhananjani is a disciple of the Buddha, very much
    devoted to his Teaching, Bharadvaja Gotta and his brahmin teachers show great contempt for
    the Buddha and his Teaching. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On one occasion when Bharadvaja is giving a feast to his
    brahmin teachers, his wife while in the course of waiting upon these brahmins slips
    accidentally and, as she tries to regain her balance, blurts out three times in excitement
    the formula of adoration to the Buddha: 'Nammo Tassa Bhagavato Arahato Sammasambuddhassa'.
    Upon hearing the word 'Buddha', the brahmin teachers rise up from their seats and run away
    helter-skelter in all directions just like a flock of crows in whose midst a stone has
    been thrown.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Telling his wife in a fury that he would defeat the Buddha
    in a contest of doctrines, Bharadvaja goes to see the Buddha. The interview ends up with
    Bharadvaja asking the Buddha's permission to enter his Order. He finally attains to
    Arahatship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Akkosa Sutta</b> mentions about Bharadvaja Gotta's
    younger brother Akkosaka Bharadvaja, who on hearing that his elder brother has joined the
    Buddha's Order is highly exasperated. Raging with fury, he storms into the presence of the
    Buddha whom he reviles and reproaches in the most vulgar, offensive, obscene, foul
    language.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Very calmly and with great compassion the Buddha asks the
    young Bharadvaja if he ever has given gifts to friends and relatives. When the young
    Bharadvaja replies that he indeed has made offers of gifts to his friends and relatives,
    the Buddha asks him, &quot;What happens to the gifts if your friends and relatives do not
    accept them?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Well then they remain with me as my own property,'
    replies Bharadvaja. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the Buddha says, <i>&quot;You have heaped abusive
    language on us who have not uttered a single word of abuse to you; you have been very
    offensive and quarrel some with us who do not offend you nor quarrel with you. Young
    Bharadvaja, we do not accept your words of abuse, your offensive and quarrelsome language.
    They remain with you as your own property.&quot;</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Taken by surprise by this unexpected reaction, Bharadvaja
    is frightened with the thought that this might be a recluse's method of casting a spell on
    him by way of retaliation. He asks the Buddha if he is angry with him for his rude
    behaviour. The Buddha states that he has long left anger behind. Being free from all
    mental defilements how could he take offence with him! To meet anger with anger is to sink
    lower than the original reviler. He is the conqueror who wins a hard won battle by not
    retaliating anger with anger.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the end of the discourse, Akkosaka Bharadvaja, the
    younger brother, also leaves homelife to join the Buddha's Order. In time, he too becomes
    accomplished in higher knowledge and attains to Arahatship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In <b>Kasi Bharadvaja Sutta</b> is an account of the
    Buddha's encounter with the brahmin Kasi Bharadvaja who is a rich landowner.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is sowing time and Kasi Bharadvaja is preparing to
    start ploughing operations with five hundred ploughs. It is made an auspicious occasion
    with distribution of food and with festivities. The Buddha goes to where food is being
    distributed and stands at one side. Kasi Bharadvaja, seeing him waiting for food, says to
    him, &quot;I plough, samana, and I sow. Having ploughed and sown, I eat. You too, samana,
    should plough and sow ; having ploughed and sown, you shall eat.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha replies, &quot;I too plough, brahmin, and I
    sow, and having ploughed and sown, I eat.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;We see no yoke or plough or pole or oxen of yours.
    Yet you claim to be a ploughman. How do you explain yourself?&quot; asks the brahmin.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;The faith which I have had since the time of
    Sumedha, the hermit, is the seed. It will grow to bear the fruit of Nibbana. The sila with
    which I keep control of the sense doors is the rain. The two kinds of knowledge, mundane
    and supramundane, I possess are my plough and yoke. Sense of shame for doing evil and fear
    of evil deeds are the pole and the handle of the plough. My energy is the ox, and my
    concentration is the rope with which I put the ox to the yoke. My mindfulness is the
    ploughshare and the goad. Guarded in my speech and modest in the use of food, these
    self-restraints serve as a fence round my field of Dhamma. With my harnessed ox as my
    energy, I have ploughed on, never turning back until the seed produces the fruit of
    Nibbana, the Deathless. Having done such ploughing, I eat now what I have sown and I am
    free from every kind of suffering.&quot; </i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kasi Bharadvaja is so delighted and impressed with the
    Buddha's words that he requests to be regarded as a disciple of the Buddha from that day
    till the end of his life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In<b> Gahatthavandana Sutta</b> the Buddha explains that
    the brahmins well versed in the Vedas as well as kings ruling over human dominions, and
    devas of Catumaharajika and Tavatimsa realm bow in homage to the Sakka, the king of devas.
    The Sakka himself shows respect and makes obeisance not only to samanas who have lived
    their holy life without any breach of moral conduct for many years but also to the lay
    disciples of the Buddha who are well established in their faith and who have done
    meritorious deeds of giving charity, observing the Five, the Eight or the Ten Precepts,
    and dutifully maintaining their families.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font COLOR="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(b) Nidana Vagga
    Samyutta Pali </b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This second major division of Nidana Vagga Samyutta Pali
    contains ten samyuttas, all dealing with fundamental aspects of the doctrine. The
    discourses are chiefly concerned with the principles of conditionality and
    interdependence, explained in the detailed formula which is called 'Paticcasamuppada',
    Conditioned Genesis or Dependent Origination, consisting of twelve factors&amp;.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Various aspects of Paticcasamuppada, together with
    expositions on doctrinal matters concerning practice of the holy life form the main theme
    of early suttas in these samyuttas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><i>Nidana Samyutta</i></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In <b>Paticcasmuppada Sutta</b>, the first sutta of this
    samyutta, the law of Dependent Origination outlined in the form of a formula is briefly
    explained by the Buddha to five hundred bhikkhus who are perceived by the Buddha to be
    sufficiently developed and ripe for the attainment to Arahatship. In the<b> Vibhanga Sutta</b>,
    the second sutta of this samyutta, the law of Dependent Origination is explained in fuller
    detail to the same bhikkhus.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In <b>Pancaverabhaya Sutta</b>, the Buddha lays down the
    criteria by which the status of attainment of a noble bhikkhu may be judged. If a bhikkhu
    is freed of the five dangers arising from five evil deeds, namely, killing, stealing,
    sexual misconduct, telling lies and taking intoxicating liquor and drugs; if he is
    established in the four accomplishments of a Sotapanna, namely, firm faith and confidence
    in the virtues and attributes of the Buddha, of the Dhammas and of the Samgha, and perfect
    purity in sila; and if he possesses comprehensive analytical knowledge of the law of
    Dependent Origination, he is assured of a happy future, with no danger of arising in
    states of woe and misery and is certain of further advancement in the holy life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In <b>Puttamamsupama Sutta</b>, it is explained that four
    nutriments, ahara, are 'conditions' necessary for the existence and continuity of beings:
    (i) ordinary material food (kabalikarahara), (ii) contact of sense organs (phassa) with
    sense objects, (iii) consciousness (vinnana), and (iv) mental volitional or will
    (manosancetana).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This sutta is addressed especially to young bhikkhus
    recently admitted into the Order. They are enjoined to take their meals with due
    reflection on the loathsome nature of food so as not to be overcome by greed and
    attachment for it. A bhikkhu should take meals not with a view to enjoy it or relish it,
    thereby augmenting craving, but just to sustain himself in order that the holy life may be
    lived. A particularly illuminating parable is used here by the Buddha: A man and his wife
    set out on a very long journey accompanied by their beloved son. Half-way on their journey
    they ran short of food. With no means of fresh supply, they plodded on with starvation
    staring in their face. The little son soon succumbed to hunger and died. The man and his
    wife decided to save their lives by eating the flesh of their dead son. They ate with no
    relish nor enjoyment but only to sustain themselves for the rest of the journey.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Other apt parables are given by the Buddha for the
    understanding of the remaining three nutriments. When one understands the real ,nature of
    nutriments on which life depends, one understands the craving, tanha, responsible for all
    the suffering. Thereby the way is open to the supreme liberation, the Arahatship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Susima Paribbajaka Sutta</b> gives an account of the
    wandering ascetic Susima who is one of those who join the Buddha's Order with ulterior
    motives. After the rains residence many bhikkhus come to pay their respect to the Buddha
    to whom they report their attainment of Arahatship. When he learns from these Arahats that
    they possess no supernormal powers such as the Divine Power of Vision, Divine Power of
    Hearing, or Knowing Other People's mind, he is very disappointed. He has come into the
    Order just to acquire such powers with which to win fame and gain for himself.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He approaches the Buddha and inquires how the bhikkhus
    could claim Arahatship when they possess no supernormal powers. The Buddha explains to him
    that their liberation is through pure Insight knowledge, not associated with jhana
    accomplishments. Through <b>Vipassana</b> meditation only they have seen the real nature
    of <b>nama</b> and <b>rupa</b> and realities of nature, Dhammatthiti) followed by
    realization of Nibbana through Magga Nana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha takes him through the same course of
    meditation, testing by means of questions his understanding of the five <b>khandhas</b>,
    their real nature of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, insubstantiality, finally
    establishing in him the insight that none of these <b>khandhas</b> is to be regarded as,
    &quot;This is mine; this is I; this is myself&quot;. At the end of the discourse he gains
    full understanding of the Dhamma with the attainment of Arahatship. When he realizes
    Arahatship himself without coming into possession of the supernormal powers, he confesses
    to the Buddha the ulterior motive with which he had first joined the Order, and begs to be
    pardoned for such evil intentions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><em><i>Dhatu Samyutta</i></em></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The natural law of affinity is pointed out by the Buddha
    in the <b>Cankama Sutta</b> of this samyutta while he is staying at the Gijjhakuka Hill
    near Rajagaha. He draws the attention of the bhikkhus to the scene outside, where his
    senior disciples are taking a stroll attended upon by their own group of followers. He
    says:&quot;Bhikkhus, those many bhikkhus under the leadership of the Venerable Sariputta
    are all wise being endowed with much deep knowledge of the Dhamma. Those surrounding the
    Venerable Maha Moggallana are well accomplished in supernormal powers. The Venerable
    Mahakassapa and his followers are strict observers of <b>Dhutanga</b> austerity practices.
    The bhikkhus led by the Venerable Anuruddha are fully endowed with the Divine Power of
    Vision. The Venerable Punna and his disciples are adepts at teaching the Dhamma. The
    Venerable Upali with his followers are experts in Vinaya rules of discipline and the
    bhikkhus under Ananda's guidance are noted for their knowledge in many fields. Devadatta
    and his many followers are distinguished by their evil ways, thoughts and desires.
    Bhikkhus, in this way are beings grouped together in accordance with their natural bents
    and tendencies. The law of affinity works in such a way that kindred spirits flock
    together, those of evil disposition in one group, those of wholesome inclinations in
    another. This law of affinity has held true in the past, as it is true now and will be
    true in the future.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><em><i>Anamatagga Samyutta</i> </em></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the various suttas of this samyutta, the Buddha teaches
    that the cycle of existence, the samsara, represents the continuous arising and passing
    away of <b>khandhas,</b> <b>Ayatanas</b> and dhatus. This incessant process of evolution
    and dissolution of dhatus (the fundamental elements of matter and mind) and khandhas
    (compounded of the dhatus) is endless. Blinded by <b>avijja, </b>ignorance, and by
    nivaranas, hindrances, and fettered by tanha, craving, beings have been passing from one
    existence to another round and round the cycle of <b>samsara</b>, for immeasurable periods
    of time. To bring home this fact of intensity of suffering undergone by beings, the Buddha
    has given many similes in this samyutta, most illustrative of which are those of the four
    oceans and the Vepulla Mountain given in the <b>Assu Sutta</b>. The tears shed through the
    ages by each being on account of suffering due to disease, death, separation from the
    loved ones, association with the unloved ones would fill the four oceans to the brim. The
    bones left behind by a being after death in each existence, if collected together at a
    certain place and preserved from loss and decay, would be as high as the Vepulla Mountain
    which lies north of the Gijjhakuta Hill.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The only way to escape from this round of endless
    suffering is to perceive the real nature of the <b>khandhas</b> by means of <b>Vipassana</b>meditation
    until one becomes disenchanted with them; and thus by abandoning craving for and
    attachment to them one attains liberation through realization of Nibbana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha teaches in other suttas that one should in the
    meanwhile develop loving-kindness towards all sentient beings with the realization that,
    during the immeasurably long passage through the samsara, there is no being who has not
    been one's mother, father, sister, brother or one's son or daughter, relative or friend.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><em><i>Kassapa samyutta</i></em></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the <b>Candupama Sutta</b> of this samyutta, the Buddha
    lays down codes of conduct for bhikkhus, giving the example of the moon. Just as the moon
    sheds its light equally on every object or person so also a bhikkhu should equally treat
    everyone, young or old or of middle age, showing favouritism to none, nor hostility to
    any. He must deal with them with due retard, humility and meekness. Mindfulness should be
    ever present in his relations with all classes of people. For example, when a certain
    person tries to obtain his drinking water from an old well or from a riverbank of loose
    sand or from down a precipice, he approaches the source of water with great care,
    controlling his movements and actions. Much in the same way should a bhikkhu conduct
    himself with great mindfulness in his dealings with all classes of people.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In teaching the Dhamma to lay disciples, if his motive is
    to win gain and fame for himself, then his teaching should be regarded as impure. The
    Dhamma should always be taught only out of compassion and with pure thought so that the
    Dhamma which is excellent in the beginning, excellent in the middle and excellent in the
    ending, namely, the Dhamma on <b>sila,</b> <b>samadhi</b> and <b>Panna</b>, could be
    heard, understood and practised by the listener.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the<b> Saddhammappatirupaka Sutta</b>, the Buddha
    outlines the conditions under which the Teaching would decline or under which it would
    prosper. The Buddha gives the discourse in answer to a question asked by the Venerable
    Mahakassapa why it is that in former days when there were only a few disciplinary rules
    promulgated by the Buddha, there were a large number of Arahats; now that the disciplinary
    rules have multipled, only a few attain to Arahatship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha explains that the number of disciplinary rules
    increases in proportion to the deterioration in the moral state of beings. So long as no
    spurious and false teaching appears in the three branches of the Teaching (pariyatti,
    theoretical learning; patipatti, practice; pativedha, fruits of the practice), so long
    will the Teaching remain genuine, pure, and untarnished. But when spurious and false
    teaching appears, this Teaching with its three branches will decline gradually until it
    vanishes altogether, much in the same way as genuine gold disappears when imitation gold
    is introduced to take its place. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha concludes : &quot;And Kassapa, just as iron is
    destroyed by rust, it is the members of the Order who are corrupt, immoral, who cannot
    hope to attain higher knowledge, who will bring about the downfall of the Teaching.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the last few suttas of Nidana Vagga are discourses that
    describe the fearful destiny of corrupt bhikkhus and bhikkhunis and those lay people who
    have done evil deeds in previous lives. The Venerable Maha Moggallana sees them suffering
    intensely in the Peta world and describes their conditions vividly. The Buddha confirms
    what the Venerable Moggallana has recounted.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font COLOR="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(c) Khandha Vaggo
    Samyutta Pali</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The main theme of most suttas in this division is, as the
    name implies, khandhas, the five aggregates that constitute what is regarded as a being.
    Each of the components of these aggregates, namely, matter, sensation, perception, mental
    concomitants and consciousness is shown to be a bundle of dukkha, suffering. Made up of
    thirteen samyuttas, Khandha Vagga forms an important collection of doctrinal discussions
    on such topics as <b>atta, anatta,</b> eternity, and annihilation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <b>Nakulapitu Sutta</b> gives an account of the advice
    given to Nakulapita, an ageing disciple of the Buddha. He asks for advice from the Buddha
    on how to conduct and keep himself free from the pains of old age and disease. The Buddha
    explains that rupakkhandha, the material body being a bundle of dukkha, is subjected
    constantly to the pains of old age and disease; but the mental complex could be kept free
    of agony and pain by keeping it undefiled with impurities. A more detailed exposition of
    this brief explanation of the Buddha is given to Nekulapita by the Venerable Sariputta.
    The uninstructed common worldling clings to the five aggregates through craving and
    conceit, and holds the wrong view that each of the aggregates (Rupa, Vedana, sanna,
    sankhara and vinnana) is self, atta. Even as he clings to the five aggregates as <b>atta</b>
    these aggregates manifest their own oppressive characters by inflicting pain of old age,
    pain of disease, pain of defilements (kilesa). Because of these oppressive pains, the
    uninstructed common worldling is subjected to sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and
    despair. But when the worldling be comes instructed and has become accomplished in the
    Thirty Seven Factors of Enlightenment, he does not cling to the five aggregates through
    craving, conceit or holding wrong views of self. Then even though the five aggregates
    manifest their own characteristics of being oppressive, he is no longer subjected to
    mental afflictions of sorrow, lamentations, pain, grief and despair.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the <b>Bhara Sutta</b>, the five groups of grasping
    (Pancupadanakkhandha) are designated as a burden, a heavy load. It is craving for sense
    objects, craving for existence, craving for non-existence which is responsible for this
    heavy burden being borne along. Realization of the Noble Truth of Cessation, Nibbana, is
    where the craving is completely eradicated, where this heavy load is finally discarded.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <b>Yamaka Sutta</b> explains that the five aggregates
    are of an impermnent nature; they should be looked upon as one's enemies. Understanding
    their real nature of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, insubstantiality, the twenty kinds
    of wrong views of self should be discarded so that one may not be set upon by these
    enemies.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <b>Vakkali Sutta</b> gives an account of the Buddha's
    visit to the ailing Bhikkhu Vekkali upon his request, The great compassion of the Buddha
    becomes manliest in this account. When Vakkali informs the Buddha that for a long time he
    has been longing to set his eyes upon the Buddha, the Buddha gently reproaches him: <i>'Vakkali,
    what is there in seeing the decomposing body of mine? It is enough to see the Dhamma. He
    who has seen the Dhamma has seen me. This body of mine is like all else - always rotting
    away, falling into decay.&quot;</i> Then the Buddha teaches him the dhamma on the
    inpermanence of all things, their unsatisfactoriness and insubstantiality and finally
    shows him the way to liberation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of all the five aggregates, the Buddha says it is better
    for a person to mistake his physical body as atta, self, rather than mind or
    consciousness, because the physical body appears more solid and substantial than thought
    or mind which constantly changes faster than the physical body.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <b>Khemaka Sutta</b> records an illuminating
    conversation between a bhikkhu named Khemaka and a group of bhikkhus who want to verify
    the stage of his attainments. When the bhikkhus ask him if he sees self or anything
    pertaining to self in the five aggregates, Khemaka replies &quot;No.&quot; But when the
    bhikkhus suggest that, if so, he must be an Arahat free from defilements, Khemaka replies
    that though he does not find self or anything pertaining to self in the five <b>khandhas</b>,
    he is not an Arahat free of taints. He still has a vague feeling &quot;I am&quot; although
    he does not clearly see &quot;This is I&quot; with respect to matter, sensation,
    perception, mental formations or consciousness.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">His vague feeling is likened to the smell of a flower. It
    is neither the smell of the petals, nor of the colour, nor of the pollen, but the smell of
    the flower. He then goes on to explain that even if a person retains the feeling &quot;I
    am&quot; at the early stages of realization, as he progresses further and attains to
    higher stages, this feeling of &quot;I am&quot; disappears altogether, just as the smell
    of soap lingers in a freshly washed cloth and disappears after a time when it is kept in a
    box.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the <b>Puppha Sutta</b>, the Buddha declares that he is
    not quarrelling or arguing with the world; it is only the world with its devas, maras,
    kings and people that is disputing with him. To proclaim the truth is not engaging in
    disputes. He speaks only what wise men hold to be true. Wise men say that there is no
    corporeality, sensation, perception, mental formations or consciousness which is stable,
    permanent, enduring. He says the same. Wise man say that there is only corporeality,
    sensation, perception, mental formations or consciousness which is unstable, impermanent,
    unenduring. He also says so.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;In this changing world, there are only things
    which are subject to constant change and decay. Perceiving their their real nature, I
    declare that the world is compounded of things subject to decay and decomposition, namely,
    the aggregates of matter, sensation, perception, mental formations and consciousness,
    which are incessantly rising and passing away. There is nothing else besides these
    perishing aggregates. Bhikkhus, I teach this dhamma in a brief manner. I also teach this
    dhamma more comprehensively and completely. But if the uninstructed common worldling
    remains unperceiving and unknowing in spite of very enlightening discourses, how can I
    help? Bhikkhus, various kinds of lotus grow in water, develop in water, rise above water,
    and remain there unpolluted by water; so also I was born in this world, I grew up in this
    world, I developed in this world and rose high above it without being attached to it,
    without being affected by it&quot;. </i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the <b>Phenapindupama Sutta</b>, the aggregate of <b>rupa</b>
    is likened to froth; it is unstable, impermanent, constantly rising, and vanishing. It is
    therefore not self. The aggregate of Vedana is likened to an air bubble. The various
    sensations are just like bubbles, disappearing fast, impermanent, untrustworthy, of the
    nature of anicca, dukkha and anatta. Sense perception which apprehends whatever is seen,
    heard, smelt, tasted, touched or known, is likened to a mirage. What is considered by a
    samana as a being, a man, a woman or self is an optical illusion like a mirage. In
    reality, it is merely a phenomenon of incessant arising and vanishing. Sankhara,
    volitional activities, are likened to plantain trunks. A plantain trunk is made up of
    layers of fibrous materiel with no substantial, solid inner core. Sankhara is like the
    plantainn trunk void of inner substance. Consciousness is like a conjuror's trick. It
    arises and vanishes instantly. Consciousness arises not as one wishes, but as conditioned
    by its own cause and circumstance.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font COLOR="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(d) Salayatana Vagga
    Samyutta Pali</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This division is made up of ten samyuttas or groups. It
    deals mainly with the six sense organs or bases of contact named internal sense bases
    (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind), six corresponding sense objects, known as
    external sense bases (visible form, sound, odour, taste, tangible things and
    mind-objects), and consciousness that arises in relation to each pair of these internal
    and external sense bases. There are expositions on the impermanent nature of these sense
    bases and how relinquishing of attachment to them results in liberation. The sensation
    arising from coming together of the sense bases and consciousness is shown to be of three
    kinds: pleasant, unpleasant, indifferent, none of which is permanent; each one of these is
    the cause of craving which in turn is the root of all suffering. Concise but illuminating
    expositions on Nibbana are found in many suttas. So also are there practical guides for
    Vipassana meditation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the very first two suttas, the Buddha explains that the
    six internal sense bases and six external sense bases have the nature of impermanence;
    being impermanent, they are really suffering and not self. <i>&quot;Bhikkhus, realizing
    their true nature, you should not regard these twelve sense bases as 'This is mine', 'This
    is I', 'This is myself'. Contemplate on them steadfastly, constantly, until Vipassana
    Insight into their real nature arises.&quot;</i> The Buddha continues to explain that
    insight into the true nature of the twelve ayatanas will develop dispassion and
    disenchantment for them. Being disenchanted with them, there is no craving, clinging,
    thereby achieving the Path and Fruition.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the famous <b>Aditta Sutta</b>, the fire sermon,
    delivered at Gayasisa to one thousand ascetics formerly devoted to fire-worship but
    recently converted and admitted into the Order as bhikkhus, the Buddha explains that each
    of the six sense bases and the six sense objects is burning; each is burning, with the
    fire of lust, with the fire of hate, with the fire of ignorance. Each is burning with the
    fire of birth, ageing and death; with the fire of sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and
    despair. Six forms of consciousness arising in relation to the six sense bases are also
    burning; the six contacts and the six sensations resulting from them are also burning.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha explains further that when a bhikkhu who has
    practised the dhamma develops Vipassana Insight and perceives that each of the bases is
    burning, he becomes disenchanted with it. Then craving fades away. With the fading of
    craving, he is liberated. And when liberated, there is knowledge that he is liberated. At
    the end of the discourse, one thousand former worshippers of fire attained Arahatship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the<b> Pathama Migajala Sutta</b>, the Buddh's
    definition of a bhikkhu who lives in solitude is very edifying. When a bhikkhu unmindfully
    takes delight in the six sense objects, regards them wrongly as 'This is mine', 'This is
    I', 'This is my self', craving for them arises in him and he becomes attached to fetters.
    Such a bhikkhu in whom craving has arisen is regarded as one living with a companion, even
    if he lives alone deep in a forest away from towns and villages. When, however, he
    mindfully perceives the true nature of the six sense bases and objects, he does not
    wrongly hold on to them as 'This is mine', 'This is I', 'This is my self' and craving for
    them does not arise in him. Such a bhikkhu in whom craving has not arisen is said to be
    living in solitude without a companion even if he lives in the midst of people, in towns
    or villages.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The<b> Punna Sutta</b> gives an account of a bhikkhu by
    the name of Punna who asks for instruction from the Buddha on a suitable subject on which
    he can meditate in solitude. The Buddha advises him to contemplate on the true nature of
    the six sense bases and objects. When he perceives their true nature, no craving for them
    will arise in him. Eradication of craving will result in liberation and attainment of
    Arahatship. After receiving the instruction, the bhikkhu informs the Buddha of his
    intention to reside in a very distant and remote land. The Buddha tells him that it is a
    wild country inhabited by savage tribes, and asks him how he intends to cope with the
    dangers and hazards that would face him. The answer given by the bhikkhu provides a model
    lesson in fortitude and endurance.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The bhikkhu says, if he were menaced with invectives and
    curses or attacked physically, or if he had stones thrown at him or if he were hit with
    sticks or cut with swords, or pierced with spears, he would bear them with endurance with
    no malice against the savage tribes. Even if his head were to be chopped off he would feel
    he was luckier then those noble ones who had to commit suicide to be released from the
    sufferings of the <b>khandhas.</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha remarks, &quot;Well said, bhikkhu, well said. I
    believe you are qualified to lead a solitary life in that wild country. You will overcome
    all difficulties.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As presaged by the Buddha, the bhikkhu is able to overcome
    all hostilities and difficulties in his new residence, and to convert five hundred men and
    five hundred women so that they come to take refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the
    Samgha. And during the very first vassa residence, practising the meditation as instructed
    by the Buddha, the Bhikkhu Punna attains Arahatship, fully accomplished in the the vijjas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the <b>Bharadvaja Sutta</b>, an interesting interview
    between King Udena and the Venerable Pindola Bharadvaja is described. King Udena
    approaches the Venerable Pindola Bharadvaja while he is meditating at the foot of a tree
    in the king's park. The king remarks that many young men have abandoned sensual pleasures
    and led the holy life. They maintain the holy practice throughout their life. The king
    enquires, &quot;What is the means by which they maintain the purity of their holy
    life?&quot; The bhikkhu replies that they keep to the pure life by training themselves as
    instructed by the Buddha to regard a woman of their mother's age as their mother, a woman
    of their sister's age as their sister, and a girl of their daughter's age as their
    daughter.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The king is not satisfied with the answer. He argues that
    even if a bhikkhu trains himself in the said manner, it is no guarantee for the
    non-arising of impure thoughts in him in connection with a female person. The Venerable
    Pindola Bharadvaja explains further they practise meditation on the foulness of a body by
    contemplating on the thirty two constituent parts of the body. The king is still not
    convinced; he maintains that, for older bhikkhus with more mature experience, who are well
    established in mindfulness and concentration, contemplation on the thirty two constituent
    parts of the body might prove to be salutary; but this type of meditation for younger
    bhikkhus might have an adverse effect, exciting lust and passion instead of aversion for
    the human body. Only when the Venerable Pindola Bharadvaja tells him that the bhikkhus
    practise restraint of the six faculties keeping a close watch on the doors of the six
    senses that the king agrees that purity of the holy life is possible under such
    circumstances.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the<b> Pathama Dirukkhandhopama Sutta</b>, the
    discourse given by the Buddha on the bank of the River Ganges at Kosambi, the Buddha uses
    the simile of a log floating down the river. He says that if the log does not get stranded
    on either of the two banks, nor sinks in the middle of the river, nor gets salvaged and
    deposited on the bank by some one, nor is retrieved by men or devas, nor sucked in by a
    whirlpool, and if it does not get decomposed on the way, it will be carried by the current
    till its destination, the ocean, is reached.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this simile, the near bank means the six internal sense
    bases; the far bank represents the six external sense objects; sinking in the mid river
    means getting immersed in sensuous desires; being salvaged and deposited on a bank means
    being hindered by one's own conceit; being retrieved by men means doing some services or
    running errands for men; being retrieved by devas means practising the holy life with the
    deva realm as one's objective; being sucked in a whirlpool means wallowing in sensual
    pleasures; getting decomposed on the way means becoming corrupt, immoral, heedless of the
    disciplinary rules. If a bhikkhu manages to steer him self clear of all these obstacles,
    he will be carried along by the current of Right View till he reaches his destination,
    Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the <b>Chappanakopama Sutta</b>, the Buddha teaches
    that a bhikkhu practising the holy life must exercise control of his sense faculties. The
    six sense faculties may be likened to six animals, namely, a snake, a crocodile, a giant
    bird, a dog, a jackal and a monkey. Suppose each animal is bound by a rope and the ropes
    are tied together into a single knot. When they are left in this state, each animal will
    try to get to its own habitat, the snake to its underground hole, the crocodile to the
    river, etc. In this way they will pull and struggle against one another until they become
    exhausted and are dragged along by the strongest of them. The mind of a bhikkhu with
    unrestrained sense faculties will be impelled by the senses towards corresponding sense
    objects. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But suppose each animal is bound by a separate rope which
    is fastened to a pole firmly planted in the ground each animal will make furious attempts
    to return to its home and becoming exhausted finally will stand, sit, curl or lie down
    quietly near the post. Similarly by practising contemplation of the body, Kayagatasati,
    the sense faculties are placed well under control. Mindfulness of the body serves as the
    firm post to which each of the faculties is tied down. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Dukkarapanha Sutta </b>states that in the Teaching of
    the Buddha, it is difficult first to become a member of the Order as a novice and as a
    bhikkhu. Secondly, it is difficult to be happy and comfortable in the Order with its
    disciplinary rules. Thirdly, even if one stays the course and remains in the Order, it is
    difficult for one to practise concentration meditation and Vipassana meditation to attain
    to higher stages of knowledge. When fully endowed with supporting paramis (perfections), a
    bhikkhu who gets instruction in the morning and starts practising meditation in the
    morning may be fully liberated by the evening; if he gets instruction in the evening and
    starts practising meditation in the evening he may be fully liberated by the morning. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A wealthy householder by the name of Citta figures quite
    prominently in some of the suttas of this division. In <b>Nigantha Nataputta Sutta</b>,
    Nigantha Nataputta finds himself unable to accept the view expressed by the Buddha that
    there is jhana and samadhi free from vitakka and vicara. He discusses this problem with
    Citta, the wealthy householder, who is an Ariya disciple of the Buddha. Citta tells him:
    &quot;I believe there is jhana and samadhi free from vitakka and vicara, not because of my
    faith in the Buddha but because of my own achievement and realization.&quot; Citta
    explains that he has personally experienced jhana samadhi unaccompanied by vitakka and
    vicara and has no need to rely on others for believing this.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The same Citta used to have in his younger days a close
    friend who later become the naked ascetic Kassapa. Each has gone his own separate way and
    the two friends meet again only after thirty years. Citta asks his friend whether by
    living the ascetic life he has gained any thing more than what could be achieved by the
    wholesome dhamma of ordinary people. The ascetic Kassapa admits that he has nothing to
    show besides his nakedness, his shaven head and accumulation of dust on his body.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When asked in return he himself has gained by being a
    disciple of the buddha and following the Path as instructed by his Teacher, Citta informs
    him that he has become fully accomplished in the four jhanas, and having removed the five
    fetters, is now an anagami, a Non-returner. The naked ascetic, impressed by his
    achievements, tells Citta that he wants to be a disciple of the Buddha. Citta introduces
    him to the leading bhikkhus and helps him to get admission into the Order.With the
    guidance of the theras and encouragement of his friend Citta, the ex-ascetic Kassapa puts
    in such an effort in the practice of meditation that in no time he gains the supreme goal
    of Arahatship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the <b>Sankhadhama Sutta</b>, the Buddha points out the
    wrong views held by Nigantha Nataputta on kamma and its resultant effects. According to
    the village headman Asibandhakaputta, his Teacher Nigantha Nataputta teaches that every
    one who commits evil deeds of killing, lying, etc. is definitely bound to be reborn in
    states of woe. Whatever action is performed in a greater frequency, that action tends to
    determine the destiny of a being. The Buddha points out the fallacy in the two statements,
    one contradicting the other. An individual does not often commit the evil deed, for in
    stance, of killing. Other actions besides killing are performed by him in a more frequent
    manner; hence, according to Nigantha Nataputta, he will not be destined to states of woe
    for his evil act of killing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the Buddha explains that only very heinous acts such
    as killing of one's own parents, creating a schism in the Samgha, etc. bring the dire
    resultant effect of certain destiny in the states of woe. Other misdeeds, physical, vocal
    or mental, cannot be regarded as to lead with certainty to unhappy destinations. In stead
    of just feeling remorseful and penitent over one's particular evil deed, one should
    recognize it to be evil, and resolve not to repeat a similar unwholesome action, and
    follow it with the practice of concentration and Vipassana meditation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus abandoning all evil deeds and doing only wholesome
    deeds together with development of Brahmavihara Bhavana till accomplished in jhana, one
    can escape from the unhappy consequences of one's evil actions and look forward to a
    better future. This Sankhadhama Sutta establishes the fact that as in matter of practice
    so also in the matters of views, the Buddha takes the Middle Path. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the <b>Bhadraka Sutta</b>, the Buddha explains the
    origin of suffering by giving illuminating examples. The village headman Bhadraka wants to
    know the cause of suffering that afflicts mankind. In reply, the Buddha asks him to think
    of his son and imagine that his son is meeting with unexpected misfortunes, or getting
    arrested by the king's order or facing a severe punishment. Bhadraka imagines as he is
    told and finds that such thoughts give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, grief
    and despair in him. When he imagines a stranger to be placed in a similar situation,
    facing similar predicament, he finds that he is not troubled at all with any mental agony.
    He explains to the Buddha that the difference in his mental reaction to the two situations
    lies in the fact that he loves his son with a parent's love and is very fond of his son,
    whereas he has no such feeling towards the stranger.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Next the Buddha asks him if any love, passion or desire
    arises in him before he meets or sees or hears about the woman who has become his wife,
    Bhadraka replies that only when he meets, sees and hears about her that he develops
    passion and attachment towards his wife. When the Buddha asks him further whether he will
    suffer from sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, grief, despair, if anything untoward
    happens to his wife, he confesses that he will suffer more than these agonies; he might
    even lose his life through intense suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha points out then that the root cause of
    suffering in the world is cravings, greed, passion and desire that engulf mankind. It has
    been so in the past, as it is now and so it will be in the future.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font COLOR="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(e) Maha Vagga Samyutta
    Pali.</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The last Vagga of Samyutta Nikaya is made up of twelve
    samyuttas, the list of which gives a clear indication of the subjects dealt with in this
    division: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Magga Samyutta, Bojjhanga Samyutta, Satipatthana Samyutta,
      Indriya Samyutta, Sammappadhana Samyutta, Bala Samyutta, Iddhipada Samyutta, Anuruddha
      Samyutta, Jhana Samyutta, Anapana Samyutta, Sotapatti Samyutta and Sacca Samyutta. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The main doctrines which form the fundamental basis of the
    Buddha's Teaching are reviewed in these samyuttas, covering both the theoretical and
    practical aspects. In the concluding suttas of the vagga, the ultimate goal of the holy
    life, Arahatta Phala, Nibbana, end of all suffering, is constantly kept in full view
    together with a detailed description of the way of achieving it, namely, the Four Noble
    Truths and the Noble Path of Eight Constituents.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the opening suttas it is pointed out how friendship
    with the good and association with the virtuous is of immense help for the attainment of
    the Path and Perfection. It is one of the supporting factors conducive to the welfare of a
    bhikkhu. Not having a virtuous friend and good adviser is a great handicap for him in his
    endeavours to attain the Path.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the <b>Kundaliya Sutta</b>, the wandering ascetic
    Kundaliya asks the Buddha what his objective is in practising the holy life. When the
    Buddha replies that he lives the holy life to enjoy the Fruits of the Path and the bliss
    of liberation by knowledge, the ascetic wants to know how to achieve these results. The
    Buddha advises him to cultivate and frequently practise restraint of the five senses. This
    will establish the threefold good conduct in deed, word and thought. When the threefold
    good conduct is cultivated and frequently practised, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness
    will be established. When the Four Foundations of Mindfulness are well established, the
    Seven Factors of Enlightenment will be developed. When the Seven Factors of Enlightenment
    are developed and frequently applied, the. Fruits of the Path and liberation by knowledge
    will be achieved.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the <b>Udayi Sutta</b>, there is an account of Udayi
    who gives confirmation of such achievements through personal experience. He tells how he
    comes to know about the five <b>khandhas</b> from the discourses, how he practises
    contemplation on the arising and ceasing of these <b>khandhas</b> thereby developing <b>Udayabbaya
    Nana</b> which, through frequent cultivation, matures into Magga Insight. Progressing
    still further by developing and applying frequently the Seven Factors of Enlightenment he
    ultimately attains Arahatship. In many suttas are recorded the personal experiences of
    bhikkhus and lay disciples who on being afflicted with serious illness are advised to
    cultivate and practise the Seven Factors of Enlightenment. They recount how they are
    relieved, not only of pains of sickness but also of suffering that arises from craving.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In <b>Sakunagghi Sutta</b>, the bhikkhus are exhorted by
    the Buddha to keep within the confines of their own ground, i.e., the Four Foundations of
    Mindfulness, namely, contemplation of body, sensation, mind and mind-objects. They can
    roam freely in the safe resort guarded by these outposts of Four Foundations of
    Mindfulness, unharmed by lust, hate and ignorance. Once they stray outside their own
    ground, they expose themselves to the allurements of the sensuous world. The parable of
    falcon and skylark illustrates this point. A fierce falcon suddenly seizes hold of a tiny
    skylark which is feeding in an open field. Clutched in the claws of its captor, the
    unfortunate young bird bemoans its foolishness in venturing outside of its own ground to
    fall a victim to the raiding falcon.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;If only I had stayed put on my own ground inherited
    from my parents, I could easily have beaten off this attack by the falcon.' Bemused by
    this challenging soliloquy, the falcon asks the skylark where that ground would be that it
    has inherited from its parents. The skylark replies, &quot;The interspaces between clods
    of earth in the ploughed fields are my ground inherited from my parents.&quot; All right,
    tiny tot, I shell release you now. See if you can escape my clutches even on your own
    ground.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then standing on a spot where three big clods of earth
    meet, the skylark derisively invites the falcon, &quot;Come and get me, you big
    brute.&quot; Burning with fury, the falcon sweeps down with fierce speed to grab the
    mocking little bird in its claws. The skylark quickly disappears into the interspaces of
    the earth clods, but the big falcon, unable to arrest its own speed, smashes into the herd
    protruding clods to meet its painful death.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In<b> Bhikkhunuupassaya Sutta</b>,the Buddha explains for
    Ananda's benefit two methods of meditation. When established in the Four Foundations of
    Mindfulness, a bhikkhu will experience a beneficial result, gradually increasing. But
    should his mind be distracted by external things during the contemplation on body,
    sensation, mind or mind-object, the bhikkhu should direct his mind to some
    confidence-inspiring object, such as recollection of the virtues of the Buddha. By doing
    so, he experiences joy, rapture, tranquillity and happiness, which is conducive to
    concentration. He can then revert back to the original object of meditation. When his mind
    is not distracted by external things, no need arises for him to direct his mind to any
    confidence-inspiring object. The Buddha concludes his exhortation thus: <i>&quot;Here are
    trees and secluded places, Ananda. Practise meditation, Ananda. Be not neglectful lest you
    regret it afterwards.&quot;</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As set out in the <b>'Ciratthiti Sutta'</b>, the Venerable
    Ananda takes this injunction to heart and regards the practice of the Four Methods of
    Steadfast Mindfulness as of supreme importance. When a bhikkhu by the name of Badda asks
    the Venerable Ananda, after the death of the Buddha, what will bring about the
    disappearance of the Buddha's Teaching, the Venerable Ananda replies, &quot;So long as the
    practice of the Four Methods of Steadfast Mindfulness is not neglected, so long will the
    Teaching prosper; but when the practice of the Four Methods of Steadfast Mindfulness
    declines, the Teaching will gradually disappears&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Anapanassati</b> meditation, one of the methods of body
    contemplation, consists in watching closely one's in-breath and out-breath and is rated
    highly as being very beneficial. In the <b>Maha Kappina Sutta</b>,the bhikkhus inform the
    Buddha, &quot;We notice, Venerable Sir, that bhikkhu Maha Kappina is always calm and
    collected, never excited, whether he is in company or alone in the forest.&quot; &quot;It
    is so, bhikkhus. One who practises Anapanassati meditation with mindfulness and full
    comprehension remains calm in body and collected in mind, unruffled, unexcited.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The<b> Icchanagala Sutta</b> describes how the Buddha
    himself once stayed for the rains-residence of three months in Icchanagala forest grove in
    solitude practising Anapanassati meditation most of the time. Anapanassati meditation is
    known as the abode of the Enlightened Ones, the abode of the Noble Ones.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When fully accomplished in the cultivation of the Seven
    Factors of Enlightenment, through practice of body contemplation or Anapanassati
    meditation, one be comes firmly established in unshakable confidence in the Buddha, the
    Dhamma end the Samgha. The moral conduct of such a person, through observance of precepts,
    is also without blemish. He has reached, in his spiritual development, the stage of the
    Stream-winner, Sotapatti Magga, by virtue of which, he will never be reborn in states of
    woe and misery. His path only leads upwards, towards the three higher stages of
    accomplishment. He has only to plod on steadfastly without looking backwards.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is explained in the <b>Pathama Mahanama Sutta</b>, by
    the simile of an earthern pot filled partly with gravels and stones and partly with fat
    and butter. By throwing this pot into water and smashing it with a stick, it will be seen
    that gravels and stones quickly sink to the bottom while fat and butter rise to the
    surface of the water. Likewise, when a person who has established himself in the five
    wholesome dhammas of faith, conduct, learning, charity and insight dies, his body remains
    to get decomposed but his extremely purified mental continuum continues in higher states
    of existence as birth-linking consciousness, <b>patisandhi citta</b>. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the concluding suttas are expositions on the Middle
    Path, the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Path of Eight Constituents.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha's first sermon, the <b>Dhammacakkappavattana
    Sutta</b>, appears in the last samyutta, namely, Saccasamyutta.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha did not make his claim to supremely perfect
    enlightenment until he had acquired full understanding of the Four Noble Truths.<i>
    &quot;As long, O bhikkhus, as my knowledge of reality and insight regarding the Four Noble
    Truths in three aspects and twelve ways was not fully clear to me, so long did I not admit
    to the world with its devas, maras and brahmas, to the mass of beings with its recluses,
    brahmins, kings and people that I had understood, attained and realized rightly by myself
    the incomparable, the most excellent perfect enlightenment.&quot;</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha concluded his first sermon with the words <i>&quot;This
    is my last existence. Now there is no more rebirth for me.&quot;</i></font></p>
