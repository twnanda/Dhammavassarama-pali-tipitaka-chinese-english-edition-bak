    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Disciplinary and Procedural Rules for
    the Samgha </b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Vinaya Pitaka is made up of rules of discipline laid
    down for regulating the conduct of the Buddha's disciples who have been admitted as
    bhikkhus and bhikkhunis into the Order. These rules embody authoritative injunctions of
    the Buddha on modes of conduct and restraints on both physical and verbal actions. They
    deal with transgressions of discipline, and with various categories of restraints and
    admonitions in accordance with the nature of the offence. </font></p>
    <p><font COLOR="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><strong><i>(a) Seven Kinds of
    Transgression or Offence, Apatti </i></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The rules of discipline first laid down by the Buddha are
    called Mulapannatti (the root regulation); those supplemented later are known as
    Anupannatti. Together they are known as Sikkhapadas, rules of discipline. The act of
    tranagressing these rules of discipline, thereby incurring a penalty by the guilty
    bhikkhu, is called Apatti, which means 'reaching, committing'. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The offences for which penalties are laid down may be
    classified under seven categories depending on their nature: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(i) Parajika <br>
      (ii) Samghadisesa <br>
      (iii) Thullaccaya <br>
      (iv) Pacittiya <br>
      (v) Patidesaniya<br>
      (vi) Dukkata <br>
      (vii) Dubbhasita. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">An offence in the first category of offences, Parajika, is
    classified as a grave offence, Garukapatti, which is irremediable, atekiccha and entails
    the falling off of the offender from bhikkhuhood. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">An offence in the second category, Samghadisesa, is also
    classified as a grave offence but it is remediable, satekiccha. The offender is put on a
    probationary period of penance, during which he has to undertake certain difficult
    practices and after which he is rehabilitated by the Samgha assembly. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The remaining five categories consist of light offences,
    lahukapatti, which are remediable and incur the penalty of having to confess the
    transgression to another bhikkhu. After carrying out the prescribed penalty, the bhikkhu
    transgressor becomes cleansed of the offence. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><em><font COLOR="#0000FF"><i>(b) When and how the
    disciplinary rules were laid down.</i></font> </em></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For twenty years after the establishment of the Order
    there was neither injunction nor rule concerning Parajika and Samghadisesa offences. The
    members of the Order of the early days were all Ariyas, the least advanced of whom was a
    Stream-winner, one who had attained the first Magga and Fruition, and there was no need
    for proscribing rules relating to grave offences. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But as the years went by, the Samgha grew in strength.
    Undesirable elements not having the purest of motives but attracted only by the fame and
    gain of the bhikkhus began to get into the Buddha's Order. Some twenty years after the
    founding of the Order, it became necessary to begin establishing rules relating to grave
    offences. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was through Bhikkhu Sudinna, a native of Kalanda
    Village near Vesali, who committed the offence of having sexual intercourse with his
    ex-wife, that the first Parajika rule came to be promulgated. It was laid down to deter
    bhikkhus from indulging in sexual intercourse. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When such a grave cause had arisen for which the laying
    down of a prohibitory rule became necessary, the Buddha convened an assembly of the
    bhikkhus. It was only after questioning the bhikkhu concerned and after the undesirability
    of committing such an offence had been made clear that a certain rule was laid down in
    order to prevent future lapses of similar nature. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha also followed the precedence set by earlier
    Buddhas. Using his supernormal powers, he reflected on what rules the earlier Buddhas
    would lay down under certain given conditions. Then he adopted similar regulations to meet
    the situation that had arisen in his time. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><em><font COLOR="#0000FF"><i>(c) Admission of
    Bhikkhunis into the Order</i></font> </em></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After spending four vassas (residence period during the
    rains) after his Enlightenment, the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu, his native royal city, at
    the request of his ailing father, King Suddhodana. All that time, Mahapajapati, Buddha's
    foster mother requested him to admit her into the Order. Mahapajapati was not alone in
    desiring to join the Order. Five hundred Sakyan ladies whose husbands had left the
    household life were also eager to be admitted into the Order. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After his father's death, the Buddha went back to Vesali,
    refusing the repeated request of Mahapajapati for admission into the Order. The determined
    foster mother of the Buddha and widow of the recently deceased King Suddhodana, having cut
    off her hair and put on bark-dyed clothes, accompanied by five hundred Sakyan ladies, made
    her way to Vesali where the Buddha was staying in the Mahavana, in the Kutagara Hall. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Venerable Ananda saw them outside the gateway of the
    Kutagara Hall, dust-laden with swollen feet, dejected, tearful, standing and weeping. Out
    of great compassion for the ladies, the Venerable Ananda interceded with the Buddha on
    their behalf and entreated him to accept them in the Order. The Buddha continued to stand
    firm. But when the Venerable Ananda asked the Buddha whether women were not capable of
    attaining Magga and Phala Insight, the Buddha replied that women were indeed capable of
    doing so, provided they left the household life like their menfolk. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thereupon Ananda made his entreaties again saying that
    Mahapajapati had been of great service to the Buddha waiting on him as his guardian and
    nurse, suckling him when his mother died. And as women were capable of attaining the Magga
    and Phala Insight, she should be permitted to join the Order and become a bhikkhuni. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha finally acceded to Ananda's entreaties:
    &quot;Ananda, if Mahapajapati accepts eight special rules, garu-dhamma, let such
    acceptance mean her admission to the Order.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The eight special rules [*] are: </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(i) A bhikkhuni, even if she enjoys a seniority of a
      hundred years in the Order, must pay respect to a bhikkhu though he may have been a
      bhikkhu only for a day. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) A bhikkhuni must not keep her rains-residence in a
      place where there are no bhikkhus.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) Every fortnight a bhikkhuni must do two things: To
      ask the bhikkhu Samgha the day of uposatha, and to approach the bhikkhu Samgha for
      instruction and admonition. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) When the rains-residence period is over, a bhikkhuni
      must attend the pavarana ceremony conducted at both the assemblies of bhikkhus and
      bhikkhunis, in each of which she must invite criticism on what has been seen, what has
      been heard or what has been suspected of her. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(v) A bhikkhuni who has committed a Samghadisesa offence
      must undergo penance for a half-month, pakkha manatta, in each assembly of bhikkhus and
      bhikkhunis. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(vi) Admission to the Order must be sought, from both
      assemblies, by a woman novice only after two year's probationary training as a candidate.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(vii) A bhikkhuni should not revile a bhikkhu in any way,
      not even obliquely. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(viii) A bhikkhuni must abide by instructions given her by
      bhikkhus, but must not give instructions or advice to bhikkhus. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mahapajapati accepted unhesitatingly these eight
    conditions imposed by the Buddha and was consequently admitted into the Order. </font></p>
