    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of the five Nikayas, Khuddaka Nikaya contains the largest
    number of treatises (as listed below) and the most numerous categories of dhamma. Although
    the word &quot;Khuddaka&quot; literally means &quot;minor&quot; or &quot;small&quot;, the
    actual content of this collection can by no means be regarded as minor, including as it
    does the two major divisions of the Pitaka, namely, the Vinaya Pitaka and the Abhidhamma
    Pitaka according to one system of classification. The miscellaneous nature of this
    collection, containing not only the discourses by the Buddha but compilations of brief
    doctrinal notes mostly in verse, accounts of personal struggles and achievements by theras
    and theris also in verse, the birth stories, the history of the Buddha etc., may account
    for its title.</font></p>

    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(1) Khuddakapatha Pali </b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">First of the treatises in this Nikaya, Khuddakapatha
    contains readings of mirror passages&quot; most of which are also found in other parts of
    Tipitaka. it is a collection of nine short formulae and suttas used as a manual for
    novices under training, namely, (a) the three refuges (b) the Ten Precepts (c) the thirty
    two parts of the body (d) single Dhammas for novices in the form of a catechism (e)
    Mangala Sutta (f) Ratana Sutta (g) Tirokutta Sutta (h) Nidhikanda Sutta and (i) Metta
    Sutta.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Taking refuge in the Three Gems, the Buddha, the Dhamma
    and the Samgha, by reciting the formula, &quot;I take refuge in the Buddha, I take refuge
    in the Dhamma, I take refuge in the Samgha,&quot; is a conscious act of expression of
    complete faith in the Three Gems, not mere profession of superficial belief nor a rite of
    traditional piety. It implies (i) one's humility; (ii)acceptance of the Triple Gems as
    one's guiding principles and ideals; (iii) acceptance of discipleship and (iv) homage.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the section on 'Kumara panha, questions for young boys,
    the dhamma is tailored to suit the young intellect of novices:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">What is the One? -- The Nutriment which sustains the life
      of beings. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">What are the Two? -- Nama and rupa </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">What are the Three? -- Pleasant, Unpleasant, Neutral
      Vedanas. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">What are the Four? -- The Four Noble Truths.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">What are the Five? -- The five groups of grasping.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">What are the Six? -- The six bases of senses. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman">What are the Ten? -- The ten demeritorious courses of
      action. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Maha Mingala Sutta</b>, the discourse on the great
    blessings, is a famous sutta cherished highly in all Buddhist countries. It is a
    comprehensive summary of Buddhist ethics for the individual as well as for society,
    composed in elegant verses. The thirty eight blessings enumerated in the sutta as
    unfailing guides throughout one's life start with advice on avoidance of bad company and
    provide ideals and practices basic to all moral and spiritual progress, for the welfare
    and happiness of the individual, the family and the community. The final blessing is on
    the development of the mind which is unruffled by vagaries of fortune, unaffected by
    sorrow, cleansed of defilements and which thus gains liberation - the mind of an Arahat.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <b>Ratana Sutta</b> was delivered by the Buddha when
    Vesali was plagued by famine, disease etc. He had been requested by the Licchavi Princes
    to come from Rajagaha to Vesali. The sutta was delivered for the purpose of countering the
    plagues, by invocation of the truth of the special qualities of the Three Gems, the
    Buddha, the Dhamma and the Samgha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <b>Metta Sutta</b> was taught to a group of bhikkhus
    who were troubled by non-human beings while sitting in meditation at the foot of secluded
    forest trees. The Buddha showed them how to develop loving-kindness to wards all beings,
    the practice which will not only protect them from harm but also will serve as a basis for
    insight through attainment of jhana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Khuddakapatha which is a collection of these nine
    formulae and suttas appears to be arranged in such a way as to form a continuous theme
    demonstrating the practice of the holy life: how a person accepts the Buddha's Teaching by
    taking refuge in the Three Gems; then how he observes the Ten Precepts for moral
    purification. Next he takes up a meditation subject, the contemplation of thirty two
    constituents of the body, to develop non-attachment. He is shown next the virtues and
    merits of giving and how one handicaps oneself by not performing acts of merit. In the
    meanwhile he safeguards himself by reciting the mingala Sutta and provides protection to
    others by reciting the Ratana Sutta. Finally, he develops loving-kindness towards all
    beings, thereby keeping himself safe from harm; at the same time he achieves jhanic
    concentration which will eventually lead him to reach the goal of spiritual life, Nibbana,
    by means of knowledge of Insight and the Path.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(2) The Dhammapada Pali </b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is a book of the Tipitaka which is popular and
    well-known not only in Buddhist countries but also elsewhere. The Dhammapada is a
    collection of the Buddha's words or basic and essential principles of the Buddha's
    Teaching. It consists of 423 verses arranged according to topics in twenty six vaggas or
    chapters.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Verse 183 gives the teachings of the Buddha in a nutshell:
    Abstain from all evil; Promote (develop) what is good and purify your mind. Each stanza is
    packed with the essence of Truth which illumines the path of a wayfarer. Many are the
    Dhammapada verses which find their way into the writings and everyday speech of the
    Buddhists. One can get much sustenance and encouragement from the Dhammapada not only for
    spiritual development but also for everyday living.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Dhammapada describes the path which a wayfarer should
    follow. It states (in verses 277,278 and 279) that all conditioned things are transitory
    and impermanent; that all conditioned things are subject to suffering; and that all things
    (dhammas) are insubstantial, incapable of being called one's own. When one sees the real
    nature of things with (Vipassana) insight, one becomes disillusioned with the charms and
    attractions of the Five Aggregates. Such disillusionment constitutes the path of purity
    (Nibbana).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Verse 243 defines the highest form of impurity as
    ignorance (avijja) and states that the suffering in the world can be brought to an end
    only by the destruction of craving or hankering after sensual pleasures. Greed, ill will
    and ignorance are described as dangerous as fire and unless they are held under restraint,
    a happy life is impossible both now and thereafter.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Avoiding the two extremes, namely, indulgence in a life of
    sensuous pleasures and, the practice of self-mortification, one must follow the Middle
    Path, the Noble Path of Eight Constituents to attain perfect Peace, Nibbana. Attainment to
    the lowest stage (Sotapatti Magga) on this Path shown by the Buddha is to be preferred
    even to the possession of the whole world (v. 178). The Dhammapada emphasizes that one
    makes or mars oneself, and no one else can help one to rid oneself of impurity. Even the
    Buddhas cannot render help; they can only show the way and guide; a man must strive for
    himself.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Dhammapada recommends a life of peace and non-violence
    and points out the eternal law that hatred does not cease by hatred, enmity is never
    overcome by enmity but only by kindness and love (V. 5). It advised to conquer anger by
    loving-kindness, evil by good, miserliness by generosity, and falsehood by truth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Dhammapada contains gems of literary excellence,
    replete with appropriate similes and universal truths and is thus found appealing and
    edifying by readers all the world over. It serves as a digest of the essential principles
    and features of the Buddha Dhamma as well as of the wisdom of all the ages.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(3) Udana Pali </b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">An udana is an utterance mostly in matrical form inspired
    by a particularly intense emotion. This treatise is a ccllection of eighty joyful
    utterances made by the Buddha on unique occasions of sheer bliss; each udana in verse is
    accompanied by an account in prose of the circumstances that led to their being uttered.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, in the first Bodhivagga Sutta are recorded
    the first words spoken aloud by the newly Enlightened Buddha in three stanzas beginning
    with the famous opening lines: <i>&quot;<strong>Yada have patubhavanti dhamma, Atapino
    jhayato brahmanassa</strong><font COLOR="#800040">.</font>&quot;</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For seven days after his Enlightenment, the Buddha sat at
    the foot of the Bodhi tree feeling the bliss of liberation. At the end of seven days, he
    emerged from this (Phala Sampatti) sustained absorption in Fruition-mind, to deliberate
    upon the principle of Dependent Origination: When this is, that is (Imasmin sati, idam
    hoti); this having arisen, that arises (Imassuppada, idam uppajjati); when this is not,
    that is not (Imasmim asati, idam na hoti); this having ceased, that ceases (Imassa
    nirodha, idam nirujjhati).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the first watch of the night, when the principle of the
    origin of the whole mass of suffering was thoroughly grasped in a detailed manner in the
    order of arising, the Buddha uttered the first stanza of joy.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When the real nature of things becomes clear to the
    ardently meditating recluse, then all his doubts vanish, because he understands what that
    nature is as well as its cause.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the second watch of the night, his mind was occupied
    with the principle of Dependent Origination in the order of ceasing. When the manner of
    cessation of suffering was thoroughly understood, the Buddha was moved again to utter the
    second stanza of jubilation:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When the reel nature of things becomes clear to the
    ardently meditating recluse, then all his doubts vanish, because he perceives the
    cessation of causes.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the third watch of the night, the Buddha went over the
    detailed formula of the principle of Dependent Origination, Paticca Samuppada, in both the
    orders of arising and ceasing. Then having mastered the doctrine of Dependent Origination
    very thoroughly, the Buddha uttered the third stanza of solemn utterance:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;When the real nature of things becomes clear to the
    ardently rneditating recluse, then like the sun that illumines the sky, he stands
    repelling the dark hosts of Mara.&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(4) Itivuttaka Pali</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Fourth treatise contains 112 suttas divided into four
    nipatas with verses and prose mixed, one supplementing the other. Although the collection
    contains the inspired sayings of the Buddha as in Udana, each passage is preceded by the
    phrase 'Iti vuttam Bhagavata', 'thus was said by the Buddha,' and reads like a personal
    note book in which are recorded short pithy sayings of the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The division into nipatas instead of vaggas denotes that
    the collection is classified in ascending numerical order of the categories of the dhammas
    in the nipatas of the Anguttara. Thus in Ekaka Nipata are passages dealing with single
    items of the dhamma:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Bhikkhus, abandon craving; I guarantee attainment to
    the stage of an Anagami. if you abandon craving.&quot; In Duka Nipata, each passage deals
    with units of two items of the dhamma: There are two forms of Nibbana dhatu, namely,
    Sa-upadisesa Nibbana dhatu, with the five khandhas still remaining, and Anupadisesa
    Nibbana dhatu, without any khandha remaining. </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(5) Suttanipata Pali</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As well-known as Dhammapada, Sutta Nipata is also a work
    in verse with occasional introductions in prose. It is divided into five vaggas: (i) Uraga
    vagga of 12 suttas; (ii) Cula Vagga of 14 suttas; (iii) Maha Vagga of 12 suttas; (iv)
    Atthaka Vagga of 16 suttas and (v) Parayana Vagga of 16 questions. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the twelve suttas of the Uraga Vagga are found some
    important teachings of the Buddha which rnay be practised in the course of one's daily
    life:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;True friends are rare to come by these days; a show
      of friendship very often hides some private ends. Man's mind is defiled by self-interest.
      So, becoming disillusioned, roam alone like a rhinoceros.&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="RIGHT"><font face="Times New Roman">(Khaggavisana Sutta)</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Not by birth does one become an outcast, not by
      birth does one become a Brahmana;&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;By one's action one becomes an outcast, by one's
      action one becomes a brahmana.&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="RIGHT"><font face="Times New Roman">(Vasala Sutta) </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;As a mother even with her life protects her only
      child, so let one cultivate immeasurable loving-kindness towards all living beings.&quot; </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="RIGHT"><font face="Times New Roman">(Metta Sutta) </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Parayana Vagga deals with sixteen questions asked by
    sixteen Brahmin youths while the Buddha is staying at Pasanaka Shrine in the country of
    Magadha. The Buddha gives his answers to each of the questions asked by the youths.
    Knowing the meaning of each question and of the answers given by the Buddha, if one
    practises the Dhamma as instructed in this sutta, one can surely reach the Other Shore,
    which is free from ageing and death.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Dhamma in this sutta is known as Parayana because it
    leads to the Other Shore, Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font color="#0000FF">(6) Vimana Vatthu
    Pali</font></b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vimana means mansion. Here it refers to celestial mansions
    gained by beings who have done acts of merit. In this text are eighty five verses grouped
    in seven vaggas; in the first four vaggas, celestial females give an account of what acts
    of merit they have done in previous existences as human being and how they are reborn in
    deva realm where magnificent mansions await their appearance. In the last three vaggas,
    the celestial males tell their stories. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Venerable Maha Moggallana who can visit the deva realm
    brings back these stories as told him by the deva concerned and recounts them to the
    Buddha who confirms the stories by supplying more background details to them. These
    discourses are given with a view to bring out the fact that the human world offers plenty
    of opportunities for performing meritorious acts. The other objective for such discourses
    is to refute the wrong views of those who believe that nothing exists after this life (the
    annihilationists) and those who maintain that there is no resultant effect to any action.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Of the eighty five stories described, five stories concern
    those who have been reborn in deva world having developed themselves to the stage of
    Sotapanna in their previous existences; two stories on those who have made obeisance to
    the Buddha with clasped hands; one on those who had expressed words of jubilation at the
    ceremony of building a monastery for the Samgha; two stories on those who had observed the
    moral precepts; two stories on those who had observed the precepts and given alms; and the
    rest deal with those who have been reborn in the deva world as the wholesome result of
    giving alms only.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The vivid accounts of the lives of the devas in various
    deva abodes serve to show clearly that the higher beings are not immortals, nor creators,
    but are also evolved, conditioned by the results of their previous meritorious deeds; that
    they too are subject to the laws of anicca, dukkha and anatta and have to strive
    themselves to achieve the deathless state of Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(7) Peta Vatthu Pali</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;The stories of &quot;<b>petas</b>&quot; are graphic
    accounts of the miserable states of beings who have been reborn in unhappy existences as a
    consequence of their evil deeds. There are fifty one stories, divided into four vaggas,
    describing the life of misery of' the evil doers, in direct contrast to the magnificent
    life of the devas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Emphasis is again laid on the beneficial effects of
    giving; whereas envy, jealousy, miserliness, greed and wrong views are shown to be the
    causes for appearance in the unhappy state of petas. The chief suffering in this state is
    dire lack of food, clothing and dwelling for the condemned being. A certain and immediate
    release from such miseries can be given to the unfortunate being if his former relatives
    perform meritorious deeds and share the merit with him. In Tirokutapeta Vatthu, a detailed
    account is given on how King Bimbisara brings relief to his former relatives who are
    unfortunately suffering as petas by making generous offer of food, clothing and dwelling
    places to the Buddha and his company of bhikkhus and sharing the merit, thus accrued, to
    the petas who have been his kith and kin in previous lives.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(8) The Thera Gatha Pali
    and (9) The Theri Gatha Pali</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These two treatises form a compilation of delightful
    verses uttered by some two hundred and sixty four theras and seventy three theris through
    sheer exultation and joy that arise out of their religious devotion and inspiration. These
    inspiring verses gush forth from the hearts of bhikkhus and bhikkhunis after their
    attainment of Arahatship as an announcement of their achievement and also as statement of
    their effort which has led to their final enlightenment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It may be learnt from these jubilant verses how a trifling
    incident in life, a trivial circumstance can become the starting point of spiritual effort
    which culminates in supreme liberation. But for some of the theras, the call has come
    early to them to forsake the homelife and take to the life of a homeless recluse. Their
    struggle has been hard because of the inner fight between the forces of good and evil.
    They have had a good fight and they have won by dint of resolution and ardent
    determination. The crippling bonds of greed, hatred and ignorance have been broken asunder
    and they are freed. In sheer exultation, they utter forth these inspiring verses,
    proclaiming their freedom and victory. Some of these theras reach the sublime height of
    poetic beauty when they recount their solitary life in the quiet glades and groves of
    forest, the beauteous nature that form their surrounding, and the peace and calm that have
    facilitated their meditation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Although the verses in the Theri Gatha lack the poetic
    excellence and impassioned expression of love of solitude that characterise the verses in
    the Thera Gatha, they nevertheless reflect the great piety and unflinching resolution with
    which the theris have struggled to reach the goal. One distinguishing feature of the
    struggle of the theris is that many of them receive the final impetus to seek solace in
    holy life through emotional imbalance they have been subject to, for example, loss of the
    dear ones, as in the case of Patacari, or through intense personal suffering over the
    death of a beloved son as suffered by Kisa Gotami.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Both the Thera Gatha and the Theri Gatha provide us with
    shining, inspiring models of excellence, so consoling and so uplifting, so human and true
    to life, leading us on to the path of the holy life, stimulating us when our spirit drops,
    our mind flags, and guiding us through internal conflicts and set-backs. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These gathas may be enjoyed simply as beautiful poems with
    exquisite imagery and pleasing words or they may be contemplated on as inspiring messages
    with deep meaning to uplift the mind to the highest levels of spiritual attainment. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Rain gods! my abode has a roofing now for my
    comfortable living; it will shield me from the onset of wind and storm. Rain god! Pour
    down to thy heart's content; my mind is calm and unshakable, free from fetters. I dwell
    striving strenuously with untiring zeal. Rain god! Pour down to thy heart's content.&quot;
    (Verse 325)</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The bhikkhu has now his &quot;abode&quot; of the five
    khandhas well protected by 'the roofing and walls' of sense restraints and panna. He lives
    thus comfortably, well shielded from the rain and storm of lust, craving and attachments.
    Undisturbed by the pouring rain, and whirling wind of conceit, ignorance, hatred, he
    remains calm and composed, unpolluted. Although he lived thus in security and comfort of
    liberation and calm, he keeps alert and mindful, ever ready to cope with any emergency
    that may arise through lack of mindfulness. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(10) Jataka Pali</b></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Birth-stories of the Buddha</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These are stories of the previous existences of Gotama
    Buddha, while he was as yet but a Bodhisatta. The <i>Jataka </i>is an extensive work in
    verses containing five hundred and forty seven stories or previous existences as recounted
    by the Buddha, (usually referred to in Burma as 550 stories). The treatise is divided into
    nipatas according to the number of verses concerning each story; the one verse stories are
    classified as Ekaka Nipata, the two verse stories come under Duka Nipata etc. It is the
    commentary to the verses which gives the complete birth-stories. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In these birth-stories are embedded moral principles and
    practices which the Bodhisatta had observed for self-development and perfection to attain
    Buddhahood.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(11) Niddesa Pali.</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This division of Khuddaka Nikaya consists of two parts:
    Maha Niddesa, the major exposition which is the commentary on the fourth vagga (Atthaka)
    of the Sutta Nipata and Cula Niddesa, the minor exposition which is the commentary on the
    fifth vagga (Parayana) and on the Khaggavisana Sutta in the first vagga. Attributed to the
    Venerable Sariputta, these exegetical works contain much material on the Abhidhamma and
    constitute the earliest forms of commentaries, providing evidence of commentarial
    tradition many centuries before the Venerable Buddhaghosa appeared on the scene.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(12) Patisambhida Magga
    Pali.</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This treatise, entitled the Path of Analysis, is
    attributed to the Venerable Sariputta. Dealing with salient teachings of the Buddha
    analytically in the style of the Abhidhamma, it is divided into three main vaggas, namely,
    Maha Vagga, Yuganaddha Vagga and Panna Vagga. Each vagga consists of ten sub-groups, named
    kathas, such as Nana Kathas, Ditthi Katha etc.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The treatment of each subject matter is very detailed and
    provides theoretical foundation for the practice of the Path.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(13) Apadana Pali</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is a biographical work containing the life stories
    (past and present) of the Buddha and his Arahat disciples. It is divided into two
    divisions: the Therapadana giving the life stories of the Buddha, of forty one
    Paccekabuddhas and of five hundred and fifty nine Arahats from the Venerable Sariputta to
    the Venerable Ratthapala and Theripadana with the life stories of forty theri Arahats from
    Sumedha Theri to Pesala Theri.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Apadana here means a biography or a life story of a
    particularly accomplished person, who has made a firm resolution to strive for the goal he
    desires, and who has ultimately achieved his goal, namely, Buddhahood for an Enlightened
    One, Arahatship for his disciples. Whereas the Thera Gatha and the Theri Gatha depict
    generally the triumphant moment of achievements of the theras and theris, the Apadana
    describes the up-hill work they have to undertake to reach the summit of their ambition.
    The Gathas and the Apadanas supplement one another to unfold the inspiring tales of hard
    struggles and final conquests. </font></p>

    Pali</font></b> </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>History of the Buddhas</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Buddhavamsa Pali gives a short historical account of
    Gotama Buddha and of the twenty four previous Buddhas who had prophesied his attainment of
    Buddhahood. It consists of twenty nine sections in verse.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first section gives an account of how the Venerable
    Sariputta asks the Buddha when it was that he first resolved to work for attainment of the
    Buddhahood and what paramis (virtues towards perfection) he had fulfilled to achieve his
    goal of Perfect Enlightenment. In the second section, the Buddha describes how as Sumedha,
    the hermit, being inspired by Dipankara Buddha, he makes the resolution for the attainment
    of Buddhahood, and how the Buddha Dipankara gives the hermit Sumedha his blessing,
    prophesying that Sumedha would become a Buddha by the name of Gotama after a lapse of four
    asankheyya and a hundred thousand kappas (world cycles).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From then onwards, the Bodhisatta Sumedha keeps on
    practising the ten paramis namely, almas-giving, morality, renunciation, wisdom,
    perseverance, forbearance, truthfulness, determination, loving-kindness and equanimity.
    The Buddha relates how he fulfils these paramis, existence after existence, and how each
    of the twenty four Buddhas, who appeared after Dipankara Buddha at different intervals of
    world cycles, renewed the prophesy that he would become a Buddha by the name of Gotama.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In sections three to twenty-seven are accounts of the
    twenty five Buddhas including Gotama Buddha, giving details about each of them with regard
    to birth, status, names of their parents, names of their wives and children, their
    life-span, their way of renunciation, duration of their efforts to attain Buddhahood,
    their teaching of the Dhammacakka Sutta in the Migadayavana, the names of their Chief
    Disciples and their chief lay disciples. Each section is closed with an account of where
    the Buddhas pass away and how their relics are distributed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the twenty eighth section is given the names of three
    Buddhas, namely, Tanhankara, Medhankara and Saranankara who lived before Dipankara Buddha
    at different intervals of the same world cycle. The names of other Buddhas (to Gotama
    Buddha) are also enumerated together with the name of the kappas in which they have
    appeared. Finally there is the prophesy by the Buddha that Metteyya Buddha would arise
    after him in this world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The last section gives an account of how the Buddha's
    relics are distributed and where they are preserved.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(15) Cariya Pitaka</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This treatise contains thirty five stories of the Buddha's
    previous lives retold at the request of the Venerable Sariputta . Whereas the Jataka is
    concerned with the Buddha's previous existences from the time of Sumedha, the hermit, till
    he becomes Gotama Buddha, Cariya Pitaka deals only with thirty five of the existences of
    the Bodhisattas in this last world cycle. The Venerable Sariputta, a object in making the
    request is to bring out into bold relief the indomitable will, the supreme effort, the
    peerless sacrifice with which the Bodhisatta conducts himself in fulfilment of the ten
    paramis (virtues towards Perfection). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Bodhisatta has, throughout innumerable ages, fulfilled
    the ten paramis for countless number of times. Cariya Pitakas records such performances in
    thirty-five existences, selecting seven out of the ten paramis. and recounts how each
    parami is accomplished in each of these existences. Ten stories in the first vagga are
    concerned with accumulation of virtues in alms-giving, the second vagga has ten stories on
    the practice of morality and the last vagga mentions fifteen stories, five of them dealing
    with renunciation, one with firm determination, six with truthfulness, two with
    loving-kindness and one with equanimity.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(16) Netti and (17)
    Petakopadesa</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The two small works, Netti, made up of seven chapters, and
    Petakopadesa, made up of eight chapters, are different from the other books of the
    Tipitaka because they are exegetical and methodological in nature.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font color="#0000FF">(18) Milindapanha
    Pali</font></b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Milindapanha Pali is the last of the books which
    constitute Khuddaka Nikaya. It records the questions asked by King Milinda and the answers
    given by the Venerable Nagasena some five hundred years after the Parinibbana of the
    Buddha. King Milinda was Yonaka (Graeco-Bactrian) ruler of Sagala. He was very learned and
    highly skilled in the art of debating. The Venerable Nagasena, a fully accomplished
    Arahat, was on a visit to Sagala at the request of the Samgha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Milinda, who wanted to have some points on the Dhamma
    clarified, asked the Venerable Nagasena abstruse questions concerning the nature of men,
    his survival after death, and other doctrinal aspects of the Dhamma. The Venerable
    Nagasena gave him satisfactory replies on each question asked. These erudite questions and
    answers on the Teaching of the Buddha are compiled into the book known as the Milindapanha
    Pali.</font></p>
