    </font></h3>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman">(a) Abhidhamma,
    the Higher Teaching of the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Abhidhamma is the third great division of the Pitaka. It
    is a huge collection of systematically arranged, tabulated and classified doctrines of the
    Buddha, representing the quintessence of his Teaching.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Abhidhamma means Higher Teaching or Special Teaching; it
    is unique in its abstruseness, analytical approach, immensity of scope and conduciveness
    to one's liberation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha dhamma has only one taste, the taste of
    liberation. But in Suttanta discourses, the Buddha takes into consideration the
    intellectual level of his audience, and their attainments in parami. He therefore teaches
    the dhamma in conventional terms (vohara vacana), making references to persons and objects
    as I, we, he, she, men, woman, cow, tree, etc. But in Abhidhamma the Buddha makes no such
    concessions; he treats the dhamma entirely in terms of the ultimate reality (paramattha
    sacca). He analyses every phenomenon into its ultimate constituents. All relative concepts
    such as man, mountain, etc. are reduced to their ultimate elements which are then
    precisely defined, classified and systematically arranged.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus in Abhidhamma everything is expressed in terms of
    khandhas, five aggregates of existence; ayatanas, five sensory organs and mind, and their
    respective sense objects; dhatu, elements; indriya, faculties; sacca, fundamental truths;
    and so on. Relative conceptual objects such as man, women, etc. are resolved into ultimate
    components of khandhas, ayatanas, etc. and viewed as an impersonal psycho-physical
    phenomenon, which is conditioned by various factors and is impermanent (anicca), suffering
    (dukkha) and is without a permanent entity (anatta).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having resolved all phenomena into ultimate components
    analytically (as in Dhammasangani and Vibhanga) it aims at synthesis by defining
    inter-relations (paccaya) between the various constituent factors (as in Patthana). Thus
    Abhidhamma forms a gigantic edifice of knowledge relating to the ultimate realities which,
    in its immensity of scope, grandeur, subtlety, and profundity, properly belongs only to
    the intellectual domain of the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman">(b) The seven
    books of Abhidhamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Suttanta Pitaka also contains discourses dealing with
    analytical discussions and conditional relationship of the five aggregates. Where the need
    arises subjects such as the five aggregates, ayatanas, etc. are mentioned in the sutta
    discourses. But they are explained only briefly by what is known as the Sutta Method of
    Analysis (Suttanta bhajaniya), giving bare definitions with limited descriptions. For
    example, khandhas, the five aggregates, are enumerated as the corporeal aggregate, the
    aggregate of sensation, the aggregate of perception, the aggregate of mental formations
    (volitional activities) and the aggregate of consciousness, They may be dealt with a
    little more comprehensively; for instance, the corporeal aggregate may be further defined
    as corporeality of the past, the present or the future; the corporeality which is internal
    or external, coarse or fine, inferior or superior, far or near. The Sutta Method of
    Analysis does not usually go further than this definition.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the Abhidhamma approach is more thorough, more
    penetrating, breaking down each corporeal or mental component into the ultimate, the most
    infinitesimal unit. For example, Rupakkhandha, corporeal aggregate, has been analysed into
    twenty eight constituents; Vedanakkhandha, the aggregate of sensation, into five;
    Sannakkhandha, the aggregate of perception, into six; Sankharakkhandha, the aggregate of
    mental formations, into fifty; and Vinnanakkhandha, the aggregate of consciousness, into
    eighty nine. Then each constituent part is minutely described with its properties and
    qualities and its place in the well arranged system of classification is defined.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A complete description of things require also a statement
    of how each component part stands in relation to other component parts. This entails
    therefore a synthetical approach as well, to study the interrelationship between
    constituent parts and how they are related to other internal or external factors.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus the Abhidhamma approach covers a wide field of study,
    consisting of analytical and synthetical methods of investigation, describing and defining
    minutely the constituent parts of aggregates, classifying them under well-ordered heads
    and well-arranged systems and finally setting out conditions in which they are related to
    each other. Such a large scope of intellectual endeavour needs to be encompassed in a
    voluminous and classified compilation. Hence the Abhidhamma Pitaka is made up of seven
    massive treatises, namely, </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(i) Dhammasangani, containing detailed enumeration of all
      phenomena with an analysis of consciousness (citta) and its concomitant mental factors
      (cetasikas); </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) Vibhanga, consisting of eighteen separate sections on
      analysis of phenomena quite distinct from that of Dhammasangani;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) Dhatukatha, a small treatise written in the form of
      a catechism, discussing all phenomena of existence with reference to three categories,
      khandha, ayatana and datu </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) Puggalapannatti, a small treatise giving a
      description of various types of individuals according to the stage of their achievement
      along the Path;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(v) Kathavatthu, a compilation by the Venerable
      Moggaliputta, the presiding thera of the third Great Synod in which he discusses and
      refutes doctrines of other schools in order to uproot all points of controversy on the
      Buddha dhamma; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(vi) Yamaka, regarded as a treatise on applied logic in
      which analytical procedure is arranged in pairs; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(vii) Patthana, a gigantic treatise which together with
      Dhammasangani, the first book, constitutes the quintessence of the Abhidhamma Pitaka. It
      is a minutely detailed study of the doctrine of conditionality, based on twenty four
      paccayas, conditions or relations.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+1" COLOR="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman">(c) Conventional
    Truth (Sammuti Sacca) and Ultimate Truth (Paramattha Sacca).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Two kinds of Truth are recognised in the Abhidhamma
    according to which only four categories of things, namely, mind (consciousness), mental
    concomitants, Materiality and Nibbana are classed as the Ultimate Truth; all the rest are
    regarded as apparent truth. When we use such expression as 'I', 'you', 'man', 'Woman',
    'person', 'individual', we are speaking about things which do not exist in reality. By
    using such expressions about things which exist only in designation, we are not telling a
    lie; we are merely speaking an apparent truth, making use or conventional language,
    without which no communication will be possible.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But the Ultimate Truth is that there is no 'person',
    'individual' or 'I' in reality. There exist only khandhas made up of corporeality, mind
    (consciousness) and mental concomitants. These are real in that they are not just
    designations, they actually exist in us or around us. </font></p>
