    Discourses of the Buddha</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This Collection in the Suttanta Pitaka, named Digha Nikaya
    as it is made up of thirty-four long discourses of the Buddha, is divided into three
    divisions (a) Silakkhandha Vagga, Division Concerning Morality (b) Maha Vagga, the Large
    Division (c) Pathika Vagga, the Division beginning with the discourse on Pathika, the
    Naked Ascetic. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font COLOR="#0000FF">(a) Silakkhandha
    Vagga</font> </b></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Pali Division Concerning Morality </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This division contains thirteen suttas which deal
    extensively with various types of morality, namely, Minor Morality, basic morality
    applicable to all; Middle Morality and Major Morality which are mostly practised by
    Samanas and Brahmanas. It also discusses the wrong views often prevalent as well as
    brahmin views of sacrifice and caste, and various religious practices such as extreme
    self-mortification. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>(1) Brahmajala Sutta, Discourse on the Net of Perfect
    Wisdom.</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">An argument between Suppiya, a wandering ascetic, and his
    pupil Brahmadatta, with the teacher maligning the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Samgha and
    the pupil praising the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Samgha gave rise to this famous
    discourse which is listed first in this Nikaya.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> In connection with the maligning of the Buddha, the
    Dhamma and the Samgha, the Buddha enjoined his disciples not to feel resentment, nor
    displeasure, nor anger, because it would only be spiritually harmful to them. As to the
    words of praise for the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Samgha, the Buddha advised his
    disciples not to feel pleased, delighted or elated, for it would be an obstacle to their
    progress in the Path. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha said that whatever worldling, puthujjana,
    praised the Buddha he could not do full justice to the peerless virtues of the Buddha,
    namely, his Superior Concentration, samadhi, and Wisdom, panna. A worldling could touch on
    only &quot;matters of a trifling and inferior nature, mere morality.&quot; The Buddha
    explained the three grades of morality and said that there were other dhammas profound,
    hard to see, subtle and intelligible only to the wise. Anyone wishing to praise correctly
    the true virtues of the Buddha should do so only in terms of these dhammas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the Buddha continued to expound on various wrong
    views. There were samanas and brahmanas who,speculating on the past adhered to and
    asserted their wrong views in eighteen different ways, namely, </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(i) Four Kinds of Belief in Eternity, Sassata Ditthi, </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) Four Kinds of Dualistic belief in Eternity and
      Non-eternity, Ekacca Sassata Ditthi, </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) Four Views of the World being Finite or Infinite,
      Antananta Ditthi, </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) Four Kinds of ambiguous evasion, Amaravikkhepa </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(v) Two Doctrines of Non-Causality, Adhiccasamuppanna
      Vada. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There were samanas and brahmanas, who, speculating on the
    future, adhered to and aserted their wrong views in forty-four ways, namely, </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(i) Sixteen Kinds of Belief in the Existence of Sanna
      after death, Uddhamaghatanika Sanni Vada, </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) Eight Kinds of Belief in the Non-Existence of Sanna
      after death, Uddhamaghatanika Asanni Vada, </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(iii) Eight Kinds of Belief in the Existence of Neither
      sanna nor non-sanna after death, Uddhamaghatanika Nevasanni Nassani Vada. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) Seven Kinds of Belief in Annihilation, Uccheda Vada, </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(v) Five Kinds of Mundane Nibbana as realizable in this
      very life, Ditthadhamma Nibbana Vada. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha said that whatever samanas and brahmanas
    speculated on the past, or the future or both the past and the future, they did so in
    these sixty-two ways or one of these sixty-two ways. The Buddha announced further that he
    knew all these wrong views and also what would be the destination, the next existence, in
    which the one holding these views would be reborn. The Buddha gave a detailed analysis of
    these wrong views asserted in sixty-two ways and pointed out that these views had their
    origin in feeling which arose as a result of repeated contact through the six sense bases.
    Whatever person holds these wrong views, in him feeling gives rise to craving; craving
    gives rise to clinging; clinging gives rise to existence; the kammic causal process in
    existence gives rise to rebirth; and rebirth gives rise to ageing, death, grief,
    lamentation, pain, distress and despair. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But whatever person knows, as they really are, the origin
    of the six sense bases of contact, their cessation, their pleasurableness, their danger
    and the way of escape from them, he realizes the dhammas, not only mere morality, sila,
    but also concentration,samadhi, and liberation, vimutti, wisdom, panna, that transcend all
    these wrong views. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All the samanas and brahmanas holding the sixty-two
    categories of wrong views are caught in the net of this discourse just like all the fish
    in a lake are contained in a finely meshed net spread by a skilful fisher man or his
    apprentice. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>(2) Samannaphala Sutta, Discourse on the Fruits of the
    Life of a Samana </b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On one fullmoon night while the Buddha was residing in
    Rajagaha at the mango grove of Jivaka this discourse on the fruits of the life of a
    samana, personally experienced in this very life, was taught to King Ajatasattu on request
    by him. The Buddha explained to him the advantage of the life of a samana by giving him
    the examples of a servant of his household or a landholder cultivating the King's own land
    becoming a samana to whom the King himself would show respect and make offerings of
    requisites, providing him protection and security at the same time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Buddha provided further elucidation on other
    advantages, higher and better, of being a samana by elaborating on (i) how a householder,
    hearing the dhamma taught by a Buddha, leaves the homelife and becomes a samana out of
    pure faith; (ii) how he becomes established in three categories of sila, minor, middle and
    major; (iii) how he gains control over his sense-faculties so that no depraved states of
    mind as covetousness and dissatisfaction would overpower him; (iv) how he be comes endowed
    with mindfulness and clear comprehension and remains contented; (v) how, by dissociating
    himself from five hindrances, he achieves the four jhanas the first, the second, the third
    and the fourth - as higher advantages than those previously mentioned, (vi) how he becomes
    equipped with eight kinds of higher knowledge, namely, Insight Knowledge, the Power of
    Creation by Mind, the Psychic Powers, the Divine Power of Hearing, Knowledge of the Minds
    of others, Knowledge of Past existences, Divine Power of Sight, Knowledge of Extinction of
    moral intoxicants. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus when the knowledge of liberation arises in him, he
    knows he has lived the life of purity. There is no other advantage of being a samana,
    personally experienced, more pleasing and higher than this. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>(3) Ambattha Sutta.</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Ambattha, a young disciple of Pokkharasati, the learned
    brahmin, was sent by his master to investigate whether Gotama was a genuine Buddha endowed
    with thirty-two personal characteristics of a great man. His insolent behaviour, taking
    pride in his birth as a brahmin, led the Buddha to subdue him by proving that Khattiya is
    in fact superior to Brahmana. The Buddha explained further that nobleness in man stemmed
    not from birth but from perfection in three categories of morality, achievements of four
    jhanas, and accomplishments in eight kinds of higher knowledge. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>(4) Sonadanda Sutta. </b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given to the brahmin Sonadanda who
    approached the Buddha while he was residing near Lake Gaggara at Camps in the country of
    Anga. He was asked by the Buddha what attributes should one possess to be acknowledged as
    a brahmin. Sonadanda enumerated high birth, learning in the Vedas, good personality,
    morality and knowledge as essential qualities to be a brahmin. When further questioned by
    the Buddha, he said that the minimum qualifications were morality and knowledge without
    which no one would be entitled to be called a brahmin. On his request, the Buddha
    explained to him the meaning of the terms morality and knowledge, which he confessed to be
    ignorant of, namely, the three categories of morality, achievements of four jhanas and
    accomplishments in eight kinds of higher knowledge.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b> (5) Kutadanta Sutta</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> On the eve of offering a great sacrificial feast, the
    brahmin Kutadanta went to see the Buddha for advice on how best to conduct the sacrifice.
    Giving the example of a former King Mahavijita, who also made a great sacrificial
    offering, the Buddha declared the principle of consent by four parties from the provinces,
    namely, noblemen, ministers, rich brahmins and house holders; the eight qualities to be
    possessed by the king who would make the offerings; the four qualities of the brahmin
    royal adviser who would conduct the ceremonies and the three attitudes of mind towards the
    sacrifices. With all these conditions fulfilled, the feast offered by the king was a great
    success, with no loss of life of sacrificial animals, no hardship on the people, no one
    impressed into service, every one co-operating in the great feast willingly. The brahmin
    Kutadanta then asked the Buddha if there was any sacrifice which could be made with less
    trouble and exertion, yet producing more fruitful result. The Buddha told him of the
    traditional practice of offering the four requisites to bhikkhus of high morality. Less
    troublesome and more profitable again was donating a monastery to the Order of Bhikkhus.
    Better still were the following practices in ascending order of beneficial effects. (i)
    Going to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Samgha for refuge; (ii) observance of the Five
    Precepts; (iii) going forth from the homelife and leading the holy life, becoming
    established in morality, accomplished in the four jhanas, and equipped with eight kinds of
    higher knowledge resulting in the realization of extinction of asavas, the sacrifice which
    entails less trouble and exertion but which excels all other sacrifices. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b> (6) Mahali Sutta</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Mahali Otthaddha, a Licchavi ruler, once came to see the
    Buddha to whom he recounted what Sunakkhatta, a Licchavi prince, had told him. Sunakkhatta
    had been a disciple of the Buddha for three years after which he left the Teaching. He
    told Mahali how he had acquired the Divine Power of Sight by which he had seen myriads of
    pleasant, desirable forms belonging to the deva world but that he had not heard sounds
    belonging to the deva world. Mahali wanted to know from the Buddha whether Sunakkhetta did
    not hear the sounds of the deva world because they were non-existent, or whether he did
    not hear them although they existed. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Buddha explained that there were sounds in the deva
    world but Sunakkhatta did not hear them because he had developed concentration only for
    one purpose, to achieve the Divine Power of Sight but not the Divine Power of Hearing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Buddha explained further that his disciples practised
    the noble life under him not to acquire such divine powers but with a view to the
    realization of dhammas which far excel and transcend these mundane kinds of
    concentrations. Such dhammas are attainments of the Four States of Noble Fruition - states
    of a stream-winner, a once-returner, a non-returner, and the state of mind and knowledge
    of an Arahat freed of all asavas that have been rendered extinct.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Path by which these dhammas can be realized is the
    Noble Path of Eight Constituents: Right View, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action,
    Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right mindfulness, Right Concentration. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b> (7) Jaliya Sutta</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Once when the Buddha was residing at Ghositarama
    Monastery near Kosambi, two wandering ascetics Mundiya and Jaliya approached him and asked
    whether the soul was the physical body or the physical body the soul, or whether the soul
    was one thing and the physical body another.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Buddha explained how a person who had finally
    realized liberation would not even consider whether the soul was the physical body, or the
    physical body the soul or whether the soul was one thing and the physical body another.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> <b>(8) Mahasihanada Sutta</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse defines what a true samanas, what a true
    brahmana is. The Buddha was residing in the Deer Park of Kannakathala at Urunna. Then the
    naked ascetic Kassapa approached him and said that he had heard that Samana Gotama
    disparaged all practices of self-mortification and that Samana Gotama reviled all those
    who led an austere life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Buddha replied that they were slandering him with
    what was not said, what was not true. When the Buddha could see with his supernormal
    vision the bad destinies as well as the good destinies of those who practised extreme form
    of self-mortification, and of those who practised less extreme forms of
    self-mortification, how could he revile all systems of self-mortification.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Kessapa then maintained that only those recluses who for
    the whole of their life cultivated the practice of standing or sitting, who were
    abstemious in food, eating only once in two days, seven days, fifteen days etc., were real
    samanas and brahmanas. The Buddha explained to him the futility of extreme
    self-mortification and said that only when a recluse practised to become accomplished in
    morality, concentration and knowledge; cultivated loving-kindness, and dwelt in the
    emancipation of mind, and emancipation through knowledge that he would be entitled to be
    called a samana and brahmana. Then the Buddha gave full exposition on morality,
    concentration and knowledge, resulting in Kassapa's decision to join the Order of the
    Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>(9) Potthapada Sutta</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once the Buddha was staying at the Monastery of
    Anathapindika in the Jeta Grove at Savatthi he visited the Ekasalaka Hall where various
    views were debated. At that time Potthapada the wandering ascetic asked him about the
    nature of the cessation of Consciousness (sanna). Potthapada wanted to know how the
    cessation of Consciousness was brought about. The Buddha told him that it was through
    reason and cause that forms of Consciousness in a being arose and ceased, A certain form
    of Consciousness arose through practice (Adhicitta sikkha) and a certain form of
    Consciousness ceased through practice.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Buddha then proceeded to expound on these practices
    consisting of observance of sila and development of concentration which resulted in
    arising and ceasing of successive jhanas. The meditator progressed from one stage to the
    next in sequence until he achieved the Cessation of all forms of Consciousness (nirodha
    samapatti).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>(10) Subha Sutta</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is a discourse given not by the Buddha but by his
    close attendant, the Venerable Ananda, on the request of young Subha. The Buddha had
    passed a way by then. And young Subha wanted to know from the lips of the Buddha's close
    attendant what dhammas were praised by the Buddha and what those dhammas were which he
    urged people to practise.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Ananda told him that the Buddha had words of praise for
    the three aggregates of dhamma, namely, the aggregate of morality, the aggregate of
    concentration and the aggregate of knowledge. The Buddha urged people to practise these
    dhammas, dwell in them, and have them firmly established. Ananda explained these
    aggregates of dhamma in great detail to young Subha, in consequence of which he became a
    devoted lay disciple.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>(11) Kevatta Sutta</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha was residing at Nalanda in Pavarika's mango
    grove. A devoted lay disciple approached the Buddha and urged him to let one of his
    disciples perform miracles so that the City of Nalanda would become ever so much devoted
    to the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Buddha told him about the three kinds of miracles
    which he had known and realised by himself through supernormal knowledge. The first
    miracle, iddhipatihariya was rejected by the Buddha because it could be mistaken as the
    black art called Gandhari magic. The Buddha also rejected the second miracle, adesana
    patihariya which might be mistaken as practice of Cintemani charm. He recommended the
    performance of the third miracle, the anusasani patihariya, the miracle of the power of
    the Teaching as it involved practice in Morality, Concentration and Knowledge leading
    finally to the extinction of Asavas, Asavakkhaye Nana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>(12) Lohicca Sutta</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The discourse lays down three types of blame worthy
    teachers: (i) The teacher who is not yet accomplished in the noble practice and teaches
    pupils who do not listen to him. (ii) The teacher who is not yet accomplished in the noble
    practice and teaches pupils who practise as instructed by him and attain emancipation.
    (iii) The teacher who is fully accomplished in the noble practice and teaches pupils who
    do not listen to him</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The praiseworthy teacher is one who has become fully
    accomplished in the three practices of Morality, Concentration and Knowledge and teaches
    pupils who become fully accomplished like him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>(13) Tevijja Sutta</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Two brahmin youths Vasettha and Bharadvaja came to see
    the Buddha while he was on a tour through the Kingdom of Kosala. They wanted the Buddha to
    settle their dispute as to the correct path that lead straight to companionship with the
    Brahma. Each one thought only the way shown by his own master was the true one.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Buddha told them that as none of their masters had
    seen the Brahma, they were like a line of blind men each holding on to the preceding one.
    Then he showed them the true path that really led to the Brahma realm, namely, the path of
    morality and concentration, and development of loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic
    joy and equanimity towards all sentient beings. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font COLOR="#0000FF">(b) Maha Vagga
    Pali</font></b> </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>The Large Division</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ten suttas in this division are some of the most
    important ones of the Tipitaka, dealing with historical, and biographical aspects as well
    as the doctrinal aspects of Buddhism. The most famous sutta is the Mahaparinibbana Sutta
    which gives an account of the last days and the passing away of the Buddha and the
    distribution of his relics. Mahapadana Sutta deals with brief accounts of the last seven
    Buddhas and the life story of the Vipassi Buddha. Doctrinally important are the two
    suttas: the Mahanidana Sutta which explains the Chain of Cause and Effect, and the
    Mahasatipatthana Sutta dealing with the four Methods of Steadfast Mindfulness and
    practical aspects of Buddhist meditation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>(1) Mahapadana Sutta</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse was given at Savatthi to the bhikkhus who
    were one day discussing the Buddha's knowledge of past existences. He told them about the
    last seven Buddhas, with a full life story of one of them, the Vipassi Buddha, recalling
    all the facts of the Buddhas, their social rank, name, clan, life-span, the pairs of Chief
    Disciples, the assemblies of their followers, their attainments, and emancipation from
    defilements.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Buddha explained that his ability to remember and
    recall all the facts of past existences was due to his own penetrating discernment as well
    as due to the devas making these matters known to him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>(2) Mahanidana Sutta</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse was given at Kammasadhamna market town to
    the Venerable Ananda to correct his wrong view that the doctrine of Paticcasamuppada,
    although having signs of being deep and profound, was apparent and fathomable. The Buddha
    told him that this doctrine not only appeared to be deep and profound but was actually
    deep and profound on four counts: it was deep in meaning, deep as a doctrine, deep with
    respect to the manner in which it was taught, and deep with regard to the facts on which
    it was established.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He then gave a thorough exposition on the doctrine and
    said that because of lack of proper understanding and penetrative comprehension of this
    doctrine, beings were caught in and unable to escape from, the miserable, ruinous round of
    rebirth. He concluded that without a clear understanding of this doctrine, even the mind
    of those, accomplished in the attainments of jhana, would be beclouded with ideas of atta.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>(3) Mahaparinibbana Sutta </b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This sutta is an important narrative of the Buddha's last
    days, a detailed chronicle of what he did, what he said and what happened to him during
    the last year of his life. Compiled in a narrative form, it is interspersed with many
    discourses on some of the most fundamental and important aspects of the Buddha's Teaching.
    Being the longest discourse of the Digha Nikaya, it is divided into six chapters.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> On the eve of the last great tour, the Buddha while
    staying at Rajagaha gave the famous discourses on seven factors of Non-decline of kings
    and princes and seven factors of Non-decline of the bhikkhus.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Then he set out on his last journey going first to the
    village of Patali where he taught on the consequences of an immoral and a moral life. He
    then proceeded to the village of Koti where he expounded on the Four Noble Truths. Then
    the Buddha took up his residence at the village of Natika where the famous discourse on
    the Mirror of Truth was given.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Next the Buddha went to Vesali with a large company of
    bhikkhus. At Vesali he accepted the park offered by the Courtesan Ambapali. From Vesali,
    the Buddha travelled to a small village named Veluva where he was overtaken by a severe
    illness that could have proved fatal. But the Buddha resolved to maintain the life-process
    and not to pass away without addressing his lay disciples and without taking leave of the
    Samgha. When Ananda informed the Buddha how worried he had been because of the Buddha's
    illness, the Buddha gave the famous injunction:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i> &quot;Let yourselves be your own support, your own
    refuge. Let the Dhamma, not anything else, be your refuge.&quot;</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> It was at Vesali that the Buddha made the decision to
    pass away and realize parinibbana in three months' time. Upon his making this momentous
    decision, there was a great earthquake. Ananda, on learning from the Buddha the reason of
    the earthquake, supplicated him to change the decision, but to no avail.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Buddha then caused the Samgha to be assembled to whom
    he announced his approaching parinibbana. He then went over all the fundamental principles
    of his Teaching and exhorted them to be vigilant, alert, and to watch over one's own mind
    so as to make an end of suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Buddha then left Vesali and went to Bhanda Village
    where he continued to give his discourses to the accompanying Samgha on sila, samadhi and
    panna. Proceeding further on his journey to the north, he gave the discourse on the four
    great Authorities, Mahapadesa, at the town of Bhoga.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> From there he went on to Pava and stayed in the Mango
    Grove of Cunda, the Goldsmith's son, who made an offering of food to the Buddha and his
    community of bhikkhus. After eating the meal offered by Cunda, a severe illness came upon
    the Buddha who nevertheless continued on his journey till he reached Kusinara where in the
    Sal Grove of the Malla princes he urged Ananda to lay out the couch for him. He lay down
    on the couch with mindfulness and deliberation, awaiting the hour of his parinibbana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Even on his death-bed the Buddha continued to teach,
    explaining that there are four places which arouse reverence and devotion, four persons
    worthy of a stupa, and answering Ananda's questions on how to conduct oneself with regard
    to women, or on what should be done regarding the remains of the Buddha. His last act of
    selflessness was to expound the Truth and show the Path to Subhadda, the wandering
    ascetic.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Then after ascertaining that there was not a single
    bhikkhu who had perplexity or doubt about the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Samgha, the
    Buddha uttered his last words: &quot;Inherent, in all compounded things is decay and
    dissolution. Strive well with full mindfulness.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Then as the assembled bhikkhus, princes and people paid
    homage to him with deep reverence, the Buddha passed away, realizing parinibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>(4) Mahasudassana Sutta </b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given by the Buddha while he was lying
    on his death-bed in the Sal Grove of the Mallas. When Ananda implored him not to realize
    parinibbana in an insignificant, barren, small town, the Buddha told him that Kusinara was
    not an insignificant, small place. In times long past, it was known as Kusavati, the
    capital city of Universal Monarchs who ruled over the four quarters of the world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Buddha then described the magnificence and grandeur
    of Kusavati when King Mahasudassana was the ruler there. He also told how the King ruled
    over his dominions righteously and how finally abandoning all attachments and practising
    jhana he passed away and reached the blissful Brahma realm.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Buddha revealed that he himself was King
    Mahasudassana of that time. He had cast off the body in this place (former Kusavati) for
    six times as a Universal Monarch. Now he was casting it off for the seventh and last time.
    He ended the discourse reminding Ananda that all compounded things are indeed impermanent.
    Arising and decaying are their inherent nature. Only their ultimate cessation is blissful
    Nibbana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b> (5) Janavasabha Sutta</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse is an extension of another discourse
    delivered by the Buddha on his last journey. Ananda wanted to know the destinies of lay
    disciples from the country of Magadha. The Buddha told him that innumerable persons from
    Magadha had reached the deva world by virtue of their faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma and
    the Samgha. This information was given him by Janavasabha Deva who was formerly King
    Bimbisara. He informed the Buddha that there were regular assemblies of devas in the deva
    realm on uposatha days when the king of the devas and Sanankumara Brahma taught the Dhamma
    on development of the Bases of Psychic Power, on the Three Opportunities, on the Four
    Methods of Steadfast Mindfulness and the Seven Accessories of Concentration.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b> (6) Mahagovinda Sutta</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> In this discourse, Pancasikha, a gandhabba deva, told the
    deva assembly where Sanankumara Brahma taught the Dhamma as shown by Mahagovinda, the
    Bodhisatta who had reached the Brahma world. The Buddha said that Mahagovinda was none
    other than himself and explained that the Dhamma he taught at that time could lead one
    only to the Brahma World. With his Teaching now as Enlightened Buddha, higher attainments
    such as the Sotapatti, Sakadagami, Anagami and the highest achievement Arahatta phala were
    possible.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> <b>(7) Mahasamaya Sutta</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Buddha was residing in the Mahavana forest at
    Kapilavatthu with a company of Arahats numbering five hundred. Then devas and Brahmas from
    ten thousand Cakkavalas came to see the Buddha and, the community of bhikkhus. The Buddha
    told his disciples the names of the devas and Brahmas as listed in this sutta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> <b>(8) Sakkapanha Sutta</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Once when the Buddha was residing at the Indasala Cave
    near Rajagaha, Sakka, the king of devas, came to him to ask certain questions. He wanted
    to know why there was hostility and violence among various beings. The Buddha told him it
    was envy and selfishness that brought about hostility among beings. He further explained
    that envy and selfishness were caused by likes and dislikes, which in turn had their roots
    in desire. And desire grew from mental pre-occupation (vitakka) which had its origin in
    samsara-expanding illusions (papanca-sanna-sankha).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Buddha then gave an outline of practices to remove
    these samsara-expanding illusions including two types of quests, quests that should be
    pursued and quests that should not be pursued.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b> (9) Mahasatipatthana Sutta</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This sutta is one of the most important doctrinal
    discourses of the Buddha. It propounds the only way for the purification of beings, for
    overcoming sorrow and lamentation, for the complete removal of pain and grief, for the
    attainment of the right path, and for the realization of Nibbana.' This discourse, given
    directly to the bhikkhus at the market town of Kammasadhamma, defines 'the only way' as
    the Four methods of Steadfast Mindfulness made up of fourteen ways of contemplating the
    body, nine ways of contemplating sensation, sixteen ways of contemplating the mind, and
    five ways of contemplating the dhamma. It ends with a definite assurance of fruitful
    results: Arahatship in this very existence or the state of an <i>anagam</i> within seven
    years, seven months or seven days.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> <b>(10) Payasi Sutta</b> </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse recounts how the Venerable
    Kumarakassapa showed the right path to Governor Payasi of Setabya town in Kosala country.
    Governor Payasi held the wrong belief: &quot;There is no other world; no beings arise
    again after death; there are no consequences of good or bad deeds.&quot; The Venerable
    Kumarakassapa showed him the right path, illustrating his teaching with numerous
    illuminating similes. Ultimately Payasi became full of faith and took refuge in the
    Buddha, the Dhamma and the Samgha. The Venerable Kumarakassapa taught him also the right
    kind of offerings to be made and that these offerings should be made with due respect, by
    one's own hands, with due esteem and not as if discarding them. Only under these
    conditions would the good deed of offerings bear splendid fruits. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font COLOR="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(c) Pathika Vagga Pali</b></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman"> This division is made up of eleven
    shorter discourses of a miscellaneous nature. They deal with the Buddha's rejection of
    wrong and severe asceticism practised by followers of many sects; they deal also with the
    periodical evolution and dissolution of the universe, the accounts of Universal Monarchs
    and the thirty two physiognomic characteristics of a great man. There is one discourse,
    Singala Sutta, addressed to a young brahmin showing the duties to be performed by members
    of the human society. The last two suttas, Sagiti and Dasuttara, are discourses given by
    the Venerable Sariputta and they contain lists of doctrinal terms classified according to
    subject matter and numerical units. The style of their composition is different from the
    other nine suttas of the division.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b> (1) Pathika Sutta</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> At the time of the Buddha, there were many other teachers
    with their own disciples, holding different views on what constituted the holy life, on
    the origin and development of the universe, and on the performance of wonders and
    miracles. Sunakkhatta, a Licchvi prince, became a disciple of the Buddha and was admitted
    into the Order.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But he found the discipline and the Teaching to be beyond
    him and his comprehension; he became at the same time attracted to the teachings and
    practices of other sects. He left the Order after three years. Then becoming a follower of
    one of the sects he began to disparage the teachings of the Buddha, and made slanderous
    attacks on the Buddha and his disciples. In Pathika Sutta are short discourses in which
    are accounts of the Buddha's refutation and explanation with reference to many of
    Sunakkhatta's accusations.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (2) Udumbarika Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> ( This discourse was given to Nigrodha the wandering
    ascetic and his followers in the Park of the Queen Udumbarika near Rajagaha, in order to
    destroy their wrong doctrine and establish wholesome doctrine. So obsessed were the
    wandering ascetics with their own wrong beliefs that they gave no response to the Buddha's
    invitation to follow his Teaching assuring them fruitful results within seven days.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (3) Cakkavatti Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> In the town of Matula, in the country of Magadha,
    bhikkhus were enjoined by the Buddha to be their own support, their own refuge; relying
    only on the Dhamma and not on any other refuge. Then the Buddha told them the story of
    Dalhanemi, the Universal Monarch, who possessed the Celestial Wheel as one of his seven
    treasures. He and his successor ruled over the four continents, wielding the power and
    authority of the Universal Monarch. Their life-span was long and as long as they remained
    righteous and fulfilled the noble duties of Universal Monarch, making the Dhamma their
    only support, providing shelter and security, offering wealth and necessities to the
    needy, their dominions remained at peace, prosperous and progressing.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> But when the Monarch failed to fulfil the noble duties of
    a righteous king, when the Dhamma was no longer held as a refuge, morality of the people
    declines. The life-span dwindled down to ten years only. Then ten meritorious deeds
    productive of wholesome effects completely disappeared and ten evil deeds giving
    unwholesome results flourished exceedingly. People failed to show reverential regard for
    the leaders and elders, to fulfil their duties towards parents, samanas and brahmanas.
    There also developed intense mutual aversion, ill will, thoughts of killing one another,
    followed by fighting, devastation and carnage.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> A few who survived the holocaust agreed to give up their
    evil ways, to live in a spirit of harmony, doing good deeds, showing reverential regard
    for the leaders and elders, fulfilling their duties towards parents, samanas and
    brahmanas. In consequence of improved morality, their life-span expanded again until it
    reached eighty thousand years when a Universal Monarch appeared once more to rule
    righteously. Bhikkhus were thus enjoined to keep within the confines of the Dhamma, making
    it their support, their refuge. The Dhamma would show the way for their physical and
    mental development until they attained Arahatship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (4) Agganna Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given at Savatthi to two novices under
    training, Vasettha and Bharadvaja, pointing out the wrong beliefs of brahmins as regards
    caste. The brahmins claimed that among the four classes of people, recognised at that
    time, brahmins were the noblest; next came the Khattiya class, the nobility and royalty;
    followed by Vessa, the trading class and Sudda, the lowest class.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Buddha refuted these claims of the brahmins, by
    explaining how the world was subjected to processes of evolution and dissolution and
    describing how human beings first appeared on earth and how the four social classes
    emerged. He explained further that the nobility of a person was decided not by his birth
    and lineage but by his morality and knowledge of the Noble Truths.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Whoever holds wrong views and commits misdeeds </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Whoever holds wrong views and commit misdeedsis not noble
    whatever his birth. Whoever restrains himself in deed, word and thought and develops the
    Bodhipakkhiya Dhammas until he attains complete eradication of defilements in this very
    life is the chief, the noblest amongst men and devas irrespective of birth.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> <b>(5) Sampasadaniya Sutta</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Venerable Sariputtat's deep confidence in the Buddha
    was once proclaimed aloud in an eloquent eulogy of the Buddha spoken in the Buddha's
    presence. For making this bold utterance on the virtues of the Buddha, the Buddha asked
    him whether he had personal knowledge of the minds of all the Buddhas, those of the past,
    of the future and of the present, their Morality, their Concentration, their Wisdom, and
    the manner of their emancipation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Venerable Sariputta said he did not claim to have
    such knowledge but justified himself by stating in detail the course of the Dhamma taken
    by all the Buddhas - their accomplishment in sila, abandonment of Live hindrances,
    establishment in the four Methods of Steadfast Mindfulness and cultivation of the Seven
    Factors of Enlightenment - the only course that could lead to unsurpassed Supreme
    Enlightenment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> <b>(6) Pasadika Sutta</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Venerable Ananda accompanied by bhikkhu Cunda went to
    see the Buddha to give him the news about the death of Nigantha Nataputta, the leader of a
    well-known sect, and the schism that had arisen amongst his disciples.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Buddha told them that it was natural and to be
    expected to happen in a Teaching which was not well taught, not well imparted, not
    conducive to emancipation, and not taught by one who was supremely enlightened.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In contrast, the Buddha explained that when the Teaching
    was well taught, well imparted by one who was supremely enlightened, there were no wrong
    views, no speculations about past or future or about atta. In the Teaching of the Buddha,
    bhikkhus were taught the Four Methods of Steadfast Mindfulness by which wrong views and
    speculations were laid aside.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> <b>(7) Lakkhana Sutta</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse on thirty two bodily marks of a great man
    was given by the Buddha at Savatthi, in the Anathapindika's Monastery. For a person
    endowed with the thirty two bodily marks of a great man, only two possible courses are
    open to him and no other. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> &quot;If he lives the household life, he will become a
    Universal Monarch ruling in righteousness over the four continents. If he goes forth from
    the home life into homelessness, he will become an Enlightened Buddha.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Buddha explained the thirty two bodily marks in
    detail, together with accounts of meritorious deeds previously performed by virtue of
    which each of these thirty-two bodily marks were acquired.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (8) Singala Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given by the Buddha at Rajagaha for
    the edification of a young man named Singala. The youth Singala used to worship the six
    cardinal points, namely, the East, the South, the West, the North, the Nadir and the
    Zenith in obedience to the last advice given by his dying father. The Buddha explained to
    the young man that according to his Teaching, the six directions were: The East standing
    for parents; The South standing for teachers; The West standing for the wife and children;
    The North standing for friends and associates; The Nadir standing for servants, employees;
    The Zenith standing for samanas, brahmanas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Buddha explained further that the six social groups
    mentioned in the discourse were to be regarded as sacred and worthy of respect and
    worship. One worshipped them by performing one's duties towards them. Then these duties
    were explained to the youth Singala.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (9) Atanatiya Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Four Celestial Kings came to see the Buddha and told him
    that there were non-believers among many invisible beings who might bring harm to the
    followers of the Buddha. The Celestial Kings therefore wanted to teach the bhikkhus the
    protecting incantation known as the Atanatiya Paritta. The Buddha gave his consent by
    remaining silent.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Then the four Celestial Kings recited the Atanatiya
    Paritta, which the Buddha advised bhikkhus, bhikkhunis and lay disciple to learn, to
    memorise so that they might dwell at ease, well guarded and protected. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> <b>(10) Sangiti Sutta</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Buddha was touring through the country of the Mallas
    when he came to Pava. The death of Nigantha Nataputta had taken place only recently and
    his followers were left in dissession and strife, wrangling over doctrines.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Venerable Sariputta who delivered this discourse
    attributed this schism among Nataputta's followers to the fact that Nataputta's Teaching
    had not been well taught nor well imparted, and was not conducive to release from the
    round of existences, being taught by one who was not supremely enlightened.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> But the Buddha's Teaching was well taught, well imparted,
    conducive to release from the round of existences, being taught by the Buddha who was
    supremely enlightened. He advised the bhikkhus to recite the Dhamma as taught by the
    Buddha, in concord and without dissension so that the Teaching should last long. Then he
    proceeded to enumerate the Dhamma classified under separate heads as Group of the Ones,
    Group of the Twos, etc., up to the Group of the Tens to facilitate easy memorising and
    reciting.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> <b>(11) Dasuttara Sutta</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse was also delivered by the Venerable
    Sariputta, while the Buddha was staying at Campa, in order that the bhikkhus should get
    liberated from fetters, and attain Nibbana, bringing about the end of suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> He taught the Dhamma classified under separate heads as
    Group of the Ones, Group of the Twos, etc. up to the Group of the Tens. </font></p>
