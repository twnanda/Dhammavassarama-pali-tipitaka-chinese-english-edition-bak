    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Collection of Medium Length Discourses
    of the Buddha.</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This collection of medium length discourses is made up of
    one hundred and fifty two suttas in three books known as pannasa. The first book,
    Mulapannasa, deals with the first fifty suttas in five vaggas, the second book,
    Majjhimapannasa consists of the second fifty suttas in five vaggas too; and the last fifty
    two suttas are dealt with in five vaggas of the third book, Uparipannasa, which means more
    than fifty. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The suttas in this Nikaya throw much light on the social
    ideas and institutions of those days, and also provide general information on the economic
    and political life.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font COLOR="#0000FF" face="Times New Roman"><b>(a) Mulapannasa Pali</b></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><i>I. Mulapariyaya Vagga</i></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (1) Mulapariyaya Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Buddha explained the basis of all phenomena,
    specifying twenty four categories such as the four elements (earth, water, fire, wind);
    sentient beings, devas; the seen, the heard, the thought of, the known; the oneness, the
    multiplicity, the whole; and the reality of Nibbana. The uninstructed worldling cannot
    perceive the true nature of these phenomena; only the enlightened ones can see them in
    true perspective.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (2) Sabbasava Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> In this discourse, mental intoxicants that beset the
    uninstructed worldling are defined, and seven practices for eradicating them are
    explained.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b> (3) Dhammadayada sutta</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This sutta contains two separate discourses, the first one
    given by the Buddha, the second by the Venerable Sariputta. The Buddha urged the bhikkhus
    to receive as their legacy from him the Bodhipakkhiya Dhamma only, and not material things
    like the four requisites. The Venerable Sariputta advised the bhikkhus to lead a solitary
    life for attainment of jhana and to strive for the attainment of Nibbana by abandoning
    greed, ill will, and delusion.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(4) Bhayabherava Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse describes how a bhikkhu leading a solitary
    life in a secluded forest invites harm and danger to himself by his impure thoughts, words
    and deeds, and how the Buddha had lived a peaceful forest life harmlessly by cultivating
    pure thoughts, words and deeds which finally led him to enlightenment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> <b>(5) Anangana Sutta</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> In this discourse given on the request of the Venerable
    Maha Moggallana, the Venerable Sariputta explained four types of individuals:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> (i) an impure person who knows he is impure;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(ii) an impure person who does not know he is impure;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> (iii) a pure person who knows his own purity; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(iv) a pure person who does not know his own purity.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (6) Akankheyya Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This sutta describes how a bhikkhu should develop sila,
    samadhi and panna, instead of hankering after gain and fame; how he should restrain his
    faculties, seeing danger in the slightest fault. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (7) Vattha Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this discourse the Buddha explained the difference
    between an impure mind and a pure mind by giving the example of dirty cloth and clean
    cloth. Only the clear cloth will absorb dye; so also only the pure mind will retain the
    dhamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(8) Sallekha Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> In this discourse the Buddha explained to Maha Cunda how
    wrong views about atta and loka can be removed only by vipassana insight. Jhanic practice
    is not the austerity practice that removes moral defilements; jhanic practice only leads
    to a blissful existence. Only refraining from forty-four kinds of bad deeds constitutes
    austerity practice for removing moral defilements. The volition alone to do a good deed is
    enough to produce a good result; when it is accompanied by the actual deed, the beneficial
    result accruing is immeasurable. One immersed in the mire of sensuous impurities cannot
    rescue others immersed likewise in the mire.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (9) Samma-ditthi Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse is an exposition on the right view
    delivered by the Venerable Sariputta at Savatthi. When physical, verbal and mental actions
    are motivated by greed, hatred and delusion, they are deemed to be bad. When they arise
    through non-greed, non-hatred and non-delusion, the actions are deemed to be good. Right
    View is understanding what a good deed is and what a bad deed is; it is the full
    comprehension of the Four Noble Truths and not holding on to eternity views concerning
    atta.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>(10) Mahasatipatthana Sutta</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse given at Kammasadhamma market town is the
    most important sutta which gives practical guidance for cultivation of mindfulness. It
    describes the Four Methods of Steadfast Mindfulness, namely, contemplating the body,
    contemplating sensation, contemplating the mind, and contemplating the dhamma as the one
    and only way for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation,
    for the complete destruction of pain and distress, for the attainment of the Noble Magga
    and for the realization of Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This sutta appears in identical form in the Digha Nikaya.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman"><em><strong>II. Sihanada Vagga</strong></em></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (1) Culasinhanada Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> In this discourse, given at Savatthi, the Buddha made the
    bold statement that the four Categories of Ariyas, namely, the Stream-winner, the
    Once-returner, the Non-returner and the Arahat exist only in his Teaching and not in any
    other. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(2) Mahasihanda Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this discourse, given at Vesali, the Venerable
    Sariputta reported to the Buddha about the disparagement of the Buddha's virtues made by
    Sunakkhatta who had left the Teaching. The Buddha said that Sunakkhatta was not
    intellectually equipped to have the faintest glimpse of the Buddha's virtues such as the
    Ten Strengths, the four kinds of supreme Self-Confidence, the Non-decline of Sabbannuta
    Nana till the time of parinibbana. He then described the five destinations and the actions
    which lead to them as well as the wrong beliefs and practices of the naked ascetics to
    whose camp Sunakkhatta now belonged.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (3) Mahadukkhakkhandha Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given at Savatthi to refute the naked
    ascetics when they tried to make out that they followed the same path and taught the same
    dhammas the Buddha. The Buddha also explained to the bhikkhus what the pleasures of the
    senses wore, what their faults and dangers were, and the way of escape from them. The
    Buddha explained further that outside of his Teaching, these dhammas were not known and no
    one but the Buddha and his disciples could teach such dhamnas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(4) Culadukkhakkhandha Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse, given by the Buddha, at Kapilavatthu to
    the Sakyan Prince Mahanama to explain to him on his request, how greed, ill will and
    ignorance caused moral defilements and suffering.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (5) Anumana Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given by the Venerable Maha Moggallana
    to many bhikkhus at Susumaragira in the country of Bhagga. They were urged to see if they
    had purged themselves of sixteen kinds of stubbornness such as inordinate desire,
    humiliating others while praising oneself, wrathfulness, etc. If these sixteen kinds of
    unwholesome dhammas were detected in oneself, a determined effort should bo made to get
    rid of them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (6) Cetokhila Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse, given by the Buddha at Savatthi, mentions
    the five kinds of mental thorns: doubt about the Buddha, doubt about the Dhamma, doubt
    about the Sahgha, doubt about the efficacy of the practice in sila, samadhi and panna, ill
    will and animosity towards fellow bhikkhus. It also mentions the five fetters: attachment
    to sensual desires, attachment to oneself, attachment to material objects; immoderation in
    eating and sleeping, and adopting the holy life with the limited objective of attaining to
    blissful existences only. These mental thorns and fetters are obstacles to liberation from
    dukkha. They should be removed and eradicated for realization of Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (7) Vanapattha Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse, given at Savatthi, is concerned with tha
    choice of a suitable place for a bhikkhu.A bhikkhu has to depend on a forest glade or a
    village, or a town or an individual for his residence and support.If he finds out any
    particular place is not satisfactory for his spiritual development or for material
    support, he should abandon that place at once.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> If he finds it satisfactory with respect to material
    support, but not beneficial for spiritual development, he should abandon that place, too.
    But when it proves beneficial for spiritual development, even if the material support is
    meagre, the bhikkhu should stay on in that place. When conditions are satisfactory both
    for spiritual development and material support, he should live for the whole of his life
    in such a place. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (8) Madhupindika Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> A Sakyan Prince named Dandapani, once asked the Buddha at
    Kapilatthu what doctrine he taught.The Buddha replied that his doctrtne was one which
    could not be grasped by any brahman nor by the Mara. It is this: not living in discord
    with any one in the world; not obsessed by sense impressions (sanna); not troubled by
    doubts; and rot craving for any form of existence</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (9) <font COLOR="#0000FF">Dvedavitakka Sutta</font>
    </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given by the Buddha at Savatthi to
    explain two kinds of thinking: wholesome and unwholesome. Bhikkhus should practise to see
    the advantages of engaging in wholesome thoughts and the dangers of unwholesome thoughts.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (10) Vitakkasanthana Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse was given by the Buddha at
    Savatthi on how to combat the arising of unwholesome thoughts with wholesome thoughts. For
    example, greed and sensuous thoughts should be banished by contemplating on unpleasentness
    and impermanency of the object of desire; illwill and hatred must be countered by thoughts
    of loving-kindness; and ignorance may be overcome by seeking illumination and guidance
    from the teacher. </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><i>III. Opamna Vagga</i></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>(1) Kakacupama Sutta</b> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given by the Buddha at Savatthi in
    connection with Bhikkhu Moliyaphagguna who was friendly with bhikkhunis. When others
    censured him for being too friendly with bhikkhunis, he lost his temper and broke into
    quarrel with bhikkhus who criticized him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> When the Buddha admonished and advised him to keep away
    from bhikkhunis and to control his temper, he remained recalcitrant. The Buddha showed the
    harmfulness of ill temper and advised other bhikkhus to keep a tight check on their
    temper, not losing it even when some one was sawing away their limbs into bits.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (2) Alagaddupama Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given by the Buddha at Savatthi.
    Bhikkhu Arittha misunderstood the Buddha's Teaching and maintained that the Buddha showed
    how to enjoy sensuous pleasure without jeopardising one's progress in the Path. When the
    Buddha remonstrated with him for his wrong views he remained unrepentent.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Buddha then spoke to the bhikkhus on the wrong way
    and the right way of learning the dhamma, giving the simile of a snake catcher, and the
    simile of the raft.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (3) Vammika Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given by the Buddha at Savatthi.
    Venerable Kumarakassapa was asked by a deva a set of fifteen questions which he brought to
    the Buddha for elucidation. The Buddha explained to him the meaning of the questions and
    assisted him in their solution.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (4) Rathavinita Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This sutta recounts the dialogue between the Venerable
    Siriputta and the Venerable Punna at Savatthi on the seven stages of purity, such as
    purity of sila, purity of mind, purity of view etc., that must be passed before attainment
    to Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (5) Nivapa Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given by the Buddha at Savatthi on the
    snares that waylay bhikkhus on their path, making use of the simile of the hunter, the
    hunter's followers, the green pasture and four different herds of deer. The hunter was
    likened to Mara, the hunter's crowd to Mara's followers, the green pasture he had set up
    to the sensuous pleasures, and four different herds of deer to four different types of
    recluses who left homelife.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (6) Pasarasi Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This sutta given by the Buddha at Savatthi is also known
    by the name of Ariyapariyesana Sutta. The Buddha recounted his life from the time he was
    born in the human world as the son of King Suddhodana till the moment of the great
    discourse on the Turning of the Wheel of Dhamma, giving details of his renunciation,
    initial wrong practices of severe asceticism and final discovery of the Noble Path of
    Eight Constituents. In particular, stress was laid on two different types of quests, the
    Noble and the Ignoble. He explained that it was extremely unwise to go after sensual
    pleasures which subject one to ageing, disease and death. The most noble quest was to seek
    out that which will liberate one from ageing, disease and death.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (7) Culahatthipadopama Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This sutta was given by the Buddha at Savatthi. The
    Brahmin Janussoni asked the wandering ascetic Pilotika, who had just come back from the
    Buddha, whether he knew all the virtues and accomplishments of the Buddha. The wandering
    ascetic replied that only a Buddha who could match another Buddha in attainments could
    know all the virtues of the other. As for him, he could only exercise his imagination in
    this respect just as a hunter would judge the measurements of an elephant from the size of
    its footprints.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Later when the Brahmin Janussoni went to see the Buddha,
    and recounted his conversation with the wandering ascetic the buddha told him that the
    size of an elephant's footprint might still be misleading. Only when one followed the
    footprints, and the animal was seen grazing in the open, its true measurements could be
    accurately judged. So also the virtues of the Buddha and his Teaching could be fully
    appreciated and understood only when one followed his Teaching and practised as taught by
    him until the final goal of Arahatship was reached. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (8) Mahahatthipadopama Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given by the Venerable Sariputta to
    the bhikkhus at Savatthi using the simile of the elephant's footprint. He explained that
    just as the footprint of all animals could be contained within the footprint of an
    elephant, all wholesome dhammas were comprised in the Four Noble Truths.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (9) Mahasaropama Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given by the Buddha at Rajagaha in
    connection with Devadatta who remained contened with gain and fame because of his
    attainment of supernormal powers and left the Teaching to cause schism in the Order. The
    Buddha said that this Teaching was not for the purpose of gain and fame which were like
    the external shoots and branches of a tree; nor just for the accomplishment in sila which
    may be likened to the outer crust of a tree; nor for mere establishing of concentration to
    achieve supernormal powers which were like the bark of a tree. The Dhamma was taught for
    the attainment of Arahatship, the noble liberation which alone resembled the inner path of
    a tree.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (10) Culasaropama Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was givenbythe Buddha at Savatthi in
    connection with the Brahmin Pingalakoccha who asked the Buddha whether all the six
    teachers claiming to be Buddhas were really enlightened. The Buddha explained that the
    Brahmacariya practice taught by a Buddha led to Arahatship, not just to the achievement of
    gain and fame, or supernormal powers.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><em>IV. <i>Mahayamaka Vagga</i></em></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(1) Culagosinga Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Venerable Anuruddha, the Venerable Nandiya and the
    Venerable Kimila were staying in the Gosinga Sal tree woodland. The Buddha visited them
    and praised them on their way of living, practising the holy life with perfect harmony and
    concord amongst themselves, thus forming an adornment to the lovely woodland park.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (2) Mahagosinga Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Once while the Buddha was residing in the Gosinga Sal
    tree woodland, the Venerable Sariputta asked the Buddha, 'Who would most adorn this
    woodland park and enhance its beauty?' The discourse records the different answers
    provided by the Venerables Revata, Anuruddha, Maha Kassapa, Maha Moggallana, Sariputta and
    by the Buddha himself. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (3) Mahagopalaka Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse, given by the Buddha at Savatthi, explains
    the conditions under which the Teaching would grow and prosper and the conditions under
    which it would decline and decay. The example of a cowherd is given. When a cowherd is
    equipped with eleven skills of managing and tending his cattle, there is progress and
    growth in his work. So also when the bhikkhu is skilled and accomplished in eleven factors
    such as knowledge of truth about the khandhas, practice of sila, samadhi and panna, etc.,
    the Teaching will grow and prosper. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (4) Culagopalaka Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse deals with eleven factors, the failure to
    fulfil which would contribute to the down fall and ruin of the Teaching. Just as the
    cattle under the care of an unwise and unskilful cowherd crossed the river from a wrong
    quay on the bank and met with destruction instead of reaching the other shore, so also the
    followers of the teachers who were not accomplished in the knowledge of truth, khandhas,
    etc.,would end up only in disaster.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (5) Culasaccaka Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse, given at Vesali, gives an account of the
    debate between the Buddha and Saccaka the wandering ascetic on the subject of atta.
    Saccaka maintained that rupa, vedana, sanna, sankhara and vivvana were one's atta. It was
    atta which enjoyed the fruits of good deeds and suffered the consequences of bad deeds.
    The Buddha refuted his theory, pointing out that none of the khandhas was atta each being
    subjected to the laws of anicca, dukkha, and anatta, and not amenable to anyone's control.
    Saccaka had to admit his defeat in the presence of his followers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (6) Mahasaccaka Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The same Saccaka, the wandering ascetic, came again to
    the Buddha the next day and asked about the cultivation of mind and body. He knew only the
    wrong methods of developing concentration. The Buddha explained to Saccaka the various
    practices he himself had followed and mistakes he had made until he found the middle Path
    that finally led him to the realization of Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (7) Culatanhasankhaya Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On enquiry by the king of devas how a disciple of the
    Buddha trained himself to realize Nibbana, the Buddha gave him a short description of how
    a house holder, after leaving his home, put himself on a course of training that gradually
    purified his mind of all moral defilements and led him to the final goal.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (8) Mahatanhasankhaya Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> A disciple of the Buddha, Sati by name, held the view
    that the Buddha taught: &quot;The same consciousness transmigrates and wanders
    about..&quot; Other disciples tried to rid him of this wrong view but to no avail. The
    Buddha told him that he never taught such wrong views. He only taught &quot;Consciousness
    arises out of conditions; there is no arising of Consciousness without conditions.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (9) Maha-assapura Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The people of Assapura, a market town of Anga country,
    were ardently devoted to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Samgha, helping and assisting the
    members of the Order by offering them the bhikkhu requisites. Out of gratitude for such
    support, the Buddha urged the bhikkhus to make strenuous efforts in their training and
    practice of Dhamma, gradually going up stage by stage: starting from avoiding evil deeds
    by restraint of physical and vocal actions, to proceed to mental restraint through
    meditation, then progressing towards attainment of four stages of jhana, and finally to
    the stage where all moral defilemsnts were eliminated and Nibbana was attained.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (10) Cula-assapura Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Out of gratitude for the support given by the lay
    devotees of Assapura, a market town in the country of Anga, the buddha urged the bhikkhus
    to be worthy of the name of samana and brahmana. Samana means one who has stilled his
    passions; brahmana one who has rid him self of defilements. A bhikkhu should therefore
    subject himself to the course of discipline and practice as laid down by the Buddha until
    he had eliminated the twelve defilements such as envy, ill will, deceit, wrong views. etc.
    </font></p>
    <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><em>V. <i>Culayamaka Vagga</i></em></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(1) Saleyyaka Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This exposition was given to villagers of Sala on ten
    demeritorious deeds that would lead to states of misery and woe and ten meritorious deeds
    that would give rise to rebirth in happy realms.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (2) Veranjaka Sutta </strong></font></p>

    Venerable Sariputta at Savatthi regarding an Uninstructed, person with no panna, and
    instructed persons with panna; many questions on vinnana and vedana, on the difference
    between panna and vinnana, and many other things. The Venerable Sariputta obliged him with

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was delivered at Campa in connection with
    Kandaraka, the wandering ascetic, and Pessa, son of elephant rider, who marvelled at the
    silence maintained by the huge congregation of bhikkhus, not making any sound, not even a
    sneeze nor a cough. The Buddha explained that their silence was due to their
    accomplishments in samadhi and to their training on four Methods of Steadfast Mindfulness.
    The Buddha also elucidated the four types of individuals engaged in meditation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (2) Atthakanagara Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The householder Dasama of Attahaka wanted to know if

    Venerable Ananda informed him there was a group of dhammas,eleven in number, namely, the
    four jhanas, the four Brahmavihara practices and Akasanankayatana, Vinnanancayatana,
    Akincannayatana. Contemplating the impermanent nature of each of those dhammas would lead

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Potaliya had left worldly affairs behind with a view to
    lead the holy life. When the Buddha saw him dressed in ordinary everyday attire, the
    Buddha addressed him as 'Gahapati', householder, which Potaliya resented. The Buddha
    explained to him that in the vocabulary of the Vinaya one was said to have cut oneself off
    from the world only when one refrained from killing, stealing, telling lies, slandering,
    and only when one was abstemious, not conceited, and controlled in one's temper. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse was given at Rajagaha in connection with
    Jivaka, the great physician, who enquired whether it was true that the Buddha ate the meat
    of animals killed purposely for him. The Buddha told him that he had made it a rule for
    the bhikkhus not to partake of any meat which they saw or heard or had reason to suspect
    to be especially prepared for them. Further, a bhikkhu should not show eagerness for food
    nor be greedy in eating; he should eat with reflection that he took the meal only to
    sustain the body in order to pur sue the path of liberation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(6) Upali Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A prominent, wealthy lay disciple of Nigantha Nataputta
    was sent by his master to meet the Buddha and defeat him in argument on certain aspects of
    the Theory of Kamma. Whereas the Nigantha stressed on the physical and vocal actions being
    more productive of resultant effects, the Buddha maintained that it was volition or mental
    action that was paramount. By means of his discourse the Buddha converted Upali, and
    overwhelmed by intense wrath over the loss of his most prominent disciple, Nataputta died.</font></p>

    (ii) white deed leading to white result, (iii) deed which is both black and white leading

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Prince Abhayarajakumara was sent by Niganttha Nataputta to
    ask the Buddha whether he uttered unpleasant words about the destiny of Devadatta. The

    utterances: words which are true, profitable but not pleasant to others and words which
    are true, profitable and pleasant to others.</font></p>

    in number by including the upekkha vedana or five, six, eighteen or thirty six, or one
    hundred and eight, depending on the method of enumeration. Ordinarily sensations that
    arise from pleasures of the senses are regarded as sukha, or happiness. But the Buddha
    explains that the acme of happiness is attainment of nirodha samapatti.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(10) Apannaka Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse was given by the Buddha to the villagers of
    Sala in the country of Kosala who had not yet accepted any of the teachings taught by
    leaders of the various sects visiting their village. The Buddha showed them the right path
    which would not lead them astray. The wrong views of the sectarians were contrasted
    against the right views propounded by the Buddha; the disadvantages of wrong views, and
    the advantages of right views were explained. </font></p>

    meditation and gave him another discourse on the four great elements. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(3) Culamalukya Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse was given at Savatthi to the bhikkhu
    Malukya. Bhikkhu Malukya interrupted his meditation one afternoon, went to the Buddha and
    asked him the well known classical questions: Is the universe eternal or not etc.; is the
    soul the same as the body, is soul one thing and body another, etc.; does life exist after
    death, or does it not exist after death.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha explained to him that the practice of the holy
    life did not dapend upon these views.What ever view one may hold about them, there would
    still be birth, ageing, decay, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, distress. The
    Buddha said that he taught only about dukkha, the cause of dukkha, the cessation of dukkha
    and the way leading to the cessation of dukkha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(4) Mahamalukya Sutta </strong></font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(5) Bhaddali Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse, given at Savatthi, is an exhortation to
    bhikkhu Bhaddali who refused to obey the disciplinary rule of not eating after midday and
    in the evening; the Buddha explained why bhikkhus in the Teaching should respect the
    disciplinary rules laid down by him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(6) Latukikopama Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse was given to the Venerable Udayi. in
    connection with observance of disciplinary rules and precepts. When the five strengths
    (balas), namely, faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration and insight are not well
    developed, the bhikkhu finds even a paltry restraint like refraining from eating meals in
    the afternoon and in the evening very irksome and onerous. But when the five Balas are
    fully developed, even stringent rules can be observed without any difficulty or discomfort</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(7) Catuma Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse was given at Catuma to the disciples of the
    Venerable Sariputta and the Venerable Maha Moggallana, who came with five hundred bhikkhus
    to see the Buddha. The five hundred bhikkhus made a lot of noise while settling down. The
    Buddha refused to see them at first, but later relented and taught them the dangers in the
    life of a bhikkhu. Just as there are dangers and hazards in a sea like stormy waves,
    crocodiles, whirlpools, and sharks, so also there are dangers against which the bhikkhu
    must be always on guard, namely, ill will against those who instruct them and guide them;
    dissatisfaction with training rules such as those concerning taking of meals or dealing
    with womenfolk; and pleasures of senses. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(8) Nalakapana Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse was given to the Venerable Anuruddha and to
    the villagers of Nalakapana to explain that unless a bhikkhu had attained the higher
    stages of Magga and Phala, accomplishments in supernormal psychic powers may prove to be
    harmful to him. The Buddha him self talked about the destinations of the departed persons
    not to earn praise and admiration but to arouse enthusiasm and faith in his disciples.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(9) Goliyani Sutta </strong></font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(1) Tevijjavaccha Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vacchagotta, the wandering ascetic, questioned the Buddha
    whether it would be true to say that Sabbannuta Nana was constantly and continuosly
    present to him all the time, while walking or standing, asleep or awake. The Buddha
    replied that it would not be true to say so. It would be true to say only that the Buddha
    was accomplished in the three kinds of knowledge, namely, knowledge of the past, power of
    divine seeing, and knowledge of liberation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(2) Aggivaccha Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse was given by the Buddha at Savatthi in
    connection with Vacchagotta who approached the Buddha quite often to ask many questions
    about atta. On this occasion too he asked the Buddha whether there was atta, whether atta
    was permanent, etc. The Buddha told him he held no theories about atta because he had seen
    the nature of things as they really were. Then he explained to him the dhamma in some
    detail..</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(3) Mahavaccha Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse was given by the Buddha toVaccha gotta at
    Rajagaha. On his visit to the Buddha after a long interval, Vacchagotta no longer troubled
    the Buddha with his speculations about atta, loka etc.; in stead, he requested to be
    taught on good and bad deeds (Kusalakusalam Kammam) in brief. The Buddha explained to him
    the dhamma on good and bad deeds in brief as well as in detail.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Vacchagotta became a disciple of the Buddha and received
    admission into the Order. Then practising the dhamms as instructed, he ultimately attained
    Arahatship, realizing Nibbana. The problems of atta, loka etc., no longer obsessed him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(4) Dighanakha Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This important discourse was given by the Buddha in the
    Sukarakhata cave near Rajagaha, to Dighanakha, the wandering ascetic, a nephew of the
    Venera ble Sariputta, in order to remove his wrong views of annihilation. As the Buddha
    taught him the dhamma on contemplation of the body and contemplation of sensation (sukha,
    dukkha, adukkhamasukha), his uncle the Venerable Sariputta was standing behind the Buddha,
    fanning him. It was only fifteen days ago that the Venerable Sariputta had been admitted
    into the Order by the Buddha. While following the progress of the discourse, as though
    sharing the food prepared for another, the Venerable Sariputta advanced rapidly from the
    stage of a Sotapanna which he had already reached, and attained the perfect state of
    Arahatship with the fourfold Analytical Knowledge (Patisambhida Nana). At the end of the
    discourse his nephew, the wandering ascetic Dighanakha, became a Sotapanna.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(5) Magandiya Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse was given by the Buddha at the market town
    of Kammasadhamma in the Kuru country in connection with Magandiya, the wandering ascetic,
    who resented the Buddha's criticism of his wrong beliefs. The Buddha exhorted him to
    practise control of the senses and sensuous thoughts. He told the wandering ascetic the
    story of his renunciation, how he had left his luxurious palaces and how, on discovering
    the Truth, he found happiness in Arahattaphala which was far superior to any of the
    sensuous pleasures. Magandiya gave up his wrong views to become a disciple of the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(6) Sandaka Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse was given at Kosambi to Sandaka, the
    wandering ascetic, and his followers by the Venerable Ananda. The Venerable Ananda
    explained to them the four wrong views of sect-leaders who held there was no existence
    after death, that there was no evil nor good, no cause for any phenomena, and that there
    are only aggregate of seven elements. Finally he taught the wandering ascetics the dhamma
    as expounded by the Buddha. As a consequence of his teaching, Sandaka and his followers
    abandoned their wrong views and became disciples of the Buddha. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(7) Mahasakuludayi Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At one time the Buddha and his company of bhikkhus were
    residing at Rajagaha where six leaders of sects were also spending the rains with their
    respective followers. Then Udayi, the wandering ascetic, who was visited by the Buddha,
    extolled the virtues of the Buddha saying that other leaders were sometimes criticised
    even by their followers, whereas the Buddha was the exception. Even if the Buddha's
    disciples left the Order, they did not find fault with the Buddha nor the Dhamma. They
    only blamed themselves for not being able to follow his Teaching. Udayi attributed this
    difference in reverential respect enjoyed by the Buddha to five aspects of his virtues.
    The Buddha rejected Udayi's enumeration of his virtues which were mostly attributed to
    ascetic practices, and explained to him the real cause of the total veneration bestowed on
    him by his followers. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (8) Samanamundika Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The wandering ascetic Uggahamana, son of Samana mundika,
    was teaching that any recluse who refrained from wrong deed, wrong word, wrong thought,
    and wrong livelihood was a fully accomplished Arahat. The Buddha rejected his assertion,
    saying that in that case, even an infant sleeping innocently upon his bed could claim to
    Arahatship. He then explained that it was only the Noble Path of Eight Constituents
    leading to Right Knowledge and Right Liberation that could bring about realization of
    Arahatship. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (9) Culasakuludayi Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse was given at Rajagaha. The wandering
    ascetic Sakuludayi asked the Buddha many questions about atta and sila, and the Buddha
    explained to him the practice in the Teaching beginning with the precept of not taking the
    life of a being and ending with the realization of Nibbana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (10) Vekhanasa Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse was given at Savatthi. The Buddha explained
    to Vekhanasa, the wandering ascetic, how happiness accruing from spiritual attainments was
    superior to that derived from sensuous pleasures. The Buddha also gave the assurance that
    any honest worker who would follow his instructions sincerely could enjoy the bliss of
    spiritual attainments. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(1) Ghatikara Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse, given by the Buddha while journeying in
    Kosala, recounts the story of high devotion of Ghatikara, the potter, who looked after his
    blind parents and who at the same time attended upon Kassapa Buddha with utter reverence.
    There was also the account of how Ghatikara forcibly pulled along his friend, young
    Jotipala, to where Kassapa Buddha was, to pay respect. After hearing the dhamma discourses
    young Jotipala left the household life to be admitted into the Order by Kassapa Buddha.
    This interesting ancient episode that had happened in Kassapa Buddha's time many aeons ago
    was recounted to the Venerable Ananda by Gotama Buddha standing on the very spot where
    once stood, a long, long time ago, the house of Ghatikara, the potter. The Buddha
    concluded his story by revealing that young Jotipala was none other than the present
    Gotama Buddha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(2) Ratthapala Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Ratthapala, the son of a wealthy brahmin obtained his
    parents' permission with great difficulty to become a bhikkhu under the guidance of the
    Buddha. After twelve years of strenuous endeavour, when he became a full-fledged Arahat,
    he visited his parents' home. His parents attempted to entice him with wealth and wife,
    back to household life but to no avail. He taught his parents the law of impermanence,
    anicca; he said he saw nothing alluring in the wealth and the wife. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(3) Maghadeva Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse was given at the Royal mango grove at
    Mithila. The Buddha told the Venerable Ananda about the noble tradition laid down by the
    righteous King Maghadeva. When his hair began to turn white, he gave up the household life
    leaving his dominions to his eldest son. This tradition was handed down from king to son
    for generations and generations, over thousands and thousands of years until the reign of
    King Nimi. King Nimi had a son by the name of Kalarajanaka who did not go forth from home
    life into homelessness when the time came like his predecessors. Kalarajanaka terminated
    the noble practice laid down by the tradition. He thus became the last person of that
    tradition. The Buddha revealed that he was the King Maghadeva of that ancient time laying
    down the noble tradition. The Buddha said that that noble tradition did not lead to calm,
    to higher knowledge. It only led to the realm of Brahmas. But the noble practice which he
    was leading now as a Buddha certainly led to the disillusionment with the five khandhas,
    the abandonment of attachment and the cessation of dukkha; to calm, higher knowledge,
    penetrative insight and realization of Nibbana. The Buddha then exhorted, &quot;Ananda,
    continue to follow this good practice which I have laid down. Let you not be the person
    with whom my tradition ends.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(4) Madhura Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given by the Venerable Mahakaccana at
    Madhura, He refuted the brahmins' claim that only brahmins were noble and superior, and
    that others were inferior. He explained to King Madhura that it was one's Morality, not
    birth that established one's nobility. Anyone whether Brahmin, Khattiya, Vessa or Sudda,
    committing a wrong deed would be born again in the states of woe; anyone doing a good deed
    would be born again in a happy realm. After this discourse by the Venerable Mahakaccana,
    King Madhura, formerly of another faith, took refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the
    Samgha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (5) Bodhirajakumara Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse was given by the Buddha at Susumaragira in
    the country of Bhagga in connection with the statement made by Prince Bodhi that
    &quot;sukha, happiness, cannot be attained through sukha; sukha can be attained only
    through dukkha&quot;. The Buddha said he had also once thought in a similar manner, and
    recounted the whole story of his renunciation, his struggles with wrong practices, frantic
    search for the Truth, and ultimate enlightenment. When asked by the prince how long would
    it take a bhikkhu to achieve, in this very lifetime, the supreme goal of the holy life,
    Arahatship, the Buddha stipulated five attributes for the aspiring bhikkhu. If he was
    equipped with five attributes: faith, good health, integrity (not being deceitful),
    unrelenting zeal, and sufficient intellect to understand the phenomena of 'arising and
    passing away', and having the Tathagata as his instructor and guide, a bhikkhu would
    achieve the Arahatship within seven years at most. Under the most favourable circumstances
    he could become accomplished within half a day.</font></p>

    how Angulimala, the notorious robber and murderer, was tamed by the Buddha, and how he
    took refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Samgha. Although he had the name of
    Ahimsaka, Non-violence, he was formerly cruel and murderous and was called Angulimala by
    people. Being tamed now by the Buddha, he ceased hurting anyone, and started living a life
    true to his name. He had become an Arahat. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(7) Piyajatika Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> A householder of Savatthi whose son had died went to see
    the Buddha who told him that dear beloved ones formed a source of sorrow as they brought
    pain and grief. The householder was displeased with what the Buddha said. Gamblers playing
    with dice just close by the Buddha's monastery told him differently. They said that loved
    ones surely brought joy and happiness. King Pasenadi concurred with the gamblers but his
    queen Mallika maintained that only what the Buddha said must be true. She justified her
    faith in the Buddha by giving many illustrations of the Buddha's penetrating and
    illuminating wisdom. King Pasenadi was finally won over to her view. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(8) Bahitika Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse was given at Savatthi by the Venerable
    Ananda to King Pasenadi on the bank of the River Aciravati. He dealt with unwholesome
    deeds, words and thoughts which were blameworthy and wholesome deeds, words and thoughts
    which were praiseworthy. King Pasenadi was pleased with the discourse and made a gift of
    cloth from the country of Bahiti to the Venerable Ananda. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(9) Dhammacetiya Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">King Pasenadi of Kosala once came to see the Buddha.
    Entering the dwelling where the Buddha was staying, he fell on his forehead at the feet of
    the Buddha . When asked by the Buddha why he was showing such extreme humbleness and
    respect to the body of the Buddha, the king launched eloquently on a eulogy of the Buddha,
    praising his virtues. The Buddha told his bhikkhus that the words uttered by the king
    constituted a memorial in honour of the Dhamma and urged them to learn this memorial and
    recite it frequently. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (10) Kannakatthala Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse, given by the Buddha at Urunna, contains
    answers to King Pasenadi Kosala's questions about four classes of people and their
    destinations after death, about Sabbannuta Nana, and about the great Brahma. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (1) Brahmayu Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Brahmin Brahmayu was one hundred and twenty years old
    when he heard of the fame of the Buddha. He sent his disciple Uttara who was well versed
    in Vedas to find out by examining the thirty two physical characteristics of a great man
    whether Gotama was indeed an Enlightened Buddha. On Uttara's good report testifying to the
    Buddha having the requisite characteristics of a Buddha, Brahmayu went himself to see the
    Buddha. Fully satisfied, after hearing the graduated discourse, that Gotama was indeed an
    enlightened Buddha, he became a devoted disciple and, achieving the third stage of the
    Path and Fruition, an Anagami before he passed away. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (2) Sela Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sela was a brahmin of Apana market-town, who on hearing
    about the fame of the Buddha from Keniya the hermit went to see the Buddha accompanied by
    three hundred young brahmins. After hearing a discourse from the Buddha he became fully
    convinced that he had indeed seen a truly enlightened Buddha. All of them requested for
    and received permission from the Buddha to join the Order. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(3) Assalayana Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some five hundred brahmins who had come to Savatthi on
    business attempted to challenge the Buddha on his views with regard to the purity and
    nobility of the four classes of people. They sent Assalayana, a highly talented young man
    well-versed in the Vedas, to contest with the Buddha. The young man's meeting with the
    Buddha ended up in his conversion. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(4) Ghotamukha Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A discussion took place between the Venerable Udena and a
    brahmin by the name of Ghotamukha on the subject of the practice of the holy life. The
    Venerable Udena described four kinds of persons engaged in ascetic practices. After the
    discourse the Brahmin became a disciple of the Venerable Udena and took his refuge in the
    Buddha, the Dhamma and the Samgha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (5) Canki Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Canki, a brahmin of Opasada Village, came to see the
    Buddha with a large crowd amongst whom was a young brahmin by the name of Kapatika. The
    young man entered into a discussion with the Buddha about the 'Three Vedas' which had been
    handed down from generation to generation in unbroken tradition. The tradition which the
    brahmins believed to be the only Truth was likened by the Buddha to a line of blind man
    each one clinging on to the preceding one. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (6) Esukari Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse was given at Savatthi in connection with a
    brahmin named Esukari. In this sutta too the Buddha rejected the brahmin classification of
    society into four classes claiming the highest position for the brahmins. It was not only
    the brahmins who could develop loving-kindness, free from enmity and ill will. Members of
    other classes also could develop loving-kindness. It was not birth but the practice of
    wholesome dhamma that made a person noble. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (7) Dhananjani Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dhananjani was an old devoted lay disciple of the Buddha.
    After the death of his first wife who had great faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the
    Samgha, he was no longer diligent in and mindful of the practice of dhamma. His second
    wife was without faith in the Teaching of the Buddha. To maintain his family he resorted
    to wrongful means of livelihood. The Venerable Sariputta put him back on the right path.
    On his death bed, he sent for the Venerable Sariputta who solaced him with the dhamma.
    This caused him on his death to be reborn in the Brahma world. The Buddha asked the
    Venerable Sariputta why he had put the old brahmin only on the way to the inferior Brahma
    world when a higher attainment was possible for him. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (8) Vasettha Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A discussion had arisen between two brahmin youths,
    Vasettha and Bharadvaja on the origin of a brahmana. Bharadvaja maintained it was birth,
    lineage and caste that made a person a brahmana. Vasettha believed moral conduct and
    performance of customary duties were essential qualifications to be a brahmana. They went
    to the Buddha for settlement of their dispute. The Buddha told them that a person was not
    a brahmana just because of his birth if he was full of worldly attachments, or was
    harnessed to greed, ill will, craving, and ignorance. A person became a brahmana whatever
    his birth, when he had cut off his fetters of defilements, removed the obstacles of
    ignorance and attained the knowledge of the Four Noble Truths. The most perfect brahmana
    was an Arahat. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (9) Subha Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse was given on account of Subha, son of the
    brahmin Todeyya, at Savatthi. Like other brahmins, Subha believed that only householders
    could accomplish meritorious deeds in a right manner, not those who had gone forth from
    the household life. The occupation of householders produced great benefits whereas the
    occupation of the recluse brought little benefits. The Buddha removed his wrong views and
    Subha became a devoted disciple of the Buddha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (10) Sangarava Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sangarava was a young brahmin who was full of pride with
    learning in the Vedas, entertaining wrong views of his birth. He went to ask the Buddha
    whether the Buddha claimed, like some samanas and brahmanas, to have attained in this very
    life, special knowledge and vision, and reached the other shore. The Buddha explained that
    there were three kinds of samanas and brahmanas who made such claims: those who made the
    claim through hearsay, having learnt things by hearsay only; those who made the claim by
    mere reasoning and logic; and finally those who made the claim by personally realizing the
    penetrative insight of the Dhamma unheard of before. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha told Sangarava that he was of this third type
    and recounted how he had become accomplished in the dhamma by practice and
    self-realization. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b> (1) Devadaha Sutta </b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse was given by the Buddha at Devadaha in the
    country of the Sakyans to refute the wrong views of the Niganthas. The Niganthas believed
    that whatever a person experienced in this life was caused by former action. They
    practised austerity as a penance to put an end to the result of former action. The Buddha
    taught them the right path that would lead to the end of suffering. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(2) Pancattaya Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given by the Buddha to bhikkhus at
    Savatthi to explain the wrong beliefs of other sects speculating on whether the world is
    finite or infinite, etc. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (3) Kinti Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse was given by the Buddha at Pisinara. The
    Buddha explained that he taught the dhamma not for the sake of gain, such as robes,
    alms-food, lodgings, etc., nor in expectation of future happy existences. His teachings,
    namely, the Four Methods of Steadfast Mindfulness, the Four Right Efforts, etc., in short,
    the Thirty-seven Factors of Enlightenment were for the attainment of higher knowledge
    leading to the end of suffering. Whenever there was a dispute over the doctrine with
    regard to meanings and words, it should be resolved strictly in accordance with these
    dhammas. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(4) Samagama Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nigantha Nataputta had recently died at Pava and his
    followers had split into two groups. On being informed by Ananda that he was worried lest
    there be such a schism among the Order, after the passing away of the Buddha, the Buddha
    taught this discourse on imperfect and perfect teachers and disciples, on disputes and
    their origin, and on the essentials of his Teaching. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (5) Sunakkhatta Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Bhikkhu Sunakkhatta, a former Licchavi prince, once
    enquired of the Buddha whether all the bhikkhus who came to the Buddha and declared their
    attainment of Arahatship actually attained it. The Buddha said some of them actually did
    attain Arahatship whereas some deceived themselves; again others claimed Arahatship,
    knowing full well that they were not entitled to it, simply to trouble him with
    unnecessary questions. The Buddha then taught him the essential dhamma in which one must
    become accomplished before one could claim Arahatship. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(6) Anenja-sappaya Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given by the Buddha while he was
    staying once at Kammasadhama, in the country of the Kurus. The Buddha explained to the
    bhikkhus the dangers of enjoying sensual pleasures, which were transitory, empty and
    deceptive. He said he had shown them the path leading to imperturbability
    (Anenja-sappaya), to the realm of Nothingness, to the realm of Neither Consciousness nor
    Non-Consciousness, and ultimately to Nibbana. He then urged the bhikkhus: &quot;GO to the
    forest, to solitude. Strive hard in meditation.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(7) Ganakamoggallana Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Buddha was once asked by the Brahmin Gankamoggallana
    whether there were systematic rules, practices and methods in his Teaching, just as there
    were training rules, manuals, guidances in various branches of worldly knowledge. The
    Buddha told him about the Dhamma giving details about precepts to be observed,
    disciplinary rules to be followed, various concentrations to be developed and jhanas and
    pannas to be achieved step by step. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(8) Gopakamoggallana Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The leading brahmins of Rajagaha asked the Venerable
    Ananda whether the Buddha had appointed a particular thera to be the head of the Samgha
    after he passed away. Ananda informed them there was no such person. No person could
    substitute the Buddha. They wanted to know then if the Samgha had agreed upon a certain
    bhikkhu to be their head. When Ananda told them there was no such person, they wondered
    how the Samgha could remain in agreement and unity. Ananda then explained to them that
    they had indeed refuge in the Dhamma and how the Samgha of each locality recited together
    the Patimokkha, the summary of disciplinary rules, every half month. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (9) Mahapunnama Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha was sitting in the midst of a large number of
    bhikkhus out in the open on a fullmoon night. All the bhikkhus were intently engaged in
    meditation. The silence of the night was broken by the oldest of the meditating bhikkhus
    who, with the permission of the Buddha, asked him about the five aggregates of grasping,
    how craving developed with respect to each aggregate, and how craving would cease. The
    Buddha explained each point raised by the bhikkhu to the great benefit of the assembled
    Samgha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (10) Culapunnama Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse was given on how to differentiate between a

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(1) Anupada Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This discourse was given at Savatthi. The Buddha brought
    out in full detail the virtues of one of his two Chief Disciples, the Venerable Sariputta,
    extolling his wisdom which was extensive like the big earth, describing how, unlike other
    ordinary disciples who had attained arahatship, the Venerable Sariputta went through the
    practices for development of sila, samadhi and panna in a very thorough manner, step by
    step, contemplating very intensely on the minutest phenomenon of 'arising and perishing'
    until he gained the highest goal of the holy life. The Buddha explained also how the
    Venerable Sariputta was fully accomplished in the Dhamma to deserve the honour of being a
    Chief Disciple of the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (2) Chabbisodhana Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Buddha said that when any bhikkhu claimed to the
    attainment of Arahatship, his claim should not be admitted or rejected outright. His claim
    should be carefully scrutinized according to the guiding principles provided in this
    discourse.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (3) Sappurisa Sutta </strong></font></p>

    each individual is to be judged.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (4) Sevitabbasevitabba Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given briefly by the Buddha, and the
    Venerable Sariputta continued to expound it in more detail. It deals with practices and
    actions which a bhikkhu should or should not resort to. Whatever action or practice or
    object is conducive to one's spiritual progress and development should be resorted to and
    made use of; whatever is detrimental to one's spiritual advancement should be rejected.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (5) Bahudhatuka Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse is an analytical study of elements, dhatu;
    bases, ayatana; the law of dependent origination; and the right or wrong causes. Only the
    bhikkhu skilled in these studies may be reckoned as a wise person.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (6) Isigili Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given by the Buddha at Isigili, one of
    the hills surrounding Rajagaha. This is an account of why this hill was called by that
    name and of the many Paccekabuddhas who used to dwell there. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Anapanassati as a method of meditation was explained to a
    large gathering of bhikkhus including nearly all well-known senior disciples such as the
    Venerable Sariputta, Maha Moggallana, Maha Kassapa, Anuruddha, Ananda etc. Development of
    mindfulness of respiration establishes a person in the Four Methods of Steadfest
    Mindfulness. The Four Methods of Steadfast Mindfulness, being developed, establishes a
    person in the Seven Factors of Enlightenment. The Seven Factors of Enlightenment, being
    developed, bring about Insight Knowledge and emancipation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(9) Kayagatasati Sutta</strong></font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(1) Culasunnata Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Buddha once told Ananda that he often dwelt in the

    liberation of the void meant - Liberation through Insight that discerns voidness of self.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (2) Mahasunnata Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Seeing many bhikkhus living together in a crowded
    dwelling place, the Buddha told Ananda that a bhikkhu should not like living in company.
    Solitude is most beneficial for a bhikkhu. He urged bhikkhus to look upon him as a sincere
    friend who would repeatedly point out their faults to help correct them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (3) Acchariya-Abbhuta Sutta</strong></font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Bhikkhu Bakula, aged one hundred and sixty years, met his
    old friend, the naked ascetic Kassapa, after he had been in the Order of the Buddha for
    eighty years. Kassapa asked him how often he had indulged in sexual intercourse during
    those eighty years. Bakula told his friend the marvellous attributes he possessed as an
    Arahat, including the fact that he became an Arahat after seven days of strenuous
    endeavour, after which he was completely rid of moral defilements.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (5) Dantabhumi Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> In this discourse the Buddha explained to the novice
    Aciravata how a young prince like Prince Jayasena, son of King Bimbisara, could not hope
    to know, to see, to realize such dhammas as concentration and jhanas, living as he did in
    the lap of luxury, surrounded by pleasures of senses, enjoying the pleasures of senses and
    consumed and overwhelmed by the flames of desires. The Buddha pointed out the difference
    in out look between an Arahat and an ordinary uninstructed person giving the simile of a
    tamed elephant and a wild elephant of the forest.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (6) Bhumija Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given by the Venerable Bhumija to his
    nephew, Prince Jayasena to explain how Fruition would result by practising the Noble Path
    of Eight Constituents. The Buddha confirmed that only by following the right Path, namely,
    the Noble Path of Eight Constituents and not any other Path, Fruition would result. The
    Buddha gave the similes of attempting to make oil out of sand, squeezing the horns of a
    cow for milk, churning water to make butter, and rubbing two pieces of wet green wood to
    make fire.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (7) Anuruddha Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given by the Venerable Anuruddha to

    liberation through practice of four Brahmavihara Meditation and Mahaggata Cetovimutti,
    liberation through Kasina Meditation using a meditational device. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (8) Upakkilesa Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Once the Buddha left Kosambi because of quarrelling,
    contentious bhikkhus and went to Pacinavamsa Park where the Venerable Anuruddha, the
    Venerable Nandiya and the Venerable Kimila were staying. When these bhikkhus informed the
    Buddha about the aura (obhasa) and vision (dassana) of various shapes and forms they
    perceived in the course of their meditation, the Buddha taught them about Upakkilesa,
    mental defilements, that appear at a certain stage in meditation process. They should be
    on their guard not to be led astray by these deceptive defilements.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(9) Balapandita Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given by the Buddha at Savatthi on
    fools and characteristic behviourof fools; on how evil thoughts, words and deeds of fools
    harm themselves and others; and on how these evil actions lead fools to states of misery
    and woe. The utter wretchedness and intense suffering in such states beggar description.
    Once a fool, through his evil actions, found himself in one of the nether regions, there
    was very little likelihood for him to rise again to the upper realms. The chances are more
    remote than that of a blind turtle to get his head through a single hole in a yoke which
    was being tossed about in a stormy sea.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The discourse deals also with the wise and their

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This is a detailed exposition by the Venerable
    Lomasakangiya on <b>Vipassana</b> meditation of the five khandhas as explained in the
    Bhaddekaratta Sutta.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (5) Culakamma-vibhanga Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Young Subha, son of the Brahmin Todeyya, was curious to
    know why some were born in high class families, some in low class families; why some were
    born rich, others poor; why some were beautiful, others ugly; why some were of good health
    with a long span of life, others of poor health with a short span of life, etc. He
    approached the Buddha and asked fourteen questions in all to satisfy his curiosity. The
    Buddha gave a long discourse on Kamma and its resultant effects. Deeds,words and thoughts
    have endless consequences of joy and sorrow to be experienced in this very life ard
    hereafter. Men depend on their own deeds and nothing else for their condition and status
    in life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (6) Mahakamma-vibhanga Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This is another discourse on kamma and its result ant
    effects which are most difficult to foresee. How the workings of <b>Kamma</b> were most
    strange and surprising were explained with reference to four types of individuals.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (7) Salayatana-vibhanga Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse is a detailed analytical exposition on six
    internal sense bases, six external sense bases, six types of consciousness arising from
    six types of contact, etc., by the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (8) Uddesa-vibhanga Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> In this discourse, the Buddha taught briefly how
    restraint of the mind with regard to external sense bases and non-attachment to internal
    sense bases led to the cessation of suffering. The Venerable Kaccana gave an exposition on
    this subject which earned him praise from the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (9) Arana-vibhanga Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse is an exhortation on the practice of the
    Middle Path, avoiding the two extremes of indulgence in sensual pleasures and practice of
    self mortification, and on modes of conduct not indulging in backbiting; not keeping to
    colloquial vocabulary only and not spurning the conventional usage of the language, but
    speaking gently, slowly.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> <b>(10) Dhatu-vibhanga Sutta</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This is an important discourse taught to Pukkusati, a
    recluse who had left the homelife inspired by the fame of Gotama Buddha whom he had not
    yet met and whom he was on his way to see. The Buddha went purposely to meet this recluse
    in a potter's hut to teach this discourse: A man is made up of six elements, namely,
    solidity, fluidity, heat, motion, space and consciousness. On analysis, none of these
    elements is found to be 'mine' or 'me' or 'my self'. All of them are subject to the law of
    impermanence, so are the three types of sensation. When a bhikkhu perceives the real
    nature of the physical and mental phenomena, he becomes endowed with absolute wisdom,
    Knowledge of the Noble Truth.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (11) Sacca-vibhanga Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> In this discourse the Buddha taught the bhikkhus the Four
    Noble Truths as he had done at the time of giving the discourse on the Turning of the
    Wheel of Dhamma at Isipatana in Baranasi. He then urged the bhikkhus to seek guidance from
    the two theras, the Venerable Sariputta and the Venerable Maha Moggallana,likening the
    Venereble Sariputta to a mother and the Venerable Maha Moggallana to a foster mother.The
    Venerable Sariputta could analyse and explain the Four Noble Truths in detail and lead
    them to the stage of the first Path and Fruition. The Venerable Maha Moggallana could then
    lead them on till the highest Path and Fruition, the Arahatship, was achieved.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (12) Dakkhinavibhanga Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given to the Buddha's foster mother
    Mahapajapati on the occasion of her offering to the Buddha a set of robes made by her own
    hand. The Buddha urged his foster mother to make the offering to the Samgha, the community
    of bhikkhus. He enumerated fourteen kinds of donations to individuals and seven kinds of
    donations to the Samgha, explaining the superior benefit accruing from offerings made to
    the Samgha.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><em><i>V. Salayatana Vagga</i></em></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>(1) Anathapindikovada Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given by the Venerable Sariputta to
    Anathapindka on his death-bed. The Venerable Sariputta enjoined him not to grasp at the
    six internal sense bases, nor the six external sense bases, nor the feelings that arise in
    relation to them, nor at the six elements (including space and consciousness), nor at the
    five aggregates, nor the realms of Infinite Space, of Infinite Consciousness, of
    Nothingness, of Neither Consciousness Nor Non-Consciousness. With no attachment to any of
    them, there would come liberation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (2) Channovada Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> The Venerable Channa was very ill. The Venerable
    Sariputta and Cunda paid him a visit. They gave him solace by giving instruction on <b>Vipassana</b>
    meditation. The Venerable Channa died an Arahat.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (3) Punnovada Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given to Bhikkhu Punna by the Buddha
    on how to practise the holy life in solitude. When the Buddha asked him how he would
    contend with the dangers which infested the locality where he was going to stay, he told
    the Buddha of the six categories of fortitude he was endowed with, including indifference
    to an attack even on his life.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (4) Nandakovada Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given by the Venerable Nandaka to five
    hundred bhikkhunis in the presence of the Buddha one fullmoon night. He dealt with the
    twelve categories of internal and external sense bases, the six types of consciousness,
    their impermanent nature and how to practise the Seven Factors of Enlightenment. He won
    the approval of the Buddha for his lucid exposition of the Dhamma.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (5) Cularahulovada Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given by the Buddha to his son Rahula
    who was then a bhikkhu of the Order fully mature to receive the highest dhamma. The Buddha
    exhorted him, in the form of question and answers on the impermanent nature of the twelve
    sense bases, in consequence of which the Venerable Rahula attained to Arahatship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (6) Chachakka Sutta </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given by the Buddha frequently to many
    bhikkhus on the six internal sense bases, the six external sense bases, six types of
    consciousness, six types of contacts, six types of sensation, six kinds of craving and on
    how their interrelationship led to continuity of phenomena from one existence to another.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (7) Mahasalayatanika Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse is an exposition on how the ignorance of
    the six categories of dhamma such as the six internal sense bases, etc.,gives rise to
    craving, and craving to suffering. It also explains how, when they are seen as they really
    are by following the Noble Path of Eight Constituents, the knowledge of the Seven Factors
    of Enlightenment arises resulting in the perfect Peace of Nibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (8) Nagaravindeyya Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This is a discourse in which the Buddha explained to the
    villagers of Nagaravinda the distinction between samanas and brahmanas who deserved honour
    and homage and those who did not. Only those religious teachers who had discarded the
    craving that arose out of <b>ayatana </b>dhammas were worthy of veneration.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong> (9) Pindapataparisuddhi Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This is an exhortation to bhikkhus to keep themselves
    pure in mind while going on alms round or while eating their meal, by discarding craving,
    removing hindrances and developing the knowledge of the Seven Factors of Enlightenment
    through continuous practice. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>{10) Indriyabhavana Sutta</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This discourse was given to the Venerable Ananda by the
    Buddha showing the difference between the control of senses proctised by an Arahat and
    that practised by one still under training. The buddha explained that feeling of liking,
    disliking or indifference that arise from. conditioned phenomena could be soon eliminated
    by the practice of <b>Vipassana</b> Meditation. </font></p>
