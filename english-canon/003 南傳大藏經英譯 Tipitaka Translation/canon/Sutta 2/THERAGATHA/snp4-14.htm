[A questioner:]
<blockquote>
I ask the kinsman of the Sun, the great seer,<br>
about seclusion &amp; the state of peace.<br>
Seeing in what way is a monk unbound,<br>
clinging to nothing in the world?
</blockquote>
[The Buddha:]
<blockquote>
Through wisdom, he should put<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an entire stop<br>
to the root of the differentiation-classifications:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am.'<br>
He should always train mindfully<br>
to subdue any internal craving.<br>
Whatever truth he may know,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; within or without,<br>
he should not become fixed because of it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for that isn't called<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbinding by the good.<br>
He should not, because of it, think himself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; better,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lower, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; equal.<br>
Touched by contact in various ways,<br>
he should not keep forming conceits about self.<br>
Stilled right within,<br>
he should not seek peace from another.<br>
For one stilled right within,<br>
there's nothing grasped,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so how rejected?<br>
<A NAME="sea">As in</A> the middle of the sea<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is still,<br>
with no waves upwelling,<br>
so the monk -- unperturbed, still -- <br>
should not swell himself in any way.
</blockquote>
[A questioner:]
<blockquote>
He whose eyes are open has described<br>
the Dhamma he's witnessed,<br>
subduing danger.<br>
Now tell us, sir, the practice:<br>
the code of discipline &amp; concentration.
</blockquote>
[The Buddha:]
<blockquote>
One should not be careless with his eyes,<br>
should close his ears to village-talk,<br>
should not hunger for flavors,<br>
or view anything in the world<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as <i>mine.</i><br>
When touched by contact<br>
he should not lament,<br>
should not covet any state of becoming at all,<br>
or tremble at terrors.<br>
When gaining food &amp; drink,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; staples &amp; cloth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he should not make a hoard.<br>
Nor should he be upset<br>
when receiving no gains.
<p>
Absorbed, not foot-loose,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; restless,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or heedless,<br>
he should live in a noise-less abode.<br>
Not making much of sleep,<br>
ardent, given to wakefulness,<br>
he should abandon sloth, deception,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; laughter, sports,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fornication, &amp; all that goes with it;<br>
should not practice charms,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interpret physical marks, dreams,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the stars, animal cries;<br>
should not be devoted to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; medicine or inducing fertility.
<p>
A monk should not tremble at blame<br>
or grow haughty with praise;<br>
should thrust aside stinginess, greed,<br>
divisive speech, anger;<br>
should not buy or sell<br>
or revile anyone in any way;<br>
should not linger in villages,<br>
or flatter people in hopes of gains.
<p>
A monk should not boast<br>
or speak with ulterior motive,<br>
should not train in impudence<br>
or speak quarrelsome words;<br>
should not engage in deception<br>
or knowingly cheat;<br>
should not despise others for their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; life,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discernment,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; precepts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or practices.<br>
Provoked with many words<br>
from contemplatives or ordinary people,<br>
he should not respond harshly,<br>
for those who retaliate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are't calm.
<p>
Knowing this teaching, inquisitive,<br>
a monk should always train in it mindfully.<br>
Knowing Unbinding as peace,<br>
he should not be heedless of Gotama's message -- <br>
for he, the Conqueror unconquered,<br>
witnessed the Dhamma,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not by hearsay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but directly, himself.<br>
So, heedful, one should always train<br>
in line with that Blessed One's message.
