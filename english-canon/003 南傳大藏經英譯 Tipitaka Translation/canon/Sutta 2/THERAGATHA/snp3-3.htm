<hr>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in <A NAME="savatthi">Savatthi</A> at Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="anatha">Anathapindika</A>'s park. There he addressed the monks, "Monks!"
<p>
"Yes, lord," the monks replied.
<p>
The Blessed One said: "Monks, speech endowed with four characteristics is well-spoken, not poorly spoken -- faultless &amp; not to be faulted by the wise. Which four? There is the case where a monk says only what it well-spoken, not what is poorly spoken; only what is just, not what is unjust; only what is endearing, not what is unendearing; only what is true, not what is false. Speech endowed with these four characteristics is well-spoken, not poorly spoken -- faultless &amp; not to be faulted by the wise."
<p>
That is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The calm say that what is well-spoken is best;<br>
second, that one should say<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what is just, not unjust;<br>
third, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what is endearing, not unendearing;<br>
fourth, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what is true, not false.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Then <A NAME="vangisa">Ven. Vangisa</A>, rising from his seat, arranging his robe over one shoulder, faced the Blessed One with his hands palm-to-palm in front of his heart and said, "An inspiration has come to me, Blessed One! An inspiration has come to me, One Well-Gone!"
<p>
"Let the inspiration come to you, Vangisa," the Blessed One said.
<p>
Then Ven. Vangisa praised the Blessed One to his face with these attractive verses:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Speak only the speech<br>
that neither torments self<br>
nor does harm to others.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That speech is truly well spoken.
<p>
Speak only endearing speech,<br>
speech that is welcomed.<br>
Speech when it brings no evil<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to others<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is pleasant.
<p>
Truth, indeed, is deathless speech:<br>
This is an ancient principle.<br>
The goal and the Dhamma<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- so say the calm -- <br>
are firmly established on truth.
<p>
The speech the Awakened One speaks,<br>
for attaining Unbinding,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rest,<br>
for making an end<br>
to the mass of stress:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the speech unexcelled.
