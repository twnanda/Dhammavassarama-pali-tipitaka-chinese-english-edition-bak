<blockquote>
Staying attached to the cave,<br>
covered heavily over,<br>
a person plunged into confusion<br>
is far from seclusion -- <br>
for sensual pleasures<br>
are not lightly let go.
<p>
Those chained by desire,<br>
bound by becoming's allure,<br>
aren't freed by others,<br>
and find no easy release on their own.<br>
Intent, in front or behind,<br>
on hunger for sensual pleasures<br>
here or before -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; greedy<br>
for sensual pleasures,<br>
busy, deluded, ungenerous,<br>
having entered the out-of-tune way,<br>
they -- impelled into pain -- lament:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What will we be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when we pass on from here?"
<p>
So a person should train<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right here &amp; now.<br>
Whatever you know<br>
as out-of-tune in the world,<br>
don't, for its sake, act out-of-tune,<br>
for that life, say the prudent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is short.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see them,<br>
in the world, floundering around,<br>
people immersed in craving<br>
for states of becoming.<br>
Base people moan in the mouth of death,<br>
their craving, for states of becoming and not-,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unallayed.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See them,<br>
floundering in their sense of <i>mine,</i><br>
<A NAME="fish">like fish</A> in the puddles<br>
of a dried-up stream -- <br>
and, seeing this,<br>
live with no <i>mine,</i><br>
not forming attachment<br>
for states of becoming.<br>
Subdue desire for both sides,<br>
comprehending sensory contact,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with no greed.
<p>
Doing nothing for which<br>
he himself<br>
would reprove himself,<br>
the prudent person doesn't adhere<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to what's seen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to what's heard.<br>
Comprehending perception,<br>
not stuck on possessions,<br>
a sage would cross over the flood.<br>
Then, with arrow removed,<br>
living heedfully, he longs for neither<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this world<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor the next.
