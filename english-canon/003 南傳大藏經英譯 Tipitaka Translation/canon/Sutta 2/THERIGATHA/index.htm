<h1>Therigatha</h1>
<h3>Verses of the Elder Nuns</h3>

<hr>
The Therigatha, the ninth book of the Khuddaka Nikaya, contains 73 stories in verse form in which the early nuns <i>(bhikkhunis)</i> recount their struggles and accomplishments along the road to arahantship. These stories are told with often heart-breaking honesty and beauty, revealing the human side of these extraordinary women, and thus serve as inspiring reminders of our own potential to follow in their footsteps.
<p>
The verses of the Therigatha also serve as a powerful curative to any mistaken notion that the Buddha's teachings are somehow only applicable to -- and effective for -- men. The outstanding heroism and nobility of these pioneering women has served for over two and one-half millennia as an inspiration for <I>all</I> those who have endeavored to practice the Buddha's teachings since -- whether monk, nun, layman, or laywoman. Arahantship is open to all who -- like these exemplary women -- are willing to put forth the effort.
