<hr>
I have heard that at one time the Blessed One was staying in <A NAME="savatthi">Savatthi</A> at Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="anatha">Anathapindika</A>'s park. Then a certain deva, in the far extreme of the night, her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta's Grove, approached the Blessed One. On approaching, having bowed down to the Blessed One, she stood to one side. As she stood to one side, she addressed him with a verse.<br>
<blockquote>
Many devas and humans beings<br>
give thought to protection,<br>
desiring well-being.<br>
Tell, then, the highest protection.
</blockquote>
The Buddha:
<blockquote>
Not consorting with fools,<br>
consorting with the wise,<br>
paying homage to those worthy of homage:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the highest protection.
<p>
Living in a civilized land,<br>
having made merit in the past,<br>
directing oneself rightly:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the highest protection.
<p>
Broad knowledge, skill,<br>
well-mastered discipline,<br>
well-spoken words :<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the highest protection.
<p>
<A NAME="parents">Support</A> for one's parents,<br>
assistance to one's wife and children,<br>
consistency in one's work:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the highest protection.
<p>
Generosity, living in rectitude,<br>
assistance to one's relatives,<br>
deeds that are blameless:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the highest protection.
<p>
Avoiding, abstaining from evil;<br>
refraining from intoxicants,<br>
being heedful of the qualities of the mind:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the highest protection.
<p>
Respect, humility,<br>
contentment, gratitude,<br>
hearing the Dhamma on timely occasions:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the highest protection.
<p>
Patience, composure,<br>
seeing contemplatives,<br>
discussing the Dhamma on timely occasions:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the highest protection.
<p>
Austerity, celibacy,<br>
seeing the Noble Truths,<br>
realizing Unbinding:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the highest protection.
<p>
A mind that, when touched<br>
by the ways of the world,<br>
is unshaken, sorrowless, dustless, at rest:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the highest protection.
<p>
Everywhere undefeated<br>
when acting in this way,<br>
people go everywhere in well-being:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is their highest protection.
