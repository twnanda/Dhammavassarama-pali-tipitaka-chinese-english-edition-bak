<h1>The Majjhima Nikaya</h1>
<h3>The Middle Length Discourses</h3>
</center>
<hr>
The Majjhima Nikaya, or "Middle-length Discourses" of the Buddha, is the second of the five <i>nikayas</i>, or collections, in the Sutta Pitaka of the Pali Canon.
<p>
This nikaya consists of 152 discourses of the Buddha, which together constitute a comprehensive body of teaching concerning all aspects of the Buddha's teachings.
<p>
An excellent modern translation of the Majjhima Nikaya, may be found in <I>The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha: A New Translation of the Majjhima Nikaya,</I> translated by Bhikkhu &Ntilde;anamoli and Bhikkhu Bodhi (Boston: Wisdom Publications, 1995). The Introduction to that book is an extraordinary synopsis of the Buddha's teachings in general, and of their expression in the Majjhima in particular.
<p>
The sutta summaries appearing below that are marked "[BB]" were adapted from Bhikkhu Bodhi's summaries (in <I>The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha</i>) and used with permission. Those marked "[TB]" were provided by Thanissaro Bhikkhu.

One of the most important texts for beginning and veteran meditators alike, this sutta is the Buddha's "roadmap" to the entire course of meditation practice, using the vehicle of breath meditation.

According to this discourse, the question of desiring or not desiring is irrelevant as long as one develops the appropriate qualities that constitute the path to Awakening.
