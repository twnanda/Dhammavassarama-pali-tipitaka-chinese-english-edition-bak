"Whatever is not yours: let go of it. Your letting go of it will be for your long-term happiness &amp; benefit. And what is not yours?
<p>
"The eye is not yours: let go of it. Your letting go of it will be for your long-term happiness &amp; benefit. Forms are not yours...Eye-consciousness is not yours...Eye-contact is not yours...Whatever arises in dependence on eye-contact, experienced either as pleasure, as pain, or as neither-pleasure-nor-pain, that too is not yours: let go of it. Your letting go of it will be for your long-term happiness &amp; benefit.
<p>
"The ear is not yours: let go of it...
<p>
"The nose is not yours: let go of it...
<p>
"The tongue is not yours: let go of it...
<p>
"The body is not yours: let go of it...
<p>
"The intellect is not yours: let go of it. Your letting go of it will be for your long-term happiness &amp; benefit. Ideas are not yours...Intellect-consciousness is not yours...Intellect-contact is not yours...Whatever arises in dependence on intellect-contact, experienced either as pleasure, as pain, or as neither-pleasure-nor-pain, that too is not yours: let go of it. Your letting go of it will be for your long-term happiness &amp; benefit.

"<A NAME="burn">Suppose a person</A> were to gather or burn or do as he likes with the grass, twigs, branches, &amp; leaves here in <A NAME="jeta">Jeta</A>'s Grove. Would the thought occur to you, 'It's us that this person is gathering, burning, or doing with as he likes'?"
<p>
"No, lord. Why is that? Because those things are not our self nor do they pertain to our self."
<p>
"In the same way, monks, the eye is not yours: let go of it. Your letting go of it will be for your long-term happiness &amp; benefit...The ear...The nose...The tongue...The body...The intellect is not yours: let go of it. Your letting go of it will be for your long-term happiness &amp; benefit...Whatever arises in dependence on intellect-contact, experienced either as pleasure, as pain, or as neither-pleasure-nor-pain, that too is not yours: let go of it. Your letting go of it will be for your long-term happiness &amp; benefit."
