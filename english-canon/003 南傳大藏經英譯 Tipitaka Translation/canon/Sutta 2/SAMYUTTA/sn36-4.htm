<hr>
"Monks, when an uninstructed run-of-the-mill person makes the statement, 'There is a bottomless chasm in the ocean,' he is talking about something that doesn't exist, that can't be found. The word 'bottomless chasm' is actually a designation for painful bodily feeling.
<p>
"When an uninstructed run-of-the-mill person is touched by a painful bodily feeling, he sorrows, grieves, &amp; laments, beats his breast, becomes distraught. This is called an uninstructed run-of-the-mill person who has not risen up out of the bottomless chasm, who has not gained a foothold.
<p>
"When a well-instructed noble disciple is touched by a painful bodily feeling, he does not sorrow, grieve, or lament, does not beat his breast or become distraught. This is called a well-instructed noble disciple who has risen up out of the bottomless chasm, whose foothold is gained."
<blockquote>
Whoever can't endure them<br>
once they've arisen -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; painful bodily feelings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that could kill living beings -- <br>
who trembles at their touch,<br>
who cries &amp; wails,<br>
a weakling with no resiliance:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he hasn't risen up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out of the bottomless chasm<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or even gained<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a foothold.
<p>
Whoever endures them<br>
once they've arisen -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; painful bodily feelings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that could kill living beings -- <br>
who doesn't tremble at their touch:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he's risen up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out of the bottomless chasm,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his foothold is gained.
