<hr>
At Savatthi. Then, early in the morning, Sisupacala the nun put on her robes and, taking her bowl &amp; outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. When she had gone for alms in Savatthi and had returned from her alms round, after her meal she went to the Grove of the Blind to spend the day. Having gone deep into the Grove of the Blind, she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day's abiding.
<p>
Then Mara the Evil One, wanting to arouse fear, horripilation, &amp; terror in her, wanting to make her fall from solitude, approached her &amp; said, "Whose philosophy do you approve of, nun?"
<p>
"I don't approve of anyone's philosophy, my friend."
<p>
[Mara:]
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For whose sake<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have you shaved your head?<br>
You look like a contemplative<br>
but don't approve of a philosophy,<br>
so why are you wandering here<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; confused?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
[Sister Sisupacala:]
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Outside philosophers place<br>
their confidence in views.<br>
I don't approve<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of their teaching.<br>
They're not adept<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the Dhamma.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there is<br>
the Awakened One,<br>
born in the Sakyan clan,<br>
a person without peer:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all-conquering,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mara's subduer,<br>
everywhere undefeated,<br>
everywhere freed, independent;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; endowed with an Eye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all-seeing, reaching the end of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all kamma -- <br>
with the ending of acquisitions,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; released.<br>
He, that Blessed One,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is my teacher.<br>
It's in his Dhamma<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that I delight.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Then Mara the Evil One -- sad &amp; dejected at realizing, "Sisupacala the nun knows me" -- vanished right there.
