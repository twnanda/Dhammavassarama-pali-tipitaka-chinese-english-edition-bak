<hr>
At Savatthi. As he was sitting to one side, King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One: "Just now, lord, while I was alone in seclusion, this train of thought arose in my awareness: 'Few are those people in the world who, when acquiring lavish wealth, don't become intoxicated &amp; heedless, don't become greedy for sensual pleasures, and don't mistreat other beings. Many more are those who, when acquiring lavish wealth, become intoxicated &amp; heedless, become greedy for sensual pleasures, and mistreat other beings.'"
<p>
"That's the way it is, great king! That's the way it is! Few are those people in the world who, when acquiring lavish wealth, don't become intoxicated &amp; heedless, don't become greedy for sensual pleasures, and don't mistreat other beings. Many more are those who, when acquiring lavish wealth, become intoxicated &amp; heedless, become greedy for sensual pleasures, and mistreat other beings."
<p>
That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:
<blockquote>
Impassioned &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with sensual possessions,<br>
greedy, dazed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by sensual pleasures,<br>
they don't awaken to the fact<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that they've gone too far -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like deer into trap laid out.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterwards it's bitter for them:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; evil for them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the result.
