<hr>
"There are forms, monks, cognizable via the eye -- agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing. If a monk relishes them, welcomes them, &amp; remains fastened to them, he is said to be a monk fettered by forms cognizable by the eye. He has gone over to <A NAME="mara">Mara</A>'s camp; he has come under Mara's power. The Evil One can do with him as he will.
<p>
"There are sounds cognizable via the ear...
<p>
"There are aromas cognizable via the nose...
<p>
"There are flavors cognizable via the tongue...
<p>
"There are tactile sensations cognizable via the body...
<p>
"There are ideas cognizable via the intellect -- agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing. If a monk relishes them, welcomes them, &amp; remains fastened to them, he is said to be a monk fettered by forms cognizable by the intellect. He has gone over to Mara's camp; he has come under Mara's power. The Evil One can do with him as he will.
<p>
"Now, there are forms cognizable via the eye -- agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing. If a monk does not relish them, welcome them, or remain fastened to them, he is said to be a monk freed from forms cognizable by the eye. He has not gone over to Mara's camp; he has not come under Mara's power. The Evil One cannot do with him as he will.
