<hr>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in <A NAME="rajagaha">Rajagaha</A> in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary. And on that occasion <A NAME="kassapa">Ven. Maha Kassapa</A> was staying in the Pepper Tree Cave, diseased, in pain, severely ill. Then the Blessed One, in the late afternoon, left his seclusion and went to where Ven. Maha Kassapa was staying. On arrival, he sat down on a prepared seat and said to Ven. Maha Kassapa, "I hope you are getting better, Kassapa. I hope you are comfortable. I hope that your pains are lessening and not increasing. I hope that there are signs of their lessening, and not of their increasing."
<p>
"I am not getting better, lord. I am not comfortable. My extreme pains are increasing, not lessening. There are signs of their increasing, and not of their lessening."
<p>
"Kassapa, <A NAME="7fac">these seven</A> factors of Awakening rightly taught by me, when developed and pursued, lead to direct knowledge, to self-Awakening, to Unbinding. Which seven?
<p>
"Mindfulness as a factor of Awakening rightly taught by me, when developed and pursued, leads to direct knowledge, to self-Awakening, to Unbinding.
<p>
"Analysis of qualities as a factor of Awakening, rightly taught by me, when developed and pursued, leads to direct knowledge, to self-Awakening, to Unbinding.
<p>
"Persistence as a factor of Awakening...
<p>
"Rapture as a factor of Awakening...
<p>
"Serenity as a factor of Awakening...
<p>
"Concentration as a factor of Awakening...
<p>
"Equanimity as a factor of Awakening rightly taught by me, when developed and pursued, leads to direct knowledge, to self-Awakening, to Unbinding.
<p>
"Kassapa, these are the seven factors of Awakening rightly taught by me that -- when developed and pursued -- lead to direct knowledge, to self-Awakening, to Unbinding."
<p>
"They are indeed factors of Awakening, O Blessed One. They are indeed factors of Awakening, O One Well-Gone."
<p>
That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, Ven. Maha Kassapa delighted in the Blessed One's words. And Ven. Maha Kassapa recovered from his disease. That was how Ven. Maha Kassapa's disease was abandoned.
