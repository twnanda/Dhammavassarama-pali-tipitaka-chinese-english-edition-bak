<hr>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was on a wandering tour among the <A NAME="kos">Kosalans</A> with a large community of monks -- approximately 500 monks in all -- and arrived at <A NAME="sal">Salavatika</A>. Now at that time the <A NAME="loh">brahmin Lohicca</A> was reigning with feudatory rights over Salavatika -- together with its wealth, grass, timber, &amp; grain -- through a royal grant bestowed by <A NAME="pas">King Pasenadi Kosala</A>. And at that time an evil viewpoint to this effect had arisen to him: "Suppose that a priest or contemplative were to arrive at a skillful doctrine. Having arrived at a skillful doctrine, he should not declare it to anyone else, for what can one person do for another? It would be just the same as if, having cut through an old bond, one were to make another new bond. I say that such a thing is an evil, greedy deed, for what can one person do for another?"
<p>
Then Lohicca heard it said, "Gotama the contemplative -- the son of the Sakyans, having gone forth from the Sakyan clan -- on a wandering tour among the Kosalans with a large community of monks -- approximately 500 monks in all -- has arrived at Salavatika. And of that Master Gotama this fine reputation has spread: 'He is indeed a Blessed One, worthy, &amp; rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge &amp; conduct, well-gone, a knower of the cosmos, an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready to be tamed, teacher of human &amp; divine beings, awakened, blessed. He has made known -- having realized it through direct knowledge -- this world with its devas, maras, &amp; brahmas, its generations with their contemplatives &amp; priests, their rulers &amp; common people; has explained the Dhamma admirable in the beginning, admirable in the middle, admirable in the end; has expounded the holy life both in its particulars &amp; in its essence, entirely perfect, surpassingly pure. It is good to see such a worthy one.'"
<p>
So Lohicca said to <A NAME="ros">Rosika</A> the barber: "Come, dear Rosika. Go to Gotama the contemplative and, on arrival, ask whether he is free from illness &amp; affliction, is carefree, strong, &amp; living in comfort, saying: 'The brahmin Lohicca, master Gotama, asks whether you are free from illness &amp; affliction, are carefree, strong, &amp; living in comfort.' And then say: 'May master Gotama, together with the community of monks, consent to tomorrow's meal with the brahmin Lohicca.'"
<p>
Responding, "As you say, sir," to the brahmin Lohicca, Rosika the barber went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, bowing down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, "The brahmin Lohicca, lord, asks whether the Blessed One is free from illness &amp; affliction, is carefree, strong, &amp; living in comfort. And he says, 'May the Blessed One, together with the community of monks, consent to tomorrow's meal with the brahmin Lohicca.'" The Blessed One consented through silence.
<p>
Then Rosika the barber, understanding the Blessed One's consent, rose from his seat, bowed down to the Blessed One, circumambulated him -- keeping him to his right -- and returned to the brahmin Lohicca. On arrival he said to him, "I have informed the Blessed One of your words, [saying,] 'The brahmin Lohicca, lord, asks whether the Blessed One is free from illness &amp; affliction, is carefree, strong, &amp; living in comfort. And he says, "May the Blessed One, together with the community of monks, consent to tomorrow's meal with the brahmin Lohicca."' And the Blessed One has consented."
<p>
Then, as the night was ending, the brahmin Lohicca had choice staple &amp; non-staple foods prepared in his own home and then said to Rosika the barber, "Come, dear Rosika. Go to Gotama the contemplative and on arrival announce the time, [saying,] 'It is time, master Gotama. The meal is ready.'"
<p>
Responding, "As you say, sir," to the brahmin Lohicca, Rosika the barber went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, bowing down to him, stood to one side. As he was standing there, he announced the time, [saying,] "It is time, lord. The meal is ready."
<p>
Then the Blessed One, having put on his robes early in the morning, carrying his bowl &amp; outer robe, went together with a community of monks to Salavatika. Meanwhile, Rosika the barber was following right behind the Blessed One and said to him, "Lord, an evil viewpoint to this effect has arisen to the brahmin Lohicca: 'Suppose that a priest or contemplative were to arrive at a skillful doctrine. Having arrived at a skillful doctrine, he should not declare it to anyone else, for what can one person do for another? It would be just the same as if, having cut through an old bond, one were to make another new bond. I say that such a thing is an evil, greedy deed, for what can one person do for another?' It would be good if the Blessed One would extract the brahmin Lohicca from this evil viewpoint."
<p>
"Perhaps that will be, Rosika. Perhaps that will be."
<p>
Then the Blessed One went to the brahmin Lohicca's home. On arrival, he sat down on a seat made ready. The brahmin Lohicca, with his own hand, served &amp; satisfied the Blessed One &amp; the community of monks with choice staple &amp; non-staple foods. Then, when the Blessed One had eaten and had removed his hand from his bowl, the brahmin Lohicca took a lower seat and sat down to one side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, "Is it true, Lohicca, that an evil viewpoint to this effect has arisen to you: 'Suppose that a priest or contemplative were to arrive at a skillful doctrine. Having arrived at a skillful doctrine, he should not declare it to anyone else, for what can one person do for another? It would be just the same as if, having cut through an old bond, one were to make another new bond. I say that such a thing is an evil, greedy deed, for what can one person do for another?'?"
<p>
"Yes, master Gotama."
<p>
"What do you think, Lohicca. Don't you reign over Salavatika?"
<p>
"Yes, master Gotama."
<p>
"Now, suppose someone were to say, 'The brahmin Lohicca reigns over Salavatika. He alone should consume the fruits &amp; revenues of Salavatika, and not share them with others.' Would someone speaking in this way be a creator of obstacles for your subjects, or would he not?"
<p>
"He would be a creator of obstacles, master Gotama."
<p>
"And, being a creator of obstacles, would he be sympathetic for their welfare or not?"
<p>
"He would not be sympathetic for their welfare, master Gotama."
<p>
"And in one not sympathetic for their welfare, would his mind be established in good will for them, or in animosity?"
<p>
"In animosity, master Gotama."
<p>
"When the mind is established in animosity, is there wrong view or right view?"
<p>
"Wrong view, master Gotama."
<p>
"Now, for one of wrong view, Lohicca, I tell you, there is one of two destinations: either hell or the animal womb.
<p>
"What do you think, Lohicca. Doesn't King Pasenadi Kosala reign over <A NAME="kasi">Kasi</A> &amp; Kosala?"
<p>
"Yes, master Gotama."
<p>
"Now, suppose someone were to say, 'King Pasenadi Kosala reigns over Kasi &amp; Kosala. He alone should consume the fruits &amp; revenues of Kasi &amp; Kosala, and not share them with others.' Would someone speaking in this way be a creator of obstacles for King Pasenadi's subjects -- you &amp; others -- or would he not?"
<p>
"He would be a creator of obstacles, master Gotama."
<p>
"And, being a creator of obstacles, would he be sympathetic for their welfare or not?"
<p>
"He would not be sympathetic for their welfare, master Gotama."
<p>
"And in one not sympathetic for their welfare, would his mind be established in good will for them, or in animosity?"
<p>
"In animosity, master Gotama."
<p>
"When the mind is established in animosity, is there wrong view or right view?"
<p>
"Wrong view, master Gotama."
<p>
"Now, for one of wrong view, Lohicca, I tell you, there is one of two destinations: either hell or the animal womb.
<p>
"So then, Lohicca, if anyone were to say, 'The brahmin Lohicca reigns over Salavatika. He alone should consume the fruits &amp; revenues of Salavatika, and not share them with others,' he, speaking in this way, would be a creator of obstacles for your subjects. Being a creator of obstacles, he would not be sympathetic for their welfare. In one not sympathetic for their welfare, the mind would be established in animosity for them. When the mind is established in animosity, there is wrong view. For one of wrong view, I tell you, there is one of two destinations: either hell or the animal womb. In the same way, if anyone were to say, 'Suppose that a priest or contemplative were to arrive at a skillful doctrine. Having arrived at a skillful doctrine, he should not declare it to anyone else, for what can one person do for another? It would be just the same as if, having cut through an old bond, one were to make another new bond. I say that such a thing is an evil, greedy deed, for what can one person do for another?' -- he, speaking in this way, would be a creator of obstacles for those children of good family who, coming to the doctrine &amp; discipline revealed by the Tathagata, attain the sort of grand distinction where they attain the fruit of stream-entry, the fruit of once-returning, the fruit of non-returning, the fruit of arahantship; and for those who ripen deva wombs for the sake of bringing about the deva state. Being a creator of obstacles, he would not be sympathetic for their welfare. In one not sympathetic for their welfare, the mind would be established in animosity for them. When the mind is established in animosity, there is wrong view. For one of wrong view, I tell you, there is one of two destinations: either hell or the animal womb.
<p>
"And if anyone were to say, 'King Pasenadi Kosala reigns over Kasi &amp; Kosala. He alone should consume the fruits &amp; revenues of Kasi &amp; Kosala, and not share them with others,' he, speaking in this way, would be a creator of obstacles for King Pasenadi's subjects -- you &amp; others. Being a creator of obstacles, he would not be sympathetic for their welfare. In one not sympathetic for their welfare, the mind would be established in animosity for them. When the mind is established in animosity, there is wrong view. For one of wrong view, I tell you, there is one of two destinations: either hell or the animal womb. In the same way, if anyone were to say, 'Suppose that a priest or contemplative were to arrive at a skillful doctrine. Having arrived at a skillful doctrine, he should not declare it to anyone else, for what can one person do for another? It would be just the same as if, having cut through an old bond, one were to make another new bond. I say that such a thing is an evil, greedy deed, for what can one person do for another?' -- he, speaking in this way, would be a creator of obstacles for those children of good family who, coming to the doctrine &amp; discipline revealed by the Tathagata, attain the sort of grand distinction where they attain the fruit of stream-entry, the fruit of once-returning, the fruit of non-returning, the fruit of arahantship; and also for those who ripen deva wombs for the sake of bringing about the deva state. Being a creator of obstacles, he would not be sympathetic for their welfare. In one not sympathetic for their welfare, the mind would be established in animosity for them. When the mind is established in animosity, there is wrong view. For one of wrong view, I tell you, there is one of two destinations: either hell or the animal womb.
<p>
"<A NAME="3sorts">Lohicca</A>, there are these three sorts of teacher who are worthy of criticism in the world, and when anyone criticizes these sorts of teachers, the criticism is true, factual, righteous, &amp; unblameworthy. Which three?
<p>
"There is the case where a certain teacher has not attained the goal of the contemplative life for which one goes forth from the home life into homelessness. He, not having attained that goal of the contemplative life, teaches his disciples, 'This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.' His disciples don't listen, don't lend ear, don't put forth an intent for gnosis. They practice in a way deviating from the teacher's instructions. He should be criticized, saying, 'You, venerable sir, have not attained the goal of the contemplative life for which one goes forth from the home life into homelessness. Not having attained that goal of the contemplative life, you teach your disciples, "This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness." Your disciples don't listen, don't lend ear, don't put forth an intent for gnosis, and practice in a way deviating from the teacher's instructions. <A NAME="pursue">It's just as if</A> a man were to pursue [a woman] who pulls away, or to embrace one who turns her back. I say that such a thing is an evil, greedy deed, for what can one person do for another?' This is the first teacher who is worthy of criticism in the world, and when anyone criticizes this sort of teacher, the criticism is true, factual, righteous, &amp; unblameworthy.
<p>
"Then there is the case where a certain teacher has not attained the goal of the contemplative life for which one goes forth from the home life into homelessness.

His disciples listen, lend ear, put forth an intent for gnosis, and practice in a way not deviating from the teacher's instructions.

Your disciples listen, lend ear, put forth an intent for gnosis, and practice in a way not deviating from the teacher's instructions. <A NAME="field">It's just as if</A> a man, neglecting his own field, were to imagine that another's field should be weeded. I say that such a thing is an evil, greedy deed, for what can one person do for another?' This is the second teacher who is worthy of criticism in the world, and when anyone criticizes this sort of teacher, the criticism is true, factual, righteous, &amp; unblameworthy.
<p>
"Then there is the case where a certain teacher has attained the goal of the contemplative life for which one goes forth from the home life into homelessness.

His disciples don't listen, don't lend ear, don't put forth an intent for gnosis. They practice in a way deviating from the teacher's instructions.

This is the third teacher who is worthy of criticism in the world, and when anyone criticizes this sort of teacher, the criticism is true, factual, righteous, &amp; unblameworthy."
<p>
When this was said, the brahmin Lohicca said to the Blessed One, "But is there, master Gotama, any teacher who is not worthy of criticism in the world?"
<p>
"There is, Lohicca, a teacher who is not worthy of criticism in the world."
<p>
"But which teacher, master Gotama, is not worthy of criticism in the world?"
<p>
"There is the case, Lohicca, where a Tathagata appears in the world, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened. He teaches the Dhamma admirable in its beginning, admirable in its middle, admirable in its end. He proclaims the holy life both in its particulars &amp; in its essence, entirely perfect, surpassingly pure.
<p>
"A householder or householder's son, hearing the Dhamma, gains conviction in the Tathagata and reflects: 'Household life is crowded, a dusty path. The life gone forth is like the open air. It is not easy living at home to practice the holy life totally perfect, totally pure, like a polished shell. What if I were to shave off my hair &amp; beard, put on the ochre robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness?'
<p>
"So after some time he abandons his mass of wealth, large or small; leaves his circle of relatives, large or small; shaves off his hair &amp; beard, puts on the ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness.
<p>
"When he has thus gone forth, he lives restrained by the rules of the monastic code, seeing danger in the slightest faults. Consummate in his virtue, he guards the doors of his senses, is possessed of mindfulness &amp; alertness, and is content [for details, see <A HREF="dn2.htm" tppabs="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/digha/dn2.htm">DN 2</A>]...
<p>
<br><p>
<h4>(Abandoning the Hindrances)</H4>
<p>
"<A NAME="wild">Endowed</A> with this noble aggregate of virtue, this noble restraint over the sense faculties, this noble mindfulness &amp; alertness, and this noble contentment, he seeks out a secluded dwelling: a wilderness, the shade of a tree, a mountain, a glen, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a forest grove, the open air, a heap of straw. After his meal, returning from his alms round, he sits down, crosses his legs, holds his body erect, and brings mindfulness to the fore.
<p>
"Abandoning covetousness with regard to the world, he dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousness. He cleanses his mind of covetousness. Abandoning ill will &amp; anger, he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill will, sympathetic with the welfare of all living beings. He cleanses his mind of ill will &amp; anger. Abandoning sloth &amp; drowsiness, he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth &amp; drowsiness, mindful, alert, percipient of light. He cleanses his mind of sloth &amp; drowsiness. Abandoning restlessness &amp; anxiety, he dwells undisturbed, his mind inwardly stilled. He cleanses his mind of restlessness &amp; anxiety. Abandoning uncertainty, he dwells having crossed over uncertainty, with no perplexity with regard to skillful mental qualities. He cleanses his mind of uncertainty.
<p>
"<A NAME="loan">Suppose</A> that a man, taking a loan, invests it in his business affairs. His business affairs succeed. He repays his old debts and there is extra left over for maintaining his wife. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, taking a loan, I invested it in my business affairs. Now my business affairs have succeeded. I have repaid my old debts and there is extra left over for maintaining my wife.' Because of that he would experience joy &amp; happiness.
<p>
"<A NAME="ill">Now suppose</A> that a man falls sick -- in pain &amp; seriously ill. He does not enjoy his meals, and there is no strength in his body. As time passes, he eventually recovers from that sickness. He enjoys his meals and there is strength in his body. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, I was sick...Now I am recovered from that sickness. I enjoy my meals and there is strength in my body.' Because of that he would experience joy &amp; happiness.
<p>
"<A NAME="prison">Now suppose</A> that a man is bound in prison. As time passes, he eventually is released from that bondage, safe &amp; sound, with no loss of property. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, I was bound in prison. Now I am released from that bondage, safe &amp; sound, with no loss of my property.' Because of that he would experience joy &amp; happiness.
<p>
"<A NAME="slave">Now suppose</A> that a man is a slave, subject to others, not subject to himself, unable to go where he likes. As time passes, he eventually is released from that slavery, subject to himself, not subject to others, freed, able to go where he likes. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, I was a slave...Now I am released from that slavery, subject to myself, not subject to others, freed, able to go where I like.' Because of that he would experience joy &amp; happiness.
<p>
"<A NAME="travel">Now suppose</A> that a man, carrying money &amp; goods, is traveling by a road through desolate country. As time passes, he eventually emerges from that desolate country, safe &amp; sound, with no loss of property. The thought would occur to him, 'Before, carrying money &amp; goods, I was traveling by a road through desolate country. Now I have emerged from that desolate country, safe &amp; sound, with no loss of my property.' Because of that he would experience joy &amp; happiness.
<p>
"In the same way, when these five hindrances are not abandoned in himself, the monk regards it as a debt, a sickness, a prison, slavery, a road through desolate country. But when these five hindrances are abandoned in himself, he regards it as unindebtedness, good health, release from prison, freedom, a place of security. Seeing that they have been abandoned within him, he becomes glad. Glad, he becomes enraptured. Enraptured, his body grows tranquil. His body tranquil, he is sensitive to pleasure. Feeling pleasure, his mind becomes concentrated.
<p>
<br><p>
<h4>(The Four Jhanas)</H4>
<p>
"Quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures, withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities, he enters and remains in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. He permeates &amp; pervades, suffuses &amp; fills this very body with the rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal. <A NAME="bath">Just as</A> if a skilled bathman or bathman's apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together, sprinkling it again &amp; again with water, so that his ball of bath powder -- saturated, moisture-laden, permeated within &amp; without -- would nevertheless not drip; even so, the monk permeates...this very body with the rapture &amp; pleasure born of withdrawal. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal. When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction, Lohicca, that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world, and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher, the criticism would be false, unfactual, unrighteous, &amp; blameworthy.
<p>
"Furthermore, with the stilling of directed thought &amp; evaluation, he enters &amp; remains in the second jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure, one-pointedness of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation -- internal assurance. He permeates &amp; pervades, suffuses &amp; fills this very body with the rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure. <A NAME="spring">Just like</A> a lake with spring-water welling up from within, having no inflow from the east, west, north, or south, and with the skies supplying abundant showers time &amp; again, so that the cool fount of water welling up from within the lake would permeate &amp; pervade, suffuse &amp; fill it with cool waters, there being no part of the lake unpervaded by the cool waters; even so, the monk permeates...this very body with the rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure. When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction, Lohicca, that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world, and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher, the criticism would be false, unfactual, unrighteous, &amp; blameworthy.
<p>
"And furthermore, with the fading of rapture, he remains in equanimity, mindful &amp; alert, and physically sensitive of pleasure. He enters &amp; remains in the third jhana, of which the noble ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasurable abiding.' He permeates &amp; pervades, suffuses &amp; fills this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture. <A NAME="lotus">Just as</A> in a lotus pond, some of the lotuses, born &amp; growing in the water, stay immersed in the water and flourish without standing up out of the water, so that they are permeated &amp; pervaded, suffused &amp; filled with cool water from their roots to their tips, and nothing of those lotuses would be unpervaded with cool water; even so, the monk permeates...this very body with the pleasure divested of rapture. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded with pleasure divested of rapture. When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction, Lohicca, that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world, and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher, the criticism would be false, unfactual, unrighteous, &amp; blameworthy.
<p>
"And furthermore, with the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain -- as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress -- he enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither-pleasure-nor-pain. He sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness. <A NAME="cloth">Just as</A> if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend; even so, the monk sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure, bright awareness. When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction, Lohicca, that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world, and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher, the criticism would be false, unfactual, unrighteous, &amp; blameworthy.
<p>
<br><p>
<h4>(Insight Knowledge)</H4>
<p>
"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge &amp; vision. He discerns: 'This body of mine is endowed with form, composed of the four primary elements, born from mother &amp; father, nourished with rice &amp; porridge, subject to inconstancy, rubbing, pressing, dissolution, &amp; dispersion. And this consciousness of mine is supported here and bound up here.' <A NAME="gem">Just as</A> if there were a beautiful beryl gem of the purest water -- eight faceted, well polished, clear, limpid, consummate in all its aspects, and going through the middle of it was a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread -- and a man with good eyesight, taking it in his hand, were to reflect on it thus: 'This is a beautiful beryl gem of the purest water, eight faceted, well polished, clear, limpid, consummate in all its aspects. And this, going through the middle of it, is a blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread.' In the same way -- with his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability -- the monk directs &amp; inclines it to knowledge &amp; vision. He discerns: 'This body of mine is endowed with form, composed of the four primary elements, born from mother &amp; father, nourished with rice &amp; porridge, subject to inconstancy, rubbing, pressing, dissolution, &amp; dispersion. And this consciousness of mine is supported here and bound up here.' When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction, Lohicca, that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world, and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher, the criticism would be false, unfactual, unrighteous, &amp; blameworthy.
<p>
<br><p>
<h4>(The Mind-made Body)</H4>
<p>
"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, he directs &amp; inclines it to creating a mind-made body. From this body he creates another body, endowed with form, made of the mind, complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties. <A NAME="reed">Just as</A> if a man were to draw a reed from its sheath. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the sheath, this is the reed. The sheath is one thing, the reed another, but the reed has been drawn out from the sheath.' Or as if a man were to draw a sword from its scabbard. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the sword, this is the scabbard. The sword is one thing, the scabbard another, but the sword has been drawn out from the scabbard.' Or as if a man were to pull a snake out from its slough. The thought would occur to him: 'This is the snake, this is the slough. The snake is one thing, the slough another, but the snake has been pulled out from the slough.' In the same way -- with his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, the monk directs &amp; inclines it to creating a mind-made body. From this body he creates another body, endowed with form, made of the mind, complete in all its parts, not inferior in its faculties. When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction, Lohicca, that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world, and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher, the criticism would be false, unfactual, unrighteous, &amp; blameworthy.
<p>
<br><p>
<h4>(Supranormal Powers)</H4>
<p>
"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, he directs &amp; inclines it to the modes of supranormal powers. He wields manifold supranormal powers. Having been one he becomes many; having been many he becomes one. He appears. He vanishes. He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, &amp; mountains as if through space. He dives in &amp; out of the earth as if it were water. He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land. Sitting cross-legged he flies through the air like a winged bird. With his hand he touches &amp; strokes even the sun &amp; moon, so mighty &amp; powerful. He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds. <A NAME="potter">Just as</A> a skilled potter or his assistant could craft from well-prepared clay whatever kind of pottery vessel he likes, or as a skilled ivory-carver or his assistant could craft from well-prepared ivory any kind of ivory-work he likes, or as a skilled goldsmith or his assistant could craft from well-prepared gold any kind of gold article he likes; in the same way -- with his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability -- the monk directs &amp; inclines it to the modes of supranormal powers...He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds. When a disciple of a teacher attains this sort of grand distinction, Lohicca, that is a teacher not worthy of criticism in the world, and if anyone were to criticize this sort of teacher, the criticism would be false, unfactual, unrighteous, &amp; blameworthy.

"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, he directs &amp; inclines it to the divine ear-element. He hears -- by means of the divine ear-element, purified &amp; surpassing the human -- both kinds of sounds: divine &amp; human, whether near or far. <A NAME="drums">Just as</A> if a man traveling along a highway were to hear the sounds of kettledrums, small drums, conchs, cymbals, &amp; tom-toms. He would know, 'That is the sound of kettledrums, that is the sound of small drums, that is the sound of conchs, that is the sound of cymbals, and that is the sound of tom-toms.' In the same way -- with his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability -- the monk directs &amp; inclines it to the divine ear-element.

"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, he directs &amp; inclines it to knowledge of the awareness of other beings. He knows the awareness of other beings, other individuals, having encompassed it with his own awareness. He discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion, and a mind without passion as a mind without passion. He discerns a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion, and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion. He discerns a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion, and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion. He discerns a restricted mind as a restricted mind, and a scattered mind as a scattered mind. He discerns an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind, and an unenlarged mind as an unenlarged mind. He discerns an excelled mind [one that is not at the most excellent level] as an excelled mind, and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mind. He discerns a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind, and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mind. He discerns a released mind as a released mind, and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mind. <A NAME="mirror">Just as</A> if a young woman -- or man -- fond of ornaments, examining the reflection of her own face in a bright mirror or a bowl of clear water would know 'blemished' if it were blemished, or 'unblemished' if it were not. In the same way -- with his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability -- the monk directs &amp; inclines it to knowledge of the awareness of other beings.

<h4>(Recollection of Past Lives)</H4>

"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, he directs &amp; inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives (lit: previous homes). He recollects his manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, two births, three births, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred, one thousand, one hundred thousand, many aeons of cosmic contraction, many aeons of cosmic expansion, many aeons of cosmic contraction &amp; expansion, [recollecting], 'There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure &amp; pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure &amp; pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes &amp; details. <A NAME="village">Just as</A> if a man were to go from his home village to another village, and then from that village to yet another village, and then from that village back to his home village. The thought would occur to him, 'I went from my home village to that village over there. There I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, talked in such a way, and remained silent in such a way. From that village I went to that village over there, and there I stood in such a way, sat in such a way, talked in such a way, and remained silent in such a way. From that village I came back home.' In the same way -- with his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability -- the monk directs &amp; inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives.

"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, he directs &amp; inclines it to knowledge of the passing away &amp; re-appearance of beings. He sees -- by means of the divine eye, purified &amp; surpassing the human -- beings passing away &amp; re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior &amp; superior, beautiful &amp; ugly, fortunate &amp; unfortunate in accordance with their kamma: 'These beings -- who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, &amp; mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views -- with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell. But these beings -- who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, &amp; mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views -- with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destinations, in the heavenly world.' Thus -- by means of the divine eye, purified &amp; surpassing the human -- he sees beings passing away &amp; re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior &amp; superior, beautiful &amp; ugly, fortunate &amp; unfortunate in accordance with their kamma. <A NAME="tall">Just as</A> if there were a tall building in the central square [of a town], and a man with good eyesight standing on top of it were to see people entering a house, leaving it, walking along the street, and sitting in the central square. The thought would occur to him, 'These people are entering a house, leaving it, walking along the streets, and sitting in the central square.' In the same way -- with his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability -- the monk directs &amp; inclines it to knowledge of the passing away &amp; re-appearance of beings.

<h4>(The Ending of Mental Fermentations)</H4>

"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, the monk directs &amp; inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations. He discerns, as it is actually present, that 'This is stress...This is the origination of stress...This is the cessation of stress...This is the way leading to the cessation of stress...These are mental fermentations...This is the origination of fermentations...This is the cessation of fermentations...This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations.' His heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, is released from the fermentation of sensuality, the fermentation of becoming, the fermentation of ignorance. With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.' <A NAME="pool">Just as</A> if there were a pool of water in a mountain glen -- clear, limpid, &amp; unsullied -- where a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells, gravel, &amp; pebbles, and also shoals of fish swimming about &amp; resting, and it would occur to him, 'This pool of water is clear, limpid, &amp; unsullied. Here are these shells, gravel, &amp; pebbles, and also these shoals of fish swimming about &amp; resting.' In the same way -- with his mind thus concentrated, purified, &amp; bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability -- the monk directs &amp; inclines it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations.

When this was said, the brahmin Lohicca said to the Blessed One: "Master Gotama, it's <A NAME="hell">as if</A> a man, having seized by the hair another man who was falling into the pit of hell, were to pull him up &amp; set him on firm ground. In the same way, master Gotama has pulled me up as I was falling into the pit of hell and has set me on firm ground. <A NAME="magnif">Magnificent</A>, master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what had been overturned, were to reveal what was hidden, were to show the way to one who was lost, or were to hold up a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way master Gotama has -- through many lines of reasoning -- made the Dhamma clear. I go to master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, &amp; to the community of monks. May master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life."
