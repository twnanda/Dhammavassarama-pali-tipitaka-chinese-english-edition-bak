"In giving a meal, the donor gives five things to the recipient. Which five? He/she gives life, beauty, happiness, strength, &amp; quick-wittedness. Having given life, he/she has a share in long life, either human or divine. Having given beauty, he/she has a share in beauty, either human or divine. Having given happiness, he/she has a share in happiness, either human or divine. Having given strength, he/she has a share in strength, either human or divine. Having given quick-wittedness, he/she has a share in quick-wittedness, either human or divine. In giving a meal, the donor gives these five things to the recipient."
<blockquote>
The prudent person giving life, strength,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beauty, quick-wittedness -- <br>
the wise person, a giver of happiness -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attains happiness himself.<br>
Having given life, strength, beauty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; happiness, &amp; quick-wittedness,<br>
he has long life &amp; status<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wherever he arises.
