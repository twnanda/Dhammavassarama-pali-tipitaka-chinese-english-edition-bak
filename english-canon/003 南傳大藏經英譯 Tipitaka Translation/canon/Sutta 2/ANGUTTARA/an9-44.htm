[<a name="udayin">Udayin</a>:] "'Released through discernment, released through discernment,' it is said. To what extent is one described by the Blessed One as released through discernment?"
<p>
[<a name="ananda">Ananda</a>:] "There is the case, my friend, where a monk, withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful qualities, enters &amp; remains in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. And he knows it through discernment. It is to this extent that one is described in a sequential way by the Blessed One as released through discernment.
<p>
"Furthermore, with the stilling of directed thought &amp; evaluation, he enters &amp; remains in the second jhana...the third jhana...the fourth jhana...the sphere of the infinitude of space...the sphere of the infinitude of consciousness...the sphere of nothingness...the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception. And he knows it through discernment. It is to this extent that one is described in a sequential way by the Blessed One as released through discernment.
<p>
"Furthermore, with the complete transcending of the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception, he enters &amp; remains in the cessation of perception &amp; feeling. And as he sees with discernment, the mental fermentations go to their total end. And he knows it through discernment. It is to this extent that one is described in a non-sequential way by the Blessed One as released through discernment."
