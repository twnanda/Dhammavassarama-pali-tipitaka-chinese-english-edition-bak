I have heard that at one time the Blessed One was staying in <A NAME="savatthi">Savatthi</A> at Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="anatha">Anathapindika</A>'s park.There he addressed the monks, saying, "Monks."
<p>
"Yes, lord," the monks responded to him.
<p>
The Blessed One said, "Whether or not there is the arising of Tathagatas, this property stands -- this steadfastness of the Dhamma, this orderliness of the Dhamma: All processes are inconstant.
<p>
"The Tathagata directly awakens to that, breaks through to that. Directly awakening &amp; breaking through to that, he declares it, teaches it, describes it, sets it forth. He reveals it, explains it, &amp; makes it plain: All processes are inconstant.
<p>
"Whether or not there is the arising of Tathagatas, this property stands -- this steadfastness of the Dhamma, this orderliness of the Dhamma: All processes are stressful.
<p>
"The Tathagata directly awakens to that, breaks through to that. Directly awakening &amp; breaking through to that, he declares it, teaches it, describes it, sets it forth. He reveals it, explains it, &amp; makes it plain: All processes are stressful.
<p>
"Whether or not there is the arising of Tathagatas, this property stands -- this steadfastness of the Dhamma, this orderliness of the Dhamma: All phenomena are not-self.
<p>
"The Tathagata directly awakens to that, breaks through to that. Directly awakening &amp; breaking through to that, he declares it, teaches it, describes it, sets it forth. He reveals it, explains it, &amp; makes it plain: All phenomena are not-self."
<p>
That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted at his words.
