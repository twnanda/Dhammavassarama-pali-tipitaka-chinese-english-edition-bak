I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <a name="vesali">Vesali</a>, in the Great Forest, at the Gabled Pavilion. Then, in the late afternoon, he left his seclusion and went to the sick ward, where he saw a monk who was weak &amp; sickly. Seeing him, he sat down on a prepared seat. As he was sitting there, he addressed the monks: "When these five things don't leave a monk who is weak &amp; sickly, it can be expected of him that, before long -- with the ending of the fermentations -- he will enter &amp; remain in the fermentation-free release of awareness &amp; release of discernment, having realized &amp; directly known them for himself in the here &amp; now. Which five?
<p>
"There is the case where a monk [1] remains focused on unattractiveness with regard to the body, [2] is percipient of foulness with regard to food, [3] is percipient of distaste with regard to every world, [4] is percipient of the undesirability of all fabrications, and [5] has the perception of death well established within himself.
