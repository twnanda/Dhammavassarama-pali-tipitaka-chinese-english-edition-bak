<hr>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near
<A NAME="vesali">Vesali</A>, in the Great Forest, at the Gabled Pavilion. Then <A NAME="siha">General Siha</A> went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "Is it possible, lord, to point out a fruit of generosity visible in the here &amp; now?"
<p>
"It is possible, Siha. One who is generous, a master of giving, is dear &amp; charming to people at large. And the fact that who is generous, a master of giving, is dear &amp; charming to people at large: this is a fruit of generosity visible in the here &amp; now.
<p>
"Furthermore, good people, people of integrity, admire one who is generous, a master of giving. And the fact that good people, people of integrity, admire one who is generous, a master of giving: this, too, is a fruit of generosity visible in the here &amp; now.
<p>
"Furthermore, the fine reputation of one who is generous, a master of giving, is spread far &amp; wide. And the fact that the fine reputation of one who is generous, a master of giving, is spread far &amp; wide: this, too, is a fruit of generosity visible in the here &amp; now.
<p>
"Furthermore, when one who is generous, a master of giving, approaches any assembly of people -- noble warriors, brahmins, householders, or contemplatives -- he/she does so confidently &amp; without embarrassment. And the fact that when one who is generous, a master of giving, approaches any assembly of people -- noble warriors, brahmins, householders, or contemplatives -- he/she does so confidently &amp; without embarrassment: this, too, is a fruit of generosity visible in the here &amp; now.
<p>
"Furthermore, at the break-up of the body, after death, one who is generous, a master of giving, reappears in a good destination, the heavenly world. And the fact that at the break-up of the body, after death, one who is generous, a master of giving, reappears in a good destination, the heavenly world: this is a fruit of generosity in the next life."
<p>
When this was said, General Siha said to the Blessed One: "As for the four fruits of generosity visible in the here &amp; now that have been pointed out by the Blessed One, it's not the case that I go by conviction in the Blessed One with regard to them. I know them, too. I am generous, a master of giving, dear &amp; charming to people at large. I am generous, a master of giving; good people, people of integrity, admire me. I am generous, a master of giving, and my fine reputation is spread far &amp; wide: 'Siha is generous, a doer, a supporter of the Sangha.' I am generous, a master of giving, and when I approach any assembly of people -- noble warriors, brahmins, householders, or contemplatives -- I do so confidently &amp; without embarrassment.
<p>
"But when the Blessed One says to me, 'At the break-up of the body, after death, one who is generous, a master of giving, reappears in a good destination, the heavenly world,' that I do not know. That is where I go by conviction in the Blessed One."
<p>
"So it is, Siha. So it is. At the break-up of the body, after death, one who is generous, a master of giving, reappears in a good destination, the heavenly world."

One who gives is dear.<br>
People at large admire him.<br>
He gains honor. His status grows.<br>
He enters an assembly unembarrassed.<br>
He is confident -- the man unmiserly.
<p>
Therefore the wise give gifts.<br>
Seeking bliss, they would subdue the stain of miserliness.<br>
Established in the three-fold heavenly world,<br>
they enjoy themselves long<br>
in fellowship with the devas.
<p>
Having made the opportunity for themselves,<br>
having done what is skillful,<br>
then when they fall from here<br>
they fare on, self-radiant, in <A NAME="nandana">Nandana</A> [the garden of the devas].
<p>
There they delight, enjoy, are joyful,<br>
replete with the five sensuality strands.<br>
Having followed the words of the sage who is Such,<br>
they enjoy themselves in heaven -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disciples of the One Well-gone.
