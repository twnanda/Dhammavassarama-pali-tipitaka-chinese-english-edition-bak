"Monks, there are these four perversions of perception, perversions of mind, perversions of view. Which four? 'Constant' with regard to the inconstant is a perversion of perception, a perversion of mind, a perversion of view. 'Pleasant' with regard to the stressful...'Self' with regard to not-self...'Attractive' with regard to the unattractive is a perversion of perception, a perversion of mind, a perversion of view. These are the four perversions of perception, perversions of mind, perversions of view.
<p>
"There are these four non-perversions of perception, non-perversions of mind, non-perversions of view. Which four? 'Inconstant' with regard to the inconstant is a non-perversion of perception, a non-perversion of mind, a non-perversion of view. 'Stressful' with regard to the stressful...'Not-self' with regard to not-self...'Unattractive' with regard to the unattractive is a non-perversion of perception, a non-perversion of mind, a non-perversion of view. These are the four non-perversions of perception, non-perversions of mind, non-perversions of view."
<blockquote>
Perceiving constancy in the inconstant,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pleasure in the stressful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self in what's not-self,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attractiveness in the unattractive,<br>
beings, destroyed by wrong-view,<br>
go mad, out of their minds.<br>
Bound to <A NAME="mara">Mara</A>'s yoke,<br>
from the yoke they find no rest.<br>
Beings go on to the wandering-on,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leading to birth &amp; death.
<p>
But when Awakened Ones<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arise in the world,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bringing light to the world,<br>
they proclaim the Dhamma<br>
leading to the stilling of stress.<br>
When those with discernment listen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they regain their senses,<br>
seeing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the inconstant as inconstant,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the stressful as stressful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what's not-self as not-self,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the unattractive as unattractive.<br>
Undertaking right view,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they transcend all stress &amp; suffering.
