"There are these five seasonable gifts. Which five? One gives to a newcomer. One gives to one going away. One gives to one who is ill. One gives in time of famine. One sets the first fruits of field &amp; orchard in front of those who are virtuous. These are the five seasonable gifts."
<blockquote>
In the proper season they give -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those with discernment,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; responsive, free from stinginess.<br>
Having been given in proper season,<br>
with hearts inspired by the Noble Ones<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -- straightened, Such -- <br>
their offering bears an abundance.<br>
Those who rejoice in that gift<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or give assistance,<br>
they, too, have a share of the merit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the offering isn't depleted by that.<br>
So, with an unhesitant mind,<br>
one should give where the gift bears great fruit.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Merit is what establishes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; living beings in the next life.
