<hr>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the <A NAME="vajji">Vajjians</A> at <A NAME="bhanda">Bhanda</A> Village. There he addressed the monks, "Monks!"
<p>
"Yes, lord," the monks responded.
<p>
The Blessed One said: "It's because of not understanding and not penetrating four things that we have wandered &amp; transmigrated on such a long, long time, you &amp; I. Which four?
<p>
"It's because of not understanding and not penetrating noble virtue that we have wandered &amp; transmigrated on such a long, long time, you &amp; I.
<p>
"It's because of not understanding and not penetrating noble concentration that we have wandered &amp; transmigrated on such a long, long time, you &amp; I.
<p>
"It's because of not understanding and not penetrating noble discernment that we have wandered &amp; transmigrated on such a long, long time, you &amp; I.
<p>
"It's because of not understanding and not penetrating noble release that we have wandered &amp; transmigrated on such a long, long time, you &amp; I.
<p>
"But when noble virtue is understood &amp; penetrated, when noble concentration...noble discernment...noble release is understood &amp; penetrated, then craving for becoming is destroyed, the guide to becoming (craving &amp; attachment) is ended, there is now no further becoming."
<p>
That is what the Blessed One said. When the One Well-gone had said that, he -- the Teacher -- said further:
<blockquote>
Unexcelled virtue, concentration,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discernment, &amp; release:<br>
have been understood by Gotama of glorious stature.<br>
Having known them directly,<br>
he taught the Dhamma to the monks -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Awakened One<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Teacher who has put an end to suffering &amp; stress,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the One with vision<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; totally unbound.
