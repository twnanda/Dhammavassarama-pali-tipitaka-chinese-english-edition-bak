<hr>
"A monk endowed with five qualities practices both for his own benefit and for that of others. Which five?
<p>
"There is the case where a monk is himself consummate in virtue and encourages others to be consummate in virtue. He himself is consummate in concentration and encourages others to be consummate in concentration. He himself is consummate in discernment and encourages others to be consummate in discernment. He himself is consummate in release and encourages others to be consummate in release. He himself is consummate in the knowledge &amp; vision of release and encourages others to be consummate in the knowledge &amp; vision of release.
<p>
"Endowed with these five qualities, a monk practices both for his own benefit and for that of others.
