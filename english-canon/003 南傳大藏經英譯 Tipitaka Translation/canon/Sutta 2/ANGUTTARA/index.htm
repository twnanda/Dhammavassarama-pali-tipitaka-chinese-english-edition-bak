        Kesi is so moved by the Buddha's explanation that he

        exposition warrants careful study by all teachers -- not
        only of Dhamma -- as it reveals the multiple levels in
        which effective teaching operates: the Buddha speaks in
        terms that the listener understands (horsetraining), he
        uses similes to great effect, and he deftly answers the <i>real</i>
        question that lies behind the student's query
