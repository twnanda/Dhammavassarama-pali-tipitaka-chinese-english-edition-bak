<i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</i>
<p>
"Abandon one quality, monks, and I guarantee you non-return. Which one quality? Abandon greed as the one quality, and I guarantee you non-return."<i> This is the meaning of what the Blessed One said. So with regard to this it was said:</i> *
<blockquote>
The greed with which<br>
beings go to a bad bourn, coveting:<br>
From rightly discerning that greed,<br>
those who see clearly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let go.<br>
Letting go, they never come to this world<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ever again.
</blockquote>
<i>This, too, was the meaning of what was said by the Blessed One, so I have heard.*</i>
<p>
[*These two statements are repeated in each discourse. To avoid monotony, they are given here only in the first and last discourses.]

<i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</i>
<p>
"Abandon one quality, monks, and I guarantee you non-return. Which one quality? Abandon aversion as the one quality, and I guarantee you non-return."
<blockquote>
The aversion with which<br>
beings go to a bad bourn, upset:<br>
From rightly discerning that aversion,<br>
those who see clearly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let go.<br>
Letting go, they never come to this world<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ever again.

<i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</i>
<p>
"Abandon one quality, monks, and I guarantee you non-return. Which one quality? Abandon delusion as the one quality, and I guarantee you non-return."
<blockquote>
The delusion with which<br>
beings go to a bad bourn, confused:<br>
From rightly discerning that delusion,<br>
those who see clearly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let go.<br>
Letting go, they never come to this world<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ever again.

<i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard</i>:
<p>
"Abandon one quality, monks, and I guarantee you non-return. Which one quality? Abandon anger as the one quality, and I guarantee you non-return."
<blockquote>
The anger with which<br>
beings go to a bad bourn, enraged:<br>
From rightly discerning that anger,<br>
those who see clearly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let go.<br>
Letting go, they never come to this world<br>

<i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard</i>:
<p>
"Abandon one quality, monks, and I guarantee you non-return. Which one quality? Abandon contempt as the one quality, and I guarantee you non-return."
<blockquote>
The contempt with which<br>
beings go to a bad bourn, disdainful:<br>
From rightly discerning that contempt,<br>
those who see clearly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let go.<br>
Letting go, they never come to this world<br>

<p>
"Abandon one quality, monks, and I guarantee you non-return. Which one quality? Abandon conceit as the one quality, and I guarantee you non-return."
<blockquote>
The conceit with which<br>
beings go to a bad bourn, proud:<br>
From rightly discerning that conceit,<br>
those who see clearly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let go.<br>
Letting go, they never come to this world<br>

<h3><a name="7">7.</a></h3>
<i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</i>
<p>
"Monks, one who has not fully known and fully understood the All, who has not detached his mind from it and let go of it, is incapable of putting an end to stress. But one who has fully known and fully understood the All, who has detached his mind from it and let go of it, is capable of putting an end to stress."
<blockquote>
He who knows the All<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from all around,<br>
who is not aroused<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by anything at all.<br>
having totally comprehended<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the All,<br>
has overcome<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all stress.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> The All = the six senses (sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and ideation) and their respective objects. This covers the entirety of experience that can be described. For a full discussion of this point, see <A HREF="../../lib/modern/index.htm#likefire" tppabs="http://www.sacred-texts.com/lib/modern/index.htm#likefire">The Mind Like Fire Unbound</A>, pp. 30-32.

<i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</i>
<p>
"Monks, one who has not fully known and fully understood conceit, who has not detached his mind from it and let go of it, is incapable of putting an end to stress. But one who has fully known and fully understood conceit, who has detached his mind from it and let go of it, is capable of putting an end to stress."
<blockquote>
People are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; possessed by conceit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tied up with conceit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delighted with becoming.<br>
Not comprehending conceit<br>
they come to becoming again.<br>
<p>
But those who, letting go of conceit,<br>
are, in its destruction, released,<br>
conquering the bond of conceit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overcome all bonds.

<h3><a name="14">14.</a></h3>
<i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</i>
<p>
"Monks, I don't envision even one other obstruction -- obstructed by which people go wandering and transmigrating on for a long, long time -- like the obstruction of ignorance. Obstructed with the obstruction of ignorance, monks, people go wandering and transmigrating on for a long, long time."
<blockquote>
Not a single thing<br>
so obstructs people<br>
that they transmigrate on, day &amp; night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as when they are strung-up on delusion.<br>
But those who, letting go of delusion<br>
shatter the mass of darkness<br>
wander no further.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their cause isn't found.

<h3><a name="15">15.</a></h3>
<i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</i>
<p>
"Monks, I don't envision even one other fetter -- fettered by which beings conjoined go wandering and transmigrating on for a long, long time -- like the fetter of craving. Fettered with the fetter of craving, beings conjoined go wandering and transmigrating on for a long, long time."
<blockquote>
A man with craving as his companion<br>
wanders on a long, long time.<br>
Neither in this state nor another<br>
can he get beyond the wandering on.<br>
Knowing this drawback -- <br>
that craving brings stress into play -- <br>
free from craving, devoid of clinging,<br>
the mindful monk is unbound.<br>

<h3><a name="16">16.</a></h3>
<i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</i>
<p>
"With regard to internal factors, I don't envision any other single factor so helpful as appropriate attention for a monk who is a learner, who has not attained the goal but remains intent on the unsurpassed rest from the yoke. A monk who attends appropriately abandons what is unskillful and develops what is skillful.
<blockquote>
The quality of appropriate attention<br>
in a learning monk:<br>
Nothing else is so helpful<br>
for attaining the supreme goal.<br>
A monk, striving appropriately,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attains the ending of stress.

<h3><a name="17">17.</a></h3>
<i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</i>
<p>
"With regard to external factors, I don't envision any other single factor like friendship with admirable people in being so helpful for a monk who is a learner, who has not attained the goal but remains intent on the unsurpassed rest from the yoke. A monk who is a friend with admirable people abandons what is unskillful and develops what is skillful."
<blockquote>
A monk who is a friend<br>
to admirable people,<br>
-- one reverential, respectful,<br>
doing what his friends advise -- <br>
alert, mindful,<br>
attains step by step<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the ending of all fetters.

<h3><a name="19">19.</a></h3>
<i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</i>
<p>
"One thing, when arising in the world, arises for the welfare of the masses, for the happiness of the masses, for the welfare and happiness of many beings, both heavenly and human. Which one thing? Concord in the Sangha. When the Sangha is in concord, there are no arguments with one another, no abuse of one another, no ganging up on one another, no abandoning of one another. Then those with little confidence [in the teaching] become confident, while those already confident become even more so."
<blockquote>
Blissful is concord in the Sangha.<br>
One who assists in concord -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delighting in concord,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; judicious -- <br>
is not barred<br>
from security from bondage.<br>
Having brought concord to the Sangha,<br>
one rejoices for an aeon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in heaven.

<h3><a name="23">23.</a></h3>
<i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</i>
<p>
"This one quality, if developed and pursued, keeps both benefits in hand: benefit in this life, and benefits in lives to come. Which one quality? Heedfulness with regard to skillful qualities. This is the one quality that, if developed and pursued, keeps both benefits in hand: benefit in the here and now, and benefits in lives to come."
<blockquote>
The wise praise heedfulness<br>
in doing deeds of merit,<br>
for one who is heedful, wise,<br>
achieves both benefits:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; benefit in the here and now,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; benefits in lives to come.<br>
From breaking through to one's benefit,<br>
one is called prudent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wise.

<h3><a name="24">24.</a></h3>
<i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</i>
<p>
"If a single person were to wander and transmigrate on for an aeon, he would leave behind a chain of bones, a pile of bones, a heap of bones, as large as this <A NAME="vep24">Mount Vepulla</A>, if there were someone to collect them and the collection were not destroyed."
<blockquote>
The accumulation of a single person's<br>
bones for an aeon<br>
would be a heap on a par<br>
with the mountain,<br>
so said the Great Seer.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (He declared this to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the great Mount Vepulla<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the north of Vulture's Peak<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the mountain-ring<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the <A NAME="mag24">Magadhans</A>.)<br>
But when that person sees<br>
with right discernment<br>
the four Noble Truths -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stress,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the cause of stress,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the transcending of stress,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; the Noble Eightfold Path,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the way to the stilling of stress -- <br>
having wandered on<br>
seven times at most, then,<br>
from the ending of all fetters<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he makes an end of suffering &amp; stress.

<h3><a name="25">25.</a></h3>
<i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</i>
<p>
"For the person who transgresses in one thing, I tell you, there is no evil deed that is not to be done. Which one thing? This: telling a deliberate lie."
<blockquote>
The person who lies,<br>
who transgress in this one thing,<br>
transcending concern for the world beyond:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there's no evil<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he might not do.

<h3><a name="26">26.</a></h3>
<i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</i>
<p>
"If beings knew, as I know, the results of giving and sharing, they would not eat without having given, nor would the stain of selfishness overcome their minds. Even if it were their last bite, their last mouthful, they would not eat without having shared, if there were someone to receive their gift. But because beings do not know, as I know, the results of giving and sharing, they eat without having given. The stain of selfishness overcomes their minds."
<blockquote>
If beings knew<br>
what was said by the great sage,<br>
that the result of sharing<br>
is of such great fruit,<br>
subduing selfishness<br>
with brightened awareness,<br>
they would give in season<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the noble ones,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where a gift bears great fruit.
<p>
Having given much food<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as an offering<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to those worthy of offerings,<br>
then when they fall from here,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the human state,<br>
the donors go to heaven.<br>
And having gone there to heaven,<br>
they rejoice in yearned-for pleasures.<br>
They, the unselfish, partake in<br>
the result of sharing.

<h3><a name="27">27.</a></h3>
<i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</i>
<p>
"All the grounds for making merit leading to spontaneously arising (in heaven) do not equal one-sixteenth of the release of awareness through good will. Good will -- surpassing them -- shines, blazes, and dazzles.
<p>
<A NAME="moon27">Just as</A> the radiance of all the stars does not equal one-sixteenth of the radiance of the moon, as the moon -- surpassing them -- shines, blazes, and dazzles, even so, all the grounds for making merit leading to spontaneously arising in heaven do not equal one-sixteenth of the release of awareness through good will. Good will -- surpassing them -- shines, blazes, and dazzles.
<p>
<A NAME="sun27">Just as</A> in the last month of the rains, in autumn, when the sky is clear and cloudless, the sun, on ascending the sky, overpowers the space immmersed in darkness, shines, blazes, and dazzles, even so, all the grounds for making merit leading to spontaneously arising in heaven do not equal one-sixteenth of the release of awareness through good will. Good will -- surpassing them -- shines, blazes, and dazzles.
<p>
<A NAME="morning27">Just as</A> in the pre-dawn darkness the morning star shines, blazes, and dazzles, even so, all the grounds for making merit leading to spontaneously arising in heaven do not equal one-sixteenth of the release of awareness through good will. Good will -- surpassing them -- shines, blazes, and dazzles."
<blockquote>
When one develops, mindfully,<br>
unlimited good will,<br>
fetters are worn through,<br>
on seeing the ending of acquisitions.<br>
<p>
If with uncorrupted mind<br>
one feels good will for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; being,<br>
one becomes skilled from that.<br>
But a Noble One produces<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a mind of sympathy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for all beings,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an abundance of merit.
<p>
Kingly seers, who conquered the earth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; swarming with beings,<br>
went about making sacrifices:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the horse sacrifice, human sacrifice,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; water rites, soma rites,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; the "Unobstructed,"<br>
but these don't equal one-sixteenth<br>
of a well-developed mind of good will,<br>
<A NAME="moon27b">just as</A> the constellations<br>
don't equal one-sixteenth<br>
of the radiance of the moon.
<p>
One who neither kills<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor gets others to kill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neither conquers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor gets others to conquer,<br>
with good will for all beings,<br>
has no enmity with anyone at all.<br>
