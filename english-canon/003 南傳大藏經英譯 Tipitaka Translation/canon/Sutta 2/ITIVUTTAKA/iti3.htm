<p>
"There are these <A NAME="3feelings53">three feelings</A>. Which three? A feeling of pleasure, a feeling of pain, a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain. A feeling of pleasure should be seen as stressful. A feeling of pain should be seen as a stinger. A feeling of neither pleasure nor pain should be seen as inconstant. When a monk has seen a feeling of pleasure as stressful, a feeling of pain as a stinger, and a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain as inconstant, then he is called a monk who is noble, who has seen rightly, who has cut off craving, destroyed the fetter, and who -- from the right breaking-through of conceit -- has put an end to suffering &amp; stress."
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Whoever sees<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pleasure as stress,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pain as a stinger,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and peaceful neither-pleasure-nor-pain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as inconstant,<br>
is a monk who has seen rightly.<br>
From that he is there set free:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a master of direct knowledge,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at peace,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a sage gone beyond<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the yoke.

"There are these three searches. Which three? The search for sensuality, the search for becoming, the search for a holy life. These are the three searches."
<blockquote>
Sensual search, becoming-search,<br>
together with the holy-life search -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.e., grasping at truth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; based on the accumulation of viewpoints.<br>
Through the relinquishment of searches<br>
&amp; the abolishing of viewpoints<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of one dispassionate to all passion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and released in the ending of craving,<br>
through the ending of searches, the monk<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is devoid of perplexity &amp; desire.

This was said by the Lord....
<p>
"Bhikkhus, these three kinds of persons are found existing in the world. What three? One who is like a rainless cloud, one who rains locally, and one who rains everywhere.
<p>
"Now what kind of person, bhikkhus, is like a rainless cloud? Here, a certain person is not a giver to anyone; he does not give food, drink, clothing, vehicles, garlands, scents, ointments, beds, lodging, and lamps to recluses and brahmins, to the poor, destitute, and needy. This kind of person is like a rainless cloud.
<p>
"Now what, bhikkhus, is the kind of person who rains locally? Here, a certain person is a giver to some but not a giver to others. Food, drink, clothing, vehicles, garlands, scents, ointments, beds, lodging, and lamps he gives only to some recluses and brahmins, to some of the poor, destitute, and needy, but not to others. This is the kind of person who rains locally.
<p>
"Now what, bhikkhus, is the kind of person who rains everywhere? Here, a certain person gives to all. He gives food, drink, clothing, vehicles, garlands, scents, ointments, beds, lodging, and lamps to all recluses and brahmins, to the poor, destitute, and needy. This is the kind of person who rains everywhere.
<p>
"These, bhikkhus, are the three kinds of persons found existing in the world."
<blockquote>
Neither to recluses nor brahmins<br>
Nor to the poor and destitute<br>
Does he distribute his store<br>
Of food and drink and goods;<br>
That base person is called<br>
"One like a rainless cloud."
<p>
To some he does not give,<br>
To some he offers alms;<br>
That one wise people call<br>
"One who rains only locally."
<p>
A person renowned for his bounty,<br>
Compassionate towards all beings,<br>
Distributes alms gladly.<br>
"Give! Give!" he says.
<p>
Like a great storm cloud<br>
That thunders and rains down<br>
Filling the levels and hollows,<br>
Saturating the earth with water,<br>
Even so is such a person.
<p>
Having righteously gathered wealth<br>Which he obtains by his own effort,<br>He fully satisfies with food and drink<br>Whatever beings live in need.

"These three divine sounds sound forth among the devas on appropriate occasions. Which three? When a noble disciple, shaving off his hair and beard, clothing himself in the ochre robe, makes up his mind to go forth from the home life into homelessness, on that occasion the divine sound sounds forth among the devas: 'This noble disciple has made up his mind to do battle with <A NAME="mara82">Mara</A>.' This is the first divine sound that sounds forth among the devas on appropriate occasions.
<p>
"When a noble disciple lives engaged in developing the seven [sets of] qualities that are wings to awakening, on that occasion the divine sound sounds forth among the devas: 'This noble disciple is doing battle with Mara.' This is the second divine sound that sounds forth among the devas on appropriate occasions.
<p>
"When a noble disciple, through the ending of effluents dwells in the release of awareness and release of discernment that are free from effluent, having known and made them manifest for himself in the here and now, on that occasion the divine sound sounds forth among the devas: 'This noble disciple has won the battle. Having been in the front lines of the battle, he now dwells victorious.' This is the third divine sound that sounds forth among the devas on appropriate occasions.
<p>
"These are the three divine sounds that sound forth among the devas on appropriate occasions."
<blockquote>
Seeing that he has won the battle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- the disciple of the rightly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self-awakened one -- <br>
even the devas pay homage<br>
to this great one, thoroughly mature.<br>
"Homage to you, O thoroughbred of a man,<br>
you who have won the hard victory,<br>
defeating the army of Death,<br>
unhindered in emancipation."

"Remain focused, monks, on the foulness of the body. Have mindfulness of in-and-out breathing well established to the fore within you. Remain focused on the inconstancy of all fabrications. For one who remains focused on the foulness of the body, the latent tendency to passion for the property of beauty is abandoned. For one who has mindfulness of in-and-out breathing well established to the fore within oneself, annoying external thoughts and inclinations don't exist. For one who remains focused on the inconstancy of all fabrications, ignorance is abandoned, and clear knowing arises."
