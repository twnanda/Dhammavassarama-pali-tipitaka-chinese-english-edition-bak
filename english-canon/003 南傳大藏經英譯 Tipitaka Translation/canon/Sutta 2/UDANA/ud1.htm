<h3><A NAME="1">Bodhi Sutta (Ud I.1)</A> -- Awakening (1) <A HREF="#top">go to top</A></h3>
I have heard that on one occasion, when the Blessed One was newly Awakened -- staying at <A NAME="uruvela1.1">Uruvela</A> by the banks of the <A NAME="neranjara1.1">Nera&ntilde;jara River</A> in the shade of the Bodhi tree, the tree of Awakening -- he sat in the shade of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one session, sensitive to the bliss of release. At the end of seven days, after emerging from that concentration, in the first watch of the night, he gave close attention to dependent co-arising in forward order, thus:
<blockquote>
When this is, that is.<br>
From the arising of this comes the arising of that.
<p>
In other words:
<p>
From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications.<br>
From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness.<br>
From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-and-form.<br>
From name-and-form as a requisite condition come the six sense media.<br>
From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact.<br>
From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling.<br>
From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving.<br>
From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance.<br>
From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming.<br>
From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth.<br>
From birth as a requisite condition, then old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair come into play. Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress and suffering.
</blockquote>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<blockquote>
As phenomena grow clear<br>
to the brahmin -- ardent, absorbed -- <br>
his doubts all vanish<br>
when he discerns what has a cause.

<h3><A NAME="2">Bodhi Sutta (Ud I.2)</A> -- Awakening (2) <A HREF="#top">go to top</A></h3>
I have heard that on one occasion, when the Blessed One was newly Awakened -- staying at <A NAME="uruvela1.2">Uruvela</A> by the banks of the <A NAME="neranjara1.2">Nera&ntilde;jara River</A> in the shade of the Bodhi tree, the tree of Awakening -- he sat in the shade of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one session, sensitive to the bliss of release. At the end of seven days, after emerging from that concentration, in the second watch of the night, he gave close attention to dependent co-arising in reverse order, thus:
<blockquote>
When this isn't, that isn't.<br>
From the cessation of this comes the cessation of that.
<p>
In other words:
<p>
From the cessation of ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications.<br>
From the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness.<br>
From the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name-and-form.<br>
From the cessation of name-and-form comes the cessation of the six sense media.<br>
From the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact.<br>
From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling.<br>
From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving.<br>
From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging/sustenance.<br>
From the cessation of clinging/sustenance comes the cessation of becoming.<br>
From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth.<br>
From the cessation of birth, then old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair all cease. Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress and suffering.
</blockquote>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<blockquote>
As phenomena grow clear<br>
to the brahmin -- ardent, absorbed -- <br>
his doubts all vanish<br>
when he penetrates the ending<br>
of requisite conditions.

<h3><A NAME="3">Bodhi Sutta (Ud I.3)</A> -- Awakening (3) <A HREF="#top">go to top</A></h3>
I have heard that on one occasion, when the Blessed One was newly Awakened -- staying at <A NAME="uruvela1.3">Uruvela</A> by the banks of the <A NAME="neranjara1.3">Nera&ntilde;jara River</A> in the shade of the Bodhi tree, the tree of Awakening -- he sat in the shade of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one session, sensitive to the bliss of release. At the end of seven days, after emerging from that concentration, in the third watch of the night, he gave close attention to dependent co-arising in forward and reverse order, thus:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When this is, that is.<br>
From the arising of this comes the arising of that.<br>
When this isn't, that isn't.<br>
From the cessation of this comes the cessation of that.
<p>
In other words:
<p>
From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications.<br>
From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness.<br>
From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-and-form.<br>
From name-and-form as a requisite condition come the six sense media.<br>
From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact.<br>
From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling.<br>
From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving.<br>
From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance.<br>
From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming.<br>
From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth.<br>
From birth as a requisite condition, then old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair come into play.<br>
Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress and suffering.<br>
<p>
Now from the remainderless fading and cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications. From the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness.<br>
From the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name-and-form.<br>
From the cessation of name-and-form comes the cessation of the six sense media.<br>
From the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact.<br>
From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling.<br>
From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving.<br>
From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging/sustenance.<br>
From the cessation of clinging/sustenance comes the cessation of becoming.<br>
From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth.<br>
From the cessation of birth, then old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair all cease.<br>
Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress and suffering.

<A NAME="sun1.3">As</A> phenomena grow clear<br>

<h3><A NAME="6">Kassapa Sutta (Ud I.6)</A> -- About Maha Kassapa <A HREF="#top">go to top</A></h3>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in <A NAME="rajagaha1.6">Rajagaha</A> at the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary. Now at that time <A NAME="kassapa1.6">Ven. Maha Kassapa</A> was staying at the <A NAME="pipphali1.6">Pipphali Cave</A>, afflicted, in pain, and seriously ill. Then, at a later time, he recovered from his illness. When he had recovered from the illness, the thought occurred to him: "What if I were to go into Rajagaha for alms?"
<p>
Now at that time 500 devatas were eager for the chance to give alms to Ven. Maha Kassapa. But Ven. Maha Kassapa, ignoring those 500 devatas, early in the morning put on his robes and, carrying his bowl and outer robe, went into Rajagaha for alms along the streets of the poor, the streets of the indigent, the streets of the weavers. The Blessed One saw that Ven. Maha Kassapa had gone into Rajagaha for alms along the streets of the poor, the streets of the indigent, the streets of the weavers.
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<blockquote>
Maintaining no others,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unknown,<br>
trained, established<br>
in what is essential,<br>
effluents* ended,<br>
anger disgorged:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's what I call<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a brahmin.

<h3><A name="10">Bahiya Sutta (Ud I.10)</A> -- About Bahiya <A HREF="#top">go to top</A></h3>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="sav1.10">Savatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana1.10">Anathapindika</A>'s monastery. Now at that time <A NAME="bahiya1.10">Bahiya</A> of the Bark-cloth was living in <A NAME="supparaka1.10">Supparaka</A> by the seashore. He was worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, given homage -- a recipient of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medical requisites for the sick. Then, when he was alone in seclusion, this line of thinking arose to his awareness: "Now, of those who in this world are arahants or have entered the path of arahantship, am I one?"
<p>
Then a devata who had once been a blood relative of Bahiya of the Bark-cloth -- compassionate, desiring his welfare, knowing with her own awareness the line of thinking that had arisen in his awareness -- went to where he was staying and on arrival said to him: "You, Bahiya, are neither an arahant nor have you entered the path of arahantship. You don't even have the practice whereby you would become an arahant or enter the path of arahantship."
<p>
"But who, living in this world with its devas, is an arahant or has entered the path to arahantship?"
<p>
"Bahiya, there is a city in the northern country named Savatthi. The Blessed One -- an arahant, rightly self-awakened -- is living there now. He is truly an arahant and he teaches the Dhamma that leads to arahantship. "
<p>
Then Bahiya, deeply chastened by the devata, left Supparaka right then and, in the space of one day and night, went all the way to where the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi, in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery. At that time, a large number of monks were doing walking meditation in the open air. He went to them and, on arrival, said, "Where, venerable sirs, is the Blessed One staying -- the arahant, right self-awakened? We want to see him."
<p>
"He has gone into the town for alms."
<p>
Then Bahiya, hurriedly leaving Jeta's Grove and entering Savatthi, saw the Blessed One going for alms in Savatthi -- calm, calming, his senses at peace, his mind at peace, tranquil and poised in the ultimate sense, accomplished, trained, guarded, his senses restrained, a <A NAME="naga10">Great One</A> (naga). Seeing him, he approached the Blessed One and, on reaching him, threw himself down, with his head at the Blessed One's feet, and said, "Teach me the Dhamma, O Blessed One! Teach me the Dhamma, O One-Well-Gone, that will be for my long-term welfare and bliss."
<p>
When this was said, the Blessed One said to him: "This is not the time, Bahiya. We have entered the town for alms."
<p>
A second time, Bahiya said to the Blessed One: "But it is hard to know for sure what dangers there may be for the Blessed One's life, or what dangers there may be for mine. Teach me the Dhamma, O Blessed One! Teach me the Dhamma, O One-Well-Gone, that will be for my long-term welfare and bliss."
<p>
A second time, the Blessed One said to him: "This is not the time, Bahiya. We have entered the town for alms."
<p>
A third time, Bahiya said to the Blessed One: "But it is hard to know for sure what dangers there may be for the Blessed One's life, or what dangers there may be for mine. Teach me the Dhamma, O Blessed One! Teach me the Dhamma, O One-Well-Gone, that will be for my long-term welfare and bliss."
<p>
"Then, Bahiya, you should train yourself thus: In reference to the seen, there will be only the seen. In reference to the heard, only the heard. In reference to the sensed, only the sensed. In reference to the cognized, only the cognized. That is how your should train yourself. When for you there will be only the seen in reference to the seen, only the heard in reference to the heard, only the sensed in reference to the sensed, only the cognized in reference to the cognized, then, Bahiya, you will not be 'thereby.' When you are not thereby, you will not be 'therein.' When you are not therein, you will be neither 'here' nor 'there' nor between the two. This, just this, is the end of stress."
<p>
<A name="victory1.10">Through hearing</A> this brief explanation of the Dhamma from the Blessed One, the mind of Bahiya of the Bark-cloth right then and there was released from the effluents through lack of clinging/sustenance. Having exhorted Bahiya of the Bark-cloth with this brief explanation of the Dhamma, the Blessed One left.
<p>
<A NAME="cow1.10">Now</A>, not long after the Blessed One's departure, Bahiya -- attacked by a cow with a calf -- lost his life. Then the Blessed One, having gone for alms in Savatthi, after the meal, returning from his alms round with a large number of monks, saw that Bahiya had died. On seeing him, he said to the monks, "Take Bahiya's body and, placing it on a litter and carrying it away, cremate it and build him a memorial. Your companion in the holy life has died."
<p>
"As you say, lord," the monks replied. After placing Bahiya's body on a litter, carrying it off, cremating it, and building him a memorial, they went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they said to him, "Bahiya's body has been cremated, lord, and his memorial has been built. What is his destination? What is his future state?"
<p>
"Monks, Bahiya of the Bark-cloth was wise. He practiced the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma and did not pester me with issues related to the Dhamma. Bahiya of the Bark-cloth, monks, is totally unbound."
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<blockquote>
Where water, earth, fire, &amp; wind have no footing:<br>
There the stars do not shine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sun is not visible,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the moon does not appear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; darkness is not found.<br>
And when a sage,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a brahmin through sagacity,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has known [this] for himself,<br>
then from form &amp; formless,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from bliss &amp; pain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he is freed.
