<h3><A name="1">Muccalinda Sutta (Ud II.1)</A> -- About Muccalinda <A HREF="#top">go to top</A></h3>
I have heard that on one occasion, when the Blessed One was newly Awakened -- staying at Uruvela by the banks of the <A NAME="neranjara2.1">Nera&ntilde;jara River</A> in the shade of the Muccalinda tree -- he sat for seven days in one session, sensitive to the bliss of release. Now at that time a great, out-of-season storm-cloud rose up, with seven days of rainy weather, cold winds, and intense darkness. Then <A NAME="muccalinda2.1">Muccalinda</A> the naga king, leaving his realm and encircling the Blessed One's body seven times with his coils, stood with his great hood spread over the Blessed One, thinking: "Don't let the Blessed One be disturbed by cold. Don't let the Blessed One be disturbed by heat. Don't let the Blessed One be disturbed by the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and creeping things." Then at the end of the seven days the Blessed One emerged from that concentration. Muccalinda the naga king, realizing that the sky had cleared and the storm clouds had left, and unraveled his coils from the body of the Blessed One, changed his appearance and, assuming the form of a youth, stood in front of the Blessed One with hands before his heart in homage.
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<blockquote>
Blissful is solitude for one who's content,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who has heard the Dhamma,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who sees.<br>
Blissful is non-affliction with regard for the world,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; restraint for living beings.<br>
Blissful is dispassion with regard for the world,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the overcoming of sensual pleasures.<br>
But the subduing of the conceit "I am" -- <br>
That is truly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the ultimate bliss.

<h3><A name="2">Raja Sutta (Ud II.2)</A> -- Kings <A HREF="#top">go to top</A></h3>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="sav2.2">Savatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana2.2">Anathapindika's</A> monastery. Now at that time a large number of monks, after the meal, on returning from their alms round, had gathered at the meeting hall when this discussion arose: "Friends, which of these two kings has greater wealth, greater possessions, the greater treasury, the greater stock of riding animals, the greater army, greater power, greater might: <A NAME="bimbisara2.2">King Seniya Bimbisara</A> of Magadha or <A NAME="pasenadi2.2">King Pasenadi</A> of Kosala?" And this discussion came to no conclusion.
<p>
Then the Blessed One, emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon, went to the meeting hall and, on arrival, sat down on a seat made ready. As he sat down there, he addressed the monks: "For what topic are you gathered together here? And what was the discussion that came to no conclusion?"
<p>
"Just now, lord, after the meal, on returning from our alms round, we gathered at the meeting hall when this discussion arose: 'Friends, which of these two kings has greater wealth, greater possessions, the greater treasury, the greater stock of riding animals, the greater army, greater power, greater might: King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha or King Pasenadi of Kosala?' This was the discussion that had come to no conclusion when the Blessed One arrived.
<p>
"It isn't right, monks, that sons of good families, on having gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless life, should talk on such a topic. When you have gathered you have two duties: either Dhamma-talk or <A NAME="silence">noble silence</A>."
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<blockquote>
Any sensual bliss in the world,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any heavenly bliss,<br>
isn't worth one sixteenth-sixteenth<br>
of the bliss of the ending of craving.

<h3><A name="3">Danda Sutta (Ud II.3)</A> -- The Stick <A HREF="#top">go to top</A></h3>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="sav2.3">Savatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana2.3">Anathapindika's</A> monastery. Now at that time, a large number of boys on the road between Savatthi and Jeta's Grove were hitting a snake with a stick. Then early in the morning the Blessed One, having put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. He saw the large number of boys on the road between Savatthi and Jeta's Grove hitting the snake with a stick.
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<blockquote>
Whoever takes a stick<br>
to beings desiring ease,<br>
when he himself is looking for ease,<br>
will meet with no ease after death.<br>
<p>
Whoever doesn't take a stick<br>
to beings desiring ease,<br>
when he himself is looking for ease,<br>
will meet with ease after death.

<h3><A name="4">Sakkara Sutta (Ud II.4)</A> -- Veneration <A HREF="#top">go to top</A></h3>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="sav2.4">Savatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana2.4">Anathapindika's</A> monastery. Now at that time the Blessed One was worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, given homage -- a recipient of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medical requisites for the sick. The community of monks was also worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, given homage -- a recipient of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medical requisites for the sick. But the wanderers of other sects were not worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, or given homage, nor were they recipients of robes, almsfood, lodgings, or medical requisites for the sick. So the wanderers of other sects, unable to stand the veneration given to the Blessed One and the community of monks, on seeing monks in village or forest, would insult, revile, irritate, and harass them with discourteous, abusive language.
<p>
Then a large number of monks went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they said to the Blessed One: "At present the Blessed One is worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, given homage -- a recipient of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medical requisites for the sick. The community of monks is also worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, given homage -- a recipient of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medical requisites for the sick. But the wanderers of other sects are not worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, or given homage, nor are they recipients of robes, almsfood, lodgings, or medical requisites for the sick. So the wanderers of other sects, unable to stand the veneration given to the Blessed One and the community of monks, on seeing monks in village or forest, insult, revile, irritate, and harass them with discourteous, abusive language."
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<blockquote>
When in contact with pleasure or pain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in village or forest,<br>
one should blame neither<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oneself nor others.<br>
Contacts make contact<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dependent on a sense of acquisition.<br>
Where there's no sense of acquisition,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contacts would make contact<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with what?

<h3><A name="5">Upasaka Sutta (Ud II.5)</A> -- The Lay Follower <A HREF="#top">go to top</A></h3>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="sav2.5">Savatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A name="ana2.5">Anathapindika's</A> monastery. Now at that time a certain lay follower from Icchanangalaka had arrived in Savatthi on some business affairs. Having settled his affairs in Savatthi, he went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, "At long last you have managed to come here."
<p>
"For a long time I have wanted to come see the Blessed One, lord, but being involved in one business affair after another, I have not been able to do so."
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
How blissful it is, for one who has nothing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who has mastered the Dhamma,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is learned.<br>
See how they suffer, those who have something,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people bound in body<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with people.

<h3><A name="6">Gabbhini Sutta (Ud II.6)</A> -- The Pregnant Woman <A HREF="#top">go to top</A></h3>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A name="sav2.6">Savatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana2.6">Anathapindika's</A> monastery. Now at that time the young wife of a certain wanderer was pregnant and on the verge of delivery. So she said to the wanderer, "Go get some oil for my delivery."
<p>
When this was said, the wanderer said to her, "But where can I get any oil?"
<p>
A second time, she said to him, "Go get some oil for my delivery."
<p>
A second time, he said to her, "But where can I get any oil?"
<p>
A third time, she said to him, "Go get some oil for my delivery."
<p>
Now at that time at the storehouse of <A NAME="pasenadi2.6">King Pasenadi</A> Kosala they were giving priests and contemplatives as much oil or ghee as they needed to drink, but not to take away. So the thought occurred to the wanderer, "At present at the storehouse of King Pasenadi Kosala they are giving priests and contemplatives as much oil or ghee as they need to drink, but not to take away. Suppose, having gone there, I were to drink as much oil as I need and, on returning home, were to vomit it up to use at the delivery?"
<p>
So, having gone to the storehouse of King Pasenadi Kosala, he drink as much oil as he needed but, on returning home, was unable to bring it up or pass it down. So he rolled back and forth, suffering from pains that were piercing, racking, and agonizing. Then early in the morning the Blessed One, having put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. He saw the wanderer rolling back and forth, suffering from pains that were piercing, racking, and agonizing,
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
How blissful it is, for one who has nothing.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who are expert<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are people with nothing.<br>
See how they suffer, those who have something,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people bound in mind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with people.

<h3><A name="7">Ekaputta Sutta (Ud II.7)</A> -- The Only Son <A HREF="#top">go to top</A></h3>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A name="sav2.7">Savatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana2.7">Anathapindika's</A> monastery. Now at that time the dear and beloved only son of a certain lay follower had died. So a large number of lay followers -- their clothes wet, their hair wet -- went to the Blessed One in the middle of the day and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there the Blessed One said to them: "Why have you come here -- your clothes wet, your hair wet -- in the middle of the day?"
<p>
When this was said, the lay follower said to the Blessed One, "My dear and beloved only son has died. This is why we have come here -- our clothes wet, our hair wet -- in the middle of the day."
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Tied down by what's dear &amp; alluring,<br>
heavenly beings, most people,<br>
worn out with misery,<br>
fall under the sway of the King of Death.<br>
But those who, day &amp; night,<br>
heedfully abandon what's dear,<br>
dig up misery<br>
by the root -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Death's bait<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so hard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to overcome.

<h3><A name="9">Visakha Sutta (Ud II.9)</A> -- To Visakha <A HREF="#top">go to top</A></h3>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in <A NAME="sav2.9">Savatthi</A> at the Eastern Monastery, the palace of <A NAME="migaramom2.9">Migara's mother</A>. Now at that time, Visakha, Migara's mother, had some dealings with <A NAME="pasenadi2.9">King Pasenadi</A> Kosala that he did not settle as she had wished. So in the middle of the day she went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As she was sitting there the Blessed One said to her, "Well now, Visakha, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?"
<p>
"Just now, lord, I had some dealings with King Pasenadi Kosala that he did not settle as I had wished.
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
All subjection to others<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is painful.<br>
All independence<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is bliss.<br>
What is held in common<br>
brings suffering,<br>
for duties are hard<br>
to overcome.

<h3><A name="10">Bhaddiya Kaligodha Sutta (Ud II.10)</A> -- About Bhaddiya Kaligodha <A HREF="#top">go to top</A></h3>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at <A NAME="anupiya2.10">Anupiya</A> in the Mango Orchard. Now at that time, <A NAME="bhaddiya2.10">Ven. Bhaddiya Kaligodha</A>, on going to a forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, would repeatedly exclaim, "What bliss! What bliss!" A large number of monks heard Ven. Bhaddiya Kaligodha, on going to a forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, repeatedly exclaim, "What bliss! What bliss!" and on hearing him, the thought occurred to them, "There's no doubt but that Ven. Bhaddiya Kaligodha doesn't enjoy leading the holy life, for when he was a householder he knew the bliss of kingship, so that now, on recollecting that, he is repeatedly exclaiming, 'What bliss! What bliss!'" They went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they told him: "Ven. Bhaddiya Kaligodha, lord, on going to a forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, repeatedly exclaims, 'What bliss! What bliss!' There's no doubt but that Ven. Bhaddiya Kaligodha doesn't enjoy leading the holy life, for when he was a householder he knew the bliss of kingship, so that now, on recollecting that, he is repeatedly exclaiming, 'What bliss! What bliss!'"
<p>
Then the Blessed One told a certain monk, "Come, monk. In my name, call Bhaddiya, saying, 'The Teacher calls you, my friend.'"
<p>
"As you say, lord," the monk answered and, having gone to Ven. Bhaddiya, on arrival he said, "The Teacher calls you, my friend."
<p>
"As you say, my friend," Ven. Bhaddiya replied. Then he went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, "Is it true, Bhaddiya that, on going to a forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, you repeatedly exclaim, 'What bliss! What bliss!'?"
<p>
"Yes, lord."
<p>
"What meaning do you have in mind that you repeatedly exclaim, 'What bliss! What bliss!'?"
<p>
"Before, when I was a householder, maintaining the bliss of kingship, I had guards posted within and without the royal apartments, within and without the city, within and without the countryside. But even though I was thus guarded, thus protected, I dwelled in fear -- agitated, distrustful, and afraid. But now, on going alone to a forest, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, I dwell without fear, unagitated, confident, and unafraid -- unconcerned, unruffled, my wants satisfied, with my <A NAME="deer2.10">mind like a wild deer</A>. This is the meaning I have in mind that I repeatedly exclaim, 'What bliss! What bliss!'"
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In whom there exists<br>
no provocation,<br>
&amp; for whom becoming &amp; non-becoming<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are overcome,<br>
he is one -- beyond fear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blissful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without grief,<br>
whom the devas can't see.
