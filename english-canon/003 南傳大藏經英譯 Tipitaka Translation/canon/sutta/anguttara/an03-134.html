jtb 020713: The following preamble is traditionally included when this sutta is chanted, although it does not appear in the Tipitaka:

I have heard that at one time the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi at Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery. There he addressed the monks, saying, "Monks."

"Yes, lord," the monks responded to him.

The Blessed One said, "Whether or not there is the arising...

<p>"Monks, whether or not there is the arising of Tathagatas, this property stands &mdash; this steadfastness of the Dhamma, this orderliness of the Dhamma: All processes are inconstant.</p>
<p>"The Tathagata directly awakens to that, breaks through to that. Directly awakening &amp; breaking through to that, he declares it, teaches it, describes it, sets it forth. He reveals it, explains it, &amp; makes it plain: All processes are inconstant.</p>
<p>"Whether or not there is the arising of Tathagatas, this property stands &mdash; this steadfastness of the Dhamma, this orderliness of the Dhamma: All processes are stressful.</p>
<p>"The Tathagata directly awakens to that, breaks through to that. Directly awakening &amp; breaking through to that, he declares it, teaches it, describes it, sets it forth. He reveals it, explains it, &amp; makes it plain: All processes are stressful.</p>

That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted at his words.

<p><b>Note</b></p>
<div class="note">
<p><b><a href="#t-1" name="n-1" id="n-1">1</a>.</b> The suttas are inconsistent on the question of whether Unbinding counts as a phenomenon (dhamma). <a href="../khuddaka/iti/tb0/iti3.html#iti-090">Iti 90</a>, among others, states clearly that it is. <a href="an10-058.html">AN X.58</a>, however, calls Unbinding the ending of all phenomena. <a href="../khuddaka/suttanipata/snp5-06.html">Sn V.6</a> quotes the Buddha as calling the attainment of the goal the transcending of all phenomena, just as <a href="../khuddaka/suttanipata/snp4-06.html">Sn IV.6</a> and <a href="../khuddaka/suttanipata/snp4-10.html">Sn IV.10</a> state that the arahant has transcended dispassion, said to be the highest phenomenon. If the former definition applies here, Unbinding would be not-self. If the latter, the word phenomenon (as more inclusive than fabrication) would apply to the non-returner's experience of the Deathless (see <a href="an09-036.html">AN IX.36</a>). The arahant's experience of Unbinding would be neither self nor not-self, as it lies beyond all designations (see <a href="../digha/dn-15-tb0.html">DN 15</a>).</p>
