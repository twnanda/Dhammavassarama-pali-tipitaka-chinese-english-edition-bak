<div class="sutta">
<p>"There are these <a name="trainings" id="trainings">three trainings</a>. Which three? The training in heightened virtue, the training in heightened mind, the training in heightened discernment.</p>
<p>"And what is the training in <a name="sila" id="sila">heightened virtue</a>? There is the case where a monk is virtuous. He dwells restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha, consummate in his behavior &amp; sphere of activity. He trains himself, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in the slightest fault. This is called the training in heightened virtue.</p>
<p>"And what is the training in heightened mind? There is the case where a monk &mdash; quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful [mental] qualities &mdash; enters &amp; remains in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. With the stilling of directed thought &amp; evaluation, he enters &amp; remains in the second jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation &mdash; internal assurance. With the fading of rapture he remains in equanimity, mindful &amp; alert, and physically sensitive of pleasure. He enters &amp; remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasurable abiding.' With the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain &mdash; as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress &mdash; he enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. This is called the training in heightened mind.</p>
<p>"And what is the training in heightened discernment? There is the case where a monk discerns as it actually is that 'This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.' This is called the training in heightened discernment.</p>
<p>"These are the three trainings."</p>
