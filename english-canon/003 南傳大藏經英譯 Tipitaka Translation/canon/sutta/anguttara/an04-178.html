<p>"Monks, these four types of individuals are to be found existing in the world. Which four?</p>
<p>"There is the case where a monk enters &amp; remains in a certain peaceful awareness-release.<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-1" name="t-1" id="t-1">1</a></span> He attends to the cessation of self-identification, but as he is attending to the cessation of self-identification his mind doesn't leap up, grow confident, steadfast, or firm in the cessation of self-identification. For him the cessation of self-identification is not to be expected. <a name="branch" id="branch">Just as</a> if a man were to grasp a branch with his hand smeared with resin, his hand would stick to it, grip it, adhere to it; in the same way, the monk enters &amp; remains in a certain peaceful awareness-release.

For him the breaching of ignorance is not to be expected. <a name="pool" id="pool">Just as</a> if there were a waste-water pool that had stood for countless years, where a man were to block all the inlets and open all the outlets, and the sky were to not rain down in good streams of rain: the breaching of the waste-water pool's embankment would not be expected; in the same way, the monk enters &amp; remains in a certain peaceful awareness-release. He attends to the breaching of ignorance, but as he is attending to the breaching of ignorance his mind doesn't leap up, grow confident, steadfast, or firm in the breaching of ignorance.
