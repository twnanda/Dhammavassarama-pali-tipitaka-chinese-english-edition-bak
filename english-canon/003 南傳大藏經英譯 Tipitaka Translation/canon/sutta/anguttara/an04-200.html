<p>"Monks, these four things are born. Which four? Affection is born of affection. Aversion is born of affection. Affection is born of aversion. Aversion is born of aversion.</p>
<p>"And how is affection born of affection? There is the case where an individual is pleasing, appealing, &amp; charming to (another) individual. Others treat that individual as pleasing, appealing, &amp; charming, and the other one thinks, 'This individual is pleasing, appealing, &amp; charming to me. Others treat this individual as pleasing, appealing, &amp; charming.' He gives rise to affection for them. This is how affection is born of affection.</p>
<p>"And how is aversion born of affection? There is the case where an individual is pleasing, appealing, &amp; charming to (another) individual. Others treat that individual as displeasing, unappealing, &amp; not charming, and the other one thinks, 'This individual is pleasing, appealing, &amp; charming to me. Others treat this individual as displeasing, unappealing, &amp; not charming.' He gives rise to aversion for them. This is how aversion is born of affection.</p>

jtb 020511: To clarify these four paragraphs: 1) Joe likes Sam; the Smiths also like Sam; therefore Joe likes the Smiths (i.e., affection gives rise to affection). 2) Joe likes Sam; the Smiths dislike Sam; therefore Joe dislikes the Smiths (i.e., affection gives rise to aversion). 3) Joe dislikes Sam; the Smiths dislike Sam; therefore Joe likes the Smiths (i.e., aversion gives rise to affection). 4) Joe dislikes Sam; the Smiths like Sam; therefore Joe dislikes the Smiths (i.e., aversion gives rise to aversion). 

This calls to mind an article in Scientific American's "Mathematical Recreations" column from many years ago (1970s? 80s?) involving the application of simple mathematical operations to human relations. Some human relationships are transitive (A likes B; B likes C; therefore A (probably) likes C), while others are not (A hates B; B hates C; therefore A (probably) doesn't hate C). Some are commutative: A likes B, therefore B likes A. Alas, life's not so simple!

<p>"Monks, these are the four things that are born.</p>
<p>"Now, on the occasion when a monk, quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful (mental) qualities, enters &amp; remains in the first jhana &mdash; rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation &mdash; then any affection of his that is born of affection does not come about. Any aversion of his that is born of affection... any affection of his that is born of aversion... any aversion of his that is born of aversion does not come about.</p>
<p>"On the occasion when a monk... enters &amp; remains in the second jhana... enters &amp; remains in the third jhana... enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhana, then any affection of his that is born of affection does not come about. Any aversion of his that is born of affection... any affection of his that is born of aversion... any aversion of his that is born of aversion does not come about.</p>
<p>"On the occasion when a monk, through the ending of the mental fermentations, enters &amp; remains in the fermentation-free awareness-release &amp; discernment-release, having known &amp; verified them for himself right in the here &amp; now, then any affection of his that is born of affection is abandoned, its root destroyed, like an uprooted palm tree, deprived of the conditions of existence, not destined for future arising. Any aversion of his that is born of affection... any affection of his that is born of aversion... any aversion of his that is born of aversion is abandoned, its root destroyed, like an uprooted palm tree, deprived of the conditions of existence, not destined for future arising.</p>
<p>"This is said to be a monk who doesn't pull in, doesn't push away, doesn't smolder, doesn't flare up, and doesn't burn.</p>
<p>"And how does a monk pull in? There is the case where a monk assumes form to be the self, or the self as possessing form, or form as in the self, or the self as in form. He assumes feeling to be the self, or the self as possessing feeling, or feeling as in the self, or the self as in feeling. He assumes perception to be the self, or the self as possessing perception, or perception as in the self, or the self as in perception. He assumes (mental) fabrications to be the self, or the self as possessing fabrications, or fabrications as in the self, or the self as in fabrications. He assumes consciousness to be the self, or the self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in the self, or the self as in consciousness. This is how a monk pulls in.</p>
<p>"And how does a monk not pull in? There is the case where a monk doesn't assume form to be the self, or the self as possessing form, or form as in the self, or the self as in form. He doesn't assume feeling to be the self... doesn't assume perception to be the self... doesn't assume fabrications to be the self... doesn't assume consciousness to be the self, or the self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in the self, or the self as in consciousness. This is how a monk doesn't pull in.</p>
<p>"And how does a monk push away? There is the case where a monk returns insult to one who has insulted him, returns anger to one who is angry at him, quarrels with one who is quarreling. This is how a monk pushes away.</p>

<p>"And how does a monk smolder? There is the case where, there being 'I am,' there comes to be 'I am here,' there comes to be 'I am like this' ... 'I am otherwise' ... 'I am bad' ... 'I am good' ... 'I might be' ... 'I might be here' ... 'I might be like this' ... 'I might be otherwise' ... 'May I be' ... 'May I be here' ... 'May I be like this' ... 'May I be otherwise' ... 'I will be' ...

'May I be otherwise' ... 'I will be' ... 'I will be here' ... 'I will be like this' ... 'I will be otherwise.'</p>
<p>"And how does a monk flare up? There is the case where, there being 'I am because of this (or: by means of this),' there comes to be 'I am here because of this,' there comes to be 'I am like this because of this' ... 'I am otherwise because of this' ... 'I am bad because of this' ... 'I am good because of this' ... 'I might be because of this' ... 'I might be here because of this' ...

<p>"And how does a monk burn? There is the case where a monk's conceit of 'I am' is <i>not</i> abandoned, its root destroyed, like an uprooted palm tree, deprived of the conditions of existence, not destined for future arising. This is how a monk burns.</p>
