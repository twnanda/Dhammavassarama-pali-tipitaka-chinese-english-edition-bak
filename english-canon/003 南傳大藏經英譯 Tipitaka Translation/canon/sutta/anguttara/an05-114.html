<div class="sutta">
<p>On one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Magadhans at Andhakavinda. Then Ven. Ananda went to him and, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him, "Ananda, the new monks &mdash; those who have not long gone forth, who are newcomers in this Dhamma &amp; Discipline &mdash; should be encouraged, exhorted, and established in these five things. Which five?</p>
<p>"'Come, friends, be virtuous. Dwell restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha, consummate in your behavior &amp; sphere of activity. Train yourselves, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in the slightest faults.' Thus they should be encouraged, exhorted, &amp; established in restraint in accordance with the Patimokkha.</p>
<p>"'Come, friends, dwell with your sense faculties guarded, with mindfulness as your protector, with mindfulness as your chief, with your intellect self-protected, endowed with an awareness protected by mindfulness.' Thus they should be encouraged, exhorted, &amp; established in restraint of the senses.</p>
<p>"'Come, friends, speak only a little, place limits on your conversation.' Thus they should be encouraged, exhorted, &amp; established in limited conversation.</p>
<p>"'Come, friends, dwell in the <a name="wild" id="wild">wilderness</a>. Resort to remote wilderness &amp; forest dwellings.' Thus they should be encouraged, exhorted, &amp; established in physical seclusion.</p>
<p>"Come, friends, develop right view. Be endowed with right vision.' Thus they should be encouraged, exhorted, &amp; established in right vision.</p>
<p>"New monks &mdash; those who have not long gone forth, who are newcomers in this Dhamma &amp; Discipline &mdash; should be encouraged, exhorted, and established in these five things."</p>
