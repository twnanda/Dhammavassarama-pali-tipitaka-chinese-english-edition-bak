<div class="sutta">
<p>On one occasion the Blessed One was staying in <a name="saketa" id="saketa">Saketa</a> at Kalaka's park. There he addressed the monks: "Monks!"</p>
<p>"Yes, lord," the monks responded.</p>
<p>The Blessed One said: "Monks, whatever in the cosmos &mdash; with its devas, Maras, &amp; Brahmas, its generations with their contemplatives &amp; priests royalty &amp; common people &mdash; is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after, pondered by the intellect: That do I know. Whatever in the cosmos &mdash; with its devas, Maras, &amp; Brahmas, its generations with their contemplatives &amp; priests, their royalty &amp; common people &mdash; is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after, pondered by the intellect: That I directly know. That has been realized by the Tathagata, but in the Tathagata<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-1" name="t-1" id="t-1">1</a></span> it has not been established.<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-2" name="t-2" id="t-2">2</a></span></p>
<p>"If I were to say, 'I don't know whatever in the cosmos... is seen, heard, sensed, cognized... pondered by the intellect,' that would be a falsehood in me. If I were to say, 'I both know and don't know whatever in the cosmos... is seen, heard, sensed, cognized... pondered by the intellect,' that would be just the same. If I were to say, 'I neither know nor don't know whatever in the cosmos... is seen, heard, sensed, cognized... pondered by the intellect,' that would be a fault in me.</p>
<p>"Thus, monks, the Tathagata, when seeing what is to be seen, doesn't construe an [object as] seen. He doesn't construe an unseen. He doesn't construe an [object] to-be-seen. He doesn't construe a seer.</p>
<p>"When hearing...</p>
<p>"When sensing...</p>
<p>"When cognizing what is to be cognized, he doesn't construe an [object as] cognized. He doesn't construe an uncognized. He doesn't construe an [object] to-be-cognized. He doesn't construe a cognizer.</p>
<p>Thus, monks, the Tathagata &mdash; being the same with regard to all phenomena that can be seen, heard, sensed, &amp; cognized &mdash; is 'Such.' And I tell you: There's no other 'Such' higher or more sublime.</p>
<div class="verse">
<pre>
"Whatever is seen or heard or sensed
	and fastened onto as true by others,
One who is Such &mdash; among the self-fettered &mdash; 
wouldn't further claim to be true or even false.

"Having seen well in advance that arrow
where generations are fastened &amp; hung
<i> &mdash; 'I know, I see, that's just how it is!' &mdash; </i>
there's nothing of the Tathagata fastened."
