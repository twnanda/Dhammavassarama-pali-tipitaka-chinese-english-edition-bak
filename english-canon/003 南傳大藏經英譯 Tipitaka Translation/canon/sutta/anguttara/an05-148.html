<div class="sutta">
<p>"These five are a person of integrity's gifts. Which five? A person of integrity gives a gift with a sense of conviction. A person of integrity gives a gift attentively. A person of integrity gives a gift in season. A person of integrity gives a gift with an empathetic heart. A person of integrity gives a gift without adversely affecting himself or others.</p>
<p>"Having given a gift with a sense of conviction, he &mdash; wherever the result of that gift ripens &mdash; is rich, with much wealth, with many possessions. And he is well-built, handsome, extremely inspiring, endowed with a lotus-like complexion.</p>
<p>"Having given a gift attentively, he &mdash; wherever the result of that gift ripens &mdash; is rich, with much wealth, with many possessions. And his children, wives, slaves, servants, and workers listen carefully to him, lend him their ears, and serve him with understanding hearts.</p>
<p>"Having given a gift in season, he &mdash; wherever the result of that gift ripens &mdash; is rich, with much wealth, with many possessions. And his goals are fulfilled in season.</p>
<p>"Having given a gift with an empathetic heart, he &mdash; wherever the result of that gift ripens &mdash; is rich, with much wealth, with many possessions. And his mind inclines to the enjoyment of the five strings of lavish sensuality.</p>
<p>"Having given a gift without adversely affecting himself or others, he &mdash; wherever the result of that gift ripens &mdash; is rich, with much wealth, with many possessions. And not from anywhere does destruction come to his property &mdash; whether from fire, from water, from kings, from thieves, or from hateful heirs.</p>
<p>"These five are a person of integrity's gifts."</p>
