<p>"To the extent that there are animals &mdash; footless, two-footed, four-footed, many footed; with form or formless; percipient, non-percipient, or neither percipient nor non-percipient &mdash; the Tathagata, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened, is reckoned the foremost among them. In the same way, all skillful qualities are rooted in heedfulness, converge in heedfulness, and heedfulness is reckoned the foremost among them.</p>
<p>"<a name="footprint" id="footprint">Just as</a> the footprints of all legged animals are encompassed by the footprint of the elephant, and the elephant's footprint is reckoned the foremost among them in terms of size; in the same way, all skillful qualities are rooted in heedfulness, converge in heedfulness, and heedfulness is reckoned the foremost among them.</p>
<p>"<a name="rafters" id="rafters">Just as</a> the rafters in a peak-roofed house all go to the roof-peak, incline to the roof-peak, converge at the roof-peak, and the roof-peak is reckoned the foremost among them; in the same way, all skillful qualities are rooted in heedfulness, converge in heedfulness, and heedfulness is reckoned the foremost among them.</p>
<p>"<a name="root" id="root">Just as</a>, of all root fragrances, black aloes-root is reckoned the foremost; in the same way, all skillful qualities are rooted in heedfulness, converge in heedfulness, and heedfulness is reckoned the foremost among them.</p>
<p>"<a name="wood" id="wood">Just as</a>, of all wood fragrances, red sandalwood is reckoned the foremost; in the same way, all skillful qualities are rooted in heedfulness, converge in heedfulness, and heedfulness is reckoned the foremost among them.</p>
<p>"<a name="flower" id="flower">Just as</a>, of all flower fragrances, jasmine is reckoned the foremost; in the same way, all skillful qualities are rooted in heedfulness, converge in heedfulness, and heedfulness is reckoned the foremost among them.</p>
<p>"<a name="princes" id="princes">Just as</a> all wattle-and-daub-town princes fall subject to a wheel-turning emperor, and the wheel-turning emperor is reckoned the foremost among them; in the same way, all skillful qualities are rooted in heedfulness, converge in heedfulness, and heedfulness is reckoned the foremost among them.</p>
<p>"<a name="stars" id="stars">Just as</a> all the light of the constellations does not equal one sixteenth of the light of the moon, and the light of the moon is reckoned the foremost among them; in the same way, all skillful qualities are rooted in heedfulness, converge in heedfulness, and heedfulness is reckoned the foremost among them.</p>
<p>"<a name="sun" id="sun">Just as</a> in the last month of the rains, in autumn, when the sky is clear &amp; cloudless, the sun, on ascending the sky, overpowers the space immersed in darkness, shines, blazes, &amp; dazzles; in the same way, all skillful qualities are rooted in heedfulness, converge in heedfulness, and heedfulness is reckoned the foremost among them.</p>
<p>"<a name="rivers" id="rivers">Just as</a> the great rivers &mdash; such as the Ganges, the Yamuna, the Aciravati, the Sarabhu, &amp; the Mahi &mdash; all go to the ocean, incline to the ocean, slope to the ocean, tend toward the ocean, and the ocean is reckoned the foremost among them; in the same way, all skillful qualities are rooted in heedfulness, converge in heedfulness, and heedfulness is reckoned the foremost among them."</p>
