<div class="sutta">
<p>"Monks, the taking of life &mdash; when indulged in, developed, &amp; pursued &mdash; is something that leads to hell, leads to rebirth as a common animal, leads to the realm of the hungry shades. The slightest of all the results coming from the taking of life is that, when one becomes a human being, it leads to a short life span.</p>
<p>"Stealing &mdash; when indulged in, developed, &amp; pursued &mdash; is something that leads to hell, leads to rebirth as a common animal, leads to the realm of the hungry shades. The slightest of all the results coming from stealing is that, when one becomes a human being, it leads to the loss of one's wealth.</p>
<p>"Illicit sexual behavior &mdash; when indulged in, developed, &amp; pursued &mdash; is something that leads to hell, leads to rebirth as a common animal, leads to the realm of the hungry shades. The slightest of all the results coming from illicit sexual behavior is that, when one becomes a human being, it leads to rivalry &amp; revenge.</p>

The slightest of all the results coming from telling falsehoods is that, when one becomes a human being, it leads to being falsely accused.</p>
<p>"Divisive tale-bearing &mdash; when indulged in, developed, &amp; pursued &mdash; is something that leads to hell, leads to rebirth as a common animal, leads to the realm of the hungry shades. The slightest of all the results coming from divisive tale-bearing is that, when one becomes a human being, it leads to the breaking of one's friendships.</p>
<p>"Harsh speech &mdash; when indulged in, developed, &amp; pursued &mdash; is something that leads to hell, leads to rebirth as a common animal, leads to the realm of the hungry shades. The slightest of all the results coming from harsh speech is that, when one becomes a human being, it leads to unappealing sounds.</p>
<p>"Frivolous chattering &mdash; when indulged in, developed, &amp; pursued &mdash; is something that leads to hell, leads to rebirth as a common animal, leads to the realm of the hungry shades. The slightest of all the results coming from frivolous chattering is that, when one becomes a human being, it leads to words that aren't worth taking to heart.</p>
<p>"The drinking of fermented &amp; distilled liquors &mdash; when indulged in, developed, &amp; pursued &mdash; is something that leads to hell, leads to rebirth as a common animal, leads to the realm of the hungry shades. The slightest of all the results coming from drinking fermented &amp; distilled liquors is that, when one becomes a human being, it leads to mental derangement."</p>
