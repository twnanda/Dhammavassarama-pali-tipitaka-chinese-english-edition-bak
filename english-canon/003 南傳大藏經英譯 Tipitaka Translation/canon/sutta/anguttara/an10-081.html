<div class="sutta">
<p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in <a name="campa" id="campa">Campa</a>, on the shore of <a name="gaggara" id="gaggara">Gaggara Lake</a>. Then <a name="bahuna" id="bahuna">Ven. Bahuna</a> went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "Lord, freed, dissociated, &amp; released from how many things does the Tathagata dwell with unrestricted awareness?"</p>
<p>"Freed, dissociated, &amp; released from ten things, Bahuna, the Tathagata dwells with unrestricted awareness. Which ten? Freed, dissociated, &amp; released from form, the Tathagata dwells with unrestricted awareness. Freed, dissociated, &amp; released from feeling... Freed, dissociated, &amp; released from perception... Freed, dissociated, &amp; released from fabrications... Freed, dissociated, &amp; released from consciousness... Freed, dissociated, &amp; released from birth... Freed, dissociated, &amp; released from aging... Freed, dissociated, &amp; released from death... Freed, dissociated, &amp; released from stress... Freed, dissociated, &amp; released from defilement, the Tathagata dwells with unrestricted awareness.</p>
<p>"<a name="lotus" id="lotus">Just as</a> a red, blue, or white lotus born in the water and growing in the water, rises up above the water and stands with no water adhering to it, in the same way the Tathagata &mdash; freed, dissociated, &amp; released from these ten things &mdash; dwells with unrestricted awareness."</p>
