<p>"There are these four types of excellent thoroughbred horses to be found existing in the world. Which four? There is the case where an excellent thoroughbred horse, on seeing the shadow of the goad-stick, is stirred &amp; agitated, [thinking,] 'I wonder what task the trainer will have me do today? What should I do in response?' Some excellent thoroughbred horses are like this. And this is the first type of excellent thoroughbred horse to be found existing in the world.</p>
<p>"Then again there is the case where an excellent thoroughbred horse is not stirred &amp; agitated on seeing the shadow of the goad-stick, but when his coat is pricked [with the goad stick] he is stirred &amp; agitated, [thinking,] 'I wonder what task the trainer will have me do today? What should I do in response?' Some excellent thoroughbred horses are like this. And this is the second type of excellent thoroughbred horse to be found existing in the world.</p>
<p>"Then again there is the case where an excellent thoroughbred horse is not stirred &amp; agitated on seeing the shadow of the goad-stick, or when his coat is pricked, but when his hide is pricked [with the goad stick] he is stirred &amp; agitated, [thinking,] 'I wonder what task the trainer will have me do today? What should I do in response?' Some excellent thoroughbred horses are like this. And this is the third type of excellent thoroughbred horse to be found existing in the world.</p>

What should I do in response?' Some excellent thoroughbred horses are like this. And this is the fourth type of excellent thoroughbred horse to be found existing in the world.</p>
<p>"These are the four types of excellent thoroughbred horse to be found existing in the world.</p>
<p>"Now, there are these four types of excellent thoroughbred persons to be found existing in the world. Which four?</p>
<p>"There is the case where a certain excellent thoroughbred person hears, 'In that town or village over there a man or woman is in pain or has died.' He is stirred &amp; agitated by that. Stirred, he becomes appropriately resolute. Resolute, he both realizes with his body the highest truth and, having penetrated it with discernment, sees.
