<p><b>Translator's note:</b> On the surface, the qualities the Buddha attributes to Hatthaka in this sutta do not seem especially "amazing" or "astounding." Keep in mind, however, that the Canon depicts Hatthaka as very wealthy, and the Commentary adds that he is a prince. To find such qualities in a person of power and wealth is fairly amazing.</p>

<div class="sutta">
<p>On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <a name="alavi" id="alavi">Alavi</a> at the <a name="aggalava" id="aggalava">Aggalava Shrine</a>. There he addressed the monks: "Monks, remember Hatthaka of Alavi as being endowed with seven amazing, astounding qualities. Which seven? Monks, Hatthaka of Alavi is endowed with conviction. He is virtuous. He has a sense of conscience. He has a sense of concern.<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-1" name="t-1" id="t-1">1</a></span> He is learned. He is generous. He is discerning. Remember Hatthaka of Alavi as being endowed with these seven amazing, astounding qualities."</p>
<p>That is what the Blessed One said. Having said it, the One Well-going, getting up from his seat, went into his dwelling.</p>
<p>Then early in the morning a certain monk, having put on his robes and carrying his bowl &amp; outer robe, went to Hatthaka of Alavi's home. On arrival, he sat down on a seat made ready. Then Hatthaka of Alavi approached the monk and, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there the monk said to him, "Friend, the Blessed One has described you as being endowed with seven amazing, astounding qualities. Which seven? 'Hatthaka of Alavi is endowed with conviction. He is virtuous. He has a sense of conscience. He has a sense of concern. He is learned. He is generous. He is discerning.' Friend, the Blessed One has described you as being endowed with these seven amazing, astounding qualities."</p>
<p>"I hope, sir, that there were no white-clad householders there."</p>
<p>"No, friend, there were no white-clad householders there."</p>
<p>"It's good, sir, that there were no white-clad householders there."</p>
<p>Then the monk, having received alms at Hatthaka of Alavi's home, departed. After his meal, returning from his alms round, he went to the Blessed One. On arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, [he told the Blessed One what had happened.]</p>
<p>[The Blessed One replied:] "It's good, monk, it's very good that the clansman is modest and does not want others to know of the skillful qualities present in him. In that case, monk, remember Hatthaka of Alavi as being endowed with this eighth amazing, astounding quality: modesty."</p>
