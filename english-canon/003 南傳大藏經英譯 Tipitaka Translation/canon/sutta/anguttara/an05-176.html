<p>Then <a name="anatha" id="anatha">Anathapindika</a> the householder, surrounded by about 500 lay followers, went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him, "Householder, you have provided the community of monks with robes, alms food, lodgings, &amp; medicinal requisites for the sick, but you shouldn't rest content with the thought, 'We have provided the community of monks with robes, alms food, lodgings, &amp; medicinal requisites for the sick.' So you should train yourself, 'Let's periodically enter &amp; remain in seclusion &amp; rapture.' That's how you should train yourself."</p>
<p><a name="sariputta" id="sariputta">When</a> this was said, Ven. Sariputta said to the Blessed One, "It's amazing, lord. It's astounding, how well put that was by the Blessed One: 'Householder, you have provided the community of monks with robes, alms food, lodgings, &amp; medicinal requisites for the sick, but you shouldn't rest content with the thought, "We have provided the community of monks with robes, alms food, lodgings, &amp; medicinal requisites for the sick." So you should train yourself, "Let's periodically enter &amp; remain in seclusion &amp; rapture." That's how you should train yourself.'</p>
<p>"<a name="possibilities5" id="possibilities5">Lord</a>, when a disciple of the noble ones enters &amp; remains in seclusion &amp; rapture, there are five possibilities that do not exist at that time: The pain &amp; distress dependent on sensuality do not exist at that time. The pleasure &amp; joy dependent on sensuality do not exist at that time. The pain &amp; distress dependent on what is unskillful do not exist at that time. The pleasure &amp; joy dependent on what is unskillful do not exist at that time. The pain &amp; distress dependent on what is skillful do not exist at that time. When a disciple of the noble ones enters &amp; remains in seclusion &amp; rapture, these five possibilities do not exist at that time."</p>
<p>[The Blessed One said:] "Excellent, Sariputta. Excellent. When a disciple of the noble ones enters &amp; remains in seclusion &amp; rapture, there are five possibilities that do not exist at that time: The pain &amp; distress dependent on sensuality do not exist at that time. The pleasure &amp; joy dependent on sensuality do not exist at that time. The pain &amp; distress dependent on what is unskillful do not exist at that time.
