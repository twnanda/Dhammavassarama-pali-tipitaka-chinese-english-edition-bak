<div class="sutta verse">
<pre>
He's called a brahman
	for having banished his evil,
a contemplative
	for living in consonance,
one gone forth
	for having forsaken
	his own impurities.
</pre>
</div>

<hr class="minibar2" />
<h5><a href="index.html#n389" name="dhp-389" id="dhp-389">389</a></h5>
<div class="sutta verse">
<pre>
One should not strike a brahman,
nor should the brahman

<div class="sutta verse">
<pre>
Nothing's better for the brahman
than when the mind is held back
from what is endearing &amp; not.
However his harmful-heartedness
	wears away,
that's how stress
simply comes to rest.

<div class="sutta verse">
<pre>
The person from whom
you would learn the Dhamma
taught by the Rightly
Self-Awakened One:

<div class="sutta verse">
<pre>
Not by matted hair,
by clan, or by birth,
is one a brahman.
Whoever has truth
&amp; rectitude:
	he is a pure one,
	he, a brahman.

<a name="dhp-394" id="dhp-394"></a>What's the use of your matted hair,
	you dullard?
What's the use of your deerskin cloak?
The tangle's inside you.
You comb the outside.
</pre>

Wearing cast-off rags
 &mdash; his body lean &amp; lined with veins &mdash;
absorbed in jhana,
alone in the forest:

<div class="sutta verse">
<pre>
I don't call one a brahman
for being born of a mother
or sprung from a womb.
He's called a 'bho-sayer'
if he has anything at all.
But someone with nothing,
who clings to no thing:
	he's what I call
	a brahman.
</pre>
</div>

Free from anger,
duties observed,
principled, with no overbearing pride,
trained, a 'last-body':

</div>

<hr class="minibar2" />
<h5><a name="dhp-401" id="dhp-401">401</a></h5>
<div class="sutta verse">
<pre>
	Like water     on a lotus leaf,
a mustard seed  on the tip of an awl,
he doesn't adhere to sensual pleasures:
