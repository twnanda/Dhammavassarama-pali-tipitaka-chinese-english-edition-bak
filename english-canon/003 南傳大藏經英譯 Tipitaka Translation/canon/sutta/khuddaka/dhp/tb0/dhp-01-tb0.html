<div class="sutta verse">
<pre>
Phenomena are   preceded by the heart,
	   ruled by the heart,
	   made of the heart.
If you speak or act
with a corrupted heart,
then suffering follows you &mdash;
as the wheel of the cart,
	the track of the ox
	that pulls it.

<a name="dhp-2" id="dhp-2"></a>Phenomena are  preceded by the heart,
	   ruled by the heart,
	   made of the heart.
If you speak or act
with a calm, bright heart,
then happiness follows you,
like a shadow
	that never leaves.

'He     insulted me,
	   hit me,
	   beat me,
	   robbed me'
 &mdash; for those who brood on this,
	hostility isn't stilled.

<a name="dhp-4" id="dhp-4"></a>'He insulted me,
hit me,
beat me,
robbed me' &mdash;
for those who don't brood on this,
	hostility is stilled.

<a name="dhp-5" id="dhp-5"></a>   Hostilities aren't stilled
	through hostility,
	regardless.
Hostilities are stilled
through non-hostility:
	this, an unending truth.

<a name="dhp-6" id="dhp-6"></a>Unlike those who don't realize
that we're here on the verge
	of perishing,
those who do:
	their quarrels are stilled.

<pre>
One who stays focused on the beautiful,
is unrestrained with the senses,
knowing no moderation in food,
apathetic, unenergetic:
	Mara overcomes him
	as the wind, a weak tree.

<a name="dhp-8" id="dhp-8"></a>One who stays focused on the foul,
is restrained with regard to the senses,
knowing moderation in food,
full of conviction &amp; energy:
	Mara does not overcome him
	as the wind, a mountain of rock.

<pre>
He who,     depraved,
	       devoid
	of truthfulness
	&amp; self-control,
puts on the ochre robe,
doesn't deserve the ochre robe.

<a name="dhp-10" id="dhp-10"></a>But he who is free
	               of depravity
	           endowed
	               with truthfulness
	               &amp; self-control,
	           well-established
	               in the precepts,
truly deserves the ochre robe.

Those who regard
non-essence as essence

don't get to the essence,
	ranging about in wrong resolves.

essence as essence,

As rain seeps into
an ill-thatched hut,
so passion,
	the undeveloped mind.

a well-thatched hut,

<div class="sutta verse">
<pre>
Here    he grieves
	   he grieves  hereafter.
In both worlds
the wrong-doer grieves.
He grieves, he's afflicted,
seeing the corruption
	of his deeds.

<a name="dhp-16" id="dhp-16"></a>Here  he rejoices
	   he rejoices     hereafter.
In both worlds
the merit-maker rejoices.
He rejoices, is jubilant,
seeing the purity
	of his deeds.

<a name="dhp-17" id="dhp-17"></a>Here  he's tormented
	   he's tormented  hereafter.
In both worlds
the wrong-doer's tormented.
He's tormented at the thought,
	'I've done wrong.'
Having gone to a bad destination,
he's tormented
	all the more.

<a name="dhp-18" id="dhp-18"></a>Here  he delights
	   he delights     hereafter.
In both worlds
the merit-maker delights.
He delights at the thought,
	'I've made merit.'
Having gone to a good destination,
he delights
	all the more.

<div class="sutta verse">
<pre>
If he recites many teachings, but
	&mdash; heedless man &mdash;
doesn't do what they say,
like a cowherd counting the cattle of
	       others,
he has no share in the contemplative life.

<a name="dhp-20" id="dhp-20"></a>If he recites next to nothing
but follows the Dhamma
in line with the Dhamma;
	abandoning passion,
	   aversion, delusion;
	alert,
	his mind well-released,
	   not clinging
	either here or hereafter:
he has his share in the contemplative life.
