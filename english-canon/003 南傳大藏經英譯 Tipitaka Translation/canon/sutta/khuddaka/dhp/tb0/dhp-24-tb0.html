<h5><a name="dhp-334" id="dhp-334">334</a></h5>
<div class="sutta verse">
<pre>
When a person lives heedlessly,
his craving grows like a creeping vine.
He runs now here
	&amp; now  there,
as if looking for fruit:
	a monkey in the forest.
</pre>
</div>

<hr class="minibar2" />
<h5><a name="dhp-335" id="dhp-335">335-336</a></h5>
<div class="sutta verse">
<pre>
If this sticky, uncouth craving
overcomes you in the world,
your sorrows grow like wild grass
	after rain.
	
<a name="dhp-336" id="dhp-336"></a>If, in the world, you overcome
this uncouth craving, hard to escape,
sorrows roll off you,
	like water beads off
	a lotus.
</pre>
</div>

<hr class="minibar2" />
<h5><a href="index.html#n337" name="dhp-337" id="dhp-337">337</a></h5>
<div class="sutta verse">
<pre>
To all of you gathered here
I say: Good fortune.
	Dig up craving
 &mdash; as when seeking medicinal roots, wild grass &mdash;
	by the root.
Don't let Mara cut you down
 &mdash; as a raging river, a reed &mdash;
over &amp; over again.
</pre>
</div>

<hr class="minibar2" />
<h5><a name="dhp-338" id="dhp-338">338</a></h5>
<div class="sutta verse">
<pre>
If its root remains
undamaged &amp; strong,
a tree, even if cut,
will grow back.
So too if latent craving
is not rooted out,
this suffering returns
	again
	&amp;
	again.
</pre>
</div>

<hr class="minibar2" />
<h5><a href="index.html#n339" name="dhp-339" id="dhp-339">339-340</a></h5>
<div class="sutta verse">
<pre>
He whose 36 streams,
flowing to what is appealing, are strong:
the currents &mdash; resolves based on passion &mdash;
carry him, of base views, away.

<a name="dhp-340" id="dhp-340"></a>They flow every which way, the streams,
but the sprouted creeper stays
	   in place.
Now, seeing that the creeper's arisen,
cut through its root
with discernment.
</pre>
</div>

<hr class="minibar2" />
<h5><a href="index.html#n341" name="dhp-341" id="dhp-341">341</a></h5>
<div class="sutta verse">
<pre>
Loosened &amp; oiled
are the joys of a person.
People, bound by enticement,
looking for ease:
to birth &amp; aging they go.
</pre>
</div>

<hr class="minibar2" />
<h5><a href="index.html#n343" name="dhp-342" id="dhp-342">342-343</a></h5>
<div class="sutta verse">
<pre>
Encircled with craving,
people hop round &amp; around
like a rabbit caught in a snare.
Tied with fetters &amp; bonds
they go on to suffering,
again &amp; again, for long.

<a name="dhp-343" id="dhp-343"></a>Encircled with craving,
people hop round &amp; around
like a rabbit caught in a snare.
	So a monk
should dispel   craving,
should aspire   to dispassion
	for himself.
</pre>
</div>

<hr class="minibar2" />
<h5><a name="dhp-344" id="dhp-344">344</a></h5>
<div class="sutta verse">
<pre>
Cleared of the underbrush
but obsessed with the forest,
set free from the forest,
right back to the forest he runs.
Come, see the person set free
who runs right back to the same old chains!
</pre>
</div>

<div class="sutta verse">
<pre>
That's not a strong bond
 &mdash; so say the enlightened &mdash;
the one made of iron, of wood, or of grass.
To be smitten, enthralled,
	with jewels &amp; ornaments,
	longing for children &amp; wives:
that's the strong bond,
 &mdash; so say the enlightened &mdash;
one that's constraining,
	elastic,
	hard to untie.
But having cut it, they
 &mdash; the enlightened &mdash; go forth,
free of longing, abandoning
	sensual ease.
	
<a name="dhp-347" id="dhp-347"></a>Those smitten with passion
	   fall back
into a self-made stream,
like a spider snared in its web.
But, having cut it, the enlightened set forth,
free of longing, abandoning
	all suffering &amp; stress.
</pre>

<div class="sutta verse">
<pre>
Gone to the beyond of becoming,
	you let go of <i>in front,
</i>    let go of <i>behind,
</i>    let go of <i>between.
</i>With a heart everywhere let-go,
you don't come again to birth
	   &amp; aging.
</pre>

<a name="dhp-350" id="dhp-350"></a>
<div class="sutta verse">
<pre>
For a person
	forced on by his thinking,
	fierce in his passion,
	focused on beauty,
craving grows all the more.
He's the one
	who tightens the bond.

But one who delights
	in the stilling of thinking,
always  mindful
	       cultivating
	a focus on the foul:
He's the one
	who will make an end,
the one who will cut Mara's bond.
</pre>
</div>

<a name="dhp-352" id="dhp-352"></a>
<div class="sutta verse">
<pre>
Arrived at the finish,
unfrightened, unblemished, free
of craving, he has cut away
the arrows of becoming.
This physical heap is his last.

Free from craving,
ungrasping,
astute in expression,
knowing the combination of sounds &mdash;
which comes first &amp; which after.
He's called a
	last-body
	greatly discerning
	great man.
</pre>
</div>

<hr class="minibar2" />
<h5><a href="index.html#n353" name="dhp-353" id="dhp-353">353</a></h5>
<div class="sutta verse">
<pre>
All-conquering,
all-knowing am I,
with regard to all things,
	unadhering.
All-abandoning,
released in the ending of craving:
having fully known on my own,
to whom should I point as my teacher?
</pre>
</div>

<hr class="minibar2" />
<h5><a href="index.html#n354" name="dhp-354" id="dhp-354">354</a></h5>
<div class="sutta verse">
<pre>
A gift of Dhamma conquers   all gifts;
the taste of Dhamma,            all tastes;
a delight in Dhamma,            all delights;
the ending of craving,      all suffering
	                           &amp; stress.
</pre>
</div>

<div class="sutta verse">
<pre>
Riches ruin the man
weak in discernment,
but not those who seek
	the beyond.
Through craving for riches
the man weak in discernment
	   ruins himself
as he would others.

<div class="sutta verse">
<pre>
Fields are spoiled by weeds;
people, by passion.
So what's given to those
free of passion
	bears great fruit.

<a name="dhp-357" id="dhp-357"></a>Fields are spoiled by weeds;
people, by aversion.
So what's given to those
free of aversion
	bears great fruit.

<a name="dhp-358" id="dhp-358"></a>Fields are spoiled by weeds;
people, by delusion.
So what's given to those
free of delusion
	bears great fruit.

<a name="dhp-359" id="dhp-359"></a>Fields are spoiled by weeds;
people, by longing.
So what's given to those
free of longing
	bears great fruit.
