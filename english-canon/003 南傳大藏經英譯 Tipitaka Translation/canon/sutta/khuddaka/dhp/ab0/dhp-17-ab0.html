<div class="sutta verse">
<p><a name="dhp-221" id="dhp-221"></a><b>221.</b> One should give up anger, renounce pride, and overcome all fetters. Suffering never befalls him who clings not to mind and body and is detached.</p>
<p><a name="dhp-222" id="dhp-222"></a><b>222.</b> He who checks rising anger as a charioteer checks a rolling chariot, him I call a true charioteer. Others only hold the reins.</p>
<p><a name="dhp-223" id="dhp-223"></a><b>223.</b> Overcome the angry by non-anger; overcome the wicked by goodness; overcome the miser by generosity; overcome the liar by truth.</p>
<p><a name="dhp-224" id="dhp-224"></a><b>224.</b> Speak the truth; yield not to anger; when asked, give even if you only have a little. By these three means can one reach the presence of the gods.</p>
<p><a name="dhp-225" id="dhp-225"></a><b>225.</b> Those sages who are inoffensive and ever restrained in body, go to the Deathless State, where, having gone, they grieve no more.</p>
<p><a name="dhp-226" id="dhp-226"></a><b>226.</b> Those who are ever vigilant, who discipline themselves day and night, and are ever intent upon Nibbana &mdash; their defilements fade away.</p>
<p><a name="dhp-227" id="dhp-227"></a><b>227.</b> O Atula! Indeed, this is an ancient practice, not one only of today: they blame those who remain silent, they blame those speak much, they blame those who speak in moderation. There is none in the world who is not blamed.</p>
<p><a name="dhp-228" id="dhp-228"></a><b>228.</b> There never was, there never will be, nor is there now, a person who is wholly blamed or wholly praised.</p>
<p><a name="dhp-229" id="dhp-229"></a><b>229.</b> But the man whom the wise praise, after observing him day after day, is one of flawless character, wise, and endowed with knowledge and virtue.</p>
<p><a name="dhp-230" id="dhp-230"></a><b>230.</b> Who can blame such a one, as worthy as a coin of refined gold? Even the gods praise him; by Brahma, too, is he praised.</p>
<p><a name="dhp-231" id="dhp-231"></a><b>231.</b> Let a man guard himself against irritability in bodily action; let him be controlled in deed. Abandoning bodily misconduct, let him practice good conduct in deed.</p>
<p><a name="dhp-232" id="dhp-232"></a><b>232.</b> Let a man guard himself against irritability in speech; let him be controlled in speech. Abandoning verbal misconduct, let him practice good conduct in speech.</p>
<p><a name="dhp-233" id="dhp-233"></a><b>233.</b> Let a man guard himself against irritability in thought; let him be controlled in mind. Abandoning mental misconduct, let him practice good conduct in thought.</p>
<p><a name="dhp-234" id="dhp-234"></a><b>234.</b> The wise are controlled in bodily action, controlled in speech and controlled in thought. They are truly well-controlled.</p>
