<div class="sutta verse">
<p><a name="dhp-256" id="dhp-256"></a><b>256.</b> Not by passing arbitrary judgments does a man become just; a wise man is he who investigates both right and wrong.</p>
<p><a name="dhp-257" id="dhp-257"></a><b>257.</b> He who does not judge others arbitrarily, but passes judgment impartially according to the truth, that sagacious man is a guardian of law and is called just.</p>
<p><a name="dhp-258" id="dhp-258"></a><b>258.</b> One is not wise because one speaks much. He who is peaceable, friendly and fearless is called wise.</p>
<p><a name="dhp-259" id="dhp-259"></a><b>259.</b> A man is not versed in Dhamma because he speaks much. He who, after hearing a little Dhamma, realizes its truth directly and is not heedless of it, is truly versed in the Dhamma.</p>
<p><a name="dhp-260" id="dhp-260"></a><b>260.</b> A monk is not Elder because his head is gray. He is but ripe in age, and he is called one grown old in vain.</p>
<p><a name="dhp-261" id="dhp-261"></a><b>261.</b> One in whom there is truthfulness, virtue, inoffensiveness, restraint and self-mastery, who is free from defilements and is wise &mdash; he is truly called an Elder.</p>
<p><a name="dhp-262" id="dhp-262"></a><b>262.</b> Not by mere eloquence nor by beauty of form does a man become accomplished, if he is jealous, selfish and deceitful.</p>
<p><a name="dhp-263" id="dhp-263"></a><b>263.</b> But he in whom these are wholly destroyed, uprooted and extinct, and who has cast out hatred &mdash; that wise man is truly accomplished.</p>
<p><a name="dhp-264" id="dhp-264"></a><b>264.</b> Not by shaven head does a man who is indisciplined and untruthful become a monk. How can he who is full of desire and greed be a monk?</p>
<p><a name="dhp-265" id="dhp-265"></a><b>265.</b> He who wholly subdues evil both small and great is called a monk, because he has overcome all evil.</p>
<p><a name="dhp-266" id="dhp-266"></a><b>266.</b> He is not a monk just because he lives on others' alms. Not by adopting outward form does one become a true monk.</p>
<p><a name="dhp-267" id="dhp-267"></a><b>267.</b> Whoever here (in the Dispensation) lives a holy life, transcending both merit and demerit, and walks with understanding in this world &mdash; he is truly called a monk.</p>
<p><a name="dhp-268" id="dhp-268"></a><b>268.</b> Not by observing silence does one become a sage, if he be foolish and ignorant. But that man is wise who, as if holding a balance-scale accepts only the good.</p>
<p><a name="dhp-269" id="dhp-269"></a><b>269.</b> The sage (thus) rejecting the evil, is truly a sage. Since he comprehends both (present and future) worlds, he is called a sage.</p>
<p><a name="dhp-270" id="dhp-270"></a><b>270.</b> He is not noble who injures living beings. He is called noble because he is harmless towards all living beings.</p>
<p><a name="verse-271-272" id="verse-271-272"></a><b>271-272.</b> Not by rules and observances, not even by much learning, nor by gain of absorption, nor by a life of seclusion, nor by thinking, "I enjoy the bliss of renunciation, which is not experienced by the worldling" should you, O monks, rest content, until the utter destruction of cankers (Arahantship) is reached.</p>
