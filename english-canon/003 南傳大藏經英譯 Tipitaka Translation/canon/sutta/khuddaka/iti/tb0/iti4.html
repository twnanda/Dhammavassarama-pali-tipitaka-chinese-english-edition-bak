<p>"When one is consummate in virtue, consummate in the Patimokkha; dwelling restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha, consummate in one's behavior &amp; sphere of activity; training oneself, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in the slightest faults &mdash; what more is to be done?</p>
<p>"If, while he is walking, any greed in a monk is done away with, any ill will, any sloth &amp; drowsiness, any restlessness &amp; anxiety, any uncertainty is done away with; if his persistence is aroused and not lax; if his mindfulness is established &amp; unmuddled; if his body is calm &amp; unaroused; if his mind is centered &amp; unified: then a monk walking with such ardency &amp; concern is called continually &amp; continuously resolute, one with persistence aroused.</p>

Controlled in walking,
controlled in standing,
controlled in sitting,
controlled in lying down,
controlled in flexing &amp; extending his limbs
	&mdash; above, around, &amp; below,

	observing the arising &amp; passing away

a monk who dwells thus ardently,

<p><i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard:</i> "The world<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-112.1" name="t-112.1" id="t-112.1">1</a></span> has been fully awakened to by the Tathagata. From the world, the Tathagata is disjoined. The origination of the world has been fully awakened to by the Tathagata. The origination of the world has, by the Tathagata, been abandoned. The cessation of the world has been fully awakened to by the Tathagata. The cessation of the world has, by the Tathagata, been realized. The path leading to the cessation of the world has been fully awakened to by the Tathagata. The path leading to the cessation of the world has, by the Tathagata, been developed.</p>
<p>"Whatever in this world &mdash; with its devas, Maras, &amp; Brahmas, its generations complete with contemplatives &amp; priests, princes &amp; men &mdash; is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after, pondered by the intellect, that has been fully awakened to by the Tathagata. Thus he is called the Tathagata.</p>
<p>"From the night the Tathagata fully awakens to the unsurpassed Right Self-awakening to the night he is totally unbound in the Unbinding property with no fuel remaining, whatever the Tathagata has said, spoken, explained is just so <i>(tatha)</i> and not otherwise. Thus he is called the Tathagata.</p>
<p>"The Tathagata is one who does in line with <i>(tatha)</i> what he teaches, one who teaches in line with what he does. Thus he is called the Tathagata.</p>
<p>"In this world with its devas, Maras, &amp; Brahmas, its generations complete with contemplatives &amp; priests, princes &amp; men, the <a name="epi112" id="epi112">Tathagata</a> is the unconquered conqueror, all-seeing, the wielder of power.<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-112.2" name="t-112.2" id="t-112.2">2</a></span> Thus he is called the Tathagata." <i>This is the meaning of what the Blessed One said.

<pre>
Directly knowing all the world,
all the world as is really is,
	from all the world	disjoined,
	in all the world	unmatched:
Conquering all
in all ways,
enlightened,
released from all bonds,
he touches the foremost peace &mdash; 
	Unbinding, free
	from fear.

He is	free	of fermentation,
		of trouble,
	awakened,
		his doubts cut through;
has attained	the ending of action,
is released	in the destruction of acquisitions.
He is blessed, awakened,
a lion, unsurpassed.
In the world with its devas
he set the Brahma-wheel going.<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-112.3" name="t-112.3" id="t-112.3">3</a></span>

Thus divine &amp; human beings
who have gone to the Buddha for refuge,
gathering, pay homage
<a name="mature112" id="mature112">to</a> the great one, thoroughly mature:

'<a name="tamed112" id="tamed112">Tamed</a>, he's the best
	of those who can be tamed;
calm, the seer
	of those who can be calmed;
released, supreme
	among those who can be released;
crossed, the foremost
	of those who can cross.'

Thus they pay homage
to the great one, thoroughly mature:
'In this world with its devas,
	there's no one
	to compare
	with you.'

<p><b><a href="#t-112.1" name="n-112.1" id="n-112.1">1</a>.</b> <a href="../../../samyutta/sn35-082.html">SN XXXV.82</a> defines the "world" as the six sense spheres, their objects, consciousness at those spheres, contact at those spheres, and whatever arises in dependence on that contact, experienced as pleasure, pain, or neither-pleasure-nor-pain.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-112.2" name="n-112.2" id="n-112.2">2</a>.</b> These are epithets usually associated with the Great Brahma. See <a href="iti1.html#iti-022">&sect; 22</a>.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-112.3" name="n-112.3" id="n-112.3">3</a>.</b> The Brahma-wheel = the Dhamma-wheel, the name of the Buddha's first sermon, so called because it contains a "wheel" that lists all twelve permutations of two sets of variables: the four noble truths &mdash; stress, its origination, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation &mdash; and the three levels of knowledge appropriate to each truth: knowledge of the truth, knowledge of the task appropriate to the truth, and knowledge that the task has been completed. This wheel constitutes the Buddha's most central teaching.</p>
