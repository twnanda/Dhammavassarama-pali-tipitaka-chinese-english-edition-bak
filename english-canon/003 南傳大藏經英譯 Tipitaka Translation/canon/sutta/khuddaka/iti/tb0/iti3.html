from the company of devas

three sounds sound forth

to a good destination,
to companionship

On becoming a human being,
acquire a conviction
unsurpassed

That conviction of yours

Not understanding these fires, people
	&mdash; fond of self-identity &mdash;

swell the ranks of hell,
	the wombs of common animals, demons,
	the realm of the hungry shades.

While those who, day &amp; night,
are devoted
to the teachings
	of the rightly self-awakened,
put out the fire of passion,
	constantly perceiving the foul.
They, superlative people,
put out the fire of aversion
		with good will,
and the fire of delusion
	with the discernment leading
	to penetration.
They, the masterful, by night &amp; day,
	having put out [the fires],
having,	without remainder,

They, the wise, with an attainer-of-wisdom's

directly knowing
the ending of birth,

<p>"There is the case where a monk recollects his manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, two... five, ten... fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand, many aeons of cosmic contraction, many aeons of cosmic expansion, many aeons of cosmic contraction &amp; expansion: 'There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance.

There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure &amp; pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes &amp; details.</p>
<p>"This is the first knowledge he has attained. Ignorance has been destroyed; knowledge has arisen; darkness has been destroyed; light has arisen &mdash; as happens in one who is heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute.</p>
<p>"Then again, the monk sees &mdash; by means of the divine eye, purified &amp; surpassing the human &mdash; beings passing away &amp; re-appearing, and I discerned how they are inferior &amp; superior, beautiful &amp; ugly, fortunate &amp; unfortunate in accordance with their actions: 'These beings &mdash; who were endowed with bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, &amp; mental misconduct; who reviled noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views &mdash; at the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell. But these beings &mdash; who were endowed with bodily good conduct, verbal good conduct, &amp; mental good conduct; who did not revile noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views &mdash; at the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destinations, in the heavenly world.' Thus &mdash; by means of the divine eye, purified &amp; surpassing the human &mdash; he sees beings passing away &amp; re-appearing, and discerns how they are inferior &amp; superior, beautiful &amp; ugly, fortunate &amp; unfortunate in accordance with their actions.</p>

<p>"Then again, the monk &mdash; with the ending of fermentations &mdash; remains in the fermentation-free awareness-release &amp; discernment-release, having directly known and made it manifest for himself right in the present life.</p>
<p>"This is the third knowledge he has attained. Ignorance has been destroyed; knowledge has arisen; darkness has been destroyed; light has arisen &mdash; as happens in one who is heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute.</p>
