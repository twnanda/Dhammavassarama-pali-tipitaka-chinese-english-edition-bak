When one develops &mdash; mindful &mdash; 
good will without limit,
fetters are worn through,

If with uncorrupted mind
you feel good will
	for even	one being,
you become skilled from that.
But a Noble One produces
	a mind of sympathy
	for			all beings,
	an abundance of merit.

Kingly seers, who conquered the earth
	swarming with beings,
went about making sacrifices:
	the horse sacrifice, human sacrifice,
	water rites, soma rites,
	&amp; the "Unobstructed,"
<a name="moon27b" id="moon27b">but these</a> don't equal
one sixteenth
of a well-developed mind of good will &mdash; 
as all the constellations don't,
one sixteenth
of the radiance of the moon.

One who		neither kills
		nor gets others to kill,
		neither conquers,
	nor gets others to conquer,
with good will for all beings,
has no hostility with anyone
