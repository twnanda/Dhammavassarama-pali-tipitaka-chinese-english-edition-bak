<p><b>Translator's note:</b> This discourse mentions the metaphorical notion of "heartwood" <i>(sara)</i> three times. Although <i>sara</i> as a metaphor is often translated as "essence," this misses some of the metaphor's implications. When <i>x</i> is said to have <i>y</i> as its heartwood, that means that the proper development of <i>x</i> yields <i>y,</i> and that <i>y</i> is the most valuable part of <i>x &mdash; </i> just as a tree, as it matures, develops heartwood, and the heartwood is the most valuable part of the tree.</p>

<pre>
"With 	what virtue,
		what behavior,
nurturing 	what actions,
would a person become rightly based
and attain the ultimate goal?"

"One should be respectful
	of one's superiors<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-1" name="t-1" id="t-1">1</a></span>
	&amp; not envious;
should have a sense of the time
	for seeing teachers<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-2" name="t-2" id="t-2">2</a></span>;
should value the opportunity
	when a talk on Dhamma's in progress;
should listen intently
	to well-spoken words;
should go at the proper time,
	humbly, casting off stubborness,
	to one's teacher's presence;
should both recollect &amp; follow
	the Dhamma, its meaning,
	restraint, &amp; the holy life.

Delighting in 	Dhamma,
savoring 		Dhamma,
established in 	Dhamma,
with a sense of how
to investigate 	Dhamma,
one should not speak in ways
destructive 		of Dhamma,<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-3" name="t-3" id="t-3">3</a></span>
should guide oneself
with true, well-spoken words.

	Shedding
laughter, 		chattering,
lamentation, 	hatred,
deception, 		deviousness,
greed, 		pride,
confrontation, 	roughness,
astringency, 		infatuation,
one should go about free
of 		intoxication,
	steadfast within.

Understanding's the heartwood
	of well-spoken words;
concentration, the heartwood
	of learning &amp; understanding.

When a person is hasty &amp; heedless
his discernment &amp; learning
	don't grow.
While those who delight
in the doctrines taught by the noble ones,
	are unexcelled
in word, action, &amp; mind.
They, established in
		calm,
		composure, &amp;
		concentration,
have reached
what discernment &amp; learning
have as their heartwood."<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-4" name="t-4" id="t-4">4</a></span>

<p><b>Notes</b></p>
<div class="note">
<p><b><a href="#t-1" name="n-1" id="n-1">1</a>.</b> According to the Commentary, one's superiors include those who have more wisdom than oneself, more skill in concentration and other aspects of the path than oneself, and those senior to oneself.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-2" name="n-2" id="n-2">2</a>.</b> The Commentary says that the right time to see a teacher is when one is overcome with passion, aversion, and delusion, and cannot find a way out on one's own. This echoes a passage in AN VI.26, in which Ven. Maha Kaccana says that the right time to visit a "monk worthy of esteem" is when one needs help in overcoming any of the five hindrances or when one doesn't yet have an appropriate theme to focus on to put an end to the mind's fermentations.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-3" name="n-3" id="n-3">3</a>.</b> The Commentary equates "words destructive of the Dhamma" with "animal talk." See the discussion under <a href="../../../../lib/authors/thanissaro/bmc1/ch08-9.html#pc-85">Pacittiya 85</a> in <i>The Buddhist Monastic Code.</i></p>
<p><b><a href="#t-4" name="n-4" id="n-4">4</a>.</b> The heartwood of learning &amp; discernment is release.</p>
