<div class="sutta">
<p>Thus have I heard:</p>
<p>On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at Anathapindika's monastery. Now when the night was far advanced, a certain deity, whose surpassing radiance illuminated the whole of Jetavana, approached the Blessed One, respectfully saluted him, and stood beside him. Standing thus, he addressed the Blessed One in verse:</p>
<p>1. "Many deities and men longing for happiness have pondered on (the question of) blessings. Pray tell me what the highest blessings are.</p>
<p>2. "Not to associate with the foolish, but to associate with the wise, and to honor those worthy of honor &mdash; this is the highest blessing.</p>
<p>3. "To reside in a suitable locality, to have performed meritorious actions in the past, and to set oneself in the right direction &mdash; this is the highest blessing.</p>
<p>4. "Vast learning, skill in handicrafts, well grounded in discipline, and pleasant speech &mdash; this is the highest blessing.</p>
<p>5. "To support one's father and mother; to cherish one's wife and children, and to be engaged in peaceful occupations &mdash; this is the highest blessing.</p>
<p>6. "Liberality, righteous conduct, rendering assistance to relatives, and performance of blameless deeds &mdash; this is the highest blessing.</p>
<p>7. "To cease and abstain from evil, to abstain from intoxicating drinks, and diligent in performing righteous acts &mdash; this is the highest blessing.</p>
<p>8. "Reverence, humility, contentment, gratitude, and the timely hearing of the Dhamma, the teaching of the Buddha, &mdash; this is the highest blessing.</p>
<p>9. "Patience, obedience, meeting the Samanas (holy men), and timely discussions on the Dhamma &mdash; this is the highest blessing.</p>
<p>10. "Self-control, chastity, comprehension of the Noble Truths, and the realization of Nibbana &mdash; this is the highest blessing.</p>
<p>11. "The mind that is not touched by the vicissitudes of life,<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-s2-1" name="t-s2-1" id="t-s2-1">1</a></span> the mind that is free from sorrow, stainless, and secure &mdash; this is the highest blessing.</p>
<p>12. "Those who have fulfilled the conditions (for such blessings) are victorious everywhere, and attain happiness everywhere &mdash; To them these are the highest blessings."</p>
</div>
<hr />
<div class="notes">
<p><b>Note</b></p>
<div class="note">
<p><b><a href="#t-s2-1" name="n-s2-1" id="n-s2-1">1</a>.</b> The vicissitudes are eight in number: gain and loss, good-repute and ill-repute, praise and blame, joy and sorrow. This stanza is a reference to the state of mind of an arahant, the Consummate One.</p>
