<pre>
"The rice is cooked,
my milking done.
I live with my people
along the banks of the Mahi;
my hut is roofed, my fire lit:
	so if you want, rain-god,
	go ahead &amp; rain."
</pre>
<p class="spkr">The Buddha:</p>
<pre>
"Free from anger,
my stubbornness gone,<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-2" name="t-2" id="t-2">2</a></span>
I live for one night
along the banks of the Mahi;
my hut's roof is open, my fire out:<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-3" name="t-3" id="t-3">3</a></span>
	so if you want, rain-god,
	go ahead &amp; rain."
</pre>
<p class="spkr">Dhaniya:</p>
<pre>
"No mosquitoes or gadflies
are to be found.
The cows range in the marshy meadow
where the grasses flourish.
They could stand the rain if it came:
	so if you want, rain-god,
	go ahead &amp; rain."
</pre>
<p class="spkr">The Buddha:</p>
<pre>
"A raft, well-made,
has been lashed together.<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-4" name="t-4" id="t-4">4</a></span>
Having crossed over,
gone to the far shore,
I've subdued the flood.
No need for a raft
is to be found:<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-5" name="t-5" id="t-5">5</a></span>
	so if you want, rain-god,
	go ahead &amp; rain."
</pre>
<p class="spkr">Dhaniya:</p>
<pre>
"My wife is compliant, not careless,
is charming, has lived with me long.
I hear no evil about her at all:
	so if you want, rain-god,
	go ahead &amp; rain."
</pre>
<p class="spkr">The Buddha:</p>
<pre>
"My mind is compliant, released,
has long been nurtured, well tamed.
No evil is to be found in me:
	so if you want, rain-god,
	go ahead &amp; rain."
</pre>
<p class="spkr">Dhaniya:</p>
<pre>
"I support myself on my earnings.
My sons live in harmony,
free from disease.
I hear no evil about them at all:
	so if you want, rain-god,
	go ahead &amp; rain."
</pre>
<p class="spkr">The Buddha:</p>
<pre>
"I'm in no one's employ,<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-6" name="t-6" id="t-6">6</a></span>
I wander the whole world
on the reward [of my Awakening].
No need for earnings
is to be found:
	so if you want, rain-god,
	go ahead &amp; rain."
</pre>
<p class="spkr">Dhaniya:</p>
<pre>
"There are cows, young bulls,
cows in calf, &amp; breeding cows,
&amp; a great bull, the leader of the herd:
	so if you want, rain-god,
	go ahead &amp; rain."
</pre>
<p class="spkr">The Buddha:</p>
<pre>
"There are no cows, no young bulls,
no cows in calf or breeding cows,
no great bull, the leader of the herd:<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-7" name="t-7" id="t-7">7</a></span>
	so if you want, rain-god,
	go ahead &amp; rain."
</pre>
<p></p>
<p class="spkr">Dhaniya:</p>
<pre>
"The stakes are dug-in, immovable.
The new mu&ntilde;ja-grass halters, well-woven,
not even young bulls could break:
	so if you want, rain-god,
	go ahead &amp; rain."
</pre>
<p></p>
<p class="spkr">The Buddha:</p>
<pre>
"Having broken my bonds
like a great bull,
like a great elephant
tearing a rotting vine,
I never again
will lie in the womb:
	so if you want, rain-god,
	go ahead &amp; rain."

The great cloud rained down
	straightaway,
filling the lowlands &amp; high.
Hearing the rain-god pour down,
Dhaniya said:
"How great our gain
that we've gazed
on the Blessed One!
	We go to him,
the One with vision,
	for refuge.
May you be our teacher, Great Sage.
My wife &amp; I are compliant.
Let's follow the holy life
under the One Well-gone.
Gone to the far shore
of aging &amp; death,
let's put an end
to suffering &amp; stress."
</pre>
<p class="spkr">Mara:<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-8" name="t-8" id="t-8">8</a></span></p>
<pre>
"Those with children
	delight
because of their children.
Those with cattle
	delight
because of their cows.
A person's delight
comes from acquisitions,
since a person with no acquisitions
	doesn't delight."
</pre>
<p class="spkr">The Buddha:</p>
<pre>
"Those with children
	grieve
because of their children.
Those with cattle
	grieve
because of their cows.
A person's grief
comes from acquisitions,
since a person with no acquisitions
	doesn't grieve."

<p><b>Notes</b></p>
<div class="note">
<p><b><a href="#t-1" name="n-1" id="n-1">1</a>.</b> Dhaniya Gopa: Literally, one whose wealth is in cattle. According to the Commentary, his herd consisted of 30,000 head of cattle.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-2" name="n-2" id="n-2">2</a>.</b> The first line in the Buddha's verse plays on words in the first line of Dhaniya's. "Free from anger" <i>(akkodhano)</i> plays on "rice is cooked" <i>(pakkodano);</i> and "stubbornness" <i>(khilo)</i> plays on "milk" <i>(khiro).</i></p>
<p><b><a href="#t-3" name="n-3" id="n-3">3</a>.</b> "Open" means having a mind not covered or concealed by craving, defilement, or ignorance. This image is also used in <a href="../udana/ud5-05.html">Ud V.5</a> and <a href="snp4-04.html">Sn IV.4</a>. "My fire out" refers to the fires of passion, aversion, &amp; delusion; birth, aging, &amp; death; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair. See <a href="../../samyutta/sn-35-028-tb0.html">SN XXXV.28</a>; <a href="../iti/tb0/iti3.html#iti-093">Iti 93</a>; and <i><a href="../../../../lib/authors/thanissaro/likefire/index.html">The Mind Like Fire Unbound</a>.</i></p>
<p><b><a href="#t-4" name="n-4" id="n-4">4</a>.</b> The raft stands for the noble eightfold path. See passages <a href="../../../../lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/part2.html#passage-113">113</a> and <a href="../../../../lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/part2.html#passage-114">114</a> in <i>The Wings to Awakening.</i></p>
<p><b><a href="#t-5" name="n-5" id="n-5">5</a>.</b> As this verse doesn't seem to be a direct response to the preceding one, the Commentary suggests that we are missing part of the conversation here. An alternative possibility is that the Buddha is engaging in word play &mdash; the word "crossed over" <i>(tinna)</i> being a pun on Dhaniya's reference to grass <i>(tina).</i></p>
<p><b><a href="#t-6" name="n-6" id="n-6">6</a>.</b> According to the Commentary, the Buddha is not in anyone else's employ nor even in his own employ &mdash; i.e., he is not in the employ of craving.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-7" name="n-7" id="n-7">7</a>.</b> The Buddha may be speaking literally here &mdash; he has no cattle, so there is no way that a heavy rain could cause him harm &mdash; but he may also be speaking metaphorically. See <a href="../../samyutta/sn04-019.html">SN IV.19</a>.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-8" name="n-8" id="n-8">8</a>.</b> According to the Commentary, Mara suddenly comes on the scene to try &mdash; unsuccessfully &mdash; to prevent Dhaniya and his wife from going forth. His verses here, together with the Buddha's response, are also found at <a href="../../samyutta/sn04-008.html">SN IV.8</a>.</p>
