<p><b>Translator's note:</b> This discourse is the source of many proverbs frequently quoted in Theravadin countries. In 1982, when Thailand was celebrating the 200<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the founding of the current dynasty, His Majesty the King structured his chief address to the Thai people around the four qualities mentioned in the Buddha's last verse.</p>

<div class="sutta">
<p> I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at <a name="alavi" id="alavi">Alavi</a> in the haunt of the Alavaka yakkha. Then the Alavaka yakkha went to the Blessed One and on arrival said to him: "Get out, contemplative!"</p>
<p>[Saying,] "All right, my friend," the Blessed One went out.</p>
<p>"Come in, contemplative!"</p>
<p>[Saying,] "All right, my friend," the Blessed One went in.</p>
<p>A second time... A third time, the Alavaka yakkha said to the Blessed One, "Get out, contemplative!"</p>
<p>[Saying,] "All right, my friend," the Blessed One went out.</p>
<p>"Come in, contemplative!"</p>
<p>[Saying,] "All right, my friend," the Blessed One went in.</p>
<p>Then a fourth time, the Alavaka yakkha said to the Blessed One, "Get out, contemplative!"</p>
<p>"I won't go out, my friend. Do what you have to do."</p>
<p>"<a name="ganges" id="ganges">I will ask you a question</a>, contemplative. If you can't answer me, I will possess your mind or rip open your heart or, grabbing you by the feet, hurl you across the Ganges."</p>
<p>"My friend, I see no one in the cosmos with its devas, Maras &amp; Brahmas, its contemplatives &amp; priests, its royalty &amp; commonfolk, who could possess my mind or rip open my heart or, grabbing me by the feet, hurl me across the Ganges. But nevertheless, ask me what you wish."</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="spkr">[Alavaka:]</p>
<pre>
What	is a person's highest wealth?
What, when well-practiced, brings bliss?
What	is the highest of savors?
Living in what way
		is one's life called the best?
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[The Buddha:]</p>
<pre>
Conviction 	is a person's highest wealth.
Dhamma, 	when well-practiced, brings bliss.
Truth is the highest of savors.<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-1" name="t-1" id="t-1">1</a></span>
Living with discernment,

How 		does one cross over the flood?
How 		cross over the sea?
How 		does one overcome suffering &amp; stress?

<p class="spkr">[The Buddha:]</p>
<pre>
Through conviction	one crosses over the flood.
Through heedfulness,	the sea.
Through persistence	one overcomes
		suffering &amp; stress.
Through discernment		a person is purified.
</pre>
<p></p>
<p class="spkr">[Alavaka:]</p>
<pre>
How 		does one gain discernment?
How 		does one find wealth?
How 		does one attain honor?
How 		bind friends to oneself?
	Passing from this world
	to
	the next world,
how		does one not grieve?
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[The Buddha:]</p>
<pre>
Convinced of the arahants' Dhamma
for attaining Unbinding,
&mdash; heedful, observant &mdash; 
one listening well
		gains discernment.
Doing what's fitting,
enduring burdens,
one with initiative
		finds wealth.
Through truth
		one attains honor.
Giving
		binds friends to oneself.

Endowed with these four qualities,
	&mdash; truth,
	self-control,
	stamina,
	relinquishment &mdash; 
a householder of conviction,
on passing away, doesn't grieve.

Now, go ask others,
common priests &amp; contemplatives,
if anything better than
	truth,
	self-control,
	endurance,
	&amp; relinquishment
here can be found.
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[Alavaka:]</p>
<pre>
How could I go ask
common priests &amp; contemplatives? &mdash; 
now that today I understand
	what benefits
	the next life.

It was truly for my well-being
that the Awakened One came
	to stay in Alavi.
Today I understand
where what is given
bears great fruit.

I will wander from village to village,
		town to town,
paying homage		to the Self-awakened One
&amp; the true rightness	of the Dhamma.
