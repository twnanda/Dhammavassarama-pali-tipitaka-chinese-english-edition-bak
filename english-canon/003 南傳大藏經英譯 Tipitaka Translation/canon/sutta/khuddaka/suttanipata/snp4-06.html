<pre>
How short this life!
You die this side of a century,
but even if you live past,
	you die of old age.

People grieve
for what they see as <i>mine,</i>
for 	nothing possessed is constant,
	nothing is constantly possessed.<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-1" name="t-1" id="t-1">1</a></span>
Seeing this separation
	simply as it is,
one shouldn't follow the household life.

At death a person abandons
what he construes as <i>mine.</i>
Realizing this, the wise
shouldn't incline
to be devoted to <i>mine.</i>

<a name="dream" id="dream">Just as</a> a man doesn't see,
	on awakening,
what he met in a dream,
even so he doesn't see,
when they are dead
	&mdash; their time done &mdash; 
those he held dear.

When they are seen &amp; heard,
people are called by this name or that,
but only the name remains
to be pointed to
	when they are dead.

Grief, lamentation, &amp; selfishness
	are not let go
	by those greedy for <i>mine,</i>
so sages
	letting go of possessions,
	seeing the Secure,
		go wandering forth.

A monk, living 		withdrawn,
enjoying a dwelling 	secluded:
	they say it's congenial for him
	he who wouldn't, in any realm,
		display self.

Everywhere
	the sage
		independent
holds nothing dear or undear.

	<a name="lotus" id="lotus">In him</a>
lamentation &amp; selfishness,
like water on a white lotus,
	do not adhere.

As a water bead on a lotus leaf,
as water on a red lily,
	does not adhere,

	so the sage
	does not adhere
to the seen, the heard, or the sensed;

	for, cleansed,
	he doesn't construe
	in connection
with the seen, the heard, or the sensed.

	In no other way
does he wish for purity,
for he neither takes on passion
	nor puts it away.<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-2" name="t-2" id="t-2">2</a></span>

<p><b><a href="#t-1" name="n-1" id="n-1">1</a>.</b> "Nothing possessed is constant, nothing is constantly possessed" &mdash; two readings of the phrase, <i>na hi santi nicca pariggaha.</i></p>
<p><b><a href="#t-2" name="n-2" id="n-2">2</a>.</b> Nd.I: An arahant has put passion totally away once and for all, and so has no need to do it ever again. An alternative explanation is that, as <a href="snp5-06.html">Sn V.6</a> points out, the arahant has gone beyond all dhammas, dispassion included.</p>
