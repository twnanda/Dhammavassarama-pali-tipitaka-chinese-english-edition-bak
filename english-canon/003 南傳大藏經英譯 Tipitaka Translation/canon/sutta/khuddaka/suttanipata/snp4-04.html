"I see the pure, the supreme,
	free from disease.
It's in connection
with what's seen
that a person's purity
		is."<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-1" name="t-1" id="t-1">1</a></span>

Understanding thus,
having known the "supreme,"
&amp; remaining focused
	on purity,
one falls back on that knowledge.
If it's in connection
with what is seen
that a person's purity is,
or if stress is abandoned
in connection with knowledge,
then a person with acquisitions
	is purified
in connection with something else,<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-2" name="t-2" id="t-2">2</a></span>
	for his view reveals that
	in the way he asserts it.

No brahman<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-3" name="t-3" id="t-3">3</a></span>
says purity
comes in connection
with anything else.
Unsmeared with regard
to what's 	seen, heard, sensed,
		precepts or practices,
		merit or evil,
not creating
anything here,
he's let go
	of what he had embraced,
he's let go of self.

Abandoning what's first,
they depend on	what's next.<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-4" name="t-4" id="t-4">4</a></span>
Following distraction,
they don't cross over attachment.
<a name="monkey" id="monkey">They</a> embrace &amp; reject
	&mdash; like a monkey releasing a branch
		to seize at another<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-5" name="t-5" id="t-5">5</a></span> &mdash; 
a person undertaking practices on his own,
goes high &amp; low,
latched onto perception.
But having clearly known
through vedas,<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-6" name="t-6" id="t-6">6</a></span> having encountered
	the Dhamma,
one of profound discernment
	doesn't go
	high &amp; low.

He's enemy-free<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-7" name="t-7" id="t-7">7</a></span>
with regard to 	all things
seen, heard, or sensed.
By whom, with what,<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-8" name="t-8" id="t-8">8</a></span>
should he
be pigeonholed
here in the world?
	&mdash; one who has seen in this way,
	who goes around
				open.<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-9" name="t-9" id="t-9">9</a></span>

They don't conjure, don't yearn,
don't proclaim "utter purity."
Untying the tied-up knot of grasping,
they don't form a desire for
	any
	thing
at all in the world.

The brahman
gone beyond territories,<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-10" name="t-10" id="t-10">10</a></span>
has nothing that
&mdash; on knowing or seeing &mdash; 
he's grasped.
Unimpassionate 	for passion,
not impassioned 	for dis-,<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-11" name="t-11" id="t-11">11</a></span>
he has nothing here
that he's grasped as supreme.

<p><b>Notes</b></p>
<div class="note">
<p><b><a href="#t-1" name="n-1" id="n-1">1</a>.</b> An ancient Indian belief, dating back to the Vedas, was that the sight of certain things or beings was believed to purify. Thus "in connection with what's seen" here means both that purity is brought about by means of seeing such a sight, and that one's purity is measured in terms of having such a sight. This belief survives today in the practice of <i>darshan.</i></p>
<p><b><a href="#t-2" name="n-2" id="n-2">2</a>.</b> In other words, if purity were simply a matter of seeing or knowing something, a person could be pure in this sense and yet still have acquisitions (= defilements), which would not be true purity.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-3" name="n-3" id="n-3">3</a>.</b> "Brahman" in the Buddhist sense, i.e., a person born in any caste who has become an arahant.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-4" name="n-4" id="n-4">4</a>.</b> Nd.I: Leaving one teacher and going to another; leaving one teaching and going to another. This phrase may also refer to the mind's tendency to leave one craving to go to another.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-5" name="n-5" id="n-5">5</a>.</b> "Like a monkey releasing a branch to seize at another" &mdash; an interesting example of a whole phrase that functions as a "lamp," i.e., modifying both the phrase before it and the phrase after it.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-6" name="n-6" id="n-6">6</a>.</b> Vedas &mdash; Just as the word "brahman" is used in a Buddhist sense above, here the word <i>veda</i> is given a Buddhist sense. According to the Commentary, in this context it means the knowledge accompanying four transcendent paths: the paths to stream-entry, once-returning, non-returning, and arahantship.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-7" name="n-7" id="n-7">7</a>.</b> Nd.I: The enemies here are the armies of Mara &mdash; all unskillful mental qualities. For a detailed inventory of the armies of Mara, see <a href="snp3-02.html">Sn III.2</a>.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-8" name="n-8" id="n-8">8</a>.</b> By whom, with what &mdash; two meanings of the one Pali word, <i>kena.</i></p>
<p><b><a href="#t-9" name="n-9" id="n-9">9</a>.</b> Nd.I: "Open" means having a mind not covered or concealed by craving, defilement, or ignorance. This image is used in <a href="../udana/ud5-05.html">Ud V.5</a>. It is in contrast to the image discussed in <a href="snp4-02.html#n-1">note 1 to Sn IV.2</a>. An alternative meaning here might be having one's eyes open.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-10" name="n-10" id="n-10">10</a>.</b> Nd.I: "Territories" = the ten fetters <i>(samyojana)</i> and seven obsessions <i>(anusaya).</i></p>
<p><b><a href="#t-11" name="n-11" id="n-11">11</a>.</b> Nd.I: "Passion" = sensuality; "dispassion" = the jhana states that bring about dispassion for sensuality.</p>
