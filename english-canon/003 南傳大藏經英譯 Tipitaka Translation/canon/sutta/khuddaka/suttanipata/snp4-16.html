<pre>
"Never before
have I seen or heard
from anyone
of a teacher with such lovely speech
come, together with his following
from Tusita heaven,<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-1" name="t-1" id="t-1">1</a></span>
as the One with Eyes
who appears to the world with its devas
having dispelled all darkness
having arrived at delight
		all alone.

To that One Awakened &mdash; 
	unentangled, Such, un-
	deceptive,
	come with his following &mdash; 
I have come with a question
on behalf of the many
here who are fettered.
For a monk disaffected,
frequenting a place that's remote &mdash; 
	the root of a tree,
	a cemetery,
	in mountain caves
	various places to stay &mdash; 
how many are the fears there
at which he shouldn't tremble
	&mdash; there in his noiseless abode &mdash; 
how many the dangers in the world
for the monk 	going the direction
			he never has gone
that he should transcend
there in his isolated abode?
What should be
	the ways of his speech?
What should be
	his range there of action?
What should be
	a resolute monk's
	precepts &amp; practices?<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-2" name="t-2" id="t-2">2</a></span>
<a name="silver" id="silver">Undertaking</a> what training
	&mdash; alone, astute, &amp; mindful &mdash; 
would he blow away
his own impurities
as a silver smith,
	those in molten silver?"
</pre>
<p class="spkr">The Buddha:</p>
<pre>
"I will tell you
as one who knows,
what is comfort
for one disaffected
resorting to a remote place,
desiring self-awakening
in line with the Dhamma.
An enlightened monk,
	living circumscribed,
	mindful,
shouldn't fear the five fears:
of horseflies, mosquitoes, snakes,
human contact, four-footed beings;
shouldn't be disturbed
by those following another's teaching
even on seeing their manifold
		terrors;
should overcome still other
further dangers
as he seeks what is skillful.

	Touched
	by the touch
of discomforts, hunger,
he should endure cold
&amp; inordinate heat.
He with no home,
in many ways touched by these things,
striving, should make firm his persistence.

He shouldn't commit a theft,
shouldn't speak a lie,
should touch with thoughts of good will
beings firm &amp; infirm.
Conscious of when
his mind is stirred up &amp; turbid,
he should dispel it:
	'It's on the Dark One's side.'

He shouldn't come under the sway
of anger or pride.
Having dug up their root
he would stand firm.
Then, when prevailing
	&mdash; yes &mdash; 
he'd prevail over his sense of dear &amp; undear.
Yearning 	for discernment
enraptured 	with what's admirable,
he should overcome these dangers,
should conquer 	discontent
			in his isolated spot,
should conquer 	these four
			thoughts of lament:

	'What will I eat,
	or where will I eat.
	How badly I slept.
	Tonight where will I sleep?'

These lamenting thoughts
he should subdue &mdash; 
one under training,
wandering without home.
Receiving food &amp; cloth
at appropriate times,
he should have a sense of enough
for the sake of contentment.<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-3" name="t-3" id="t-3">3</a></span>
Guarded in regard to these things
going restrained into a village,
even when harassed
he shouldn't say a harsh word.

With eyes downcast,
&amp; not footloose,
committed to jhana,
he should be continually wakeful.<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-4" name="t-4" id="t-4">4</a></span>
Strengthening equanimity,
	centered within,
he should cut off any penchant
to conjecture or worry.
When reprimanded,
he should &mdash; mindful &mdash; 
		rejoice;<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-5" name="t-5" id="t-5">5</a></span>
should smash any stubbornness
toward his fellows in the holy life;
should utter skillful words
that are not untimely;
should give no mind
to the gossip people might say.

And then there are in the world
the five kinds of dust
for whose dispelling, mindful
he should train:
with regard to forms, sounds, tastes,
smells, &amp; tactile sensations
	he should conquer passion;
with regard to these things
	he should subdue his desire.

A monk, mindful,
his mind well-released,
contemplating the right Dhamma
at the right times,
	on coming
	to oneness
	should annihilate
	darkness,"

						the Blessed One said.
