"Seeing how,
behaving how,
is one said to be
	at peace?
Gotama, tell me about
	&mdash; when asked about &mdash; 
	the ultimate person."

<i>The Buddha:</i>

"Free from craving
before the break-up
[of the body],
independent
	of <i>before</i>
	&amp; <i>the end,</i><span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-1" name="t-1" id="t-1">1</a></span>
not classified <i>in between,</i><span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-2" name="t-2" id="t-2">2</a></span>
no yearning is his.

Un-	angered,
un-	startled,
un-	boastful,
un-	anxious,
giving counsel unruffled,
<i>he</i> is a sage,
	his speech
	under control.

Free from attachment
with regard to the future,
not sorrowing
over the past,
he sees seclusion
in the midst of sensory contacts.<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-3" name="t-3" id="t-3">3</a></span>
He can't be led
in terms of views.<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-4" name="t-4" id="t-4">4</a></span>

	Withdrawn, un-
	deceitful, not
	stingy, not
	miserly, not
	insolent, in-
	offensive,
	he doesn't engage in
	divisive speech.

Not intoxicated with enticements,
nor given to pride,
he's gentle, quick-witted,
beyond conviction &amp; dispassion.<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-5" name="t-5" id="t-5">5</a></span>

Not in hopes of material gain
does he take on the training;
when without material gain
he isn't upset.

Unobstructed 	by craving,
he doesn't 		through craving<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-6" name="t-6" id="t-6">6</a></span>
	hunger for flavors.

Equanimous &mdash; always &mdash; mindful,
he doesn't conceive himself as
equal,
	superior,
		inferior,
			in the world.
	No swellings of pride
	are his.

Whose dependencies
don't exist
when, on knowing the Dhamma,
he's in-
dependent;
in whom no craving is found
for becoming or not-:
<i>he</i> is said
	to be at peace,
		un-intent
		on sensual pleasures,
	with nothing at all
	to tie him down:
one who's crossed over attachment.

He has no 	children
		cattle,
		fields,
		land.
In him you can't pin down
	what's embraced
	or rejected,
		what's self
		or opposed to self.<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-7" name="t-7" id="t-7">7</a></span>
He has no yearning
for that which people run-of-the-mill
or priests &amp; contemplatives
might blame &mdash; 
	which is why
he is unperturbed
with regard to their words.

His greed gone,
not miserly,
	the sage
doesn't speak of himself
as among those who are higher,
	equal,
or lower.
	He,
conjuring-free,
	doesn't submit
	to conjuring,
	to the cycling of time.<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-8" name="t-8" id="t-8">8</a></span>

For whom
nothing in the world
is his own,
	who doesn't grieve
	over what is not,
		who doesn't enter into
			doctrines
			phenomena:<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-9" name="t-9" id="t-9">9</a></span>
<i>he</i> is said
	to be
	at peace."

<p><b>Notes</b></p>
<div class="note">
<p><b><a href="#t-1" name="n-1" id="n-1">1</a>.</b> Nd.I: "Independent of before &amp; the end" = no craving or view with regard to past or future.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-2" name="n-2" id="n-2">2</a>.</b> For discussions of how the awakened one cannot be classified even in the present, see <a href="../../majjhima/mn-072-tb0.html">MN 72</a> and <a href="../../samyutta/sn22-085.html">SN XXII.85</a>-<a href="../../samyutta/sn22-086.html">86</a>.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-3" name="n-3" id="n-3">3</a>.</b> Nd.I: "He sees seclusion in the midst of sensory contacts" = he sees contact as empty of self. This passage may also refer to the fact that the awakened person experiences sensory contact as if disjoined from it. On this point, see <a href="../../../../lib/authors/thanissaro/likefire/2-4.html#mn140">MN 140</a> and <a href="../../../../lib/authors/thanissaro/likefire/2-4.html#mn146">MN 146</a>, quoted in <i>The Mind Like Fire Unbound,</i> pp. 116 and 113.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-4" name="n-4" id="n-4">4</a>.</b> See <a href="../../anguttara/an10-093.html">AN X.93</a>.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-5" name="n-5" id="n-5">5</a>.</b> Beyond conviction &amp; dispassion &mdash; The Pali here can also mean, "A person of no conviction, he does not put away passion." This is an example of the kind of pun occasionally used in Pali poetry for its shock value. Other examples are at <a href="../dhp/tb0/dhp-07-tb0.html#dhp-97">Dhp 97</a> and the end of <a href="snp4-13.html">Sn IV.13</a>. For an explanation of what is meant by being beyond dispassion, see <a href="snp4-06.html#n-2">note 2 to Sn IV.6</a>.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-6" name="n-6" id="n-6">6</a>.</b> The Pali word <i>tanhaya</i> &mdash; by/through craving &mdash; here is a "lamp," i.e., a single word that functions in two separate phrases.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-7" name="n-7" id="n-7">7</a>.</b> "Embraced/rejected, what's self/what lies against self" &mdash; a pun on the pair of Pali words, <i>attam/nirattam.</i></p>
<p><b><a href="#t-8" name="n-8" id="n-8">8</a>.</b> "Conjuring, the cycling of time" &mdash; two meanings of the Pali word, <i>kappam</i>.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-9" name="n-9" id="n-9">9</a>.</b> "Doctrines, phenomena" &mdash; two meanings of the Pali word, <i>dhamma</i>.</p>
