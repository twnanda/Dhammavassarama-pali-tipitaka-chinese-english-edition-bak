<div class="sutta">
<div class="verse">
<pre>
Staying attached to the cave,
covered heavily over,<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-1" name="t-1" id="t-1">1</a></span>
a person sunk in confusion
is far from seclusion &mdash; 
for	sensual pleasures
	sensual desires<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-2" name="t-2" id="t-2">2</a></span>
in the world
	are not lightly let go.

Those chained by desire,
bound by becoming's allure,
aren't easily released
for there's no liberation by others.
Intent, in front or behind,<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-3" name="t-3" id="t-3">3</a></span>
on hunger for sensual pleasures
here or before &mdash; 
	greedy
for sensual pleasures,
busy, deluded, ungenerous,
entrenched in the out-of-tune way,<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-4" name="t-4" id="t-4">4</a></span>
they &mdash; impelled into pain &mdash; lament:
	"What will we be
	when we pass on from here?"

So a person should train
	right here &amp; now.
Whatever you know
as out-of-tune in the world,
don't, for its sake, act out-of-tune,
for that life, the enlightened say,
	is short.

	I see them,
in the world, floundering around,
people immersed in craving
for states of becoming.
Base people moan in the mouth of death,
their craving, for states of becoming &amp; not-,<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-5" name="t-5" id="t-5">5</a></span>
	unallayed.

	See them,
floundering in their sense of <i>mine,</i>
<a name="fish" id="fish">like fish</a> in the puddles
of a dried-up stream &mdash; 
and, seeing this,
live with no <i>mine,</i>
not forming attachment
for states of becoming.
	Subdue desire
for both sides,<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-6" name="t-6" id="t-6">6</a></span>
comprehending<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-7" name="t-7" id="t-7">7</a></span> sensory contact,
	with no greed.

Doing nothing for which
he himself
would rebuke himself,
the enlightened person doesn't adhere
	to what's seen,
	to what's heard.
Comprehending perception,
he'd cross over the flood &mdash; 
the sage not stuck
on possessions.
Then, with arrow removed,
living heedfully, he longs for neither &mdash; 
	this world,
	the next.

<p><b>Notes</b></p>
<div class="note">
<p><b><a href="#t-1" name="n-1" id="n-1">1</a>.</b> Nd.I: "Covered heavily over" with defilements and unskillful mental qualities.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-2" name="n-2" id="n-2">2</a>.</b> "Sensual desires/sensual pleasures": two possible meanings of <i>kama.</i> According to Nd.I, both meanings are intended here.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-3" name="n-3" id="n-3">3</a>.</b> Nd.I: "In front" means experienced in the past (as does "before" two lines down); "behind" means to-be-experienced in the future.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-4" name="n-4" id="n-4">4</a>.</b> Nd.I: "The out-of-tune way" means the ten types of unskillful action (see <a href="../../anguttara/an10-176.html">AN X.176</a>).</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-5" name="n-5" id="n-5">5</a>.</b> States of not-becoming are oblivious states of becoming that people can get themselves into through a desire for annihilation, either after death or as a goal of their religious striving (see <a href="../iti/tb0/iti2.html#iti-049">Iti 49</a>). As with all states of becoming, these states are impermanent and stressful.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-6" name="n-6" id="n-6">6</a>.</b> According to Nd.I, "both sides" here has several possible meanings: sensory contact and the origination of sensory contact; past and future; name and form; internal and external sense media; self-identity and the origination of self-identity. It also might mean states of becoming and not-becoming, mentioned in the previous verse and below, in <a href="snp4-05.html">Sn IV.5</a>.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-7" name="n-7" id="n-7">7</a>.</b> Nd.I: Comprehending sensory contact has three aspects: being able to identify and distinguish types of sensory contact; contemplating the true nature of sensory contact (e.g., inconstant, stressful, and not-self); and abandoning attachment to sensory contact. The same three aspects would apply to comprehending perception, as mentioned in the following verse.</p>
