<p><b>Notes</b></p>
<div class="note">
<p><b><a href="#t-1" name="n-1" id="n-1">1</a>.</b> "Nothingness" here denotes the dimension of nothingness, one of the four levels of mental absorption on formless themes. One attains this level, after surmounting the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, by focusing on the perception, "There is nothing." MN 26 tells us that Alara Kalama, the Buddha's first teacher when the latter was still a Bodhisatta, had attained this level of mental absorption and had thought that it was the highest possible attainment. The Bodhisatta left him upon realizing that it was not true liberation from stress and suffering. Nevertheless, the dimension of nothingness can be used as a basis for the insight leading to that liberation. On this point, see <a href="snp5-14.html">Sn.V.14</a> and <a href="../../anguttara/an09-036.html">AN IX.36.</a></p>
<p><b><a href="#t-2" name="n-2" id="n-2">2</a>.</b> For a discussion of this passage in light of early Buddhist theories of fire, see <a href="../../../../lib/authors/thanissaro/likefire/2-1.html"><i>The Mind Like Fire Unbound,</i> Chapter 1.</a></p>
<p><b><a href="#t-3" name="n-3" id="n-3">3</a>.</b> For a discussion of the meaning of "criterion" in this passage, see <a href="../../../../lib/authors/thanissaro/likefire/2-1.html"><i>The Mind Like Fire Unbound,</i> Chapter 1</a>.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-4" name="n-4" id="n-4">4</a>.</b> Although Upasiva refers to the goal as a phenomenon (dhamma), the Buddha describes it as the transcending of all phenomena. For some of the implications of this statement, see <a href="../../anguttara/an03-134.html">AN III.134</a>.</p>
