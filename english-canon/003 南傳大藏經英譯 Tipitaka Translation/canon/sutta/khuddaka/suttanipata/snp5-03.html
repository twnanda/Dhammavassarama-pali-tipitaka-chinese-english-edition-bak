<p class="spkr">[Punnaka:]</p>
<pre>
To the one unperturbed,
who has seen the root [of all things],
I have come with a question.
Because of what
have many human seers
	&mdash; noble warriors, brahmans &mdash; 
offered sacrifices to devas
here in the world?
I ask you, O Blessed One.
Please tell me.
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[The Buddha:]</p>
<pre>
Those many human seers
	&mdash; noble warriors, brahmans &mdash; 
who have offered sacrifices to devas
here in the world, Punnaka,
hoping for more of this state of being,
	offered their sacrifices
	because of aging.
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[Punnaka:]</p>
<pre>
Those many human seers
	&mdash; noble warriors, brahmans &mdash; 
who have offered sacrifices to devas
here in the world:
Have they, O Blessed One,
heeding the path of sacrifice,
crossed over birth &amp; aging?
I ask you, O Blessed One.
Please tell me.
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[The Buddha:]</p>
<pre>
They hoped for, liked,
	longed for,
	so sacrificed &mdash; 
they longed for sensuality,
	dependent on gain.
I tell you:
	those who take on the yoke
		of sacrifice,
	impassioned with
	the passion for becoming,
have not crossed over birth &amp; aging.
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[Punnaka:]</p>
<pre>
If those who take on the yoke of sacrifice
haven't crossed over the flood, dear sir,
then who in the world
of beings divine &amp; human
has crossed over birth &amp; aging?
	I ask you, O Blessed One.
	Please tell me.
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[The Buddha:]</p>
<pre>
He who has fathomed
the far &amp; near in the world,
for whom there is nothing
perturbing in the world &mdash; 
	his vices evaporated,
	undesiring, untroubled,
		at peace &mdash; 
he, I tell you, has crossed over birth
			&amp; aging.

<p><b>Note</b></p>
<div class="note">
<p>AN III.32 and <a href="../../anguttara/an04-041.html">AN IV.41</a> contain discussions of the last verse in this poem.</p>
<p>In AN III.32, Ven. Ananda asks the Buddha, "Could it be that a monk could attain a concentration of such a sort such that, with regard to this conscious body, he would have no 'I'-making or 'mine'-making or obsession of conceit, such that with regard to all external themes [topics of concentration] he would have no 'I'-making or 'mine'-making or obsession of conceit, and that he would enter &amp; remain in the awareness-release &amp; discernment-release in which there is no 'I'-making or 'mine'-making or obsession of conceit?"</p>
<p>The Buddha answers that it is possible, and that such a concentration can be attained when one is percipient in this way: "This is peace, this is exquisite &mdash; the resolution of all mental processes; the relinquishment of all acquisitions; the ending of craving; dispassion; cessation; Unbinding." He then adds that it was in connection to this state of mind that he uttered the last verse in this poem.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../anguttara/an04-041.html">AN IV.41</a>, the Buddha identifies four ways of developing concentration: "There is the development of concentration that, when developed &amp; pursued, leads to a pleasant abiding in the here &amp; now. There is the development of concentration that, when developed &amp; pursued, leads to the attainment of knowledge &amp; vision. There is the development of concentration that, when developed &amp; pursued, leads to mindfulness &amp; alertness. There is the development of concentration that, when developed &amp; pursued, leads to the ending of the effluents." (For details, see <a href="../../anguttara/an04-041.html">AN IV.41</a>) The Buddha then adds that he uttered the last verse of this poem in connection with these four ways of developing concentration.</p>
