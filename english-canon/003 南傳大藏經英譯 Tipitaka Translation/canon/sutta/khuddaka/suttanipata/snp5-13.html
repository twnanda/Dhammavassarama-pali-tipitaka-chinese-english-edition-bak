<p class="spkr">[Udaya:]</p>
<pre>
To the one in jhana
	seated dustless,
		passionless,
	his task done,
	effluent-free,
		gone to the beyond
		of all phenomena,
I've come with a question.
Tell me the gnosis of emancipation,
	the breaking open
	of ignorance.
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[The Buddha:]</p>
<pre>
The abandoning
	both of sensual desires,
	&amp; of unhappiness,
the dispelling of sloth,
the warding off of anxieties,
equanimity-&amp;-mindfulness purified,
	with inspection of mental qualities
	swift in the forefront:
That I call the gnosis of emancipation, <span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-1" name="t-1" id="t-1">1</a></span>
	the breaking open
	of ignorance. <span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-2" name="t-2" id="t-2">2</a></span>
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[Udaya:]</p>
<pre>
With what
	is the world fettered?
With what
	is it examined?
Through the abandoning of what
	is there said to be
		Unbinding?
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[The Buddha:]</p>
<pre>
With delight
	the world's fettered.
With directed thought
	it's examined.
Through the abandoning of craving
	is there said to be
		Unbinding.
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[Udaya:]</p>
<pre>
Living mindful in what way
does one bring consciousness
		to a halt?
We've come questioning
	to the Blessed One.
Let us hear your words.
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[The Buddha:]</p>
<pre>
Not relishing feeling,
	inside or out:
One living mindful in this way
	brings consciousness
		to a halt. <span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-3" name="t-3" id="t-3">3</a></span>

<p><b>Notes</b></p>
<div class="note">
<p><b><a href="#t-1" name="n-1" id="n-1">1</a>.</b> For a discussion of the "gnosis of emancipation" &mdash; the state of knowledge consisting of mental absorption coupled with an analysis of mental states, see <a href="../../anguttara/an09-036.html">AN IX.36</a> and <a href="../../../../lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/part3.html#part3-f">Section III.F in <i>The Wings to Awakening</i></a>.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-2" name="n-2" id="n-2">2</a>.</b> AN III.33 contains a discussion of this verse. The Buddha tells Ven. Sariputta that one should train oneself such that "with regard to this conscious body, there will be no 'I'-making or 'mine'-making or obsession of conceit, such that with regard to all external themes [topics of concentration] there will be no 'I'-making or 'mine'-making or obsession of conceit, and that we will enter &amp; remain in the awareness-release &amp; discernment-release in which there is no 'I'-making or 'mine'-making or obsession of conceit." When one has trained in this way, he says, one is called a person who has cut through craving, unraveled the fetter, who has, through the right penetration of conceit, put an end to suffering &amp; stress. He then states that it was in connection to this state that he uttered this verse.</p>
<p><b><a href="#t-3" name="n-3" id="n-3">3</a>.</b> For a discussion of "bringing consciousness to a halt" &mdash; showing that it is not an annihilation of consciousness, but rather the ending of its proliferating activity &mdash; see <a href="../../samyutta/sn22-053.html">SN XXII.53</a>.</p>
