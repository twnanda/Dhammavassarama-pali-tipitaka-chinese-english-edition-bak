<p class="spkr">[Cunda the smith:]</p>
<pre>
"I ask the sage of abundant discernment,
awakened, lord of the Dhamma, free
of craving,
			supreme
among two-legged beings,
		best
of charioteers:
	"How many contemplatives
	are there in the world?
		Please tell me."
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[The Buddha:]</p>
<pre>
"Four contemplatives, Cunda. There isn't a fifth.
Being asked face-to-face, I'll explain:
	the Victor of the path,
	the teacher of the path,
	one who lives by the path,
	&amp; one who corrupts the path."
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[Cunda:]</p>
<pre>
"Whom do the Awakened
call the Victor of the path
[&amp;] one who is an unequalled teacher of the path?
Tell me the one who lives by the path,
and explain to me one who corrupts the path."
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[The Buddha:]</p>
<pre>
"<a name="arrow" id="arrow">He's</a> crossed over perplexity,
his arrow removed,
delighting in Unbinding, free
of greed,
the leader of the world with its devas:
		one like this
		the Awakened
		call the Victor
		of the path.

He here knows the foremost as foremost,
who right here shows &amp; analyzes the Dhamma,
that sage, a cutter-of-doubt unperturbed:
		he's called the second of monks,
		the teacher of the path.

	Mindful, restrained,
he lives by the well-taught 	Dhamma-principles,
				path,
associating with principles without blame:
		he's called the third of monks,
		one who lives by the path.

<a id="chaff" name="chaff"></a>Creating a counterfeit
of those with good practices,
self-asserting, a corrupter of families,<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-1" name="t-1" id="t-1">1</a></span> intrusive,
deceitful, unrestrained, chaff,
going around in disguise:
		he's one who corrupts the path.

Any householder, having ferreted these out
	&mdash; a discerning disciple of those who are noble &mdash; 
knowing they aren't all the same,
seeing this, his conviction's not harmed.
For how could the corrupt with the un-
	corrupt,
		the impure with the pure,
			be put on a par?"

<p><b><a href="#t-1" name="n-1" id="n-1">1</a>.</b> A corrupter of families is a monk who ingratiates himself into a family's affections by performing services for them that are inappropriate for a monk to do, thus diverting their faith away from those who live by the Dhamma and Vinaya.
