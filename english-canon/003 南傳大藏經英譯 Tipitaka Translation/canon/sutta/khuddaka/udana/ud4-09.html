<div class="sutta">
<p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in <a name="rajagaha" id="rajagaha">Rajagaha</a> at the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary. Now at that time, when <a name="upasena" id="upasena">Ven. Upasena Vangantaputta</a> was alone in seclusion, this line of thinking arose in his awareness: "What a gain, what a true gain it is for me that my teacher is the Blessed One, worthy and fully self-awakened; that I have gone forth from home to the homeless life in a well-taught Dhamma and discipline; that my companions in the holy life are virtuous and endowed with admirable qualities; that I have achieved culmination in terms of the precepts; that my mind is unified and well-concentrated; that I am an arahant, with effluents ended; that I have great power and great might. Fortunate has been my life; fortunate will be my death."</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, comprehending with his awareness the line of thinking that had arisen in Ven. Upasena Vangantaputta's awareness, on that occasion exclaimed:</p>
<div class="verse">
<pre>
He feels no regret at what life has been,
he feels no sorrow at death,
if &mdash; a wise one &mdash; he has seen that state.
He feels no sorrow
in the midst of sorrow.

For one who has destroyed
craving for becoming &mdash; 
the monk of peaceful mind &mdash; 
birth &amp; the wandering on
	are totally ended.
There is no further becoming.
</pre>
