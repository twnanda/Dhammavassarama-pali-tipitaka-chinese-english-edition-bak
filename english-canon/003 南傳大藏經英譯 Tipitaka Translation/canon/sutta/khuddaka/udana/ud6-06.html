<div class="sutta">
<p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <a name="sav" id="sav">Savatthi</a>, in Jeta's Grove, <a name="ana" id="ana">Anathapindika's</a> monastery. Now at that time there were many priests, contemplatives, and wanderers of various sects living around Savatthi with differing views, differing opinions, differing beliefs, dependent for support on their differing views. Some of the priests and contemplatives held this view, this doctrine: "The self and the cosmos are eternal. Only this is true; anything otherwise is worthless."</p>
<p>Some of the priests and contemplatives held this view, this doctrine: "The self and the cosmos are not eternal"... "The self and the cosmos are both eternal and not eternal"... "The self and the cosmos are neither eternal nor not eternal"...</p>
<p>"The self and the cosmos are self-produced"... "The self and the cosmos are produced by another"... "The self and the cosmos are both self-produced and produced by another"... "The self and the cosmos are neither self-produced nor produced by another, but are spontaneously arisen"</p>
<p>"Bliss and pain, the self and the cosmos are self-produced"... "produced by another"... "both self-produced and produced by another"... "Bliss and pain, the self and the cosmos are neither self-produced nor produced by another, but are spontaneously arisen. Only this is true; anything otherwise is worthless."</p>
<p>And they lived arguing, quarreling, and disputing, wounding one another with weapons of the mouth, saying, "The Dhamma is like this, it's not like that. The Dhamma's not like that, it's like this."</p>
<p>Then in the early morning, a large number of monks, having put on their robes and carrying their bowls and outer robes, went into Savatthi for alms. Having gone for alms in Savatthi, after the meal, returning from their alms round, they went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they said to the Blessed One: "Lord, there are many priests, contemplatives, and wanderers of various sects living around Savatthi with differing views, differing opinions, differing beliefs, dependent for support on their differing views... and they live arguing, quarreling, and disputing, wounding one another with weapons of the mouth, saying, 'The Dhamma is like this, it's not like that. The Dhamma's not like that, it's like this.'"</p>
<p>"Monks, the wanderers of other sects are blind and eyeless. They don't know what is beneficial and what is harmful. They don't know what is the Dhamma and what is non-Dhamma. Not knowing what is beneficial and what is harmful, not knowing what is Dhamma and what is non-Dhamma, they live arguing, quarreling, and disputing, wounding one another with weapons of the mouth, saying, 'The Dhamma is like this, it's not like that. The Dhamma's not like that, it's like this.'"</p>
<p>Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>
<div class="verse">
<pre>
People are intent on the idea of
	"made by me"
and attached to the idea of
	"made by another."
Some do not realize this,
nor do they see it as a thorn.
But to one who sees,
having extracted this thorn,
[the thought] "I am doing," doesn't occur;
"Another is doing," doesn't occur.

This human race is
	possessed by conceit
	bound by conceit,
	tied down by conceit.
Speaking hurtfully because of their views
they don't go beyond
	transmigration &mdash; the wandering on.
