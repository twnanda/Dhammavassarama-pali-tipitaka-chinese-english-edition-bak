<div class="sutta">
<p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was wandering among the <a name="mallans" id="mallans">Mallans</a>, together with a large community of monks, and came to a brahman village of the Mallans name <a name="thuna" id="thuna">Thuna</a>. The brahman householders of Thuna heard that "Gotama the Sakyan contemplative, gone forth from the Sakyan clan, is wandering among the Mallans together with a large community of monks, and has arrived at Thuna." So they filled the well all the way to the brim with grass and chaff, [thinking], "Don't let these shaven-headed contemplatives draw drinking water."</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One came down from the road, went to a certain tree, and on arrival sat down on a seat made ready. As he sat down, he said to <a name="ananda" id="ananda">Ven. Ananda</a>: "Come, Ananda, get me some drinking water from that well."</p>
<p>When this was said, Ven. Ananda replied, "Just now the brahman householders of Thuna filled that well all the way to the brim with grass and chaff, [thinking], 'Don't let these shaven-headed contemplatives draw drinking water.'"</p>
<p>A second time, the Blessed One said to Ven. Ananda: "Come, Ananda, get me some drinking water from that well."</p>
<p>A second time, Ven. Ananda replied, "Just now the brahman householders of Thuna filled that well all the way to the brim with grass and chaff, [thinking], 'Don't let these shaven-headed contemplatives draw drinking water.'"</p>
<p>A third time, the Blessed One said to Ven. Ananda: "Come, Ananda, get me some drinking water from that well."</p>
<p>"As you say, lord," Ven. Ananda replied and, taking a bowl, went to the well. As he was approaching the well, it expelled all the grass and chaff from its mouth and stood filled to the brim &mdash; streaming, as it were &mdash; with clear, clean, radiant water. The thought occurred to Ven. Ananda, "Isn't it amazing! Isn't it awesome! How great the Tathagata's power! How great his might! While I was approaching the well, it expelled all the grass and chaff from its mouth and stood filled to the brim &mdash; streaming, as it were &mdash; with clear, clean, radiant water."</p>
<p>Taking drinking water in his bowl, he went to the Blessed One and on arrival said, "How amazing, lord! How awesome! How great the Tathagata's power! How great his might! While I was approaching the well, it expelled all the grass and chaff from its mouth and stood filled to the brim &mdash; streaming, as it were &mdash; with clear, clean, radiant water. Drink this water, O Blessed One! Drink this water, O One-Well-Gone!"</p>
<p>Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>
<div class="verse">
<pre>
What's the need for a well
if water is everywhere?
Having cut craving
	by the root,
One would go about searching for what?
</pre>
