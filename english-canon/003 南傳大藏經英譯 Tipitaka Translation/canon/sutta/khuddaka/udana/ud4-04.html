<div class="sutta">
<p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in <a name="rajagaha" id="rajagaha">Rajagaha</a> at the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary. Now at that time <a name="sariputta" id="sariputta">Ven. Sariputta</a> and <a name="moggallana" id="moggallana">Ven. Maha Moggallana</a> were staying in <a name="pigeon" id="pigeon">Pigeon Cave</a>. Then, on a moonlit night, Ven. Sariputta &mdash; his head newly shaven &mdash; was sitting in the open air, having attained a certain level of concentration.</p>
<p>It so happened that two yakkhas who were companions were flying from north to south on some business or other. They saw Ven. Sariputta &mdash; his head newly shaven &mdash; sitting in the open air. Seeing him, the first yakkha said to the second, "I'm inspired to give this contemplative a blow on the head."</p>
<p>When this was said, the second yakkha said to the first, "Enough of that, my good friend. Don't lay a hand on the contemplative. He's an outstanding contemplative, of great power and great might."</p>
<p>A second time, the first yakkha said to the second, "I'm inspired to give this contemplative a blow on the head."</p>
<p>A second time, the second yakkha said to the first, "Enough of that, my good friend. Don't lay a hand on the contemplative. He's an outstanding contemplative, of great power and great might."</p>
<p>A third time, the first yakkha said to the second, "I'm inspired to give this contemplative a blow on the head."</p>
<p>A third time, the second yakkha said to the first, "Enough of that, my good friend. Don't lay a hand on the contemplative. He's an outstanding contemplative, of great power and great might."</p>
<p>Then the first yakkha, ignoring the second yakkha, gave Ven. Sariputta a blow on the head. And with that blow he might have knocked over an elephant seven or eight cubits tall, or split a rocky crag. But right there the yakkha &mdash; yelling, "I'm burning!" &mdash; fell into the Great Hell.</p>
<p>Now, Ven. Moggallana &mdash; with his divine eye, pure and surpassing the human &mdash; saw the yakkha give Ven. Sariputta a blow on the head. Seeing this, he went to Ven. Sariputta and, on arrival, said to him, "I hope you are well, friend Sariputta. I hope you are comfortable. I hope you are feeling no pain."</p>
<p>"I am well, friend Moggallana. I am comfortable. But I do have a slight headache."</p>
<p>"How amazing, friend Sariputta! How awesome! How great your power and might! Just now a yakkha gave you a blow on the head. So great was that blow that he might have knocked over an elephant seven or eight cubits tall, or split a rocky crag. But all you say is this: 'I am well, friend Moggallana. I am comfortable. But I do have a slight headache'!"</p>
<p>"How amazing, friend Moggallana! How awesome! How great your power and might! Where you saw a yakkha just now, I didn't even see a dust devil!"</p>
<p>The Blessed One &mdash; with his divine ear, pure and surpassing the human &mdash; heard those two great beings speak in praise of one another in this way. Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>
<div class="verse">
<pre>
Whose mind is like rock,
	steady,
	unmoved,
dispassionate for things that spark passion,
unangered by things that spark anger:
	When one's mind is developed like this,
	from where can there come
	suffering &amp; stress?
</pre>
