<div class="verse">
<p class="spkr">[Angulimala:]</p>
<pre>
"While walking, contemplative,
you say, 'I have stopped.'
But when <i>I</i> have stopped
you say I haven't.
I ask you the meaning of this:
How have you stopped?
How haven't I?"
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[The Buddha:]</p>
<pre>
"I have stopped, Angulimala,
once &amp; for all,
having cast off violence
toward all living beings.
You, though,
are unrestrained toward beings.
That's how I've stopped
and you haven't."
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[Angulimala:]</p>
<pre>
"At long last a greatly revered great seer
	for my sake
has come to the great forest.
Having heard your verse
in line with the Dhamma,
I will go about
having abandoned evil."

So saying, the bandit
hurled his sword &amp; weapons
	over a cliff
	into a chasm,
		a pit.
Then the bandit paid homage
to the feet of the One Well-gone,
and right there requested the Going-forth.
The Awakened One,
the compassionate great seer,
the teacher of the world, along with its devas,
said to him then:
	"Come, bhikkhu."
That in itself
was bhikkhuhood for him.

		* * *

Who once was heedless,<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-1" name="t-1">1</a></span>
but later is not,
	brightens the world
	like the moon set free from a cloud.

His evil-done deed<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-2" name="t-2">2</a></span>
is replaced with skillfulness:
	he brightens the world
	like the moon set free from a cloud.

Whatever young monk
devotes himself
to the Buddha's bidding:
	he brightens the world
	like the moon set free from a cloud.

May even my enemies
	hear talk of the Dhamma.
May even my enemies
	devote themselves
	to the Buddha's bidding.
May even my enemies
	associate with those people
	who &mdash; peaceful, good &mdash; 
	get others to accept the Dhamma.
May even my enemies
	hear the Dhamma time &amp; again
	from those who advise	endurance,
			forbearance,
	who praise non-opposition,
and may they follow it.

For surely he wouldn't harm me,
or anyone else;
he would attain	the foremost peace,
would protect 	the feeble &amp; firm.

Irrigators guide	the water.<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-3" name="t-3">3</a></span>
Fletchers shape	the arrow shaft.
Carpenters shape	the wood.
The wise control
		themselves.

Some tame with a blunt stick,
with hooks, &amp; with whips
But without blunt or bladed weapons
I was tamed by the one who is Such.

"Doer of No Harm" is my name,
but I used to be a doer of harm.
Today I am true to my name,
for I harm no one at all.

	A bandit
	I used to be,
renowned as Angulimala.
Swept along by a great flood,
I went to the Buddha as refuge.

	Bloody-handed
	I used to be,
renowned as Angulimala.
See my going for refuge!
Uprooted is [craving],
the guide to becoming.

Having done the type of kamma
that would lead to many
bad destinations,
touched by the fruit of [that] kamma,
unindebted, I eat my food.<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-4" name="t-4">4</a></span>

They're addicted to heedlessness<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-5" name="t-5">5</a></span>
 &mdash; dullards, fools &mdash; 
while one who is wise
cherishes heedfulness
as his highest wealth.

Don't give way to heedlessness<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-6" name="t-6">6</a></span>
	or to intimacy
	with sensual delight &mdash; 
for a heedful person,
absorbed in jhana,
attains an abundant bliss.

This<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-7" name="t-7">7</a></span> has come well &amp; not gone away,
it was not badly thought through for me.
From among well-analyzed qualities,
I have obtained
the best.

This has come well &amp; not gone away,
it was not badly thought through for me.

	The three knowledges
	have been attained;
	the Awakened One's bidding,			
		done.<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-8" name="t-8">8</a></span>

Where once I stayed here &amp; there
with shuddering mind &mdash; 
	in the wilderness,
	at the foot of a tree,
	in mountains, caves &mdash; 
with ease I now lie down, I stand,
with ease I live my life.
O, the Teacher has shown me sympathy!

Before, I was of brahman stock,
on either side high-born.
Today I'm the son
of the One Well-gone,
the Dhamma-king,
the Teacher.

Rid of craving, devoid of clinging,
sense-doors guarded, well-restrained,
having killed the root of evil,
I've reached fermentations' end.

The Teacher has been served by me;
the Awakened One's bidding,
	done;
the guide to becoming,	uprooted;
the heavy load,	laid down.
