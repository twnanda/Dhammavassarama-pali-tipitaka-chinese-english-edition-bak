<div class="sutta">
<div class="verse">
<pre>
In a lowly family I was born,
poor, with next to no food.
My work was degrading:
I gathered the spoiled,
the withered flowers from shrines
	and threw them away.
People found me disgusting,
despised me, disparaged me.
Lowering my heart,
I showed reverence to many.

Then I saw the One Self-awakened,
arrayed with a squadron of monks,
the Great Hero, entering the city,
supreme, of the Magadhans.
Throwing down my carrying pole,
I approached him to do reverence.
He &mdash; the supreme man &mdash; stood still
	out of sympathy
	just
	for me.
After paying homage
to the feet of the teacher,
	I stood to one side
	&amp; requested the Going Forth from him,
supreme among all living beings.
The compassionate Teacher,
sympathetic to all the world, said:
	"Come, monk."
That was my formal Acceptance.

Alone, I stayed in the wilds,
	untiring,
I followed the Teacher's words,
just as he, the Conqueror, had taught me.

In the first watch of the night,
	I recollected previous lives;
in the middle watch,
	purified the divine eye;
in the last,
	burst the mass of darkness.

Then, as night was ending
&amp; the sun returning,
<a name="indra" id="indra">Indra</a> &amp; <a name="brahma" id="brahma">Brahma</a> came to pay homage to me,
hands palm-to-palm at their hearts:
	"Homage to you, O thoroughbred of men,
	Homage to you, O man supreme,
	whose fermentations are ended.
	You, dear sir, are worthy of offerings."

<a name="smile" id="smile">Seeing me,</a> arrayed with a squadron of devas,
the Teacher smiled &amp; said:
	"Through austerity, celibacy,
	restraint, &amp; self-control:
	That's how one is a brahman.
	He is a brahman supreme."
