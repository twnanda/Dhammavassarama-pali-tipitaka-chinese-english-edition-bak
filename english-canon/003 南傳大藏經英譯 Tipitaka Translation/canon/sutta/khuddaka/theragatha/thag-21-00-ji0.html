<p><small><a name="verse-1210" id="verse-1210">1210</a>.</small> Mighty warriors, great archers, trained, steady bowmen, one thousand fearless men, might surround me on all sides.</p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1211" id="verse-1211">1211</a>.</small> Even if more women than these will come,<span class="note-tag"><a href="../../../../lib/authors/ireland/wheel417.html#n-2" id="t-2" name="t-2">2</a></span> they will not cause me to waver, for I am firmly established in the teaching.</p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1212" id="verse-1212">1212</a>.</small> In his presence I heard from the Awakened One, the Kinsman of the Sun, of this path leading to nibbana; it is there that my mind is attached.</p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1213" id="verse-1213">1213</a>.</small> Evil One, while I am living thus, if you assail me, so shall I act, O Death, that you will not see my path.</p>

But one who is a monk would not take up a sectarian viewpoint, much less seize upon what is bad.</p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1218" id="verse-1218">1218</a>.</small> Intelligent, for a long time composed (of mind), not deceitful, wise, not envious, the sage has experienced the peaceful state, depending on which, attained to quenching, he awaits his time.<span class="note-tag"><a href="../../../../lib/authors/ireland/wheel417.html#n-8" id="t-8" name="t-8">8</a></span></p>

Because of being infatuated by the way of conceit, for a long time you have been remorseful.</p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1220" id="verse-1220">1220</a>.</small> Soiled by contempt (for others), destroyed by conceit, people fall into hell. Persons destroyed by conceit grieve for a long time upon being reborn in hell.</p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1221" id="verse-1221">1221</a>.</small> A monk never grieves who is a knower of the path,<span class="note-tag"><a href="../../../../lib/authors/ireland/wheel417.html#n-10" id="t-10" name="t-10">10</a></span> one who has practiced it properly. He experiences fame and happiness; truthfully they call him "a seer of Dhamma."</p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1222" id="verse-1222">1222</a>.</small> Therefore be without barrenness<span class="note-tag"><a href="../../../../lib/authors/ireland/wheel417.html#n-11" id="t-11" name="t-11">11</a></span> here ( in this world), energetic, purified by abandoning the hindrances.

<div class="verse">
<p><small><a name="verse-1227" id="verse-1227">1227</a>.</small> One should speak only that word by which one would not torment oneself nor harm others. That word is indeed well spoken.</p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1228" id="verse-1228">1228</a>.</small> One should speak only pleasant words, words which are acceptable (to others). What one speaks without bringing evils to others is pleasant.</p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1229" id="verse-1229">1229</a>.</small> Truth is indeed the undying word; this is an ancient verity.

<p><small><a name="verse-1235" id="verse-1235">1235</a>-36.</small> As a wheel-turning monarch, surrounded by his ministers, tours all around this ocean-girt earth, so do the disciples with the threefold knowledge, who have left death behind, attend upon the victor in battle, the unsurpassed caravan leader.</p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1237" id="verse-1237">1237</a>.</small> All are the Fortunate One's sons; there is no chaff found here. I pay homage to the destroyer of the dart of craving, the Kinsman of the Sun.</p>

<p><small><a name="verse-1243" id="verse-1243">1243</a>.</small> He has shown the path in a variety of ways with the aim of guiding us across the flood. Since the undying has been shown (to them), the Dhamma-seers (are those who) stand immovable.</p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1244" id="verse-1244">1244</a>.</small> The light-maker, having penetrated (the Dhamma), saw the overcoming of all standpoints.<span class="note-tag"><a href="../../../../lib/authors/ireland/wheel417.html#n-29" id="t-29" name="t-29">29</a></span> Having understood and experienced it, he taught the topmost (Dhamma-teaching) to the five.<span class="note-tag"><a href="../../../../lib/authors/ireland/wheel417.html#n-30" id="t-30" name="t-30">30</a></span></p>

<p><small><a name="verse-1263" id="verse-1263">1263</a>.</small> "I ask the teacher of superior wisdom, one who in this very life is the cutter-off of doubts: The monk, well known and famous, who has died at Agga.lava, was he completely quenched in mind?</p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1264" id="verse-1264">1264</a>.</small> "Nigrodhakappa was the name given to that brahmin by you, Fortunate One. Looking for release, strenuously energetic, he went about revering you, O seer of the secure state (i.e., nibbana).</p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1265" id="verse-1265">1265</a>.</small> "<a id="sakka" name="sakka">Sakka</a>, All-seeing One, we all wish to know concerning that disciple. Our ears are ready to hear. You are the teacher, you are unsurpassed.</p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1266" id="verse-1266">1266</a>.</small> "Sever our doubt. Tell me this, you of extensive wisdom, that he experienced quenching. Speak in our very midst, All-seeing One, like the thousand-eyed Sakka in the midst of the gods.</p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1267" id="verse-1267">1267</a>.</small> "Whatever bonds exist here (in the world), ways of delusion, on the side of ignorance, bases for doubt, they no longer exist on reaching the Tathagata, for that vision of his is supreme among men.</p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1268" id="verse-1268">1268</a>.</small> "If no man were ever to disperse the defilements as the wind disperses a mass of clouds, the whole world, enveloped, would surely be darkness, and even illustrious men would not shine forth.</p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1269" id="verse-1269">1269</a>.</small> "But the wise are light-makers. O Wise One, I think you are just such a one. We have come upon him who knows and is gifted with insight. Make evident to us, within the companies (of disciples), the fate of Kappa.</p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1270" id="verse-1270">1270</a>.</small> "Quickly enunciate your beautiful utterance, O beautiful one! Like a goose stretching forth (its neck), honk gently with your melodious and well-modulated voice; we are all listening to you attentively.</p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1271" id="verse-1271">1271</a>.</small> "Pressing the one who has completely abandoned birth and death, I shall urge the purified one to speak Dhamma. For among outsiders there is no acting as they wish, but among Tathagatas there is acting with discretion.<span class="note-tag"><a href="../../../../lib/authors/ireland/wheel417.html#n-35" id="t-35" name="t-35">35</a></span></p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1272" id="verse-1272">1272</a>.</small> "This full explanation of yours, (coming from) one with upright wisdom, is well learnt. This last salutation is proferred. You of superior wisdom, knowing (Kappa's fate), do not keep us in ignorance.</p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1273" id="verse-1273">1273</a>.</small> "Having known the noble Dhamma in its full extent, you of superior energy, knowing (Kappa's fate), do not keep us in ignorance. I long for your word as one overcome by heat in the hot season longs for water. Rain down on our ears.<span class="note-tag"><a href="../../../../lib/authors/ireland/wheel417.html#n-36" id="t-36" name="t-36">36</a></span></p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1274" id="verse-1274">1274</a>.</small> "Surely the purpose for which Kappayana practiced the holy life was not in vain. Was he quenched or had he a residue remaining?<span class="note-tag"><a href="../../../../lib/authors/ireland/wheel417.html#n-37" id="t-37" name="t-37">37</a></span> Let us hear in what way he was released."</p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1275" id="verse-1275">1275</a>.</small> "He cut off craving here for mind-and-materiality", said the Fortunate One, "the stream of craving which for a long time had lain latent within him. He has crossed beyond birth and death completely." So spoke the Fortunate One, the foremost of the five.<span class="note-tag"><a href="../../../../lib/authors/ireland/wheel417.html#n-38" id="t-38" name="t-38">38</a></span></p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1276" id="verse-1276">1276</a>.</small> "On hearing your word, O best of seers, I believe. My question was truly not in vain; the brahmin did not deceive me.</p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1277" id="verse-1277">1277</a>.</small> "As he spoke, so he acted. He was a disciple of the Awakened One. He cut through the strong, spread-out net of Death the deceiver.</p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1278" id="verse-1278">1278</a>.</small> "Kappiya saw the starting point of grasping, O Fortunate One. Kappayana has certainly gone beyond the realm of Death, so difficult to cross.</p>
<p><small><a name="verse-1279" id="verse-1279">1279</a>.</small> "I pay homage to you, the god of gods,<span class="note-tag"><a href="../../../../lib/authors/ireland/wheel417.html#n-39" id="t-39" name="t-39">39</a></span> and to your son, O best of bipeds, to the great hero born in your tracks, a naga, a true son of the naga."<span class="note-tag"><a href="../../../../lib/authors/ireland/wheel417.html#n-40" id="t-40" name="t-40">40</a></span></p>
