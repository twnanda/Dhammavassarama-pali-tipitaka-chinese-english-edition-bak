<div class="verse">
<p class="spkr">[Ananda:]</p>
<pre>
<span style="font-size:small">1024.</span> 82,000 Teachings from the Buddha
I have received;
2,000 more from his disciples;
Now, 84,000 are familiar to me.


<span style="font-size:small">1025.</span> Who nothing has heard and nothing understood,
He ages only oxen-like:
His stomach only grows and grows,
But his insight deepens not.

<span style="font-size:small">1026.</span> Who has much heard and learned,
But does despise him who is poor in learning,
Is like one blind who holds a lamp.
So must I think of such a one.

<span style="font-size:small">1027.</span> Thou follow him who has heard much,
Then what is heard shall not decline.
This is the tap-root of the holy life;
Hence a Dhamma-guardian thou should'st be!

<span style="font-size:small">1028.</span> Knowing what comes first and last,
Knowing well the meaning, too,
Skilful in grammar and in other items,
The well-grasped meaning he examines.

<span style="font-size:small">1029.</span> Keen in his patient application,
He strives to weigh the meaning well.
At the right time he makes his effort,
And inwardly collects his mind.

...

<span style="font-size:small">1034.</span> All the quarters are bedimmed
And the Dhamma is not clear to me,
Indeed my noble friend has gone
And all about seems dark.

<span style="font-size:small">1035.</span> The friend has passed away,
The Master, too, has gone.
There is no friendship now that equals this:
The mindfulness directed bodywards.

<span style="font-size:small">1036.</span> The old ones now have passed away,
The new ones do no please me much,
Today alone I meditate
Like a bird gone to its nest.

...

<span style="font-size:small">1039.</span> Through a full 25 years
As long as I have been in higher training
I have never had a thought of lust:
See, how powerfully the Dhamma works.

...

<span style="font-size:small">1046.</span> Then was there terror, and the hair stood up, when he,
The all-accomplished one, the Buddha, passed away.

...

<span style="font-size:small">1049.</span> The virtuous, wise man,
The hero strong and ever resolute,
The guardian of the word so true,
Ananda found extinction now.
