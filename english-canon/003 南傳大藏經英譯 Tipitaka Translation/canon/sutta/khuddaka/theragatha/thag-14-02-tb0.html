<div class="sutta">
<div class="verse">
<pre>
<a name="bull" id="bull">Just as</a> a fine, well-bred bull
	yoked to a load,
	enduring his load,
			crushed
	by the heavy burden,
		doesn't throw down his yoke;
so, too, those who are filled with discernment
	&mdash; as the ocean, with water &mdash;
		don't look down on others.
This is nobility among beings.

Having fallen in time
	under the sway of time,
having come under the sway
	of becoming-becoming,
people fall subject to pain
		&amp; they grieve.

Elated by the causes of pleasure,
&amp; cast down by causes of pain,
fools are destroyed by both,
not seeing them for what they are.
While those who, in the midst of
	pleasure &amp; pain
have gone past the seamstress of craving,
stand firm
	like a boundary pillar,
	neither elated nor cast down.

Not to gain or loss
not to status or honor,
not to praise or blame,
not to pleasure or pain:
	everywhere
they do not adhere &mdash;
	like a water bead
	on a lotus.
	Everywhere
they are happy, the enlightened,
	everywhere
		un-
	defeated.

No matter what
	the unrighteous gain
	or the righteous loss,
righteous loss is better
	than if there were unrighteous gain.
No matter what
	the status of the unaware
	or the lowliness of those who know,
the lowliness of those who know
			is better,
	not the status of those
	unaware.
No matter what
	the praise from fools
	or the censure from those who know,
the censure from those who know
			is better
	than if there were praise
	from fools.
And as for the pleasure
	from sensuality
and the pain from seclusion,
	the pain from seclusion
			is better
	than if there were pleasure
	from sensuality.
And as for living through unrighteousness
and dying for righteousness,
	dying for righteousness
			is better,
	than if one were to live
	through unrighteousness.

Those who've abandoned
	sensuality &amp; anger,
	whose minds are calmed
	from becoming &amp; non-,
go through the world
			unattached.
For them there is nothing
		dear or undear.
Developing
	the factors for Awakening,
	faculties,
	&amp; strengths,
attaining the foremost peace,
without fermentation, they
	are entirely
	Unbound.
