<div class="sutta verse">
<p class="spkr">[Vangisa:]</p>
<p>I see this delightful and beautiful mansion, its surface of many a color, ablaze with crystal and roofed with silver and gold. A well-proportioned palace, possessing gateways, and strewn with golden sand.</p>
<p>As the thousand-rayed sun in the autumn shines in the sky in the ten directions, dispelling the dark, so does this your mansion glow, like a blazing smoke-crested fire in the darkness of the night.</p>
<p>It dazzles the eye like lightning, beautiful, suspended in space. Resounding with the music of lute, drum, and cymbals, this mansion of yours rivals Indra's city in glory.</p>
<p>White and red and blue lotuses, jasmine, and other flowers are there; blossoming sal trees and flowering asokas, and the air is filled with a variety of fragrances.</p>
<p>Sweet-scented trees, breadfruits, laden branches interlaced, with palm trees and hanging creepers in full bloom, glorious like jeweled nets; also a delightful lotus pool exists for you.</p>
<p>Whatever flowering plants there are that grow in water, and trees that are on land, those known in the human world and heavens, all exist in your abode.</p>
<p>Of what calming and self-restraint is this the result? By the fruit of what deed have you arisen here? How did this mansion come to be possessed by you? Tell it in full, O lady with thick eyelashes.</p>
<p class="spkr">[Sesavati:]</p>
<p>How it come to be possessed by me, this mansion with its flocks of herons, peacocks, and partridges; and frequented by heavenly water-fowl and royal geese; resounding with the cries of birds, of ducks and cuckoos;</p>
<p>containing divers varieties of creepers, flowers and trees; with trumpet-flower, rose-apple, and asoka trees &mdash; now how this mansion came to be possessed by me, I will tell you. Listen, venerable sir.</p>
<p>In the eastern region of the excellent country of Magadha there is a village called Nalaka, venerable sir. There I lived formerly as a daughter-in-law and they knew me there as Sesavati.</p>
<p>Scattering flower-blossoms joyfully I honored him skilled in deeds and worshipped by gods and men, the great Upatissa<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-1" id="t-1" name="t-1">1</a></span> who has attained the immeasurable quenching.</p>
<p>Having worshipped him gone to the ultimate bourn, the eminent seer bearing his last body, on leaving my human shape I came to (the heaven of) the thirty (-three) and inhabit this place.</p>
