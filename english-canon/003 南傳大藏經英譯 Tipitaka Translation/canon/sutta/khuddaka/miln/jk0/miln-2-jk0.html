<p>The king asked: "Venerable Nagasena, what is the distinguishing characteristic of attention, and what is the distinguishing characteristic of wisdom?"</p>
<p>"Examination is the distinguishing characteristic of attention, and severing is the distinguishing characteristic of wisdom."</p>
<p>"How is examination the distinguishing characteristic of attention; and how is severing the distinguishing characteristic of wisdom? Give me an analogy."</p>
<p>"Do you know barley-reapers, your majesty?"</p>
<p>"Yes, venerable sir, I know them."</p>
<p>"How, your majesty, do barley-reapers reap barley?"</p>
<p>"Venerable sir, they take a sheaf of barley in the left hand, and take a sickle in the right hand, and they cut with the sickle."</p>
<p>"<a name="miln-2-1-08-barley" id="miln-2-1-08-barley">Just as</a>, your majesty, a barley-reaper takes a sheaf of barley in the left hand, takes a sickle in the right hand, and cuts the barley, even so, your majesty, does the spiritual aspirant take hold of the mind with attention, and cut off the defilements with wisdom. Indeed thus, your majesty, examination is the distinguishing characteristic of attention, and severing is the distinguishing characteristic of wisdom."</p>

<p>The king asked: "Venerable Nagasena, what is the distinguishing characteristic of wisdom?"</p>
<p>"Previously, your majesty, I said 'severing is the distinguishing characteristic of wisdom,' and now furthermore illuminating is the distinguishing characteristic of wisdom."</p>
<p>"How, venerable sir, is illuminating the distinguishing characteristic of wisdom?"</p>
<p>"Wisdom arising, your majesty, dispels the darkness of ignorance, produces the illumination of insight, brings forth the light of knowledge, and makes manifest the noble truths; and further, the spiritual practitioner sees with complete understanding impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and corelessness."</p>
<p>"Give me an analogy."</p>

<p>The king asked: "Venerable Nagasena, when mind consciousness arises, do contact and feeling also arise?"</p>
<p>"Yes, your majesty, when mind consciousness arises, contact arises, feeling arises, perception arises, volition arises, applied thought arises, and sustained thought arises. And all these mental states arise with contact in the lead."</p>
<p>"Venerable Nagasena, what is the distinguishing characteristic of contact?"</p>
<p>"The distinguishing characteristic of contact, your majesty, is touching."</p>
<p>"Give me an analogy."</p>
<p>"<a name="miln-2-3-08-rams" id="miln-2-3-08-rams">Just as if</a>, your majesty, two rams are butting each other, one of these rams is to be understood as the eye, and the other as a visual object, and the coming together of the two of them is contact."</p>

<p>"Venerable Nagasena, what is the distinguishing characteristic of feeling?"</p>
<p>"The distinguishing characteristic of feeling, your majesty, is sensing; experiencing is also a distinguishing characteristic."</p>
<p>"Give me an analogy."</p>
<p>"<a name="miln-2-3-09-man" id="miln-2-3-09-man">Just as</a>, your majesty, some man might render the king a service, and the king, being well pleased, might repay the service, such that the man on account of this service is provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure. Then the man might think to himself: 'In the past I rendered a service to the king, and now he has repaid me, on account of which I am experiencing feelings of one kind and another.'</p>
<p>"Or just as, your majesty, some man having performed good actions, on the dissolution of the body, after death, would reappear in a happy destination, in the heavenly world, and there he would be provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure. Then the man might think to himself: 'In the past I performed good actions, and now on account of this I am experiencing feelings of one kind and another.'

<p>"Venerable Nagasena, what is the distinguishing characteristic of perception?"</p>
<p>"The distinguishing characteristic of perception, your majesty, is perceiving. What does one perceive? One perceives blue, yellow, red, white, and crimson. Thus, your majesty, the distinguishing characteristic of perception is perceiving."</p>
<p>"Give me an analogy."</p>

Even so, your majesty, if some man here through volition intended some unwholesome deed, then on the dissolution of the body, after death, he would reappear in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, in hell. And those who follow his example would also on the dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, in hell.</p>
<p>"Also just as, your majesty, some man or other might mix together ghee, fresh butter, oil, honey and sugar and drink it himself, and make others drink it, then he and the others would be happy. Even so, your majesty, if some man here through volition intended some wholesome deed, then on the dissolution of the body, after death, he would reappear in a happy destination, in the heavenly world. And those who followed his example would also on the dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in a happy destination, in the heavenly world.
