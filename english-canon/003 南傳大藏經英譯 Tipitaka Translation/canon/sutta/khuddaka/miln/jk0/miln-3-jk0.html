The Buddha appropriated it to mean "one who has attained highest knowledge," i.e., synonymous with "arahant." However, as the PED notes: "A peculiar meaning of <i>vedaguu</i> is that of 'soul' (lit. attainer of wisdom) at Miln 54 &amp; 71."

<p>"If, venerable Nagasena, there is no-one who transmigrates from one body to another, then would not one be released from evil deeds?"</p>
<p>"Yes, your majesty. If one is not reborn, then one would be released from evil deeds. But indeed because one is reborn, your majesty, then one is not fully released from evil deeds."</p>
<p>"Give me an analogy."</p>
<p>"Just as, your majesty, if some man were to steal the mangos of another, would this be an offense worthy of punishment?"</p>
<p>"Yes, venerable sir, it would be an offense worthy of punishment."</p>
<p>"But, your majesty, since these mangos that he stole were not the same mangos that the other had planted, why would it be punishable?"</p>
<p>"Venerable sir, they came into existence by means of those mangos that were planted, therefore it would be punishable."</p>
<p>"Indeed just so, your majesty, it is by the deeds that one does in this mind-and-body, lovely or unlovely, that one is reborn in another mind-and-body, therefore one would not be fully released from evil deeds ."</p>
