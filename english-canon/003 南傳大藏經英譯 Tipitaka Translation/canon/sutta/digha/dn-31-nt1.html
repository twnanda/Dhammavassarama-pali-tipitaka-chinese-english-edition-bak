<div class="sutta">
<p>Thus have I heard:</p>
<p>On one occasion the Exalted One was dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary, near <a name="rajagaha" id="rajagaha">Rajagaha</a>.</p>
<p>Now at that time, young <a name="sigala" id="sigala">Sigala</a>, a householder's son, rising early in the morning, departing from Rajagaha, with wet clothes and wet hair, worshipped with joined hands the various quarters &mdash; the East, the South, the West, the North, the Nadir, and the Zenith.</p>
<p>Then the Exalted One, having robed himself in the forenoon took bowl and robe, and entered Rajagaha for alms. Now he saw young Sigala worshipping thus and spoke to him as follows:</p>
<p>"Wherefore do you, young householder, rising early in the morning, departing from Rajagaha, with wet clothes and wet hair, worship, with joined hands these various quarters &mdash; the East, the South, the West, the North, the Nadir, and the Zenith?"</p>
<p>"My father, Lord, while dying, said to me: The six quarters, dear son, you shall worship. And I, Lord, respecting, revering, reverencing and honoring my father's word, rise early in the morning, and leaving Rajagaha, with wet clothes and wet hair, worship with joined hands, these six quarters."</p>
<p>"It is not thus, young householder, the six quarters should be worshipped in the discipline of the noble."</p>
<p>"How then, Lord, should the six quarters be worshipped in the discipline of the noble? It is well, Lord, if the Exalted One would teach the doctrine to me showing how the six quarters should be worshipped in the discipline of the noble."</p>
<p>"Well, young householder, listen and bear it well in mind; I shall speak." &mdash; "Very good, Lord," responded young Sigala.</p>
<p>And the Exalted One spoke as follows:</p>
<p>"Inasmuch, young householder, as the noble disciple <b>(1)</b> has eradicated the four vices in conduct,<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-1" name="t-1" id="t-1">1</a></span> <b>(2)</b> inasmuch as he commits no evil action in four ways, <b>(3)</b> inasmuch as he pursues not the six channels for dissipating wealth, he thus, avoiding these fourteen evil things, covers the six quarters, and enters the path leading to victory in both worlds: he is favored in this world and in the world beyond. Upon the dissolution of the body, after death, he is born in a happy heavenly realm.</p>
<p><b>(1)</b> "What are <a name="vices4" id="vices4">the four vices</a> in conduct that he has eradicated? The destruction of life, householder, is a vice and so are stealing, sexual misconduct, and lying. These are the four vices that he has eradicated."</p>
<p>Thus spoke the Exalted One. And when the Master had thus spoken, he spoke yet again:</p>
<div class="verse">
<pre>
Killing, stealing, lying and adultery,
These four evils the wise never praise.
</pre>
</div>
<p><b>(2)</b> "In which four ways does one commit no evil action? Led by desire does one commit evil. Led by anger does one commit evil. Led by ignorance does one commit evil. Led by fear does one commit evil.<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-2" name="t-2" id="t-2">2</a></span></p>
<p>"But inasmuch as the noble disciple is not led by desire, anger, ignorance, and fear, he commits no evil."</p>
<p>Thus spoke the Exalted One. And when the Master had thus spoken, he spoke yet again:</p>
<div class="verse">
<pre>
<a name="moon" id="moon">Whoever</a> through desire, hate or fear,
Or ignorance should transgress the Dhamma,
All his glory fades away
Like the moon during the waning half.
Whoever through desire, hate or fear,
Or ignorance never transgresses the Dhamma,
All his glory ever increases
Like the moon during the waxing half.
</pre>

(iii) loss of wealth,
(iv) his word is not relied upon in a court of law,
(v) he is despised by his friends and associates,
(vi) he is not sought after for matrimony; for people would say he is a gambler and is not fit to look after a wife.
</pre>
</div>
<b>(e)</b> "There are, young householder, these six evil consequences in associating with evil companions, namely: any gambler, any libertine, any drunkard, any swindler, any cheat, any rowdy is his friend and companion.
<p><b>(f)</b> "There are, young householder, these six evil consequences in being addicted to idleness:</p>

(iii) that it is too late in the evening,
(iv) that it is too early in the morning,
(v) that he is extremely hungry,
(vi) that he is too full.
</pre>
</div>
<p>"Living in this way, he leaves many duties undone, new wealth he does not get, and wealth he has acquired dwindles away."</p>
<p>Thus spoke the Exalted One. And when the Master had thus spoken, he spoke yet again:</p>
<p>"One is a bottle friend; one says, 'friend, friend' only to one's face; one is a friend and an associate only when it is advantageous.</p>
<p>"Sleeping till sunrise, adultery, irascibility, malevolence, evil companions, avarice &mdash; these six causes ruin a man.</p>
<p>"The man who has evil comrades and friends is given to evil ways, to ruin does he fall in both worlds &mdash; here and the next.</p>
<p>"Dice, women, liquor, dancing, singing, sleeping by day, sauntering at unseemly hours, evil companions, avarice &mdash; these nine<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-5" name="t-5" id="t-5">5</a></span> causes ruin a man.</p>
<p>"<a name="waning" id="waning">Who plays</a> with dice and drinks intoxicants, goes to women who are dear unto others as their own lives, associates with the mean and not with elders &mdash; he declines just as the moon during the waning half.</p>
<p>"Who is drunk, poor, destitute, still thirsty whilst drinking, frequents the bars, sinks in debt as a stone in water, swiftly brings disrepute to his family.</p>
<p>"Who by habit sleeps by day, and keeps late hours, is ever intoxicated, and is licentious, is not fit to lead a household life.</p>
<p>"Who says it is too hot, too cold, too late, and leaves things undone, the opportunities for good go past such men.</p>
<p>"But he who does not regard cold or heat any more than a blade of grass and who does his duties manfully, does not fall away from happiness."</p>
<hr class="microbar" />
<p>"These four, young householder, should be understood as foes in the guise of friends:</p>
<div class="verse">
<pre>
<b>(1)</b> he who appropriates a friend's possessions,
<b>(2)</b> he who renders lip-service,
<b>(3)</b> he who flatters,
<b>(4)</b> he who brings ruin.
</pre>
</div>
<p><b>(1)</b> "In four ways, young householder, should one who appropriates be understood as a foe in the guise of a friend:</p>

<p><b>(4)</b> "In four ways, young householder, should one who brings ruin be understood as a foe in the guise of a friend:</p>

(ii) he is a companion in sauntering in streets at unseemly hours,
(iii) he is a companion in frequenting theatrical shows,
(iv) he is a companion in indulging in gambling which causes heedlessness."

<p>Thus spoke the Exalted One. And when the Master had thus spoken, he spoke yet again:</p>

The friend who appropriates,
the friend who renders lip-service,
the friend that flatters,

<div class="verse">
<pre>
The friend who is a helpmate,
the friend in happiness and woe,
the friend who gives good counsel,
the friend who sympathises too  &mdash;  
these four as friends the wise behold
and cherish them devotedly
as does a mother her own child.

The wise and virtuous shine like a blazing fire.
He who acquires his wealth in harmless ways
like to a bee that honey gathers,<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-6" name="t-6" id="t-6">6</a></span>
riches mount up for him
like ant hill's rapid growth.

With wealth acquired this way,
a layman fit for household life,
in portions four divides his wealth:
thus will he friendship win.

One portion for his wants he uses,<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-7" name="t-7" id="t-7">7</a></span>
two portions on his business spends,
the fourth for times of need he keeps.

Generosity, sweet speech,
Helpfulness to others,
Impartiality to all,
As the case demands.

These four winning ways make the world go round,
As the linchpin in a moving car.
If these in the world exist not,
Neither mother nor father will receive,
Respect and honor from their children.

Since these four winning ways
The wise appraise in every way,
To eminence they attain,
And praise they rightly gain.

<p>When the Exalted One had spoken thus, Sigala, the young householder, said as follows:</p>
<p>"<a name="magnif" id="magnif">Excellent</a>, Lord, excellent! It is as if, Lord, a man were to set upright that which was overturned, or were to reveal that which was hidden, or were to point out the way to one who had gone astray, or were to hold a lamp amidst the darkness, so that those who have eyes may see. Even so, has the doctrine been explained in various ways by the Exalted One.</p>
<p>"I take refuge, Lord, in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. May the Exalted One receive me as a lay follower; as one who has taken refuge from this very day to life's end."</p>

<p><b><a href="#t-9" name="n-9" id="n-9">9</a>.</b> This is a sacred custom of the Aryans who never forgot the dead. This tradition is still faithfully observed by the Buddhists of Sri Lanka who make ceremonial offerings of alms to the monks on the eighth day, in the third month, and on each anniversary of the demise of the parents. Merit of these good actions is offered to the departed after such ceremony. Moreover after every <i>punna-kamma</i> (good action), a Buddhist never fails to think of his parents and offer merit. Such is the loyalty and the gratitude shown to parents as advised by the Buddha.</p>
