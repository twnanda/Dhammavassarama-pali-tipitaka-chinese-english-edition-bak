<div class="sutta">
<p>Thus have I heard:</p>
<p>On one occasion the Blessed One was living near <a name="rajagaha" id="rajagaha">Rajagaha</a> in the bamboo grove in the squirrels' feeding ground. At that time, he was afflicted with a disease, was suffering therefrom, and was gravely ill.</p>
<p>Then the Venerable Maha Cunda<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-s14-2" name="t-s14-2" id="t-s14-2">1</a></span> 'arising from his solitude at eventide'<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-s14-3" name="t-s14-3" id="t-s14-3">2</a></span> approached the Blessed One, saluted him, and sat down beside him.</p>
<p>To the Venerable Maha Cunda thus seated, the Blessed One said:</p>
<p>"O Cunda, let the factors of enlightenment occur to your mind."</p>
<p>"These seven factors of enlightenment, <i>bhante</i> (Ven. Sir), are well expounded and are cultivated and fully developed by the Blessed One. They conduce to perfect understanding, to full realization and to Nibbana. What are the seven?</p>
<p>i. "Mindfulness, the factor of enlightenment, <i>bhante,</i> is well expounded by the Blessed One, and is cultivated and fully developed by the Blessed One. It conduces to perfect understanding, to full realization and to Nibbana.</p>
<p>ii. "Investigation of the Dhamma, the factor of enlightenment, <i>bhante,</i> is well expounded by the Blessed One and is cultivated and fully developed by the Blessed One. It conduces to perfect understanding, to full realization and to Nibbana.</p>
<p>iii. "Persevering effort, the factor of enlightenment, <i>bhante,</i> is well expounded by the Blessed One and is cultivated and fully developed by the Blessed One. It conduces to perfect understanding, to full realization and to Nibbana.</p>
<p>iv. "Rapture, the factor of enlightenment, <i>bhante,</i> is well expounded by the Blessed One and is cultivated and fully developed by the Blessed One. It conduces to perfect understanding, to full realization and to Nibbana.</p>
<p>v. "Calm, the factor of enlightenment, <i>bhante,</i> is well expounded by the Blessed One and is cultivated and fully developed by the Blessed One. It conduces to perfect understanding, to full realization and to Nibbana.</p>
<p>vi. "Concentration, the factor of enlightenment, <i>bhante,</i> is well expounded by the Blessed One and is cultivated and fully developed by the Blessed One. It conduces to perfect understanding, to full realization and to Nibbana.</p>
<p>vii. "Equanimity, the factor of enlightenment, <i>bhante,</i> is well expounded by the Blessed One, and is cultivated and fully developed by the Blessed One. It conduces to perfect understanding, to full realization and to Nibbana.These seven factors of enlightenment, <i>bhante,</i> are well expounded and cultivated and fully developed by the Blessed One. They conduce to perfect understanding, to full realization and to Nibbana."</p>
<p>"Most assuredly Cunda, they are factors of enlightenment. Most assuredly, Cunda, they are factors of enlightenment."</p>
<p>Thus said the Venerable Maha Cunda, and the Master approved of it. Then the Blessed One recovered from his affliction, and thus disappeared his affliction.</p>
