<p>Staying at Savatthi... [the Blessed One said,] "What one intends, what one arranges, and what one obsesses about:<span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-1" name="t-1" id="t-1">1</a></span> This is a support for the stationing of consciousness. There being a support, there is a landing [or: an establishing] of consciousness. When that consciousness lands and grows, there is the production of renewed becoming in the future. When there is the production of renewed becoming in the future, there is future birth, aging &amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair. Such is the origination of this entire mass of suffering &amp; stress.</p>
<p>"If one doesn't intend and doesn't arrange, but one still obsesses [about something], this is a support for the stationing of consciousness. There being a support, there is a landing of consciousness. When that consciousness lands and grows, there is the production of renewed becoming in the future. When there is the production of renewed becoming in the future, there is future birth, aging &amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair. Such [too] is the origination of this entire mass of suffering &amp; stress.</p>
<p>"But when one doesn't intend, arrange, or obsess [about anything], there is no support for the stationing of consciousness. There being no support, there is no landing of consciousness. When that consciousness doesn't land &amp; grow, there is no production of renewed becoming in the future. When there is no production of renewed becoming in the future, there is no future birth, aging &amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, or despair. Such is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering &amp; stress."</p>
