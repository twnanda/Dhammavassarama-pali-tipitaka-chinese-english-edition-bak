<div class="tnote">
<p><b>Translator's note:</b> This sutta is based on a play on words. In everyday Pali, the term "consummate in faculties" is used to describe a person whose beauty and health are inspiring. Here the Buddha gives a different meaning to the term.</p>
</div>
<hr />
<div class="sutta">
<p>Then a certain monk went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, "'Consummate in faculties, consummate in faculties,' it is said. To what extent is one consummate in faculties?"</p>
<p>"If a monk, while keeping track of arising &amp; passing away with regard to the eye-faculty, becomes disenchanted with the eye-faculty; if, while keeping track of arising &amp; passing away with regard to the ear-faculty... the nose-faculty... the tongue-faculty... the body faculty... the intellect-faculty, he becomes disenchanted with the intellect-faculty; and, disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate; through dispassion, he is fully released; with full release, there is the knowledge, 'Fully released'; he discerns that 'Birth is depleted, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world,' it is to this extent that one is consummate in faculties."</p>
