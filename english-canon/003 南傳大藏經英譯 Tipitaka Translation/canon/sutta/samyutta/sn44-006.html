<div class="sutta">
<p>On one occasion Ven. Sariputta and Ven. Maha Kotthita were staying near Varanasi in the Game Refuge at Isipatana. Then in the evening, Ven. Sariputta emerged from his seclusion and went to Ven. Maha Kotthita and exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to Ven. Maha Kotthita, "Now then, friend Kotthita, does the Tathagata exist after death?"</p>
<p>"That, friend, has not been declared by the Blessed One: 'The Tathagata exists after death.'"</p>
<p>"Well then, friend Kotthita, does the Tathagata not exist after death?"</p>
<p>"Friend, that too has not been declared by the Blessed One: 'The Tathagata does not exist after death.'"</p>
<p>"Then does the Tathagata both exist and not exist after death?"</p>
<p>"That has not been declared by the Blessed One: 'The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death.'"</p>
<p>"Well then, does the Tathagata neither exist nor not exist after death?"</p>
<p>"That too has not been declared by the Blessed One: 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'"</p>
<p>"Now, friend Kotthita, when asked if the Tathagata exists after death, you say, 'That has not been declared by the Blessed One: "The Tathagata exists after death."' When asked if the Tathagata does not exist after death... both exists and does not exist after death... neither exists nor does not exist after death, you say, 'That too has not been declared by the Blessed One: "The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death."' Now, what is the cause, what is the reason, why that has not been declared by the Blessed One?"</p>

<h4>(i. The aggregates)</h4>
<p>"For one who loves form, who is fond of form, who cherishes form, who does not know or see, as it actually is present, the cessation of form, there occurs the thought, 'The Tathagata exists after death' or 'The Tathagata does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'</p>
<p>"For one who loves feeling...</p>
<p>"For one who loves perception...</p>
<p>"For one who loves fabrications...</p>
<p>"For one who loves consciousness, who is fond of consciousness, who cherishes consciousness, who does not know or see, as it actually is present, the cessation of consciousness, there occurs the thought, 'The Tathagata exists after death' or 'The Tathagata does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'</p>
<p>"But for one who doesn't love form, who isn't fond of form, who doesn't cherish form, who knows &amp; sees, as it actually is present, the cessation of form, the thought, 'The Tathagata exists after death' or 'The Tathagata does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death' doesn't occur.</p>
<p>"For one who doesn't love feeling...</p>
<p>"For one who doesn't love perception...</p>
<p>"For one who doesn't love fabrication...</p>
<p>"For one who doesn't love consciousness, who isn't fond of consciousness, who doesn't cherish consciousness, who knows &amp; sees, as it actually is present, the cessation of consciousness, the thought, 'The Tathagata exists after death' or 'The Tathagata does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death' doesn't occur.</p>
<p>"This is the cause, this is the reason, why that has not been declared by the Blessed One."</p>

<h4>(ii. Becoming)</h4>
<p>"But, my friend, would there another line of reasoning, in line with which that has not been declared by the Blessed One?"</p>
<p>"There would, my friend. "For one who loves becoming, who is fond of becoming, who cherishes becoming, who does not know or see, as it actually is present, the cessation of becoming, there occurs the thought, 'The Tathagata exists after death' or 'The Tathagata does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'</p>
<p>"But for one who doesn't love becoming, who isn't fond of becoming, who doesn't cherish becoming, who knows &amp; sees, as it actually is present, the cessation of becoming, the thought, 'The Tathagata exists after death' or 'The Tathagata does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death' doesn't occur.</p>
<p>"This, too, is a line of reasoning in line with which that has not been declared by the Blessed One."</p>

<h4>(iii. Clinging/sustenance)</h4>
<p>"But, my friend, would there another line of reasoning, in line with which that has not been declared by the Blessed One?"</p>
<p>"There would, my friend. "For one who loves clinging/sustenance, who is fond of clinging/sustenance, who cherishes clinging/sustenance, who does not know or see, as it actually is present, the cessation of clinging/sustenance, there occurs the thought, 'The Tathagata exists after death' or 'The Tathagata does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'</p>
<p>"But for one who doesn't love clinging/sustenance, who isn't fond of clinging/sustenance, who doesn't cherish clinging/sustenance, who knows &amp; sees, as it actually is present, the cessation of clinging/sustenance, the thought, 'The Tathagata exists after death' or 'The Tathagata does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death' doesn't occur.</p>
<p>"This, too, is a line of reasoning in line with which that has not been declared by the Blessed One."</p>

<h4>(iv. Craving)</h4>
<p>"But, my friend, would there another line of reasoning, in line with which that has not been declared by the Blessed One?"</p>
<p>"There would, my friend. "For one who loves craving, who is fond of craving, who cherishes craving, who does not know or see, as it actually is present, the cessation of craving, there occurs the thought, 'The Tathagata exists after death' or 'The Tathagata does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'</p>
<p>"But for one who doesn't love craving, who isn't fond of craving, who doesn't cherish craving, who knows &amp; sees, as it actually is present, the cessation of craving, the thought, 'The Tathagata exists after death' or 'The Tathagata does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death' doesn't occur.</p>
<p>"This, too, is a line of reasoning in line with which that has not been declared by the Blessed One."</p>
<p>"But, my friend, would there another line of reasoning, in line with which that has not been declared by the Blessed One?"</p>
<p>"Now, what more do you want, friend Sariputta? When a monk has been freed from the classification of craving, there exists no cycle for describing him."</p>
