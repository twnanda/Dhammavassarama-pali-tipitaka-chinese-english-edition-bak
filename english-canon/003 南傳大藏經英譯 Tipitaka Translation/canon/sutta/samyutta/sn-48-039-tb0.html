<p>"Monks, there are these five faculties. Which five? The pleasure-faculty, the pain-faculty, the happiness-faculty, the distress-faculty, the equanimity-faculty.</p>

<p>"In dependence on a contact to be experienced as pleasure, the pleasure-faculty arises. Being eased, one discerns, 'I am eased.' With the cessation of that very contact to be experienced as pleasure, one discerns, 'What was experienced as coming from that &mdash; the pleasure-faculty arising in dependence on a contact to be experienced as pleasure &mdash; ceases &amp; grows still.'</p>

<p>"In dependence on a contact to be experienced as pain, the pain-faculty arises. Being pained, one discerns, 'I am pained.' With the cessation of that very contact to be experienced as pain, one discerns, 'What was experienced as coming from that &mdash; the pain-faculty arising in dependence on a contact to be experienced as pain &mdash; ceases &amp; grows still.'</p>

<p>"In dependence on a contact to be experienced as happiness, the happiness-faculty arises. Being happy, one discerns, 'I am happy.' With the cessation of that very contact to be experienced as happiness, one discerns, 'What was experienced as coming from that &mdash; the happiness-faculty arising in dependence on a contact to be experienced as happiness &mdash; ceases &amp; grows still.'</p>

<p>"In dependence on a contact to be experienced as distress, the distress-faculty arises. Being distressed, one discerns, 'I am distressed.' With the cessation of that very contact to be experienced as distress, one discerns, 'What was experienced as coming from that &mdash; the distress-faculty arising in dependence on a contact to be experienced as distress &mdash; ceases &amp; grows still.'</p>

<p>"In dependence on a contact to be experienced as equanimity, the equanimity-faculty arises. Being equanimous, one discerns, 'I am equanimous.' With the cessation of that very contact to be experienced as equanimity, one discerns, 'What was experienced as coming from that &mdash; the equanimity-faculty arising in dependence on a contact to be experienced as equanimity &mdash; ceases &amp; grows still.'</p>

<p>"Just as when, from the conjunction &amp; combining of two fire sticks, heat is generated &amp; fire produced, while from the separation &amp; laying down of those fire sticks the heat coming from them ceases &amp; grows still; in the same way, in dependence on a contact to be experienced as pleasure, the pleasure-faculty arises...</p>

<p>"In dependence on a contact to be experienced as pain, the pain-faculty arises...</p>

<p>"In dependence on a contact to be experienced as happiness, the happiness-faculty arises...</p>

<p>"In dependence on a contact to be experienced as distress, the distress-faculty arises...</p>

<p>"In dependence on a contact to be experienced as equanimity, the equanimity-faculty arises. Being equanimous, one discerns, 'I am equanimous.' With the cessation of that very contact to be experienced as equanimity, one discerns, 'What was experienced as coming from that &mdash; the equanimity-faculty arising in dependence on a contact to be experienced as equanimity &mdash; ceases &amp; grows still.'"</p>
