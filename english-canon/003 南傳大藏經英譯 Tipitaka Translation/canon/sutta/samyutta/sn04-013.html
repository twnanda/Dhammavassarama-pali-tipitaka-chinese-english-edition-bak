<div class="sutta">
<p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <a name="rajagaha" id="rajagaha">Rajagaha</a> at the <a name="maddakucchi" id="maddakucchi">Maddakucchi</a> Deer Reserve. Now at that time his foot had been pierced by a stone sliver. Excruciating were the bodily feelings that developed within him &mdash; painful, fierce, sharp, wracking, repellent, disagreeable &mdash; but he endured them mindful, alert, &amp; unperturbed. Having had his outer robe folded in four and laid out, he lay down on his right side in the lion's posture &mdash; with one foot placed on top of the other &mdash; mindful &amp; alert.</p>
<p>Then Mara the Evil One went to the Blessed One and recited this verse in his presence:</p>
<div class="verse">
<pre>
Are you lying there in a stupor,
or drunk on poetry?
Are your goals so very few?
All alone in a secluded lodging,
what is this dreamer, this sleepy-face?
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[The Buddha:]</p>
<pre>
I lie here,
	not in a stupor,
	nor drunk on poetry.
My goal attained,
	I am sorrow-free.
All alone in a secluded lodging,
I lie down with sympathy
	for all beings.

Even those pierced in the chest
with an arrow,
their hearts rapidly,
	rapidly
	beating:
even they with their arrows
are able to sleep.
	So why shouldn't I,
	with my arrow		removed?

I'm not awake with worry,
nor afraid to sleep.
Days &amp; nights
don't oppress me.
I see no threat of decline
in any world at all.
That's why I sleep
	with sympathy
	for all beings.
</pre>
</div>
<p>Then Mara the Evil One &mdash; sad &amp; dejected at realizing, "The Blessed One knows me; the One Well-Gone knows me" &mdash; vanished right there.</p>
