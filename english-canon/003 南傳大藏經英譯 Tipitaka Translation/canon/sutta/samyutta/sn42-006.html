<div class="sutta">
<p>On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <a name="nalanda" id="nalanda">Nalanda</a> in the <a name="pavarika" id="pavarika">Pavarika Mango Grove</a>. Then <a name="asi" id="asi">Asibandhakaputta</a> the headman went to the Blessed One and on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "The brahmans of the Western lands, lord &mdash; those who carry water pots, wear garlands of water plants, purify with water, &amp; worship fire &mdash; can take [the spirit of] a dead person, lift it out, instruct it, &amp; send it to heaven. But the Blessed One, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened, can arrange it so that all the world, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappears in a good destination, the heavenly world."</p>
<p>"Very well, then, headman, I will question you on this matter. Answer as you see fit. What do you think: There is the case where a man is one who takes life, steals, indulges in illicit sex; is a liar, one who speaks divisive speech, harsh speech, &amp; idle chatter; is greedy, bears thoughts of ill-will, &amp; holds to wrong views. Then a great crowd of people, gathering &amp; congregating, would pray, praise, &amp; circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart [saying,] 'May this man, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in a good destination, the heavenly world!' What do you think: would that man &mdash; because of the prayers, praise, &amp; circumambulation of that great crowd of people &mdash; at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in a good destination, the heavenly world?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"<a name="boulder" id="boulder">Suppose</a> a man were to throw a large boulder into a deep lake of water, and a great crowd of people, gathering &amp; congregating, would pray, praise, &amp; circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart [saying,] 'Rise up, O boulder! Come floating up, O boulder! Come float to the shore, O boulder!' What do you think: would that boulder &mdash; because of the prayers, praise, &amp; circumambulation of that great crowd of people &mdash; rise up, come floating up, or come float to the shore?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"So it is with any man who takes life, steals, indulges in illicit sex; is a liar, one who speaks divisive speech, harsh speech, &amp; idle chatter; is greedy, bears thoughts of ill-will, &amp; holds to wrong views. Even though a great crowd of people, gathering &amp; congregating, would pray, praise, &amp; circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart &mdash; [saying,] 'May this man, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in a good destination, the heavenly world!' &mdash; still, at the break-up of the body, after death, he would reappear in destitution, a bad destination, the lower realms, hell.</p>
<p>"Now what do you think: There is the case where a man is one who refrains from taking life, from stealing, &amp; from indulging in illicit sex; he refrains from lying, from speaking divisive speech, from harsh speech, &amp; from idle chatter; he is not greedy, bears no thoughts of ill-will, &amp; holds to right view. Then a great crowd of people, gathering &amp; congregating, would pray, praise, &amp; circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart [saying,] 'May this man, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in destitution, a bad destination, the lower realms, hell!' What do you think: would that man &mdash; because of the prayers, praise, &amp; circumambulation of that great crowd of people &mdash; at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in destitution, a bad destination, the lower realms, hell?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"<a name="jar" id="jar">Suppose</a> a man were to throw a jar of ghee or a jar of oil into a deep lake of water, where it would break. There the shards &amp; jar-fragments would go down, while the ghee or oil would come up. Then a great crowd of people, gathering &amp; congregating, would pray, praise, &amp; circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart [saying,] 'Sink, O ghee/oil! Submerge, O ghee/oil! Go down, O ghee/oil!' What do you think: would that ghee/oil, because of the prayers, praise, &amp; circumambulation of that great crowd of people sink, submerge, or go down?"</p>
<p>"No, lord."</p>
<p>"So it is with any man who refrains from taking life, from stealing, &amp; from indulging in illicit sex; refrains from lying, from speaking divisive speech, from harsh speech, &amp; from idle chatter; is not greedy, bears no thoughts of ill-will, &amp; holds to right view. Even though a great crowd of people, gathering &amp; congregating, would pray, praise, &amp; circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart &mdash; [saying,] 'May this man, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in a destitution, a bad destination, the lower realms, hell!' &mdash; still, at the break-up of the body, after death, he would reappear in a good destination, the heavenly world."</p>
<p>When this was said, Asibandhakaputta the headman said to the Blessed One: "<a name="magnif" id="magnif">Magnificent</a>, lord! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to point out the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has the Blessed One &mdash; through many lines of reasoning &mdash; made the Dhamma clear. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, &amp; to the community of monks. May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward, for life."</p>
