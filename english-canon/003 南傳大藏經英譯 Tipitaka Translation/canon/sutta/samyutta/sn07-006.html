<div class="sutta">
<p>At <a name="savatthi" id="savatthi">Savatthi</a>. Then the brahman <a name="jata" id="jata">Jata</a><span class="note-tag"><a href="#n-1" name="t-1" id="t-1">1</a></span> Bharadvaja went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After this exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there he addressed the Blessed One with a verse:</p>
<div class="verse">
<pre>
A <a name="tangle" id="tangle">tangle</a> within,
a tangle without,
people are entangled
		in a tangle.
Gotama, I ask you this:
	who can untangle this tangle?
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[The Buddha:]</p>
<pre>
A man established in virtue,
		discerning,
developing discernment &amp; mind,
a monk ardent, astute:
	he can untangle this tangle.

Those whose 	passion,
			aversion,
			&amp; ignorance
		have faded away,
arahants, their effluents ended:
	for them the tangle's untangled.

Where name-&amp;-form,
	along with perception
	of impingement &amp; form,
totally stop without trace:
	that's where the tangle
		is cut.
</pre>
</div>
<p>When this was said, the brahman Jata Bharadvaja said to the Blessed One, "<a name="magnif" id="magnif">Magnificent</a>, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama &mdash; through many lines of reasoning &mdash; made the Dhamma clear. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, &amp; to the community of monks. Let me obtain the going forth in Master Gotama's presence, let me obtain admission."</p>
<p><a name="ordain" id="ordain">Then</a> the brahman Jata Bharadvaja received the going forth &amp; the admission in the Blessed One's presence. <a name="victory" id="victory">And</a> not long after his admission &mdash; dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute &mdash; he in no long time reached &amp; remained in the supreme goal of the holy life, for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing &amp; realizing it for himself in the here &amp; now. He knew: "Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for the sake of this world." And so Ven. Bharadvaja became another one of the arahants.</p>
