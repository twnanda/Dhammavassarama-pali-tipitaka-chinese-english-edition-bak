<p>"The eye is not yours: let go of it. Your letting go of it will be for your long-term happiness &amp; benefit. Forms are not yours... Eye-consciousness is not yours... Eye-contact is not yours... Whatever arises in dependence on eye-contact, experienced either as pleasure, as pain, or as neither-pleasure-nor-pain, that too is not yours: let go of it. Your letting go of it will be for your long-term happiness &amp; benefit.</p>
<p>"The ear is not yours: let go of it...</p>
<p>"The nose is not yours: let go of it...</p>
<p>"The tongue is not yours: let go of it...</p>
<p>"The body is not yours: let go of it...</p>
<p>"The intellect is not yours: let go of it. Your letting go of it will be for your long-term happiness &amp; benefit. Ideas are not yours... Intellect-consciousness is not yours... Intellect-contact is not yours... Whatever arises in dependence on intellect-contact, experienced either as pleasure, as pain, or as neither-pleasure-nor-pain, that too is not yours: let go of it.
