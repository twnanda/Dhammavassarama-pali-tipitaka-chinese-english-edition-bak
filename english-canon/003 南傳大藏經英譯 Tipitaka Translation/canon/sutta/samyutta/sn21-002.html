<div class="sutta">
<p>At Savatthi. There Ven. Sariputta addressed the monks: "Friends!"</p>
<p>"Yes, friend," the monks responded.</p>
<p>Ven. Sariputta said, "Friends, just now as I was withdrawn in seclusion, this train of thought arose to my awareness: 'Is there anything in the world with whose change or alteration there would arise within me sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair?' Then the thought occurred to me: 'There is nothing in the world with whose change or alteration there would arise within me sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair.'"</p>
<p>When this was said, Ven. Ananda said to Ven. Sariputta, "Sariputta my friend, even if there were change &amp; alteration in the Teacher would there arise within you no sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, or despair?"</p>
<p>"Even if there were change &amp; alteration in the Teacher, my friend, there would arise within me no sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, or despair. Still, I would have this thought: 'What a great being, of great might, of great prowess, has disappeared! For if the Blessed One were to remain for a long time, that would be for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of sympathy for the world; for the welfare, benefit, &amp; happiness of human &amp; divine beings.'"</p>
<p>"Surely," [said Ven. Ananda,] "it's because Ven. Sariputta's I-making &amp; mine-making and obsessions with conceit have long been well uprooted that even if there were change &amp; alteration in the Teacher, there would arise within him no sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, or despair."</p>
