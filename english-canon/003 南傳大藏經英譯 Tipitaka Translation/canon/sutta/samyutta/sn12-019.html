<p>Dwelling at <a name="savatthi" id="savatthi">Savatthi</a>. "When a fool is obstructed by ignorance and conjoined with craving, this body thus results. Now there is both this body and external name-&amp;-form. Here, in dependence on this duality, there is contact at the six senses. Touched by these, or one or another of them, the fool is sensitive to pleasure &amp; pain.</p>
<p>"When a wise person is obstructed by ignorance and conjoined with craving, this body thus results. Now there is both this body and external name-&amp;-form. Here, in dependence on this duality, there is contact at the six senses. Touched by these, or one or another of them, the wise person is sensitive to pleasure &amp; pain.</p>
<p>"So what difference, what distinction, what distinguishing factor is there between the wise person &amp; the fool?"</p>
<p>"For us, lord, the teachings have the Blessed One as their root, their guide, &amp; their arbitrator. It would be good if the Blessed One himself would explicate the meaning of this statement. Having heard it from the Blessed One, the monks will remember it."</p>
<p>"In that case, monks, listen &amp; pay close attention. I will speak."</p>
<p>"As you say, lord," the monks responded.</p>
<p>The Blessed One said, "The ignorance with which the fool is obstructed, the craving with which he is conjoined, through which this body results: that ignorance has not been abandoned by the fool; that craving has not been destroyed. Why is that? The fool has not practiced the holy life for the right ending of stress. Therefore, at the break-up of the body, he is headed for a [new] body. Headed for a body, he is not entirely freed from birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair. I tell you, he is not entirely freed from stress &amp; suffering.</p>
