<div class="sutta">
<p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <a name="savatthi" id="savatthi">Savatthi</a> in the Eastern Monastery, the <a name="migaramom" id="migaramom">palace</a> of Migara's mother. Now on that occasion the Blessed One, on emerging from seclusion in the late afternoon, sat warming his back in the western sun. Then <a name="ananda" id="ananda">Ven. Ananda</a> went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, massaged the Blessed One's limbs with his hand and said, "<a name="buddha" id="buddha">It's amazing</a>, lord. It's astounding, how the Blessed One's complexion is no longer so clear &amp; bright; his limbs are flabby &amp; wrinkled; his back, bent forward; there's a discernible change in his faculties &mdash; the faculty of the eye, the faculty of the ear, the faculty of the nose, the faculty of the tongue, the faculty of the body."</p>
<p>"That's the way it is, Ananda. When young, one is subject to aging; when healthy, subject to illness; when alive, subject to death. The complexion is no longer so clear &amp; bright; the limbs are flabby &amp; wrinkled; the back, bent forward; there's a discernible change in the faculties &mdash; the faculty of the eye, the faculty of the ear, the faculty of the nose, the faculty of the tongue, the faculty of the body."</p>
<p>That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-gone, the Teacher, said further:</p>
<div class="verse">
<pre>
<a name="spit" id="spit">I spit</a> on you, old age &mdash; 
old age that makes for ugliness.
The bodily image, so charming,
	is trampled by old age.
Even those who live to a hundred
are headed &mdash; all &mdash; to an end in death,
	which spares no one,
	which tramples all.
