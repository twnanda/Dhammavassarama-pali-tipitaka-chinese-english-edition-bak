<div class="sutta">
<p>"Monks, <a name="fish" id="fish"></a>just as if a fisherman were to cast a baited hook into a deep lake and a fish with its eye out for food would swallow it &mdash; so that the fish that had thus swallowed the fisherman's hook would fall into misfortune &amp; disaster, and the fisherman could do with it as he will &mdash; in the same way, there are these six hooks in the world for the misfortune of beings, for the slaughter of those that breathe. Which six?</p>
<p>"There are forms, monks, cognizable via the eye &mdash; agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing. If a monk relishes them, welcomes them, &amp; remains fastened to them, he is said to be a monk who has swallowed <a name="mara" id="mara"></a>Mara's hook, who has fallen into misfortune &amp; disaster. The Evil One can do with him as he will.</p>
<p>"There are sounds cognizable via the ear...</p>
<p>"There are aromas cognizable via the nose...</p>
<p>"There are flavors cognizable via the tongue...</p>
<p>"There are tactile sensations cognizable via the body...</p>
<p>"There are ideas cognizable via the intellect &mdash; agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing. If a monk relishes them, welcomes them, &amp; remains fastened to them, he is said to be a monk who has swallowed Mara's hook, who has fallen into misfortune &amp; disaster. The Evil One can do with him as he will.</p>
<p>"Now, there are forms cognizable via the eye &mdash; agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing. If a monk does not relish them, welcome them, or remain fastened to them, he is said to be a monk who has not swallowed Mara's hook, who has snapped the hook, who has broken the hook, who has not fallen into misfortune &amp; disaster. The Evil One cannot do with him as he will.</p>
