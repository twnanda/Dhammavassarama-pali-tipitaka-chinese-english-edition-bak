<div class="sutta">
<p>Then Vacchagotta the wanderer went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, "Master Gotama, a few days ago a large number of contemplatives, brahmans, and wanderers of various sects were sitting together in the Debating Hall when this conversation arose among them: 'This <a name="purana" id="purana"></a>Purana Kassapa &mdash; the leader of a community, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, honored and famous, esteemed as holy by the mass of people &mdash; describes a disciple who has died and passed on in terms of places of rebirth: "That one is reborn there; that one is reborn there." Even when the disciple is an ultimate person, a foremost person, attained to the foremost attainment, Purana Kassapa describes him, when he has died and passed on, in terms of places of rebirth: "That one is reborn there; that one is reborn there."</p>
<p>"'This <a name="makkhali" id="makkhali"></a>Makkhali Gosala... This <a name="nigantha" id="nigantha"></a>Nigantha Nataputta... This <a name="sanjaya" id="sanjaya"></a>Sa&ntilde;jaya Velatthaputta... This <a name="pakudha" id="pakudha"></a>Pakudha Kaccana... This <a name="ajita" id="ajita"></a>Ajita Kesakambala &mdash; the leader of a community, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, honored and famous, esteemed as holy by the mass of people &mdash; describes a disciple who has died and passed on in terms of places of rebirth: "That one is reborn there; that one is reborn there." Even when the disciple is an ultimate person, a foremost person, attained to the foremost attainment, Ajita Kesakambala describes him, when he has died and passed on, in terms of places of rebirth: "That one is reborn there; that one is reborn there."</p>
<p>"This contemplative Gotama &mdash; the leader of a community, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, honored and famous, esteemed as holy by the mass of people &mdash; describes a disciple who has died and passed on in terms of places of rebirth: "That one is reborn there; that one is reborn there." But when the disciple is an ultimate person, a foremost person, attained to the foremost attainment, the contemplative Gotama does not describe him, when he has died and passed on, in terms of places of rebirth: "That one is reborn there; that one is reborn there." Instead, he describes him thus: "He has cut through craving, severed the fetter, and by rightly breaking through conceit has made an end of suffering &amp; stress."'</p>
<p>"So I was simply befuddled. I was uncertain: How is the teaching of Gotama the contemplative to be understood?"</p>
<p>"Of course you are befuddled, Vaccha. Of course you are uncertain. When there is a reason for befuddlement in you, uncertainty arises. I designate the rebirth of one who has sustenance, Vaccha, and not of one without sustenance. <a name="fire" id="fire"></a>Just as a fire burns with sustenance and not without sustenance, even so I designate the rebirth of one who has sustenance and not of one without sustenance."</p>
<p>"But, Master Gotama, at the moment a flame is being swept on by the wind and goes a far distance, what do you designate as its sustenance then?"</p>
<p>"Vaccha, when a flame is being swept on by the wind and goes a far distance, I designate it as wind-sustained, for the wind is its sustenance at that time."</p>
<p>"And at the moment when a being sets this body aside and is not yet reborn in another body, what do you designate as its sustenance then?"</p>
<p>"Vaccha, when a being sets this body aside and is not yet reborn in another body, I designate it as craving-sustained, for craving is its sustenance at that time."</p>
