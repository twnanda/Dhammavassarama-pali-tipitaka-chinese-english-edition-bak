<div class="sutta">
<p>"Monks, when an uninstructed run-of-the-mill person makes the statement, 'There is a bottomless chasm in the ocean,' he is talking about something that doesn't exist, that can't be found. The word 'bottomless chasm' is actually a designation for painful bodily feeling.</p>
<p>"When an uninstructed run-of-the-mill person is touched by a painful bodily feeling, he sorrows, grieves, &amp; laments, beats his breast, becomes distraught. This is called an uninstructed run-of-the-mill person who has not risen up out of the bottomless chasm, who has not gained a foothold.</p>
<p>"When a well-instructed disciple of the noble ones is touched by a painful bodily feeling, he does not sorrow, grieve, or lament, does not beat his breast or become distraught. This is called a well-instructed disciple of the noble ones who has risen up out of the bottomless chasm, whose foothold is gained."</p>
<div class="verse">
<pre>
Whoever can't endure them
once they've arisen &mdash; 
	painful bodily feelings
	that could kill living beings &mdash; 
who trembles at their touch,
who cries &amp; wails,
a weakling with no resiliance:
	he hasn't risen up
	out of the bottomless chasm
	or even gained
	a foothold.

Whoever endures them
once they've arisen &mdash; 
	painful bodily feelings
	that could kill living beings &mdash; 
who doesn't tremble at their touch:
	he's risen up
	out of the bottomless chasm,
	his foothold is gained.
