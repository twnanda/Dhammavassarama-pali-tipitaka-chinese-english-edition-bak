<div class="sutta">
<p>I have heard that on one occasion a certain monk was dwelling among the <a name="kosala" id="kosala">Kosalans</a> in a forest thicket. Now at that time, after his meal, returning from his almsround, he went down to a lotus pond and sniffed a red lotus.</p>
<p>Then the devata inhabiting the forest thicket, feeling sympathy for the monk, desiring his benefit, desiring to bring him to his senses, approached him and addressed him with this verse:</p>
<div class="verse">
<pre>
You sniff this water-born flower
that hasn't been given to you.
This, dear sir, is a factor of stealing.
You             are a thief of a scent.
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[The monk:]</p>
<pre>
I don't take, don't damage.
I sniff at the lotus
	from far away.
So why do you call me
a thief of a scent?

One who
	digs up the stalks,
	damages flowers,
one of such ruthless behavior:
	why don't you say it of him?
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[The devata:]</p>
<pre>
A person ruthless &amp; grasping,
smeared like a nursing diaper:
to him
I have nothing to say.
	           It's you
	to whom I should speak.

To a person unblemished,
constantly searching for purity,
a hair-tip's worth of evil
	seems as large
	as a cloud.
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[The monk:]</p>
<pre>
Yes, yakkha, you understand me
and show me sympathy.
Warn me again, yakkha,
whenever again
you see something like this.
</pre>
<p class="spkr">[The devata:]</p>
<pre>
I don't depend on you
for my living
nor am I
your hired hand.
	       You, monk,
you yourself should know
how to go to the good destination.
</pre>
</div>
<p>The monk, chastened by the devata, came to his senses.</p>
