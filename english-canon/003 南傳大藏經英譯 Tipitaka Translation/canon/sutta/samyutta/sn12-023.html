<p>Dwelling at <a name="savatthi" id="savatthi">Savatthi</a>... "Monks, the ending of the effluents is for one who knows &amp; sees, I tell you, not for one who does not know &amp; does not see. For one who knows what &amp; sees what is there the ending of effluents? 'Such is form, such its origination, such its disappearance. Such is feeling, such its origination, such its disappearance. Such is perception, such its origination, such its disappearance. Such are fabrications, such their origination, such their disappearance. Such is consciousness, such its origination, such its disappearance.' The ending of the effluents is for one who knows in this way &amp; sees in this way.</p>
<p>"The knowledge of ending in the presence of ending has its prerequisite, I tell you. It is not without a prerequisite. And what is the prerequisite for the knowledge of ending? Release, it should be said. Release has its prerequisite, I tell you. It is not without a prerequisite. And what is its prerequisite? Dispassion... Disenchantment... Knowledge &amp; vision of things as they actually are present... Concentration... Pleasure... Serenity... Rapture... Joy... Conviction... Stress... Birth... Becoming... Clinging... Craving... Feeling... Contact... The <a name="media6" id="media6">six sense</a> media... Name-&amp;-form... Consciousness... Fabrications... Fabrications have their prerequisite, I tell you. They are not without a prerequisite. And what is their prerequisite? Ignorance, it should be said.</p>
<p>"Thus fabrications have ignorance as their prerequisite, consciousness has fabrications as its prerequisite, name-&amp;-form has consciousness as its prerequisite, the six sense media have name-&amp;-form as their prerequisite, contact has the six sense media as its prerequisite, feeling has contact as its prerequisite, craving has feeling as its prerequisite, clinging has craving as its prerequisite, becoming has clinging as its prerequisite, birth has becoming as its prerequisite, stress &amp; suffering have birth as their prerequisite, conviction has stress &amp; suffering as its prerequisite, joy has conviction as its prerequisite, rapture has joy as its prerequisite, serenity has rapture as its prerequisite, pleasure has serenity as its prerequisite, concentration has pleasure as its prerequisite, knowledge &amp; vision of things as they actually are present has concentration as its prerequisite, disenchantment has knowledge &amp; vision of things as they actually are present as its prerequisite, dispassion has disenchantment as its prerequisite, release has dispassion as its prerequisite, knowledge of ending has release as its prerequisite.</p>
<p>"<a name="rivers" id="rivers">Just as when</a> the gods pour rain in heavy drops &amp; crash thunder on the upper mountains: The water, flowing down along the slopes, fills the mountain clefts &amp; rifts &amp; gullies. When the mountain clefts &amp; rifts &amp; gullies are full, they fill the little ponds. When the little ponds are full, they fill the big lakes. When the big lakes are full, they fill the little rivers. When the little rivers are full, they fill the big rivers. When the big rivers are full, they fill the great ocean. In the same way:</p>
<p>"Fabrications have ignorance as their prerequisite, consciousness has fabrications as its prerequisite, name-&amp;-form has consciousness as their prerequisite, the six sense media have name-&amp;-form as their prerequisite, contact has the six sense media as its prerequisite, feeling has contact as its prerequisite, craving has feeling as its prerequisite, clinging has craving as its prerequisite, becoming has clinging as its prerequisite, birth has becoming as its prerequisite, stress &amp; suffering have birth as their prerequisite, conviction has stress &amp; suffering as its prerequisite, joy has conviction as its prerequisite, rapture has joy as its prerequisite, serenity has rapture as its prerequisite, pleasure has serenity as its prerequisite, concentration has pleasure as its prerequisite, knowledge &amp; vision of things as they actually are present has concentration as its prerequisite, disenchantment has knowledge &amp; vision of things as they actually are present as its prerequisite, dispassion has disenchantment as its prerequisite, release has dispassion as its prerequisite, knowledge of ending has release as its prerequisite."</p>
