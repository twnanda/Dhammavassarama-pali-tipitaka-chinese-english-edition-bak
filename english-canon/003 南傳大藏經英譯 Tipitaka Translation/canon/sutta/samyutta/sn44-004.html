<div class="sutta">
<p>On one occasion Ven. Sariputta and Ven. Maha Kotthita were staying near Varanasi in the Game Refuge at Isipatana. Then in the evening, Ven. Maha Kotthita emerged from his seclusion and went to Ven. Sariputta and exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to Ven. Sariputta, "Now then, friend Sariputta, does the Tathagata exist after death?"</p>
<p>"That, friend, has not been declared by the Blessed One: 'The Tathagata exists after death.'"</p>
<p>"Well then, friend Sariputta, does the Tathagata not exist after death?"</p>
<p>"Friend, that too has not been declared by the Blessed One: 'The Tathagata does not exist after death.'"</p>
<p>"Then does the Tathagata both exist and not exist after death?"</p>
<p>"That has not been declared by the Blessed One: 'The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death.'"</p>
<p>"Well then, does the Tathagata neither exist nor not exist after death?"</p>
<p>"That too has not been declared by the Blessed One: 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'"</p>
<p>"Now, friend Sariputta, when asked if the Tathagata exists after death, you say, 'That has not been declared by the Blessed One: "The Tathagata exists after death."' When asked if the Tathagata does not exist after death... both exists and does not exist after death... neither exists nor does not exist after death, you say, 'That too has not been declared by the Blessed One: "The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death."' Now, what is the cause, what is the reason, why that has not been declared by the Blessed One?"</p>
<p>"For one who does not know &amp; see form as it actually is present, who does not know &amp; see the origination of form... the cessation of form... the path of practice leading to the cessation of form, as it actually is present, there occurs the thought, 'The Tathagata exists after death' or 'The Tathagata does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'</p>
<p>"For one who does not know &amp; see feeling as it actually is present...</p>
<p>"For one who does not know &amp; see perception as it actually is present...</p>
<p>"For one who does not know &amp; see fabrications as they actually are present...</p>
<p>"For one who does not know &amp; see consciousness as it actually is present, who does not know &amp; see the origination of consciousness... the cessation of consciousness... the path of practice leading to the cessation of consciousness, as it actually is present, there occurs the thought, 'The Tathagata exists after death' or 'The Tathagata does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'</p>
<p>"But for one who knows &amp; sees form as it actually is present, who knows &amp; sees the origination of form... the cessation of form... the path of practice leading to the cessation of form, as it actually is present, the thought, 'The Tathagata exists after death' or 'The Tathagata does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death' doesn't occur.</p>
<p>"For one who knows &amp; sees feeling as it actually is present...</p>
<p>"For one who knows &amp; sees perception as it actually is present...</p>
<p>"For one who knows &amp; sees fabrications as they actually are present...</p>
<p>"For one who knows &amp; sees consciousness as it actually is present, who knows &amp; sees the origination of consciousness... the cessation of consciousness... the path of practice leading to the cessation of consciousness, as it actually is present, the thought, 'The Tathagata exists after death' or 'The Tathagata does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death' or 'The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death' doesn't occur.</p>
<p>"This is the cause, this is the reason, why that has not been declared by the Blessed One."</p>
