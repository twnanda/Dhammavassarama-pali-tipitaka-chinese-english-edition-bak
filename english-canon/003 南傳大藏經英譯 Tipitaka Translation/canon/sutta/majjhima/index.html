<p>The Majjhima Nikaya, or "Middle-length Discourses" of the Buddha, is the second of the five <i>nikayas,</i> or collections, in the <a href="../index.html">Sutta Pitaka</a> of the <a href="../index.html">Tipitaka</a>.</p>
<p>This nikaya consists of 152 discourses by the Buddha and his chief disciples, which together constitute a comprehensive body of teaching concerning all aspects of the Buddha's teachings.</p>
<p>An excellent modern translation of the complete Majjhima Nikaya is <i>The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha: A New Translation of the Majjhima Nikaya,</i> translated by Bhikkhu &Ntilde;anamoli and Bhikkhu Bodhi (Boston: <a href="../../../outsources/books.html#wisdom">Wisdom Publications</a>, 1995). The Introduction to that book contains an extraordinary synopsis of the Buddha's teachings in general, and of their expression in the Majjhima in particular. A fine anthology of selected suttas is <i>Handful of Leaves</i> (Vol. 1), by Thanissaro Bhikkhu (distributed by the <a href="../../../outsources/books.html#sati">Sati Center for Buddhist Studies</a>).</p>
<p>The sutta summaries appearing below that are marked <small>"[BB]"</small> were adapted from Bhikkhu Bodhi's summaries (in <i>The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha)</i> and are used with permission. Those marked <small>"[TB]"</small> were provided by Thanissaro Bhikkhu.</p>
<p>The translator appears in the square brackets []. The braces {} contain the volume and starting page number in the <a href="../../../outsources/books.html#pts">PTS</a> romanized Pali edition.</p>

<li><a href="mn-001-tb0.html" name="mn-001-tb0" id="mn-001-tb0">MN 1: Mulapariyaya Sutta &mdash; The Root Sequence</a> <small>{M i 1}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> In this difficult but important sutta the Buddha reviews in depth one of the most fundamental principles of Buddhist thought and practice: namely, that there is no thing &mdash; not even Nibbana itself &mdash; that can rightly be regarded as the source from which all phenomena and experience emerge.</li>

<li><a href="mn-002-tb0.html" name="mn-002-tb0" id="mn-002-tb0">MN 2: Sabbasava Sutta &mdash; All the Fermentations</a> <small>{M i 6}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> The Buddha teaches seven methods for eliminating from the mind the deeply rooted defilements (sensuality, becoming, views, and ignorance) that obstruct the realization of Awakening.</li>

<li><a href="mn-004-tb0.html" name="mn-004-tb0" id="mn-004-tb0">MN 4: Bhaya-bherava Sutta &mdash; Fear &amp; Terror</a> <small>{M i 16}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> What would it take to live in solitude in the wilderness, completely free of fear? The Buddha explains.</li>

<li><a href="mn-007-nt2.html" name="mn-007-nt2" id="mn-007-nt2">MN 7: Vatthupama Sutta &mdash; The Simile of the Cloth</a> <small>{M i 36}</small> <small>[Nyanaponika].</small> With a simple simile the Buddha illustrates the difference between a defiled mind and a pure mind. <small>[BB]</small></li>

<li><u>MN 10: Satipatthana Sutta &mdash; Frames of Reference/Foundations of Mindfulness</u> <small>{M i 55}</small> <a href="http://www.suttareadings.net/audio/index.html#mn-010" title="Listen to this sutta at SuttaReadings.net"> <img src="../../../icon/listen_16x16.gif" alt="SuttaReadings.net icon" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a>  <small>[<a href="mn-010-nt3.html" name="mn-010-nt3" id="mn-010-nt3">Nyanasatta</a> | <a href="mn-010-st0.html" name="mn-010-st0" id="mn-010-st0">Soma</a> | <a href="mn-010-tb0.html" name="mn-010-tb0" id="mn-010-tb0">Thanissaro</a>].</small> The Buddha's comprehensive practical instructions on the development of mindfulness as the basis for insight. [The text of this sutta is identical to that of the <a href="../digha/dn-22-tb0.html">Maha-satipatthana Sutta</a> (DN 22), except that the latter contains a more detailed exposition of the Four Noble Truths (sections 5a,b,c and d in part D of that version).]</li>

<li><a href="mn-011-nb0.html" name="mn-011-nb0" id="mn-011-nb0">MN 11: Cula-sihanada Sutta &mdash; The Shorter Discourse on the Lion's Roar</a> <small>{M i 63}</small> <small>[&Ntilde;anamoli/Bodhi].</small> The Buddha declares that only through practicing in accord with the Dhamma can Awakening be realized. His teaching is distinguished from those of other religions and philosophies through its unique rejection of all doctrines of self. <small>[BB]</small></li>

<li><a href="mn-012-nb0.html" name="mn-012-nb0" id="mn-012-nb0">MN 12: Maha-sihanada Sutta &mdash; The Great Discourse on the Lion's Roar</a> <small>{M i 68}</small> <small>[&Ntilde;anamoli/Bodhi].</small> The Buddha expounds the ten powers of a Tathagata, his four kinds of intrepidity, and other superior qualities which entitle him to "roar his lion's roar in the assemblies." <small>[BB]</small></li>

<li><a href="mn-013-tb0.html" name="mn-013-tb0" id="mn-013-tb0">MN 13: Maha-dukkhakkhandha Sutta &mdash; The Great Mass of Stress</a> <small>{M i 83}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> In deliciously graphic terms, the Buddha describes the allures and drawbacks of sensuality, physical form, and feeling. What better incentive could there be to escape samsara once and for all?</li>

<li><a href="mn-014-tb0.html" name="mn-014-tb0" id="mn-014-tb0">MN 14: Cula-dukkhakkhandha Sutta &mdash; The Lesser Mass of Stress</a> <small>{M i 91}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> What mental qualities must be abandoned in order to free oneself of greed, aversion, and delusion? Can painful austerities be used to purify oneself and burn away the karmic fruit of past misdeeds? Through skillful question-and-answer dialogues with the lay follower Mahanama and with a group of Jain ascetics, the Buddha lays these questions to rest.</li>

<li><a href="mn-018-tb0.html" name="mn-018-tb0" id="mn-018-tb0">MN 18: Madhupindika Sutta &mdash; The Ball of Honey</a> <small>{M i 108}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> A man looking to pick a fight asks the Buddha to explain his doctrine. The Buddha's answer mystifies not only the man, but also a number of monks. Ven. Maha Kaccana finally provides an explanation, and in the course of doing so explains what is needed to bring the psychological sources of conflict to an end.</li>

<li><a href="mn-019-tb0.html" name="mn-019-tb0" id="mn-019-tb0">MN 19: Dvedhavitakka Sutta &mdash; Two Sorts of Thinking</a> <small>{M i 114}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> The Buddha recounts the events leading up to his Awakening, and describes his discovery that thoughts connected with sensuality, ill-will, and harmfulness do not lead one to Awakening, while those connected with their opposites (renunciation, non ill-will, and harmlessnes) do.</li>

<li><a name="mn020" id="mn020">MN 20: <u>Vitakkasanthana Sutta &mdash; The Relaxation of Thoughts</u></a> <small>{M i 118}</small> <small>[<a href="mn-020-tb0.html" name="mn-020-tb0" id="mn-020-tb0">Thanissaro</a> | <a href="mn-020-st0.html" name="mn-020-st0" id="mn-020-st0">Soma</a>].</small> The Buddha offers five practical methods of responding wisely to unskillful thoughts (thoughts connected with desire, aversion, or delusion).</li>

<li><u>MN 21: Kakacupama Sutta &mdash; The Simile of the Saw</u> <small>{M i 122}</small> <small>[<a href="mn-021x-ab0.html" id="mn-021x-ab0" name="mn-021x-ab0">Buddharakkhita (excerpt)</a> | <a href="mn-021x-tb0.html" name="mn-021x-tb0" id="mn-021x-tb0">Thanissaro (excerpt)</a>].</small> The Buddha tells the story of a wise slave who deliberately tests her mistress's patience. The Buddha invokes several memorable similes here to illustrate the correct way to develop patience.</li>

<li><u>MN 22: Alagaddupama Sutta &mdash; The Snake Simile</u> <small>{M i 130}</small> <small>[<a href="mn-022-nypo.html" name="mn-022-nypo" id="mn-022-nypo">Nyanaponika</a> | <a href="mn-022-tb0.html" name="mn-022-tb0" id="mn-022-tb0">Thanissaro</a>].</small> Using two famous similes, the Buddha shows how the development of right view calls for the skillful application both of grasping and of letting-go. The sutta includes one of the Canon's most important expositions on the topic of not-self.</li>

<li><a href="mn-024-tb0.html" name="mn-024-tb0" id="mn-024-tb0">MN 24: Ratha-vinita Sutta &mdash; Relay Chariots</a> <small>{M i 145}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> Using the simile of a set of relay chariots, Ven. Punna Mantaniputta explains the relationship of the factors of the path to the goal of the holy life. <small>[TB]</small></li>

In this sutta the Buddha recounts the story of his own search and points out where a true and lasting happiness can be found.</li>

<li><a href="mn-027-tb0.html" name="mn-027-tb0" id="mn-027-tb0">MN 27: Cula-hatthipadopama Sutta &mdash; The Shorter Elephant Footprint Simile</a> <small>{M i 175}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> At what point do you know for sure that the Buddha's awakening was genuine? <small>[TB]</small></li>

<li><a href="mn-028-tb0.html" name="mn-028-tb0" id="mn-028-tb0">MN 28: Maha-hatthipadopama Sutta &mdash; The Great Elephant Footprint Simile</a> <small>{M i 184}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> An explanation of the four noble truths, focusing on the aggregate of physical form and showing (1) how all the aggregates are interrelated and (2) how all four noble truths, together with the principle of dependent co-arising, are related to the aggregates. <small>[TB]</small></li>

<li><a href="mn-033-tb0.html" name="mn-033-tb0" id="mn-033-tb0">MN 33: Maha-gopalaka Sutta &mdash; The Greater Cowherd Discourse</a> <small>{M i 220}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> Eleven factors that are conducive to spiritual growth, and eleven that are obstructive.

As presented here, the training begins with conscience and concern for the results of one's actions, and leads progressively onward through the cultivation of virtue, sense-restraint, moderation, wakefulness, mindfulness, alertness, the four jhanas, finally culminating in the realization of the insight knowledges.</li>

<li><a href="mn-041-nt0.html" name="mn-041-nt0" id="mn-041-nt0">MN 41: Saleyyaka Sutta &mdash; The Brahmans of Sala</a> <small>{M i 285}</small> <small>[&Ntilde;anamoli].</small> The Buddha explains to a group of brahman householders how one's present actions &mdash; by body, speech, and mind &mdash; determine one's future fortune.</li>

<li><a href="mn-054x-tb0.html" name="mn-054x-tb0" id="mn-054x-tb0">MN 54: Potaliya Sutta &mdash; To Potaliya</a> (excerpt) <small>{M i 359}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> Using seven graphic similes for the drawbacks of sensual passions, the Buddha teaches Potaliya the householder what it means, in the discipline of a noble one, to have entirely cut off one's worldly affairs. <small>[TB]</small></li>

<li><a href="mn-057-nt0.html" name="mn-057-nt0" id="mn-057-nt0">MN 57: Kukkuravatika Sutta &mdash; The Dog-duty Ascetic</a> <small>{M i 387}</small> <small>[&Ntilde;anamoli].</small> Act like a dog, and that's what you'll become. Choose your actions with care!</li>

<li><a href="mn-058-tb0.html" name="mn-058-tb0" id="mn-058-tb0">MN 58: Abhaya Sutta &mdash; To Prince Abhaya (On Right Speech)</a> <small>{M i 392}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> The Buddha explains the criteria for determining whether or not something is worth saying. This discourse is a beautiful example of the Buddha's skill as teacher: not only does he talk <i>about</i> right speech, but he also demonstrates right speech in action.</li>

<li>MN 59: Bahuvedaniya Sutta &mdash; The Many Kinds of Feeling <small>{M i 396}</small> <small>[<a href="mn-059-nt2.html" name="mn-059-nt2" id="mn-059-nt2">Nyanaponika</a> | <a href="mn-059-tb0.html" id="mn-059-tb0" name="mn-059-tb0">Thanissaro</a>].</small> The Buddha discusses the range of possible pleasures and joys, and concludes by advocating a pleasure that goes beyond feeling. <small>[The text of this sutta is almost identical to that of <a href="../samyutta/sn-36-019-nt2.html">SN XXXVI.19</a>.]</small></li>

<li><a href="mn-061-tb0.html" name="mn-061-tb0" id="mn-061-tb0">MN 61: Ambalatthika-rahulovada Sutta &mdash; Advice to Rahula at Mango Stone</a> <small>{M i 414}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> The Buddha admonishes his son, the novice Rahula, on the dangers of lying and stresses the importance of constant reflection on one's motives. (This is one of the suttas selected by King Asoka (r. 270-232 BCE) to be studied and reflected upon frequently by all practicing Buddhists. See <i><a href="../../../lib/authors/thanissaro/asoka.html">That the True Dhamma Might Last a Long Time: Readings Selected by King Asoka</a>,</i> by Thanissaro Bhikkhu.)</li>

Malunkyaputta threatens to disrobe unless the Buddha answers all his speculative metaphysical questions. Using the famous simile of a man shot by a poison arrow, the Buddha reminds him that some questions are simply not worth asking.</li>

<li><a href="mn-066-tb0.html" name="mn-066-tb0" id="mn-066-tb0">MN 66: Latukikopama Sutta &mdash; The Quail Simile</a> <small>{M i 447}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> Fetters are strong, not because of their own tensile strength, but because of the tenacity of our unwillingness to let them go. <small>[TB]</small></li>

Not only is conviction a prerequisite for listening to the Buddha's teachings with respect, but &mdash; as is shown by the unusual discussion here categorizing the types of noble disciples &mdash; it can underlie the practice all the way to the Deathless. <small>[TB]</small></li>

<li><a href="mn-072-tb0.html" name="mn-072-tb0" id="mn-072-tb0">MN 72: Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta &mdash; To Vacchagotta on Fire</a> <small>{M i 483}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> The Buddha explains to a wanderer why he does not hold any speculative views. Using the simile of an extinguished fire he illustrates the destiny of the liberated being. <small>[BB]</small> [For more on the use of fire imagery in early Buddhist texts, see the book <a href="../../../lib/authors/thanissaro/likefire/index.html">Mind Like Fire Unbound</a>.]</li>

<li><a href="mn-075x-tb0.html" name="mn-075x-tb0" id="mn-075x-tb0">MN 75: Magandiya Sutta &mdash; To Magandiya</a> (excerpt) <small>{M i 501}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> In this passage, the Buddha teaches a member of a hedonist sect about the nature of true pleasure and true health. <small>[TB]</small></li>

It requires first developing skillful habits and skillful resolves, and <i>then</i> letting them go. <small>[TB]</small></li>

<li><a href="mn-082-tb0.html" name="mn-082-tb0" id="mn-082-tb0">MN 82: Ratthapala Sutta &mdash; About Ratthapala</a> <small>{M ii 54}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> A two-part story about the monk who, the Buddha said, was foremost among his disciples in ordaining on the power of pure conviction. In the first part of the story, Ratthapala deals with his parents' opposition to his ordaining, and their attempts, after ordination, to lure him back to lay life. In the second part, he recalls the four observations about the world that inspired him, as a healthy and wealthy young man, to ordain in the first place.</li>

<li><a href="mn-086-tb0.html" name="mn-086-tb0" id="mn-086-tb0">MN 86: Angulimala Sutta &mdash; About Angulimala</a> <small>{M ii 97}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> A murderous bandit takes refuge in the Buddha, develops a heart of compassion, and becomes an arahant. <small>[TB]</small></li>

<li><a href="mn-087-tb0.html" name="mn-087-tb0" id="mn-087-tb0">MN 87: Piyajatika Sutta &mdash; From One Who Is Dear</a> <small>{M ii 106}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> King Pasenadi of Kosala figures prominently in many discourses as a devout follower of the Buddha. In this discourse we learn how &mdash; thanks to Queen Mallika's astuteness &mdash; the king first became favorably disposed toward the Buddha. <small>[TB]</small></li>

<li><a href="mn-090-tb0.html" name="mn-090-tb0" id="mn-090-tb0">MN 90: Kannakatthala Sutta &mdash; At Kannakatthala</a> <small>{M ii 125}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> A case study in how social advantages can be a spiritual liability. The discussion focuses on the factors needed for release &mdash; attainable by all people, regardless of caste or race &mdash; while the gently satirical frame story shows how the life of a king, or any highly placed person, presents obstacles to developing those factors. <small>[TB]</small></li>

<li><u><a name="mn095" id="mn095">MN 95: Canki Sutta &mdash; With Canki</a></u> (excerpt) <small>{M ii 164}</small> <small>[<a href="mn-095x-nt0.html" name="mn-095x-nt0" id="mn-095x-nt0">&Ntilde;anamoli</a> (excerpt) | <a href="mn-095x-tb0.html" name="mn-095x-tb0" id="mn-095x-tb0">Thanissaro</a> (excerpt)].</small> A pompous brahman teenager questions the Buddha about safeguarding, awakening to, and attaining the truth. In the course of his answer, the Buddha describes the criteria for choosing a reliable teacher and how best to learn from such a person. <small>[TB]</small></li>

<li><a href="mn-101-tb0.html" name="mn-101-tb0" id="mn-101-tb0">MN 101: Devadaha Sutta &mdash; To Devadaha</a> <small>{M ii 214}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> The Buddha refutes a Jain theory of kamma, which claims that one's present experience is determined solely by one's actions in past lives, and that the only way to undo the effects of past unskillful actions is to "burn them away" through severe practices of austerity. The Buddha here outlines one of his most important teachings on kamma: that it is both the results of past deeds and present actions that shape one's experience of the present. It is precisely this interaction of present and past that opens up the very possibility of Awakening.</li>

<li><a href="mn-105-tb0.html" name="mn-105-tb0" id="mn-105-tb0">MN 105: Sunakkhatta Sutta &mdash; To Sunakkhatta</a> <small>{M ii 252}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> The Buddha addresses the problem of meditators who overestimate their progress in meditation. The sutta ends with a warning: anyone who claims enlightenment as license for unrestrained behavior is like someone who fails to follow the doctor's orders after surgery, who knowingly drinks a cup of poison, or who deliberately extends a hand toward a deadly snake. <small>[TB]</small></li>

<li><a href="mn-106-tb0.html" name="mn-106-tb0" id="mn-106-tb0">MN 106: Ane&ntilde;ja-sappaya Sutta &mdash; Conducive to the Imperturbable</a> <small>{M ii 261}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> Advanced meditation instruction: how the fourth jhana and the formless attainments can be developed and used as a basis for the realization of Nibbana.</li>

<li><a href="mn-107-ih0.html" name="mn-107-ih0" id="mn-107-ih0">MN 107: Ganaka-Moggallana Sutta &mdash; The Discourse to Ganaka-Moggallana</a> <small>{M iii 1}</small> <small>[Horner].</small> The Buddha sets forth the gradual training of the Buddhist monk and describes himself as a "shower of the way." <small>[BB]</small></li>

<li><a href="mn-108-tb0.html" name="mn-108-tb0" id="mn-108-tb0">MN 108: Gopaka-Moggallana Sutta &mdash; Moggallana the Guardsman</a> <small>{M iii 7}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> Ven. Ananda explains how the Sangha maintains its unity and internal discipline after the passing away of the Buddha. <small>[BB]</small> Interestingly, this sutta also shows that early Buddhist practice had no room for many practices that developed in later Buddhist traditions, such as appointed lineage holders, elected ecclesiastical heads, or the use of mental defilements as a basis for concentration practice. <small>[TB]</small></li>

<li><a href="mn-109-tb0.html" name="mn-109-tb0" id="mn-109-tb0">MN 109: Maha-punnama Sutta &mdash; The Great Full-moon Night Discourse</a> <small>{M iii 15}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> A thorough discussion of issues related to the five aggregates. Toward the end of the discussion, a monk thinks that he has found a loophole in the teaching. The way the Buddha handles this incident shows the proper use of the teachings on the aggregates: not as a metaphysical theory, but as a tool for questioning clinging and so gaining release. <small>[TB]</small></li>

<li><a href="mn-110-tb0.html" name="mn-110-tb0" id="mn-110-tb0">MN 110: Cula-punnama Sutta &mdash; The Shorter Discourse on the Full-moon Night</a> <small>{M iii 20}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> How to recognize &mdash; and become &mdash; a person of integrity.</li>

<li><a href="mn-116-pt0.html" name="mn-116-pt0" id="mn-116-pt0">MN 116: Isigili Sutta &mdash; The Discourse at Isigili</a> <small>{M iii 68}</small> <small>[Piyadassi].</small> The Buddha enumerates the many paccekabuddhas who lived on Isigili mountain.</li>

<li><a href="mn-117-tb0.html" name="mn-117-tb0" id="mn-117-tb0">MN 117: Maha-cattarisaka Sutta &mdash; The Great Forty</a> <small>{M iii 71}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> On the nature of noble right concentration, and its interdependence with all the factors of the noble eightfold path.</li>

<li><a href="mn-118-tb0.html" name="mn-118-tb0" id="mn-118-tb0">MN 118: Anapanasati Sutta &mdash; Mindfulness of Breathing</a> <small>{M iii 78}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> One of the most important texts for beginning and veteran meditators alike, this sutta is the Buddha's roadmap to the entire course of meditation practice, using the vehicle of breath meditation. The simple practice of mindfulness of breathing leads the practitioner gradually through 16 successive phases of development, culminating in full Awakening.</li>

<li><a href="mn-119-tb0.html" name="mn-119-tb0" id="mn-119-tb0">MN 119: Kayagata-sati Sutta &mdash; Mindfulness Immersed in the Body</a> <small>{M iii 88}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> This sutta serves as a companion to the <a href="#mn-118-tb0">Anapanasati Sutta</a> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> and explains the importance of establishing a broad awareness of the body in meditation to develop jhana.</li>

<li><a href="mn121.html" name="mn121" id="mn121">MN 121: Cula-su&ntilde;&ntilde;ata Sutta &mdash; The Lesser Discourse on Emptiness</a> <small>{M iii 103}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> The Buddha instructs Ven. Ananda on the practice that leads to the "entry into emptiness," the doorway to liberation. <small>[TB]</small></li>

<li><a href="mn-122-tb0.html" name="mn-122-tb0" id="mn-122-tb0">MN 122: Maha-su&ntilde;&ntilde;ata Sutta &mdash; The Greater Discourse on Emptiness</a> <small>{M iii 109}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> The Buddha instructs Ananda on several practical aspects of the meditative dwelling in emptiness, a mode of awareness that can ultimately bring the meditator to the threshold of Awakening.</li>

<li><a href="mn125.html" name="mn125" id="mn125">MN 125: Dantabhumi Sutta &mdash; The Discourse on the "Tamed Stage"</a> <small>{M iii 128}</small> <small>[Horner].</small> By analogy with the taming of an elephant, the Buddha explains how he tames his disciples. <small>[BB]</small></li>

<li><a href="mn126.html" name="mn126" id="mn126">MN 126: Bhumija Sutta &mdash; To Bhumija</a> <small>{M iii 138}</small> <small>[Thanissaro].</small> Does the desire for Awakening get in the way of Awakening? According to this discourse, the question of desiring or not desiring is irrelevant as long as one develops the appropriate qualities that constitute the path to Awakening. The discourse is also very clear on the point that there are right and wrong paths of practice: as a geographer might say, not every river flows to the sea. <small>[TB]</small></li>

<li><u><a name="mn131" id="mn131">MN 131: </a>Bhaddekaratta Sutta &mdash; An Auspicious Day</u> <small>{M iii 187}</small> <a href="http://www.suttareadings.net/audio/index.html#mn-131" title="Listen to this sutta at SuttaReadings.net"> <img src="../../../icon/listen_16x16.gif" alt="SuttaReadings.net icon" width="16" height="16" border="0" /></a>   <small>[<a href="mn-131-bn0.html" name="mn-131-bn0" id="mn-131-bn0">&Ntilde;anananda</a> | <a href="mn-131-tb0.html" name="mn-131-tb0" id="mn-131-tb0">Thanissaro</a>].</small> In this stirring discourse the Buddha underscores the vital urgency of keeping one's attention firmly rooted in the present moment. After all, the past is gone, the future isn't here; this present moment is all we have.</li>
