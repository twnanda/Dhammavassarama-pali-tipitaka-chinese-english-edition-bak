<P>Then venerable &acirc;nanda approached the Auspicious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Auspicious One, he sat down on one side. While sitting on one side venerable &acirc;nanda said this to the Auspicious One:</P>
<P>&szlig;Reverend Sir, venerable Girim&agrave;nanda is afflicted, suffering, and very sick. Please, reverend Sir, may the Auspicious One approach venerable Girim&agrave;nanda, taking pity on him.&ucirc;</P>

Translator's note: Impermanance is one of the marks (lakkha&otilde;a) of existence, and the perception of impermanence meditatively may be called the root insight which leads to seeing the other two, namely, suffering (dukkha), and non-self (anatt&agrave;), as can be seen from the following exchange in Anattalakkha&otilde;asutta&uuml; (Sa&uuml; 22. 59), where, in regard to the five constituents of mind and body (the pa¤cakkhandha) the Buddha asks the monks: &szlig;Is form (etc) permanent or impermanent?&ucirc; &szlig;Impermanent, reverend Sir.&ucirc; &szlig;And that which is impermanent, is that suffering or pleasureable?&ucirc; &szlig;Suffering, reverend Sir.&ucirc; &szlig;Now that which is an impermanent, suffering, and changeable thing, is it proper to look upon that as: This is mine, this I am, this is my self?&ucirc; &szlig;Surely not, reverend Sir.&ucirc; Accordingly the commentary remarks that the perception of suffering is also implied in this opening contemplation (for the mark of non-self see the next perception). </FONT><A HREF="#T3"><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">Back to text</FONT></A></P>

The translation of anatta by non-self is rather unsatisfactory, but also hard to avoid, as there is a constant punning on the use of the word in the P&agrave;&euml;i. Originally atta is a reflexive pronoun meaning oneself, yourself, herself or himself, according to context. But it also came to be used to signify what in English we may call the soul or spirit, envisaged as a permanent, pleasureable, unchanging thing (cf. note 2 above). If it wasn't for the punning on these usages it might be better to render it as `the perception of insubstantiality' (and `the eye is insubstantial' etc.), as in whatever way we look at phenomena we find all is in a state of flux, and there is nothing abiding or substantial anywhere. </FONT><A HREF="#T4"><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">Back to text</FONT></A></P>

Under whatever name, the meditation is still traditionally given as the `first place for (meditational) action (kamma&ntilde;&ntilde;h&agrave;na) to those who are ordaining as novice monks in Buddhism, at the time they are having their hair shorn off.

The first five in the list are diseases affecting the sense-spheres, then follow various diseases, which I've tried to divide into some sort of order. These are followed by afflictions arising from an excess of one (or two) of the three humours into which Indian aetiology is divided, and ends with a fairly miscellaneous group. </P>
<P>It should be noted that this, and the previous meditation are not intended to be comprehensive, rather they are merely indicative. Similarly, it is not, of course, the exact nature of any of the diseases named here that is important, but the fact that the body is susceptible to diseases and afflictions of various kinds, and is therefore subject to many dangers. </FONT><A HREF="#T6"><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">Back to text</FONT></A></P>

That range of applications can usefully be summarised here. </P>
<P>First there are the famous verses from the Dhammapada beginning: `Sabbe sa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra anicc&agrave; - all processes are impermanent (Dhp 277ff.), where sa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra evidently means everything within phenomenal existence. In the Conditional Arising (Paticcasamupp&agrave;da) formula, however, the meaning of the word is restricted and rather specific, there we read: `Avijj&agrave;paccaya sa&iuml;kh&agrave;r&agrave;, sa&iuml;kh&agrave;rapaccaya vi¤¤&agrave;na&uuml;' - because of ignorance there are (volitional) processes, because there are (volitional) processes there is (rebirth) consciousness (Sa&uuml; 12. 1), where sa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra is virtually equivalent to cetan&agrave;, volition. Overlapping somewhat with this is the use of the term in the analysis of the constituents (of mind and body) (khandha) where sa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra is, in the discourses, again made equivalent to cetan&agrave; (see e.g. Sa&uuml; 22. 56). (Note that in the Abhidhamma it has been given a much broader definition to include the 50 mental processes not covered by the single factors of feeling, perception, and consciousness.) A further use of the word occurs in the following perception, mindfulness with breathing, which speaks of k&agrave;yasa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra &amp; cittasa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra, the bodily process &amp; the mental process. The former is said to be in and out-breathing, and the latter is defined as feeling and perception. The defintion of sa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra in this contemplation corresponds to the first of the definitions given above. </FONT><A HREF="#T12"><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">Back to text</FONT></A></P>
