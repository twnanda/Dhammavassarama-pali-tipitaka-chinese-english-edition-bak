<P ALIGN="CENTER">Introductory Verses</P>
</B><P>1 (976) <BR>
From the delightful city of the Kosalans to the Southern lands went one who wanted to have no possessions, a brahmin perfect in lore.</P>
<P>2 (977)<BR>
In the locality of Assaka, and near to M&aring;&euml;aka close to the bank of the Godh&agrave;vari he lived on gleanings and fruit.</P>
<P>3 (978)<BR>
In the vicinity (of the river) there was a large village, and with the income that arose from that he offered a great sacrifice.</P>
<P>4 (979)<BR>
When that great sacrifice had been given he entered his hermitage again, and when he had re-entered it, another brahmin came along -</P>
<P>5 (980)<BR>
he had sore feet, and was thirsty, with dirty teeth, and dust on his head - and after approaching (the first brahmin), he begged for five hundred (coins).</P>
<P>6 (981)<BR>
After seeing him B&agrave;vari invited him to take a seat, and he asked after his happiness and welfare, and this is the word he spoke:</P>
<P>7 (982)<BR>
&szlig;Whatever kind of gift I had, all that has been given away by me, please excuse me brahmin, I do not have the five hundred.&ucirc;</P>
<P>8 (983)<BR>
&szlig;If your honour will not give me what I am begging for, then within seven days may your head split into seven pieces!&ucirc;</P>
<P>9 (984)<BR>
Having made (a scene) the dishonest man proclaimed this fearful thing. After hearing this word of his, B&agrave;vari became miserable.</P>
<P>10 (985)<BR>
(Going) without food he dried up, and was affected by the dart of grief, and when his heart was like that his mind did not delight in meditation.</P>
<P>11 (986)<BR>
Having seen him terrified and miserable, a god who desired his welfare, approached B&agrave;vari, and this is the word he spoke:</P>
<P>12 (987)<BR>
&szlig;He does not know the head - he is a dishonest man who wants wealth! He does not have knowledge about the head or head-splitting.&ucirc;</P>
<P>13 (988)<BR>
&szlig;But now your honour knows! Please explain this to me when asked: the head and head-splitting, may we hear that word of yours.&ucirc;</P>
<P>14 (989)<BR>
&szlig;I also do not know about this, I do not have this knowledge here. The head and head-splitting! Indeed only Victors see this!&ucirc;</P>
<P>15 (990) <BR>
&szlig;Then who knows about the head and head-splitting on the face of the earth? O god, please explain this to me.&ucirc;</P>
<P>16 (991)<BR>
&szlig;From out of the city of Kapilavatthu a world leader has renounced, he is of king Okk&agrave;ka's line, a Sakyan's son, a light-maker.</P>
<P>17 (992)<BR>
He is a Sambuddha, brahmin, in everything he is perfect, having attained all deep knowledges and strengths, endowed with Vision regarding all things, he has come to the end of all actions, in the end of all cleaving he is freed.</P>
<P>18 (993)<BR>
He is the Buddha in the world, the Auspicious One, the Visionary who teaches Dhamma, after going there you can ask him about it, he will explain it to you.&ucirc;</P>
<P>19 (994)<BR>
Having heard the word `Sambuddha', B&agrave;vari became elated, then his grief became but little, and he received great happiness.</P>
<P>20 (995)<BR>
B&agrave;vari, uplifted and elated, enthusiastically asked that god: &szlig;In which village, or again in which town, in which country, is the lord of the world? Where having gone to can we revere the Sambuddha, the supreme human being?&ucirc;</P>
<P>21 (996)<BR>
&szlig;The Victor is in the Kosalan's city, S&agrave;vatthi, he has much wisdom, excellent and great intelligence, that Sakyan's son, who is free from burden and pollutant, that bull of a man has understanding of head-splitting.&ucirc;</P>
<P>22 (997)<BR>
So then the brahmin addressed his students, who were perfect in the lore: &szlig;Come, young men, and I shall explain, please listen to this word of mine:</P>
<P>23 (998)<BR>
He whose manifestation in the world is always exceptional, has now arisen in the world, renowned as one called a `Sambuddha'. Having gone quickly to S&agrave;vatthi, you can see the supreme human being.&ucirc;</P>
<P>24 (999)<BR>
&szlig;Having seen him how will we know that he is the `Buddha', O&nbsp;brahmin? You must tell us who do not know, how we can know it is him.&ucirc;</P>
<P>25 (1000)<BR>
&szlig;There has come down to us in the lore the marks of a Great Man, they are explained as thirty-two, complete in regular order.</P>
<P>26 (1001)<BR>
For whoever has on his limbs the marks of a Great Man, there can be just two destinies, for a third cannot be found:</P>
<P>27 (1002)<BR>
If he lives in a house, when he has been victorious over this earth, without a stick or a sword he will rule according to the Dhamma.</P>
<P>28 (1003)<BR>
But if he goes forth from the house to the houseless life, he becomes a cover-remover, a Sambuddha, a Worthy One, unexcelled.</P>
<P>29 (1004)<BR>
About my birth, family, and marks; lore, students and other things, about the head and head-splitting, you must ask in your mind.</P>
<P>30 (1005)<BR>
If he should be a Buddha, one who sees without obstruction, the questions that are asked in your mind he will answer by way of speech.&ucirc;</P>
<P>31 (1006)<BR>
After hearing B&agrave;vari's words, the sixteen brahmin students: Ajita, Tissa Metteyya, Pu&otilde;&otilde;aka, also Mettag&aring;,</P>
<P>32 (1007)<BR>
Dhotaka, and Upas&atilde;va, Nanda, and also Hemaka, the two: Todeyya and Kappa, and Jatuka&otilde;&otilde;&atilde;, the one who is wise,</P>
<P>33 (1008)<BR>
Bhadr&agrave;vudha and Udaya, and also the brahmin Pos&agrave;la, Moghar&agrave;ja, the intelligent one, and the great seer, Pingiya,</P>
<P>34 (1009)<BR>
each one with his own group, renowned throughout the whole world, meditators delighting in meditation, wise ones, influenced by their pre-dispositions,</P>
<P>35 (1010)<BR>
after worshipping B&agrave;vari, and circumambulating him, they all, wearing matted-hair and deer-skins, set out for the North:</P>
<P>36 (1011)<BR>
To Pati&ntilde;&ntilde;h&agrave;na of M&aring;&euml;aka first, then on to Mahissati, to Ujjeni, and Gonaddha, to Vedisa, and to the place called Vanasa,</P>
<P>37 (1012)<BR>
to Kosambi, and S&agrave;keta, and S&agrave;vathi, the city supreme, to Setabya, and Kapilavatthu, and to the city of Kusin&agrave;ra,</P>
<P>38 (1013)<BR>
to P&agrave;va, the Bhoga's fortified town, to Ves&agrave;li, and to the Magadhan city, and to the P&agrave;s&agrave;&otilde;aka shrine, delightful, it is the mind's delight.</P>
<P>39 (1014)<BR>
Just like a thirsty man to cool water, or like a trader to great gain, like one scorched by the heat to shade, quickly he climbed the mountain.</P>
<P>40 (1015)<BR>
Now at that time the Auspicious One was in front of the bhikkhu Sangha, teaching the Dhamma to the bhikkhus, roaring like a lion in a forest,</P>
<P>41 (1016)<BR>
Ajita saw the Sambuddha, brilliant like the hundred-rayed sun, like the moon which has reached fullness on the fifteenth day of the month,</P>
<P>42 (1017)<BR>
and after seeing on his limbs the characteristics in their fullness, standing cheerfully on one side he asked a question in his mind:</P>
<P>43 (1018)<BR>
&szlig;Speak and point out his birth, speak of his family, and marks, speak of his perfection in lore, how many does the brahmin school?&ucirc;</P>
<P>44 (1019)<BR>
&szlig;One hundred and twenty years his age, his family is B&agrave;vari, three marks are on his limbs, he is perfect in the three Vedas.</P>
<P>45 (1020)<BR>
In the marks, and the traditions, with the glossaries, and the ritual, he schools five hundred, in his own teaching he is perfect.&ucirc;</P>
<P>46 (1021)<BR>
&szlig;(Your) investigation of B&agrave;vari's marks, O one supreme among men, O craving-cutter, make that clear, so that we are not left doubting.&ucirc;</P>
<P>47 (1022)<BR>
&szlig;He can cover his face with his tongue, there is hair between his eyebrows, what is covered by a cloth is ensheathed: know it is so young man.&ucirc;</P>
<P>48 (1023)<BR>
Not hearing any question, but having heard the questions answered, all the people were enthusiastic, and raised their hands, thinking:</P>
<P>49 (1024)<BR>
&szlig;Now who was it, a god, or a Brahma, or Inda, the lord of Suj&agrave;, who asked those questions with the mind? To whom did he make reply?</P>
<P>50 (1025)<BR>
&szlig;About the head and head-splitting, B&agrave;vari asks (this question), please explain that O Auspicious One, please remove our doubts, O&nbsp;seer.&ucirc;</P>
<P>51 (1026)<BR>
"Know ignorance is called the head, and understanding is the head-splitter, joined with confidence, mindfulness, concentration, desire, and energy.&ucirc;</P>
<P>52 (1027)<BR>
Then with great enthusiasm, being resolute, the young man, having put his deer-skin on one shoulder, fell placing his head at (the Buddha's) feet:</P>
<P>53 (1028)<BR>
&szlig;The honourable brahmin B&agrave;vari, and his students, dear Sir, elated in heart, and happy in mind, worships your feet, O&nbsp;Visionary One.&ucirc;</P>
<P>54 (1029)<BR>
&szlig;May the brahmin B&agrave;vari, together with his students, be happy! And may you also be happy! May you live for a long time, young man!</P>
<P>55 (1030)<BR>
All of the doubts that B&agrave;vari, or you, or anyone else has, having received leave, ask whatever you long (to know) in the mind.&ucirc;</P>
<P>56 (1031)<BR>
Having received leave from the Sambuddha, sitting with hands raised in reverence, Ajita asked the Realised One the first question in that place:</P>

&szlig;By what is the world enveloped? </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" SIZE=2>said venerable Ajita, </I></FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">Why does it not become clear? What do you say is its defilement? What is (the world's) great fear?&ucirc;</P>
<P>58 (1033) 12<BR>
&szlig;The world is enveloped by ignorance, </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" SIZE=2>Ajita, said the Auspicious One, </I></FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">because of heedlessness and meanness it does not become clear.

<P>59 (1034) 13<BR>
&szlig;Streams are flowing everywhere, </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" SIZE=2>said venerable Ajita,</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"> what is the constraint for streams? Tell me the restraint for streams; by what are the streams shut off?&ucirc;</P>
<P>60 (1035) 14<BR>
&szlig;Whatever streams there are in the world, </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" SIZE=2>Ajita, said the Auspicious One, </I></FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">mindfulness is the constraint for them.

<P>62 (1037) 16<BR>
&szlig;This question that was asked, Ajita, I can answer it! As to where name-and-form ceases without remainder: with the cessation of consciousness, in this place it ceases.&ucirc;</P>
<P>63 (1038) 17<BR>
&szlig;Those who have discerned the Dhamma, and the many in training here, when I ask the prudent one, please tell me their conduct, dear Sir.&ucirc;</P>
