"Monks, <A NAME="3sagacity">there are these</A> three forms of sagacity. What three? Bodily sagacity, verbal sagacity, and mental sagacity.
<p>
"And what is bodily sagacity? There is the case where a monk abstains from taking life, abstains from theft, abstains from unchastity. This is called bodily sagacity.
<p>
"And what is verbal sagacity? There is the case where a monk abstains from lying, abstains from divisive tale-bearing, abstains from harsh language, abstains from idle chatter. This is called verbal sagacity.
<p>
"And what is mental sagacity? There is the case where a monk who -- with the wasting away of the mental effluents -- remains in the effluentless release of awareness and release of discernment, having known and made them manifest for himself right in the here and now. This is called mental sagacity.
<p>
"These, monks, are the three forms of sagacity."
<blockquote>
A sage in body, a sage in speech,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sage in mind, without effluent:<br>
A sage consummate in sagacity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is said to have abandoned<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; everything.
