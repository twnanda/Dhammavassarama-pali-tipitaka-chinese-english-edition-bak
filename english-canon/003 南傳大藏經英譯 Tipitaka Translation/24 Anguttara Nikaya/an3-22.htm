"<A NAME="3sick">There are these</A> three types of sick people to be found existing in the world. Which three?
<p>
"There is the case of the sick person who -- regardless of whether he does or does not receive amenable food, regardless of whether he does or does not receive amenable medicine, regardless of whether he does or does not receive proper nursing -- will not recover from that illness. There is the case of the sick person who -- regardless of whether he does or does not receive amenable food, regardless of whether he does or does not receive amenable medicine, regardless of whether he does or does not receive proper nursing -- will recover from that illness. There is the case of the sick person who will recover from that illness if he receives amenable food, amenable medicine, &amp; proper nursing, but not if he doesn't.
<p>
"Now, it is because of the sick person who will recover from that illness if he receives amenable food, amenable medicine, &amp; proper nursing -- but not if he doesn't -- that food for the sick has been allowed, medicine for the sick has been allowed, nursing for the sick has been allowed. And it is because there is this sort of sick person that the other sorts of sick persons are to be nursed as well [on the chance that they may actually turn out to need and benefit from such nursing].
<p>
"These are the three types of sick people to be found existing in the world.
<p>
"In the same way, <A NAME="3people">these three types</A> of people, like the three types of sick people, are to be found existing in the world. Which three?
<p>
"There is the case of the person who -- regardless of whether he does or doesn't get to see the Tathagata, regardless of whether he does or doesn't get to hear the Dhamma &amp; Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata -- will not alight on the lawfulness, the rightness of skillful mental qualities. There is the case of the person who -- regardless of whether he does or doesn't get to see the Tathagata, regardless of whether he does or doesn't get to hear the Dhamma &amp; Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata -- will alight on the lawfulness, the rightness of skillful mental qualities. There is the case of the person who will alight on the lawfulness, the rightness of skillful mental qualities if he gets to see the Tathagata and gets to hear the Dhamma &amp; Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata, but not if he doesn't.
<p>
"Now, it is because of the person who will alight on the lawfulness, the rightness of skillful mental qualities if he gets to see the Tathagata and gets to hear the Dhamma &amp; Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata -- but not if he doesn't -- that the teaching of the Dhamma has been allowed. And it is because there is this sort of person that the other sorts of persons are to be taught the Dhamma as well [on the chance that they may actually turn out to need and benefit from the teaching].
<p>
"These are the three types of people, like the three types of sick people, to be found existing in the world."
