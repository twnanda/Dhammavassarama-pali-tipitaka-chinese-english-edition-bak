"Monks, I know not of any other single thing so intractable as the untamed mind. The untamed mind is indeed a thing untractable.
<p>
"Monks, I know not of any other thing so tractable as the tamed mind. The tamed mind is indeed a thing tractable.
<p>
"Monks, I know not of any other single thing so conducive to great loss as the untamed mind. The untamed mind indeed conduces to great loss.
<p>
"Monks, I know not of any other single thing so conducive to great profit as the tamed mind. The tamed mind indeed conduces to great profit.
<p>
"Monks, I know not of any other single thing that brings such woe as the mind that is untamed, uncontrolled, unguarded and unrestrained. Such a mind indeed brings great woe.
<p>
"Monks, I know not of any other single thing that brings such bliss as the mind that is tamed, controlled, guarded and restrained. Such a mind indeed brings great bliss."
