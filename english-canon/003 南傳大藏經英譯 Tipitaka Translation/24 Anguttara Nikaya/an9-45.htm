[<a name="udayin">Udayin</a>:] "'Released both ways, released both ways,' it is said. To what extent is one described by the Blessed One as released both ways?"
<p>
[<a name="ananda">Ananda</a>:] "There is the case, my friend, where a monk, withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful qualities, enters &amp; remains in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. He remains touching with his body in whatever way there is an opening there, and he knows it through discernment. It is to this extent that one is described in a sequential way by the Blessed One as released both ways.
<p>
"Furthermore, with the stilling of directed thought &amp; evaluation, he enters &amp; remains in the second jhana...the third jhana...the fourth jhana...the sphere of the infinitude of space...the sphere of the infinitude of consciousness...the sphere of nothingness...the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception. He remains touching with his body in whatever way there is an opening there, and he knows it through discernment. It is to this extent that one is described in a sequential way by the Blessed One as released both ways.
<p>
"Furthermore, with the complete transcending of the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception, he enters &amp; remains in the cessation of perception &amp; feeling. And as he sees with discernment, the mental fermentations go to their total end. He remains touching with his body in whatever way there is an opening there, and he knows it through discernment. It is to this extent that one is described in a non-sequential way by the Blessed One as released both ways."
