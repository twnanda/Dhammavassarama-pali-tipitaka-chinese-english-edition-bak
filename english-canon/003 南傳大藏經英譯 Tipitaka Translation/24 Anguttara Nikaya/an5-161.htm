<h3>Anguttara Nikaya V.161</h3>
<h1>Aghatapativinaya Sutta</h1>
<h1>Removing Annoyance</h1>
<!-- I got the Pali title from the IBRIC (BJT) edition (5.4.2.1); the English title is my translation, which adopts Nanamoli's "removing" (I'd have preferred "subdued"). {jtb 98.4.3} -->

<small>From <A HREF="../../lib/bps/wheels/index.htm#wheel007" tppabs="http://www.sacred-texts.com/lib/bps/wheels/index.htm#wheel007"><i>The Practice of Loving-kindness (Metta) (WH 7)</i></A>, by &Ntilde;anamoli Thera, (Kandy: Buddhist Publication Society, 1987).</small>
<hr>
"Bhikkhus, there are these five ways of removing annoyance, by which annoyance can be entirely removed by a bhikkhu when it arises in him. What are the five?
<p>
"Loving-kindness can be maintained in being towards a person with whom you are annoyed: this is how annoyance with him can be removed.
<p>
"Compassion can be maintained in being towards a person with whom you are annoyed; this too is how annoyance with him can be removed.
<p>
"Onlooking equanimity can be maintained in being towards a person with whom you are annoyed; this too is how annoyance with him can be removed.
<p>
"The forgetting and ignoring of a person with whom you are annoyed can be practiced; this too is how annoyance with him can be removed.
<p>
"Ownership of deeds in a person with whom you are annoyed can be concentrated upon thus: 'This good person is owner of his deeds, heir to his deeds, his deeds are the womb from which he is born, his deeds are his kin for whom he is responsible, his deeds are his refuge, he is heir to his deeds, be they good or bad.' This too is how annoyance with him can be removed.
<p>
"These are the five ways of removing annoyance, by which annoyance can be entirely removed in a bhikkhu when it arises in him."
