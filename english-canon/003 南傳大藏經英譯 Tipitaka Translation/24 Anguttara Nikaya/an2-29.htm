"These two qualities have a share in clear knowing. Which two? Tranquillity <i>(samatha)</i> &amp; insight <i>(vipassana).</i>
<p>
"When tranquillity is developed, what purpose does it serve? The mind is developed. And when the mind is developed, what purpose does it serve? Passion is abandoned.
<p>
"When insight is developed, what purpose does it serve? Discernment is developed. And when discernment is developed, what purpose does it serve? Ignorance is abandoned."
