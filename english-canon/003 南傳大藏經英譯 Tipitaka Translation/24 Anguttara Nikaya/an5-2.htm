<hr>
"Monks, there are these five strengths for one in training. Which five? Strength of conviction, strength of conscience, strength of concern, strength of persistence, &amp; strength of discernment.
<p>
"And what is strength of conviction? There is the case where a monk, a noble disciple, has conviction, is convinced of the Tathagata's Awakening: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy and rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge &amp; conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the world, unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed, the Teacher of divine &amp; human beings, awakened, blessed.' This, monks, is called the strength of conviction.
<p>
"And what is the strength of conscience? There is the case where a noble disciple feels shame at [the thought of engaging in] bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, mental misconduct. This is called the strength of conscience.
<p>
"And what is the strength of concern? There is the case where a noble disciple feels concern for [the suffering that results from] bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, mental misconduct. This is called the strength of concern.
<p>
"And what is the strength of persistence? There is the case where a monk, a noble disciple, keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and taking on skillful mental qualities. He is steadfast, solid in his effort, not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualities. This is called the strength of persistence.
<p>
"And what is the strength of discernment? There is the case where a monk, a noble disciple, is discerning, endowed with discernment of arising &amp; passing away -- noble, penetrating, leading to the right ending of stress. This is called the strength of discernment.
<p>
"These, monks, are the five strengths of one in training. Thus you should train yourselves, 'We will be endowed with the strength of conviction that is the strength of one in training; with the strength of conscience...the strength of concern...the strength of persistence...the strength of discernment that is the strength of one in training.' That's how you should train yourselves."
