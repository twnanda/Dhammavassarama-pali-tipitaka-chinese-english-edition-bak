Then <A NAME="janussoni">Janussoni</A> the brahmin went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "I am of the view &amp; opinion that there is no one who, subject to death, is not afraid or in terror of death."
<p>
[The Blessed One said:] "Brahmin, there are those who, subject to death, are afraid &amp; in terror of death. And there are those who, subject to death, are not afraid or in terror of death.
<p>
"And who is the person who, subject to death, is afraid &amp; in terror of death? There is the case of the person who has not abandoned passion, desire, fondness, thirst, fever, &amp; craving for sensuality. Then he comes down with a serious disease. As he comes down with a serious disease, the thought occurs to him, 'O, those beloved sensual pleasures will be taken from me, and I will be taken from them!' He grieves &amp; is tormented, weeps, beats his breast, &amp; grows delirious. This is a person who, subject to death, is afraid &amp; in terror of death.
<p>
"Furthermore, there is the case of the person who has not abandoned passion, desire, fondness, thirst, fever, &amp; craving for the body. Then he comes down with a serious disease. As he comes down with a serious disease, the thought occurs to him, 'O, my beloved body will be taken from me, and I will be taken from my body!' He grieves &amp; is tormented, weeps, beats his breast, &amp; grows delirious. This, too, is a person who, subject to death, is afraid &amp; in terror of death.
<p>
"Furthermore, there is the case of the person who has not done what is good, has not done what is skillful, has not given protection to those in fear, and instead has done what is evil, savage, &amp; cruel. Then he comes down with a serious disease. As he comes down with a serious disease, the thought occurs to him, 'I have not done what is good, have not done what is skillful, have not given protection to those in fear, and instead have done what is evil, savage, and cruel. To the extent that there is a destination for those who have not done what is good, have not done what is skillful, have not given protection to those in fear, and instead have done what is evil, savage, &amp; cruel, that's where I'm headed after death.' He grieves &amp; is tormented, weeps, beats his breast, &amp; grows delirious. This, too, is a person who, subject to death, is afraid &amp; in terror of death.
<p>
"Furthermore, there is the case of the person in doubt &amp; perplexity, who has not arrived at certainty with regard to the True Dhamma. Then he comes down with a serious disease. As he comes down with a serious disease, the thought occurs to him, 'How doubtful &amp; perplexed I am! I have not arrived at any certainty with regard to the True Dhamma!' He grieves &amp; is tormented, weeps, beats his breast, &amp; grows delirious. This, too, is a person who, subject to death, is afraid &amp; in terror of death.
<p>
"These, brahmin, are four people who, subject to death, are afraid &amp; in terror of death.
<p>
"<A NAME="4ways">And who</A> is the person who, subject to death, is not afraid or in terror of death?
<p>
"There is the case of the person who has abandoned passion, desire, fondness, thirst, fever, and craving for sensuality. Then he comes down with a serious disease. As he comes down with a serious disease, the thought does not occur to him, 'O, those beloved sensual pleasures will be taken from me, and I will be taken from them!' He does not grieve, is not tormented; does not weep, beat his breast, or grow delirious. This is a person who, subject to death, is not afraid or in terror of death.

<p>
"These, brahmin, are four people who, subject to death, are not afraid or in terror of death."
<p>
[When this was said, Janussoni the brahmin said to the Blessed One:] "<A NAME="magnif">Magnificent</A>, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what had been overturned, were to reveal what was hidden, were to show the way to one who was lost, or were to hold up a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way Master Gotama has -- through many lines of reasoning -- made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of monks. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life."
