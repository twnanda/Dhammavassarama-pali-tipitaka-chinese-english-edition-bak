<P align=center>PARABHAVA-SUTTA.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus I heard: when Buddha was once residing at Jetavana, 
the vihâra of Anâthapi.n.dika, in the vicinity of the city of Sâvatthi, a 
certain deva possessed of pleasing appearance, approached Buddha, after the 
expiration of the first ten hours of the night (in the middle of the night), 
illuminating the whole Jetavana with his splendour, and having worshipped him, 
stood on one side of him (at a respectful distance) and spoke to him in this 
stanza:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Who is the person that declines (in prosperity)? Lord 
Buddha of the family of Gotama, we have come to you for the purpose of proposing 
the question: what is the cause that leads to the decline of prosperity?</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The person who advances in prosperity may be easily 
known, and so is the person who declines. He who delights (in the performance of 
the) ten meritorious acts<A name=page_226_fr_1></A><A 
href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/journals/ja/tbg.htm#page_226_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A> 
will attain to prosperity, while he that entertains an aversion thereto will 
decline in prosperity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We know that this is the first cause which leads men to 
decline in prosperity. O Bhagavâ! please declare the second cause which leads to 
that result.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. If any individual takes delight in wicked men and has an 
aversion towards the righteous, and delights in the doings of wicked men, that 
will be a cause to bring about his decline in prosperity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. We know that this is the second cause which leads to the 
decline of prosperity. O Bhagavâ! please declare the third cause. What is it 
that leads to the decline of prosperity?</P>
<P><!------------------------page 227------------------------><A 
name=page_227><FONT color=green size=1>p. 227</FONT></A> </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. If any individual should be habitually sleepy (whether 
sitting, walking, or standing, etc.), be addicted to company, be of malicious 
temper, or would not exert himself, that would operate as a cause towards the 
decline of his prosperity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. We know that this is the third cause which leads to the 
decline of prosperity. Please declare the fourth, O Bhagavâ! What is it that 
leads to that result?</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. If any individual should not support and maintain either 
of his parents in their old age, having it in his power to do so, that would 
cause the decline of his prosperity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We know that this is the fourth cause which leads to the 
decline of prosperity. O Bhagavâ! please declare the fifth. What is it that 
brings about that result?</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. If any individual utter a falsehood and thereby impose 
upon a Samana, a brâhman, or any other description of mendicants, that will 
operate as a cause towards a decline of his prosperity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. We know that this is the fifth cause which leads men to 
decline in prosperity. O Bhagavâ! please declare the sixth: what is it that 
brings about that result?</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. If any individual possessed of gold in abundance, 
plenty of kahapanas, and various kinds of viands, should himself alone enjoy his 
wealth, that would be a cause to the decline of his prosperity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. We know that this is the sixth cause which will lead 
men to decline in prosperity. O Bhagavâ! please declare the seventh: what is it 
that leads to that result?</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. If any individual disrespect his relations, actuated by 
too high an opinion of himself, founded on his superiority in birth, wealth, or 
family, it will operate as a cause towards a decline of his prosperity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. We know that this is the seventh cause which leads men 
to decline in prosperity. O Bhagavâ! please declare the eighth: what is it that 
tends to a decline of prosperity?</P>
<P><!------------------------page 228------------------------><A 
name=page_228><FONT color=green size=1>p. 228</FONT></A> </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. If any individual becomes a debauchee, a drunkard, or a 
gambler, and thereby entirely squanders away his earnings, that will be a cause 
to the decline of his prosperity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. We know that this is the eighth cause which leads to 
the decline of men' s prosperity. O Bhagavâ! please declare the ninth: what is 
it that brings about the decline of prosperity?</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. If a man not pleased with his wife be constantly seen 
in the company of prostitutes and among the wives of others, that is a cause 
which would lead to the decline of his prosperity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. We know that this is the ninth cause which leads to the 
decline of prosperity of men. O Bhagavâ! please declare the tenth: what is it 
that leads to that result?</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. If any old man take a young woman, with breasts like 
unto timba-fruits, for his wife, and break rest from motives of jealousy, that 
will operate as a cause towards the decline of his prosperity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. We know that this is the tenth cause which leads men to 
decline in prosperity. O Bhagavâ! please declare the eleventh: what is it that 
brings about that result?</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. Should any individual entrust the management of his 
affairs to a gluttonous and prodigal woman or man, or place him or her at the 
head of his household, that would be a cause to bring about the decline of his 
prosperity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. We know that this is the eleventh cause which leads men 
to decline in prosperity. O Bhagavâ! please declare the twelfth: what is it that 
leads to the said decline?</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24. If any individual is born of royal race, but is 
deficient in wealth and full of ambition, aspire to sovereignty here, that is a 
cause which will lead to a decline of his prosperity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25. Therefore the wise man who has seen well the causes 
which in this world lead to the decline of men's <!------------------------page 229------------------------><A 
name=page_229><FONT color=green size=1>p. 229</FONT></A> prosperity will lead 
such a life here as will entitle him to a birth in heaven.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center>METTA-SUTTA, OR DISCOURSE ON GENTLENESS.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus I heard: Buddha resided in the garden of 
Anâthapi.n.dika in Jetavana, near Sâvatthi. He then convoked his priests and 
said to them: There are eleven advantages, Priests, resulting from cultivating, 
meditating on, becoming accustomed to, led by, established in, following after, 
and acting according to a spirit of mildness and freedom from passion. These 
eleven are, that he who acts thus sleeps sound, awakes refreshed, has no evil 
dreams, is beloved of men, is beloved of demons, is preserved by the gods, 
neither fire, poison, nor sword can injure him, he has constant tranquillity, is 
of a pleasant aspect, will die in full possession of his intellectual powers, 
and hereafter will obtain an existence in the worlds of Brahma. These are the 
eleven advantages which result from cultivating, meditating on, being accustomed 
to, led by, established in, following after, and acting according to a spirit of 
mildness and freedom from passion.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Buddha had thus spoken, the priests were much 
edified.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center>METTÂNISAMSA-SUTTA, OR ADVANTAGES OF GENTLENESS.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. He who never violates friendly feelings<A 
name=page_229_fr_1></A><A 
href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/journals/ja/tbg.htm#page_229_note_1"><SUP><SMALL>1</SMALL></SUP></A>, 
whenever he journeys from his own residence shall obtain abundance of food, and 
become the means of supporting many others.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. He who never violates friendly feelings, whether he 
visits town, country, or province, he shall be everywhere treated with 
respect.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. He who never violates friendly feelings shall be 
unassailed <!------------------------page 230------------------------><A 
name=page_230><FONT color=green size=1>p. 230</FONT></A> by robbers, shall 
receive no dishonour from princes, and shall escape from every enemy.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. He who never violates friendly feelings shall return in 
tranquillity to his home, rejoice in the assemblies of the people, and be a 
chief among his kindred.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. He who never violates friendly feelings, exercising 
hospitality to others, shall be hospitably treated, honouring others he shall be 
honoured himself, and his praises and good name shall be spread abroad.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. He who never violates friendly feelings, presenting 
offerings to others, he himself shall receive offerings, saluting others he 
shall receive salutations, and shall attain to honour and renown.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. He who never violates friendly feelings shall shine as 
the fire, be resplendent as the gods, and never be deserted by prosperity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. He who never violates friendly feelings shall have 
fruitful cattle, abundant crops, and his children shall have prosperity.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. The man who never violates friendly feelings, should he 
fall from a precipice, from a mountain, or from a tree, when he falls he shall 
be sustained (so as to receive no injury).</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. The man who never violates friendly feelings shall 
never be overthrown by enemies, even as the nigrodha-tree, firmly fixed by its 
spreading roots, stands unmoved by the winds.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center>KARA.NÎYA-METTA-SUTTA.</P>
<P align=center>THE DISCOURSE NAMED KARA.NÎYA-METTA.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I declare the Protection (or Paritta) by the power of which 
the demons shall display not dreadful sights; by which he who is urgently 
occupied by day or night may sleep securely, and sleeping see nothing evil.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. These things must be attended to by the man wise <!------------------------page 231------------------------><A 
name=page_231><FONT color=green size=1>p. 231</FONT></A> in securing advantages 
who desires to ascertain the path to Nibbâna: Let him be skilful, upright, 
honest, mild in speech, gentle, free from arrogance.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Let him be cheerful, contented, unencumbered with 
business, with little property, having his passions under control, wise, 
temperate, not desirous of obtaining much from those who assist him.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Let him not engage in any law-pursuit for which he might 
be censured by the wise! May every being experience happiness, peace, and mental 
enjoyment!</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4-5. Whatever sentient being may exist, erratic or 
stationary, or or whatever kind, long, or tall, or middle-sized, or short, or 
stout, seen or unseen, near or remote, born or otherwise existing, may every 
being be happy!</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. In whatever place they may be, let no one deceive or 
dishonour another! Let there be no desire from wrath or malice to injure each 
other!</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. As a mother protects with her life the child of her 
bosom, so let immeasurable benevolence prevail among all beings!</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Let unbounded kindness and benevolence prevail 
throughout the universe, above, below, around, without partiality, anger or 
enmity!</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Let these dispositions be established in all who are 
awake, whether standing, walking, sitting or reclining, this place is thus 
constituted a holy residence.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. If the virtuous man who has not attained to perfection, 
yet perceives it, subdues his desire for sensual objects, certainly he shall not 
again be a lier in the womb<A name=page_231_fr_1></A><A
