<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
  1. Thus I heard: On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in the Eastern
  Park, the Palace of Migara's Mother. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">2. Then when it was evening, the venerable Ananda rose
  from retreat, and he went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down
  at one side. When he had done so, he said to the Blessed One: </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">3. 'Venerable sir, once the Blessed One was living in the
  Sakyan country. There is a town of the Sakyans called Nagaraka; there I heard and learnt
  this from the Blessed One's own lips: &quot;Now I abide much in the voiding, Ananda.&quot;
  Venerable sir, was this well heard by me, well apprehended, well attended to and well
  remembered?' 'Certainly, Ananda, that was well heard by you, well apprehended, well
  attended to and well remembered. As formerly, so now too, I abide much in the void
  abiding. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">4. 'Ananda, just as the Palace of Migara's Mother is void
  of elephants, cattle, horses and mares, void of gold and silver, void of the forgathering
  of women and men, and there is (present) only this non-voidness, that is to say, the
  single state (of non-voidness) dependent on (the presence of) the community of bhikkhus;
  so too, without giving attention to perception of village, without giving attention to
  perception of man, a bhikkhu gives attention to the single state (of non-voidness)
  dependent on (the presence of) perception of forest. His mind enters into that perception
  of forest and acquires confidence, steadiness and decision. He understands thus:
  &quot;Disturbances that would be present dependent on perception of village are not
  present here, disturbances that would be present on perception of man are not present
  here, and only this measure of disturbance is present, that is to say, the single state
  (of non-voidness) dependent on (the presence of) perception of forest.&quot; He
  understands: &quot;This field of perception is void of perception of village.&quot; He
  understands: &quot;This field of perception is void of perception of man.&quot;, (and he
  understands): &quot;There is (present) only this non-voidness, that is to say, the single
  state (of non-voidness) dependent on (the presence of) perception of forest.&quot; So he
  sees it as void of what is not there, but of what remains there he understands:
  &quot;There is that still present there.&quot; Now this has been for him an alighting upon
  voidness that accords with what actually is, without perversion of meaning and is pure. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">5. 'Again, Ananda, without giving attention to perception
  of man, without giving attention to perception of forest, a bhikkhu gives attention to the
  single state (of non-voidness) dependent on (the presence of) perception of earth. His
  mind enters into that perception of earth and acquires confidence, steadiness and
  decision. Just as though a bull's hide were freed from folds by stretching it with a
  hundred pegs, so too, without giving attention to all the ridges and hollows, the river
  ravines, the tracts of stumps and thorns, the rocky inequalities, on this earth, a bhikkhu
  gives attention to the single state (of non-voidness) dependent on (the presence of)
  perception of earth. His mind enters into the perception of earth and acquires confidence,
  steadiness and decision. He understands thus: &quot;Disturbances that would have been
  present dependent on perception of man are not present here, disturbances that would be
  present dependent on perception of forest are not present here, and only this measure of
  disturbance is present, that is to say, the single state (of non-voidness) dependent on

  of forest, without giving attention to perception of earth, a bhikkhu gives attention to
  the single state (on non-voidness) dependent on (the presence of) perception of the base
  consisting of infinite space. His mind enters into that perception of the base consisting
  of infinite space and acquires confidence, steadiness and decision. He understands thus:

    <p><em>The Buddha instructs Ven. Ananda on the practice that leads to the &quot;entry into
    emptiness,&quot; the doorway to liberation.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="center">-oOo-</p>
  <p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi in the
  Eastern Monastery, the palace of Migara's mother. Then in the evening, Ven. Ananda, coming
  out of seclusion, approached the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down, sat down
  to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One: &quot;On one occasion,
  when the Blessed One was staying among the Sakyans in a Sakyan town named Nagaraka, there
  -- face to face with the Blessed One -- I heard and learned this: 'I now often remain in
  an attitude of emptiness.' Did I hear that correctly, learn it correctly, attend to it
  correctly, remember it correctly?&quot; </p>
  <p>[The Buddha:] &quot;Yes, Ananda, you heard that correctly, learned it correctly,
  attended to it correctly, remembered it correctly. Now, as well as before, I often remain
  in an attitude of emptiness. Just as this palace of Migara's mother is empty of elephants,
  cattle and mares, empty of gold and silver, empty of assemblies of women and men, and
  there is only this non-emptiness -- the singleness based on the community of monks; even
  so, Ananda, a monk -- not attending to the perception (mental note) of village, not
  attending to the perception of human being -- attends to the singleness based on the
  perception of forest. His mind takes pleasure, finds satisfaction, settles, and indulges
  in its perception of forest. </p>
  <p>&quot;He discerns that 'Whatever disturbances that would exist based on the perception
  of village are not present. Whatever disturbances that would exist based on the perception
  of human being are not present. There is only this modicum of disturbance: the singleness
  based on the perception of forest.' He discerns that 'This mode of perception is empty of
  the perception of village. This mode of perception is empty of the perception of human
  being. There is only this non-emptiness: the singleness based on the perception of
  forest.' Thus he regards it as empty of whatever is not there. Whatever remains, he
  discerns as present: 'There is this.' And so this, his entry into emptiness, accords with
  actuality, is undistorted in meaning, and pure. </p>
  <h4><font color="#800080">(The Perception of Earth)</font></h4>
  <p>&quot;Further, Ananda, the monk -- not attending to the perception of human being, not
  attending to the perception of forest -- attends to the singleness based on the perception
  of earth. His mind takes pleasure, finds satisfaction, settles, and indulges in its
  perception of earth. Just as a bull's hide is stretched free from wrinkles with a hundred
  stakes, even so -- without attending to all the ridges and hollows, the river ravines, the
  tracts of stumps and thorns, the craggy irregularities of this earth -- he attends to the
  singleness based on the perception of earth. His mind takes pleasure, finds satisfaction,
  settles, and indulges in its perception of earth. </p>
  <p>&quot;He discerns that 'Whatever disturbances that would exist based on the perception
  of human being are not present. Whatever disturbances would exist based on the perception
  of forest are not present. There is only this modicum of disturbance: the singleness based
  on the perception of earth.' He discerns that 'This mode of perception is empty of the

  'There is this.' And so this, his entry into emptiness, accords with actuality, is
  undistorted in meaning, and pure. </p>
  <h4><font color="#800080">(The Infinitude of Space)</font></h4>
  <p>&quot;Further, Ananda, the monk -- not attending to the perception of forest, not
  attending to the perception of earth -- attends to the singleness based on the perception
  of the sphere of the infinitude of space. His mind takes pleasure, finds satisfaction,
  settles, and indulges in its perception of the sphere of the infinitude of space. </p>
  <p>&quot;He discerns that 'Whatever disturbances that would exist based on the perception
  of forest are not present. Whatever disturbances that would exist based on the perception
  of earth are not present. There is only this modicum of disturbance: the singleness based

  this, his entry into emptiness, accords with actuality, is undistorted in meaning, and
  pure. </p>
  <h4><font color="#800080">(The Infinitude of Consciousness)</font></h4>
  <p>&quot;Further, Ananda, the monk -- not attending to the perception of earth, not
  attending to the perception of the sphere of the infinitude of space -- attends to the
  singleness based on the perception of the sphere of the infinitude of consciousness. His
  mind takes pleasure, finds satisfaction, settles, and indulges in its perception of the
  sphere of the infinitude of consciousness. </p>
  <p>&quot;He discerns that 'Whatever disturbances that would exist based on the perception
  of earth are not present. Whatever disturbances that would exist based on the perception
  of the sphere of the infinitude of space are not present. There is only this modicum of
  disturbance: the singleness based on the perception of the sphere of the infinitude of

  earth. This mode of perception is empty of the perception of the sphere of the infinitude
  of space. There is only this non-emptiness: the singleness based on the perception of the
  sphere of the infinitude of consciousness.' Thus he regards it as empty of whatever is not
  there. Whatever remains, he discerns as present: 'There is this.' And so this, his entry
  into emptiness, accords with actuality, is undistorted in meaning, and pure. </p>
  <h4><font color="#800080">(Nothingness)</font></h4>
  <p>&quot;Further, Ananda, the monk -- not attending to the perception of the sphere of the
  infinitude of space, not attending to the perception of the sphere of the infinitude of
  consciousness -- attends to the singleness based on the perception of the sphere of
  nothingness. His mind takes pleasure, finds satisfaction, settles, and indulges in its
  perception of the sphere of nothingness. </p>
  <p>&quot;He discerns that 'Whatever disturbances that would exist based on the perception
  of the sphere of the infinitude of space are not present. Whatever disturbances that would
  exist based on the perception of the sphere of the infinitude of consciousness are not
  present. There is only this modicum of disturbance: the singleness based on the perception

  he regards it as empty of whatever is not there. Whatever remains, he discerns as present:
  'There is this.' And so this, his entry into emptiness, accords with actuality, is
  undistorted in meaning, and pure. </p>
  <h4><font color="#800080">(Neither Perception nor Non-Perception)</font></h4>
  <p>&quot;Further, Ananda, the monk -- not attending to the perception of the sphere of the
  infinitude of consciousness, not attending to the perception of the sphere of nothingness
  -- attends to the singleness based on the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception.
  His mind takes pleasure, finds satisfaction, settles, and indulges in the sphere of
  neither perception nor non-perception. </p>
  <p>&quot;He discerns that 'Whatever disturbances that would exist based on the perception
  of the sphere of the infinitude of consciousness are not present. Whatever disturbances
  that would exist based on the perception of the sphere of nothingness are not present.
  There is only this modicum of disturbance: the singleness based on the sphere of neither
  perception nor non-perception.' He discerns that 'This mode of perception is empty of the
  perception of the sphere of the infinitude of consciousness. This mode of perception is
  empty of the perception of the sphere of nothingness. There is only this non-emptiness:
  the singleness based on the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception.' Thus he
  regards it as empty of whatever is not there. Whatever remains, he discerns as present:
  'There is this.' And so this, his entry into emptiness, accords with actuality, is
  undistorted in meaning, and pure. </p>
  <h4><font color="#800080">(Theme-Less Concentration)</font></h4>
  <p>&quot;Further, Ananda, the monk -- not attending to the perception of the sphere of
  nothingness, not attending to the perception of the sphere of neither perception nor
  non-perception -- attends to the singleness based on the theme-less concentration of
  awareness. His mind takes pleasure, finds satisfaction, settles, and indulges in its
  theme-less concentration of awareness. </p>
  <p>&quot;He discerns that 'Whatever disturbances would exist based on the perception of
  the sphere of nothingness are not present. Whatever disturbances would exist based on the
  perception of the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception, are not present. And
  there is only this modicum of disturbance: that connected with the six sensory spheres,
  dependent on this very body with life as its condition.' He discerns that 'This mode of
  perception is empty of the perception of the sphere of nothingness. This mode of
  perception is empty of the perception of the sphere of neither perception nor
  non-perception. There is only this non-emptiness: that connected with the six sensory
  spheres, dependent on this very body with life as its condition.' Thus he regards it as
  empty of whatever is not there. Whatever remains, he discerns as present: 'There is this.'
  And so this, his entry into emptiness, accords with actuality, is undistorted in meaning,
  and pure. </p>
  <h4><font color="#800080">(Release)</font></h4>
  <p>&quot;Further, Ananda, the monk -- not attending to the perception of the sphere of
  nothingness, not attending to the perception of the sphere of neither perception nor
  non-perception -- attends to the singleness based on the theme-less concentration of
  awareness. His mind takes pleasure, finds satisfaction, settles, and indulges in its
  theme-less concentration of awareness. </p>
  <p>&quot;He discerns that 'This theme-less concentration of awareness is fabricated and
  mentally fashioned.' And he discerns that 'Whatever is fabricated and mentally fashioned
  is inconstant and subject to cessation.' For him -- thus knowing, thus seeing -- the mind
  is released from the effluent of sensuality, the effluent of becoming, the effluent of
  ignorance. With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.' He discerns that 'Birth is
  ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.' </p>
  <p>&quot;He discerns that 'Whatever disturbances would exist based on the effluent of
  sensuality...the effluent of becoming...the effluent of ignorance, are not present. And
  there is only this modicum of disturbance: that connected with the six sensory spheres,
  dependent on this very body with life as its condition.' He discerns that 'This mode of
  perception is empty of the effluent of sensuality...becoming...ignorance. And there is
  just this non-emptiness: that connected with the six sensory spheres, dependent on this
  very body with life as its condition.' Thus he regards it as empty of whatever is not
  there. Whatever remains, he discerns as present: 'There is this.' And so this, his entry
  into emptiness, accords with actuality, is undistorted in meaning, pure -- superior and
  unsurpassed. </p>
  <p>&quot;Ananda, whatever contemplatives and priests who in the past entered and remained
  in an emptiness that was pure, superior, and unsurpassed, they all entered and remained in
  this very same emptiness that is pure, superior, and unsurpassed. Whatever contemplatives
  and priests who in the future will enter and remain in an emptiness that will be pure,
  superior, and unsurpassed, they all will enter and remain in this very same emptiness that
  is pure, superior, and unsurpassed. Whatever contemplatives and priests who at present
  enter and remain in an emptiness that is pure, superior, and unsurpassed, they all enter
  and remain in this very same emptiness that is pure, superior, and unsurpassed. </p>
  <p>&quot;Therefore, Ananda, you should train yourselves: 'We will enter and remain in the
  emptiness that is pure, superior, and unsurpassed.'&quot; </p>
  <p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, Ven. Ananda delighted in the Blessed
  One's words. </p>
