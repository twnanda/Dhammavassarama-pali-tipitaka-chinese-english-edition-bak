<h4 class="ctr c"><b>Introduction<br />
to the<br />
Brahma-<i>G</i>âla Sutta</b></h4>.

<p>The phase of beliefs which this Suttanta is intended to meet, into which its argument fits, has been set out in some detail in the opening chapter of my 'American Lectures.' As there pointed out<sup>[<a name="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup>, the discussion which thus opens this series of dialogues forms also the first question in the <span class="mozp">Kath¤</span> Vatthu, and the first question in the Milinda. We cannot be far wrong if, in our endeavours to understand the real meaning of the original Buddhism, we attach as much weight to this question as did the author or authors of these ancient and authoritative Buddhist books.</p>

<p>The Suttanta sets out in sixty-two divisions <sup>[<a name="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup> various speculations or theories in which the theorisers, going out always from various forms of the ancient view of a 'soul'-a sort of subtle manikin inside the body but separate from it, and continuing, after it leaves the body, as a separate entity-attempt to reconstruct the past, or to arrange the future. All such speculation is condemned. And necessarily so, since the Buddhist philosophy is put together without this ancient idea of 'soul.'</p>

<p>The Buddhist scheme endeavours, in other words, to include all the truth which previous thinkers had grafted on to the old savage theories of a semi-material, subtle, permanent entity inside the body, while rejecting those theories themselves; it endeavours to retain all the philosophic truth which previous thinkers had grafted on to the theosophies-the corollaries of the soul theories-while rejecting those theosophies themselves. The reasons given for this position are threefold firstly, that such speculators about ultimate things, either in the past or the future, have insufficient evidence. see only one side of the shield;<sup>[<a name="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup> secondly, that such speculations do not lead to emancipation, to Arahatship;<sup>[<a name="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup> and thirdly, that such theories are really derived from the hopes, the feelings, and the sensations arising from evanescent phenomena<sup>[<a name="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup>-they belong, in other words, to the realm of hastily formed, empirical opinion <span class="mozp">(diÂÂhi)</span>, not to that of' the higher wisdom <span class="mozp">(pa¾¾¤)</span>. So that Buddhism, in the first place, holds a position somewhat similar to the modern Agnostic position. Secondly, while acknowledging the importance of feeling and of intellect, it lays special stress upon the regulation, the cultivation, of the Will<sup>[<a name="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup>. And thirdly, it distinguishes between a lower and a higher wisdom,<sup>[<a name="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup>.</p>

<p>Several scholars, and especially--with more knowledge and detail--Dr. Karl Neumann, have maintained that the position of Buddhism in the history of Indian philosophy is analogous to that of Schopenhauer in European philosophy. On the other hand, it is maintained by Professor Deussen that Schopenhauer's position is analogous to that of the Upanishads. The reconciliation will probably be found to be that what Buddhism took over, with more or less of modification, from the Upanishads, is about the same as that part of the Upanishad doctrine which is found, in European phraseology, in Schopenhauer; and what Buddhism rejected alto-ether is not to be found in Schopenhauer. He himself, who however knew both systems only from second-hand and inaccurate authorities, says, ' If I am to take the results of my own Philosophy as the standard of truth, I should be obliged to concede to Buddhism the pre-eminence over other (systems of philosophy).'</p>

<p>However this question may be decided--and its discussion, at the necessary length, by a competent student of philosophy, is a very pressing want--it is certain from the details given in our Suttanta that there were then current in Northern India many other philosophic and theosophic speculations besides those the priests found it expedient to adopt, and have preserved for us in the Upanishads. And who can doubt but that some, if not all of them, may also have had their influence on the new doctrine? There was always much philosophising in India outside the narrow and inexact limits of the so-called six Darsanas; and we have to thank Buddhist scholars for preserving, in their <span class="mozp">P¤li</span> and Sanskrit works, the evidences of such philosophy as the priests wished to exclude from notice<sup>[<a name="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup>.</p>

<p><b>I.</b> 1. T<span class="f2">HUS</span> H<span class="f2">AVE</span> I <span class="f2">HEARD</span>. The Blessed One was once going along the high road between <span class="mozp">R¤jagaha and N¤land¤</span><sup>[<a name="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup> with a great company of the brethren, with about five hundred brethren. And Suppiya the mendicant<sup>[<a name="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup> too was going along the high road between <span class="mozp">R¤jagaha and N¤land¤</span> with his disciple the youth Brahmadatta. Now just then Suppiya the mendicant was speaking in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, in dispraise of the Doctrine, in dispraise of the Order. But young Brahmadatta, his pupil, gave utterance, in many ways, to praise of the Buddha, to praise of the Doctrine, to praise of the Order. Thus. they two, teacher and pupil, holding opinions in direct contradiction one to the other, were following, step by step, after the Blessed One and the company of the brethren.</p>

<p>2. Now the Blessed One put up at the royal rest-house in the <span class="mozp">AmbalaÂÂhik¤.</span> pleasance<sup>[<a name="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup> to pass the night, and with him the company of the brethren. And so also did Suppiya the mendicant, and with him his young disciple Brahmadatta. And there, at the rest-house, these two carried on the same discussion as before.</p>

<p><b>[2]</b> 3. And in the early dawn a number of the brethren assembled, as they rose up, in the pavilion; and this was the trend of the talk that sprang up among them, as they were seated there. 'How wonderful a thing is it, brethren, and how strange that the Blessed One, he who knows and sees, the Arahat, the Buddha Supreme, should so clearly have perceived how various are the inclinations of men! For see how while Suppiya the mendicant speaks in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, the Doctrine, and the Order, his own disciple young Brahmadatta, speaks, in as many ways, in praise of them. So do these two, teacher and pupil, follow step by step after the Blessed One and the company of the brethren, giving utterance to views in direct contradiction one to the other.'</p>

<p>4. Now the Blessed One, on realising what was the drift of their talk, went to the pavilion, and took his seat on the mat spread out for him. And when he had sat down he said: 'What is the talk on which you are engaged sitting here, and what is the subject of the conversation between you?' And they told him all. And he said:</p>

<p>5. 'Brethren, if outsiders should speak against me, or against the Doctrine, <b>[3]</b> or against the Order, you should not on that account either bear malice, or suffer heart-burning, or feel ill will. If you, on that account, should be angry and hurt, that would stand in the way of your, own self-conquest. If, when others speak against us, you feel angry at that, and displeased, would you then be able to judge how far that speech of theirs is well said or ill?'</p>

<p>'That would not be so, Sir.'</p>

<p>'But when outsiders speak in dispraise of me, or of the Doctrine, or of the Order, you should unravel what is false and point it out as wrong, saying: "For this or that reason this is not the fact, that is not so, such a thing is not found among us, is not in us."</p>

<p>6. 'But also, brethren, if outsiders should speak in praise of me, in praise of the Doctrine, in praise of the Order, you should not, on that account, be filled with pleasure or gladness, or be lifted up in heart. Were you to be so that also would stand in the way of your self-conquest. When outsiders speak in praise of me, or of the Doctrine, or of the Order, you should acknowledge what is right to be the fact, saying: "For this or that reason this is the fact, that is so, such a thing is found among us, is in us."</p>

<p>7. 'It is in respect only of trifling things, of matters of little value, of mere morality, that an unconverted man, when praising the <span class="mozp"><span class="mozp">Tath¤gata</span>,</span> would speak. And what are such trifling, minor details of mere morality that he would praise.</p>

He has laid the cudgel and the sword aside, and ashamed of roughness, and full of mercy, he dwells compassionate and kind to all creatures that have life." It is thus that the unconverted man, when-speaking in praise of the <span class="mozp">Tath¤gata</span>, might speak<sup>[<a name="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup>.</p>

<p>'Or he might say: "Putting away the taking of what has not been given, Gotama the recluse lived aloof from grasping what is not his own. He takes only what is given, and expecting that gifts will come <sup>[<a name="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup>, he passes his life in honesty and purity of heart."</p>

<p>Or he might say: "Putting away unchastity, Gotama the recluse is chaste. He holds himself aloof, far off, from the vulgar practice, from the sexual act<sup>[<a name="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup>."</p>

<p>9. 'Or he might say: "Putting away lying words, Gotama the recluse holds himself aloof from falsehood. He speaks truth, from the truth he never swerves; faithful and trustworthy, he breaks not his word to the world."</p>

<p>'Or he might say: "Putting away slander, Gotama the recluse holds himself aloof from calumny. What he hears here he repeats not elsewhere to raise a quarrel against the people here; what he hears elsewhere he repeats not here to raise a quarrel against the people there. Thus does he live as a binder together of those who are divided, an encourager of those who are friends, a peacemaker, a lover of peace, impassioned for peace, a speaker of words that make for peace."</p>

<p>'Or he might say: "Putting- away rudeness of speech, Gotama the recluse holds himself aloof from harsh language. Whatsoever word is blameless, pleasant to the car, lovely, reaching to the heart, urbane<sup>[<a name="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup>, pleasing to the people, beloved of the people-such are words he speaks."</p>

<p>'Or he might say: "Putting away frivolous talk<sup>[<a name="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup>,Gotama the recluse holds himself aloof from vain conversation. In season he speaks, in accordance with the facts, words full of meaning, on religion, on the discipline of the Order. He speaks, and at the right time, words worthy to be laid up in one's heart, <b>[5]</b> fitly illustrated, clearly divided, to the point."</p>

<p>10. 'Or he might say: " Gotama the recluse holds himself aloof from causing injury to seeds or plants<sup>[<a name="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup>.</p>

<p>He takes but one meal a day, not eating at night, refraining from food after hours (after midday).</p>

<p>He refrains from being a spectator at shows at fairs, with nautch dances, singing, and music.</p>

<p>He abstains from wearing, adorning, or ornamenting himself with garlands, scents, and unguents.</p>

'In the first place, brethren, some recluse or Brahman by means of ardour, of exertion, of application, of earnestness, of careful thought, reaches up to such rapture of heart that, rapt in heart, he calls to mind his various dwelling-places in times gone by-in one birth, or in two, or three, or four, or five, or ten, or twenty, or thirty, or forty, or fifty, or a hundred, or a thousand, or in several hundreds or thousands or laks of births-to the effect that " There I had such and such a name, was of such and such a lineage<sup>[<a name="fn145" href="#n145">145</a>]</sup> and caste<sup>[<a name="fn146" href="#n146">146</a>]</sup>, lived on such and such food, experienced such and such pains and pleasures, had such and such a span of years.

And when I fell from thence I was reborn here." Thus does he recollect, in full detail both of condition and of custom, his various dwelling places in times zone by. <b>[14]</b> And he says to himself: " Eternal is the soul ; and the world, giving birth to nothing new, is stedfast as a mountain peak, as a pillar firmly fixed. and though these living creatures transmigrate and pass away, fall from one state of existence and spring up in another, yet they ale for ever and ever. And why must that be so? Because I, by means of ardour of exertion of application of earnestness of careful thought, can reach up to such rapture of heart that, rapt in heart, I can call to mind, and in full detail both of condition and of custom, my various dwelling-places in times gone by-by that is it that I know this-that the soul is eternal; and that the world, giving birth to nothing new, is stedfast as a mountain peak, as a pillar firmly fixed ; and that though these living creatures transmigrate and pass away, fall from one state of existence and spring up in another, yet they are for ever and ever."</p>

And having thus become a recluse he, by reason of ardour of exertion of application of earnestness of careful thought, reaches up to such rapture of heart that, rapt in heart, he calls to mind his last dwelling-place, but not the previous ones.

<p>'Just, brethren, as when a skilful fisherman or fisherlad should drag a tiny pool of water with a fine-meshed net he might fairly think: " Whatever fish of size may be in this pond, every one will be in this net; flounder about as they may, they will be included in it, and caught"-just so is it with these speculators about the past and the future, in this net, flounder. as they may, they are included and caught. <b>[46]</b></p>

<p>'Just, brethren, as when the stalk of a bunch of mangoes has been cut, all the mangoes that were hanging on that stalk go with it; just so, brethren, though the outward form of him who has won the truth stands before you, that which binds it to rebirth has been cut in twain. So long as his body shall last, so long do gods and men behold him. On the dissolution of the body, beyond the end of his life, neither gods nor men shall see him.'</p>

<p>'¤nanda, you may remember this exposition as the Net of Advantage, and as the Net of Truth, and as the Supreme Net, and as the Net of Theories; remember it even as the Glorious Victory in the day of battle!'</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup>Professor Cowell has been good enough to inform me that, in his opinion, the attempted restriction of all philosophy to the six Darsanas, and the very use of the term, is late mediaeval. The six are of course not mutually exclusive; and this, and the omissions in the classification of philosophy under these six heads, render it rather like a classification of animals into men, horses, birds, ghosts, beetles, and sparrows.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup></sup>The whole of this Sutta was translated into English by the Rev. Daniel Gogerly, Wesleyan missionary in Ceylon, in the journal of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society for 1846 (reprinted by P. Grimblot in his 'Sept Suttas Palis,' Paris, 1876).</p>

It was, says Buddhaghosa (pp. 41, 42), a well-watered and shady park so called from a mango sapling by the gateway. It was surrounded with a rampart, and had in it a rest-house adorned with paintings for the king's amusement.</p>

<p class="lgqt">There was another garden so named at <span class="mozp">Anur¤dhapura</span> in Ceylon, to the east of the Brazen Palace (Sum. 1, 13 1). This was so named, no doubt, after the other which was famous as the scene of the 'Exhortation to <span class="mozp">R¤hula</span> starting with falsehood,' mentioned in Asoka's Bhabra Edict (see my 'Buddhism,' pp. 224, 225).</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup>These titles occur, in the MSS., at the end of the sections of the tract that now follows. It forms a part of each of the Suttas in the first division, the first third, of this collection of Suttas. The division is called therefore the <span class="mozp">S¨la</span> Vagga or Section containing the <span class="mozp">S¨las.</span> The tract itself must almost certainly have existed as a separate work before the time when the discourses, in each of which it recurs, were first put together.</p>

<p class="lgqt">Certain paragraphs from this tract occur also elsewhere. So in Majjhima I, 179 we have the whole of the short paragraphs; in Majjhima, Nos. 76 and 77, and in <span class="mozp">Mah¤vagga</span> V, 8, 3, we have &sect; 17; in Majjhima II, 3 we have most of &sect; 18; and so on. The whole of this tract has been translated into English by Gogerly (in Grimblot, see page 1, note), into French by Burnouf (also in Grimblot, pp. 212 foll.), and into German by Dr. Neumann (in his Buddhistische Anthologie, pp. 67 foll.).</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup>This refrain is repeated at the end of each clause. When the <span class="mozp">S¨las</span> recur below, in each Sutta, the only difference is in the refrain. See, for instance, the translation of p. 100 in the text.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup>Neumann has 'waiting for a gift' which is a possible rendering: but <span class="mozp">p¤tikankhati</span> has not yet been found elsewhere in the sense of 'waiting for.' The usual meaning of the word expresses just such a trifling matter as we have been led, from the context, to expect.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">G¤ma-dhamm¤,</span> 'from the village habit, the practice of country folk the "pagan"' way.' One might render the phrase by 'pagan' if that word had not acquired, in English, a slightly different connotation. It is the opposite of <span class="mozp">por¨,</span> urbane (applied to speech, below, &sect;9). Neumann misses the point here, but has 'höflich' below.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Sam¤rambh¤</span> cannot mean 'planting' as Dr. Neumann renders it.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Kaµsa-k¬Âa.</span> The context suggests that <span class="mozp">kaµsa</span> (bronze) may here refer to coins, just as we say in English 'a copper,' and the word is actually so used in the 11th and 12th <span class="mozp">Bhikkhun¨</span> Nissaggiya Rules -- the oldest reference in Indian books to coins. The most ancient coins, which were of private (not state) coinage, were either of bronze or gold. Buddhaghosa (p.79) explains the expression here used as meaning the passing off of bronze vessels as gold. Gogerly translates 'weights,' Childers sub voce has 'counterfeit metal,' and Neumann has <span class="mozp">'M¤ss.'</span> Buddhaghosa is obliged to take <span class="mozp">kaµsa</span> in the meaning of 'gold pot,' which seems very forced ; and there is no authority for <span class="mozp">kaµsa</span> meaning either weight or mass. On the whole the coin explanation seems to me to be the simplest.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup>Buddhaghosa gives examples of each of these five classes of the vegetable. kingdom without explaining the terms. But it is only the fourth which is doubtful. It may mean 'graftings,' if the art of grafting was then known in the Ganges valley.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">£misa.</span> Buddhaghosa (p. 83) gives a long list of curry-stuffs included under this term. If he is right then Gogerly's 'raw grain' is too limited a translation, and Neumann's ' all sorts of articles to use' too extensive. In its secondary meaning the word means something. nice, a relish, a dainty.'</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Vis¬ka-dassanaµ.</span> This word has only been found elsewhere in the phrase <span class="mozp">diÂÂhi-vis¬kaµ,</span> 'the puppet shows of heresy' (Majjhima I, pp. 8, 486; and Serissaka <span class="mozp">Vim¤na</span> LXXXIV, 26). The Sinhalese renders it <span class="mozp">wipar¨ta-darsa¼a.</span></p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup>Dancing. cannot mean here a dancing in which the persons referred to took part. It must be ballet or nautch dancing.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup>Literally 'shows.' This word, only found here, has always been rendered 'theatrical representations.' Clough first translated it so in his Sinhalese Dictionary, p. 665, and he was followed by Gogerly, Burnouf, myself (in 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 192), and Dr. Neumann (p. 69),--and Weber (Indian Literature, pp. 199, 319) seems to approve this. But it is most unlikely that the theatre was already known in the fifth century B. C. And Buddhaghosa (p. 84) explains it, quite simply, as <span class="mozp">naÂa-samajj¤.</span> Now samajjo is a very interesting old word (at least in its <span class="mozp">P¤li</span> form). The Sanskrit, according to the Petersburg Dictionary, has only been found in modern dictionaries. The <span class="mozp">P¤li</span> occurs in other old texts such as Vinaya 11, 107 ; IV, 267 (both times in the very same context as it does here); ibid. II, 150; 1V, 85; <span class="mozp">Sig¤lov¤da</span> Sutta, p.300; and it is undoubtedly the same word as <span class="mozp">sam¤ja</span> in the first of the fourteen Edicts of Asoka. In the <span class="mozp">Sig¤lov¤da</span> there are said to be six dangers at such a samajjo; to wit, dancing, singing, music, recitations, conjuring tricks, and acrobatic shows. And in the Vinaya passages we learn that at a samajjo not only amusements but also food was provided; that high officials were invited, and had special seats; and that it took place at the top of a bill. This last detail of 'high places' (that is sacred places) points to a religious motive as underlying the whole procedure. The root ag (Gr. ago, whence our 'act') belongs to the stock of common Aryan roots, and means carrying on. What was the meaning of this 'carrying on together'? Who were the people who took part? Were they confined to one village? or have we here a survival from old exogamic communistic dancings together? Later the word means simply fair,' as at <span class="mozp">J¤taka</span> III, 541 :</p>

<p class="lgqt">'Many the bout 1 have played with quarterstaves at the fair,' with which <span class="mozp">J¤taka</span> I, 394 may be compared. And it is no doubt this side of the festival which is here in the mind of the author; but 'fair' is nevertheless a very inadequate rendering. The Sinhalese has rapid movement in dance-figures' <span class="mozp">(ranga-ma¼Àalu).</span></p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup>These ballad recitations in prose and verse combined were the source from which epic poetry was afterwards gradually developed. Buddhaghosa has no explanation of the word, but gives as examples the <span class="mozp">Bh¤rata</span> and the <span class="mozp">R¤m¤ya¼a.</span> The negative <span class="mozp">anakkh¤naµ</span> occurs Majjhima I, 503.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup>Buddhaghosa explains this as 'playing on cymbals'; and adds that it is also called <span class="mozp">p¤¼it¤²aµ.</span> The word is only found here and at <span class="mozp">J¤taka</span> V, 5o6, and means literally 'hand-sounds.'</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup>Buddhaghosa says 'deep music, but some say raising dead bodies to life by spells.' His own explanation is, I think, meant to be etymological; and to show that he derives the word from vi + <span class="mozp">t¤²a.</span> This would bring the word into connection with the Sanskrit <span class="mozp">vait¤²ika,</span> 'royal bard.' The other explanation connects the word with <span class="mozp">Vet¤la</span>, 'a demon,' supposed to play pranks (as in the stories of the <span class="mozp">Vet¤la-pa¾ca-viµsati</span>) by reanimating corpses. Dr. Neumann adopts it. But it does not agree so well with the context; and it seems scarcely justifiable to see, in this ancient list, a reference to beliefs which can only be traced in literature more than a thousand years later. Gogerly's rendering funeral ceremonies,' which I previously followed, seems to me now quite out of the question.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup>It is clear from <span class="mozp">J¤taka</span> V, 506 that this word means a sort of music. And at Vinaya IV, 285 <span class="mozp">kumbhath¬nik¤</span> are mentioned in connection with dancers, acrobats, and hired mourners. Buddhaghosa is here obscure and probably corrupt, and the derivation is quite uncertain. Gogerly's guess seems better than Burnouf's or Neumann's. The Sinhalese has 'striking a drum big enough to hold sixteen gallons.'</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup>Buddhaghosa seems to understand by this term (literally 'of Sobha city') the adornments or scenery used for a ballet-dance. (<span class="mozp">PaÂibh¤¼a-cittam</span> at Vinaya 11, 151; IV, 61, 298, 358; Sum. 1, 42 is the nude in art.) Weber has pointed out (Indische Studien, II, 38; III, 153) that Sobha is a city of the, fairies much given to music and love-making. It is quite likely that the name of a frequently used scene for a ballet because a proverbial phrase for all such scenery. But the Sinhalese has 'pouring water over the heads of dancers, or nude paintings.'</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup>Buddhaghosa takes these three words separately, and so do all the MSS. of the text, and the Sinhalese version. But 1 now think that the passage at <span class="mozp">J¤taka</span> IV, 390 is really decisive, and that we have here one of the rare cases where we can correct our MSS. against the authority of the old commentator. But 1 follow him in the general meaning he assigns to the strange expression <span class="mozp">'Ka¼À¤la-bamboo</span> washings.'</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n50" href="#fn50">50</a>]</sup>The following list recurs Vinaya I, 192 = 11, 163 = <span class="mozp">A¸guttara</span> 1, 181, &c.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n51" href="#fn51">51</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">£sand¨.</span> Buddhaghosa merely says 'a seat beyond the allowed measure,' but that must refer to height, as the only rule as to measure in seats is the 87th <span class="mozp">P¤cittiya</span> in which the height of beds or chairs is limited to eight 'great' inches (probably about eighteen inches). The Sinhalese Sanna adds 'a long chair for supporting the whole body.' At <span class="mozp">J¤t.</span> I, 208 a man lies down on an <span class="mozp">¤sand¨</span> so as to be able to-look up and watch the stars. At <span class="mozp">D¨gha</span> I, 55 = Majjhima 1,515 = Sa¸yutta 111, (where the reading must be corrected), the <span class="mozp">¤sand¨</span> is used as a bier. The <span class="mozp">¤sand¨</span> is selected as the right sort of seat for the king in both the <span class="mozp">V¤japeya</span> and Inauguration ceremonies because of its height (Eggeling, Sat.-<span class="mozp">Br¤h.</span> III, 35, 105). It is there said to be made of common sorts of wood, and perforated; which probably means that the frame was of wood and the seat was of interlaced cane or wickerwork. The diminutive <span class="mozp">¤sandiko,</span> with short legs and made square (for sitting, not lying on), is allowed in the Buddhist Order by Vinaya 11, 149. And even the <span class="mozp">¤sand¨</span> is allowed, if the tall legs be cut down, by Vinaya II, 169, 170 (where the reading <span class="mozp">chinditv¤</span> seems preferable, and is read in the quotation at Sum. 1, 88). The renderings ' large cushion' at ' Vinaya Texts,' II, 27 and 'stuffed couch' at 111, 209 must be accordingly corrected. Gogerly translates 'large couch,' Burnouf une chaise longue,' and Neumann bequeme Lehnstuhl.'</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n52" href="#fn52">52</a>]</sup>Pallanko. It is noteworthy that, in spite of the use of a divan with animals carved on its supports being here objected to, it is precisely the sort of seat on which the Buddha himself, or Buddhist personages of distinction, are often, in later sculptures, represented as sitting (Grunwedel, 'Buddhistische kunst,' pp. III, 124, 137; Mitra, 'Budh <span class="mozp">Gay¤,</span>' Plates XI, XX, &c. &c.). At <span class="mozp">Mah¤vaµsa</span> 25 <span class="mozp">s¨h¤sana</span> and pallanko are used of the same seat (Asoka's throne), and <span class="mozp">s¨h¤sana</span> is used of <span class="mozp">DuÂÂha</span> Gamini's throne, ibid. 157. But the Lion throne of Nissanka Malla, found at Pollonnaruwa, is not a pallanko, but an actual stone lion, larger than life size ('Indian Antiquary,' vol. 1, p. 135. Compare the similar seat in Grunwedel, p. 95).</p>

<p class="lgqt">By Vinaya 11, 170 the possession of a pallanka was allowed to the Order if the animal figures were broken off (the translation in 'Vinaya Texts,' III, 209, must be altered accordingly, reading <span class="mozp">v¤le</span> for vale, as at Vinaya IV, 312). By Vinaya II, 163 it is laid down that members of the Order were not to use a complete pallanko even in laymen's houses, so that Nigrodha's action in the passage just quoted (<span class="mozp">Mah¤vaµsa</span> 25) was really a breach of the regulations.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n53" href="#fn53">53</a>]</sup>The words from gonako down to <span class="mozp">kaÂÂhissaµ</span> inclusive, and also <span class="mozp">kuttakaµ,</span> are found only in this list, and Buddhaghosa seems to be uncertain as to the exact meaning of some of them. All except No. 7 might be used in laymen's houses ('Vinaya Texts,' III, 197), and all might be possessed by the Order i used only as floor coverings (ibid. 111, 209); except again No. 7, the cotton wool of which might be utilised for pillows. As there is a doubt about the spelling it may be noticed that the Sanna reads <span class="mozp">go¼akaµ</span> and <span class="mozp">uddalomiµ:</span> and the MS. in the R. A. S. (which repeats each sentence) has <span class="mozp">-gonakaµ</span> and <span class="mozp">uddalomiµ</span> both times.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n54" href="#fn54">54</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Samb¤hanaµ.</span> Perhaps rubbing the limbs with flat pieces of wood. See Buddhaghosa here and at 'Vinaya Texts,' III, 60.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n55" href="#fn55">55</a>]</sup>This is not quite accurate. Out of the twenty items here objected to, three (shampooing, bathing, and the use of sunshades) were allowed in the Order, and practised by Gotama himself. Bathrooms, and halls attached to them, are permitted by 'Vinaya Texts,' III, 189; shampooing by ibid. III, 68, 297. There are elaborate regulations for the provision of hot steam baths and the etiquette to be observed in them; and instances of the use of the ordinary bath in streams or rivers are frequent. The use of sunshades is permitted by 'Vinaya Texts,' 111, 13 2-3, and is referred to ibid. 111, 88, 274.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n56" href="#fn56">56</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Visikh¤-kath¤.</span> Buddhaghosa (p.90) takes this word (literally street-talk') in the sense of talk about streets, whether ill or well situate, and whether the inhabitants are bold or poor, &c.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n59" href="#fn59">59</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Lokakkh¤yik¤.</span> Buddhaghosa refers this specially to such speculations as are put forth according to the <span class="mozp">Lok¤tyata</span> system by the <span class="mozp">Vita¼Àas</span> (also called <span class="mozp">Lok¤yatikas</span>). These are materialistic theorisers, of whose system very little is, so far, known. See the note at 'Vinaya Texts, vol. iii, p. 151. 1 have collected other references to them in my ' Milinda,' vol. i, p.7 ; and to these <span class="mozp">D¨gha</span> I, 11 114,120, and Attha <span class="mozp">S¤lin¨,</span> p.3, may now be added.

Pamokkha occurs besides at Sa¸yutta I, 2, <span class="mozp">J¤taka</span> V, 30, 31, and <span class="mozp">Mah¤vaµsa</span> 158, but not in this connection.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n74" href="#fn74">74</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Nimittaµ,</span> literally 'marks,' or signs.' Buddhaghosa tells a story in illustration.

Compare Mil. 178, and the note to the last section on <span class="mozp">nemittik¤,</span> and the story at <span class="mozp">Mah¤vaµsa</span> 82.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n75" href="#fn75">75</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Upp¤do,</span> 'the portents of the great ones, thunderbolts falling, and so on,' says Buddhaghosa. The Great Ones here mean, 1 think, the spirits or gods presiding over the sun, moon, and planets (see the note on &sect; 26). The word corresponds to the Sanskrit Utp¤ta, though the d is vouched for by overwhelming authority. But this is only another instance of a change not infrequent (as Ed. Müller has shown, <span class="mozp">P¤li</span> Grammar, p. 37); and the one or two cases where Burmese scribes have (wrongly) corrected to <span class="mozp">upp¤ta</span> is another instance to be added to those referred to in the Introduction to Sum. 1 of their habit of putting an easier reading where the more difficult one is really right.

Buddhaghosa confines its meaning to that given above. This contradiction is another confirmation of the opinion expressed by me in 1880 in 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' pp. lxiii foll., that Childers was wrong in ascribing the <span class="mozp">J¤taka</span> Commentary to Buddhaghosa.

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n84" href="#fn84">84</a>]</sup>Anga-vijja. Buddhaghosa thus separates this from the <span class="mozp">a¸gaµ</span> of No. 1. In both the passages <span class="mozp">J¤t.</span> 11, 200, 250 the knowledge is simply that of judging from a man's appearance that he is rough or bad. and it is the good man in the story (in the second case the Bodisat himself) who is the <span class="mozp">anga-vijj¤-p¤Âhako.</span> So at <span class="mozp">J¤t.</span> V, 458 it is by <span class="mozp">anga-vijj¤</span> that the Bodisat prophesies that a man will be cruel.</p>

The craft is further explained by Buddhaghosa in his comment on the <span class="mozp">Mah¤-parinibb¤na</span> Sutta I, 26. Its success depended on the belief that the sites were haunted by spirits. See further below, &sect; 27.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n86" href="#fn86">86</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Khatta-vijj¤,.</span> The Burmese MSS. correct the rare khatta into the familiar khetta. <span class="mozp">Khetta-vijj¤</span> indeed occurs at Ud. III, 9, and may just possibly there (in connection with writing, arithmetic, tables, &c.) be correct in the meaning- of 'land-surveying, mensuration.' Buddhaghosa, though his explanation is corrupt, evidently understands the phrase in a sense similar to that of khatta-dhamma at <span class="mozp">J¤t.</span> V, 489, 490; Mil. 164 (see also 178); and his gloss <span class="mozp">n¨tisatthaµ</span> is probably nearer the mark than <span class="mozp">Sa¸kara's (on Ch¤nd.</span> Up. VII, 1, 2), which is dhanur-veda. It is the craft of government, then lying in great part in adhering to custom.</p>

<p class="lgqt">The Sutta only follows the Upanishad in looking at all these crafts as minor matters, but it goes beyond it in looking upon them as a 'low' way, for a Brahman, of gaining a livelihood.</p>

Prof. Kielhorn says (in a note he has been kind enough to send me on this section): What the author means by these words 1 do not know. But uppatha-gamana would be literally "aberration, the going away from one's proper path"; and patha-gamana therefore should be "following one's proper course." 1 am sure the two words could not mean conjunction and opposition; nor, I think, ascension and declension. It is curious that Buddhaghosa has not explained them.'</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n114" href="#fn114">114</a>]</sup>Burnouf takes these four words to refer to four occurrences. Gogerly and Neumann take them as only two. Buddhaghosa seems to imply four.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n115" href="#fn115">115</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Mudd¤.</span> There has been great diversity in the various guesses made at the meaning in this connection of <span class="mozp">mudd¤,</span> which usually means 'seal' or 'seal-ring.' Gogerly has 'conveyancing,' and so also Childers; Burnouf takes this word and the next as one compound in the sense of foretelling the future by calculating diagrams'; and Neumann has 'Verwaltungsdienste, 'administrative services. Buddhaghosa is very curt. He says only <span class="mozp">hattha-mudd¤ga¼an¤ Hatthamudd¤</span> is found elsewhere only at <span class="mozp">J¤t.</span> III, 528, where <span class="mozp">hattha-muddaµ karoti</span> means 'to beckon,' and at Vin. V, 163, where it is said of the polite member of the Order that he makes, no sign with his hand, nor beckons. (On <span class="mozp">hattha-vik¤ra</span> compare Mil. 1, 207, 547 = Vin. I,157 = Vin. II, 216.) Both these passages are much later than our text, and the sense of beckoning is here impossible. But <span class="mozp">mudd¤</span> is mentioned as a craft at Vin. IV, 7 (where it is called honourable), at M. I, 85, and several times in the Milinda (pp. 3, 59, 78, 178 of the <span class="mozp">P¤li</span> text), and muddiko as the person who practises that craft at D. I, 51 and Vin. IV, 8. The Sinhalese comment on this (quoted in my translation of the Milinda, 1, 91) shows that the art there was simply arithmetic, using the joints or knuckles of the fingers as an aid to memory. And this is no doubt the meaning in our paragraph.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n116" href="#fn116">116</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Ga¼an¤.</span> Buddhaghosa's comment on this is <span class="mozp">acchiddak¤-ga¼an¤,</span> in contradistinction to the last. It is evidently calculation not broken up by using, the fingers, mental arithmetic pure and simple. The accountant who uses this method is called <span class="mozp">ga¼ako</span> (D. I, 51 ; Vin. IV, 8). Buddhaghosa's comment on the latter passage is given by Minayeff at Pat. 84, but with a wrong reading, <span class="mozp">akkhiµÂaka.</span></p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n117" href="#fn117">117</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Saµkh¤naµ,</span> literally 'counting up.' He who has the faculty of doing this can, on looking at a tree, say how many leaves it has, says Buddhaghosa. But the first words of his comment are doubtful. He may perhaps mean calculating masses by means of the rosary. Burnouf skips this word, and Neumann has simply 'counting.'</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n118" href="#fn118">118</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">K¤veyyaµ.</span> The word recurs, in a bad sense, at A. 1, 72= III, 107, and also at S. I, 110 in the phrase <span class="mozp">k¤veyya-matto,</span> 'drunk with prophecy, inspired.' Buddhaghosa enumerates, in the words of A. II, 230, four kinds of poetry, and explains them in nearly the same words as found in the Manoratha <span class="mozp">P¬ran¨</span> on that passage. None of the four refer to sacrificial hymns. Impromptu rhyming, ballad singing, and the composition of poems are meant.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n119" href="#fn119">119</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Lok¤hyataµ.</span> Usually rendered 'materialism.' But it is quite clear that this meaning is impossible in this connection. See Milinda 174.</p>

Buddhaghosa explains it as astrology. The fact is all these expressions are technical terms for acts of astrology or sorcery, they none of them occur elsewhere either in <span class="mozp">P¤li</span> or Sanskrit, and the tradition preserved by Buddhaghosa may be at fault in those cases in which the use of the word had not survived to later times. The general sense may be sufficiently clear, but for absolute certainty of interpretation we must wait till examples are found in Indian books of the actual use of the words, not in mere lists, but in a connection which shows the meaning. Ath-v III, 30 is a charm to secure concord in a family, compare VII, 52 ; and there are several charms in the Athara-veda for success in gambling.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n126" href="#fn126">126</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Subhaga-karanaµ.</span> Many such charms are preserved in the Atharva-veda (for instance, X, 3:; 5; XVI, 4; 9)</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n127" href="#fn127">127</a>]</sup>It would be useless to seek in the Atharva-veda, which (with the one exception mentioned in the notes to the next section) gives only the charms which are supposed to bring benefits, for instances of these malevolent practices. But we have here direct evidence that black magic, as was indeed inevitable was as fully trusted in the sixth century B. C. in the valley of the Ganges as white. We need not be surprised that the malevolent charms are not recorded.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n128" href="#fn128">128</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Ad¤sa-pa¾ho.</span> Buddhaghosa says they made a god appear in the mirror and answer questions put. It is a later conception to discard the god, and make the mirror itself give pictures of the hidden events. The mirror is of metal (Par. Dip. 235).</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n132" href="#fn132">132</a>]</sup>Buddhaghosa explains the Great One as <span class="mozp">Mah¤ Brahma.</span> This seems to me very doubtful. It is at least odd to find Brahma introduced in this connection. We may grant that the Buddhists might have put sun-worship into a list of sorceries, but there was no ceremonial cult of Brahma and little or none of <span class="mozp">Brahm¤</span>. And however much the new gospel might hold the speculations of the dominant theosophy in contempt, that would scarcely explain their being ranked as privates in this regiment. Burnouf avoids this by rendering the phrase generally 'serving the great,' and Neumann has 'practising sorcery.' Neither of these guesses seems happy. Mahat in composition is elsewhere always <span class="mozp">mah¤ in P¤li,</span> and we possibly have here a sandhi for <span class="mozp">mahat¨-upaÂÂh¤nam,</span> in the sense of worship of the Great Mother, the Earth, with covert allusion to <span class="mozp">Mah¨.</span> This would give excellent sense, as the worship of the Mother Earth was closely associated in the popular mind with witchcraft. A god or goddess is certainly meant, and one so associated would be best in place here. It is perhaps worthy of note that in the oldest portion of the <span class="mozp">Taittir¨ya</span> Upanishad, Sun, Moon, Earth, and <span class="mozp">Sr¨</span> occur together in a set of mystic groups, and Sun, Moon, Brahma, and food are all identified by a word-play with Mahas (<span class="mozp">S¨kr¤-vall¨</span> 4-7).</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n141" href="#fn141">141</a>]</sup>The Buddhist view of Nos. 11-25 must not be mistaken. It is sufficiently clear from the numerous examples in the Vinaya (see especially 'Vinaya Texts,' II, pp. 4I-I44), and from the high praise accorded to <span class="mozp">J¨vaka</span> and other physicians, that the objection was to recluses and Brahmans practising medicine as a means of livelihood. They might do so gratis for themselves or for their coreligionists, and laymen might do so for gain.</p>

<p class="lgqt">The use of <span class="mozp">paÂimokkha</span> in No. 25 is curious. It is when, for instance, a purgative is first given and then a tonic to counteract the other, to set free from its effect. Compare <span class="mozp">J¤t.</span> V, 25.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n142" href="#fn142">142</a>]</sup>The corresponding Sanskrit terms occur at <span class="mozp">Divy¤vad¤na,</span> p. 492. No doubt the reading there ought to be nipu¼o.</p>

As in our colloquial expression a 'viewy man,' <span class="mozp">diÂÂhi</span> almost always, and <span class="mozp">anudiÂÂhi</span> in all the seven passages where it occurs, have a connotation of contempt-a mere view, an offhand ill-considered opinion, a delusion.

<p class="lgqt">The omission in the Dialogue of all reference to the Kesava Birth Story may be a sign of greater age or it may be due simply to the fact that it is not required for the argument there.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n155" href="#fn155">155</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">KhiÀÀa-padosik¤</span>. They are not mentioned elsewhere except in the list of gods in the <span class="mozp">Mah¤ Samaya</span> (p. 287).</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n156" href="#fn156">156</a>]</sup>Buddhaghosa on this has a curious note. The gods, though of great glory, are delicate in body. A man, having- gone without food - for seven days even, may restore his strength by the use of clear broth and so on. But the gods can't play tricks with themselves; and if they lose their heads and forget their meal-times, they die-pass away from that state. The poor gods! Whether this be really implied in the text or not, it is at least in harmony with the irony of the Buddha's talk.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n157" href="#fn157">157</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Mano-padosik¤.</span> Only found here and in the list in the Samaya Sutta. Even there it is almost certainly merely taken from this passage, so that it looks very much as if both these classes or titles of gods were simply invented, in irony, for the sake of the argument. Buddhaghosa identifies this class with the retinue of the four Great Kings-that is the regents of the four quarters.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n158" href="#fn158">158</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Upanijjh¤yanti,</span> from <span class="mozp">jh¤yati,</span> to burn. Elsewhere found only at Vin. 1, 193; II, 269; 111, 118, in all which passages it has the connotation of 'covet, lust after.' Buddhaghosa takes it here in the sense of envy, and tells a tale, too long to quote, to show the quarrelsome nature of these gods. In the sense of 'consider' (from <span class="mozp">jh¤yati,</span> to think) the word has only been found at S. N., p. 143. There may have been confusion between the two homonyms, so that ours got to mean to consider in such a way as to be excited, to burn.'</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n159" href="#fn159">159</a>]</sup>Buddhaghosa explains that these speculators perceive how the organs of sense break up (and sense impressions pass away); but they fail to see that the same thing holds even more strongly in the case of thoughts, since no sooner has each mental impression given rise to the succeeding one than it passes away. Not perceiving that, and depending on the analogy of birds, who fly away from one tree only to alight on another, they conclude that the mind, when this individuality is broken up, goes (as a unity) elsewhere.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n160" href="#fn160">160</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Ant¤nantik¤.</span></p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n161" href="#fn161">161</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">ParivaÂumo.</span> Only found here. Buddhaghosa says nothing.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n162" href="#fn162">162</a>]</sup>According to Buddhaghosa (Ats. 160) there are four things that are infinite-space, the number of world-systems, the number of living creatures, and the wisdom of a Buddha. Had this doctrine formed part of the original Buddhism we should expect to find these <span class="mozp">catt¤ri - anant¤ni</span> in the chapter on the 'Fours' in the <span class="mozp">A¸guttara,</span> but I do not find them there.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n163" href="#fn163">163</a>]</sup>Either in self-training or in the attainment of bliss in heaven' says Buddhaghosa (p.115).</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n164" href="#fn164">164</a>]</sup>Buddhaghosa gives examples of these five equivocations.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n165" href="#fn165">165</a>]</sup>Buddhaghosa explains that if, in his ignorance, he should, by chance, declare the good to be good, he will be puffed up by the approval of the wise. But if he should blunder, he will be filled with vexation and illwill when his error is pointed out. Either of these states of mind will be the fuel to keep the fire burning, the state technically called <span class="mozp">Up¤d¤na,</span> 'grasping.'</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n166" href="#fn166">166</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Samp¤yati.</span> See the note at 'Vinaya Texts,' III, 317, and compare M. I, 85, 96, 472.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n167" href="#fn167">167</a>]</sup>Such questions are called elsewhere the common basis of discussions among Brahmans.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n168" href="#fn168">168</a>]</sup>The word here used is <span class="mozp">Tath¤gata</span>, 'he who has gone, or perhaps come, to the truth.' See Chalmers in the J. R. A. S.' Jan., 1898, and compare S. III, 111, 116-118; M. I, I40, 171, 486; S. N. 467. The use of sammaggato (D. I, 55, &c.) and of gatatto (D. I, 57, &c.) shows that gata was used elliptically in the sense of gone to the furthest point aimed at' among the followers of the other sects that arose at the same time as Buddhism. The exact derivation and history of the word <span class="mozp">Tath¤gata</span> may be doubtful, but its meaning is, on the whole, clear enough.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n169" href="#fn169">169</a>]</sup>This is the identical answer put below (p. 57 of the text) into the mouth of <span class="mozp">Sa¾jaya BelaÂÂhaputta.</span></p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n170" href="#fn170">170</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Adhicca-samuppannik¤.</span> This adhicca (which must be distinguished from the other adhicca, derived from <span class="mozp">adh¨yati,</span> occurring at <span class="mozp">J¤t.</span> III, 218 = IV, 301) recurs at M. 1, 443, where it is opposed in the sense of 'occasional' to <span class="mozp">abhi¼ha</span> at M. I, 442 in the sense of 'habitual.' <span class="mozp">Ud¤na</span> VI, 5 throws light on its use here. It is there associated with words meaning neither self-originated, nor created by others.' It is explained by Buddhaghosa on our passage (Sum. I, 118) as 'springing up without a cause.' The derivation is doubtful.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n171" href="#fn171">171</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Asa¾¾a-satt¤.</span> They spring into being in this wise. Some one of the Brahman ascetics having practised continual meditation and arrived at the Fourth <span class="mozp">Jh¤na</span>, sees the disadvantage attached to thinking, and says to himself: 'It is by dwelling on it in thought that physical pain and all sorts of mental terrors arise. Have done with this thinking. An existence without it were better.' And dying in this belief he is reborn among the Unconscious Ones, who have form only, and neither sensations nor ideas nor predispositions nor consciousness. So long as the power of the <span class="mozp">Jh¤na</span> lasts, so long do they last. Then an idea occurs to them-the idea of rebirth in this world-and they straightway die.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n172" href="#fn172">172</a>]</sup>See 1, 1, 29 (p. 12 of the text).</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n173" href="#fn173">173</a>]</sup>Literally 'who are After-deathers, Conscious-maintainers.' These summary epithets are meant to be contemptuous, and the word chosen for death adds to the force of the phrase. It is not the usual word, but <span class="mozp">¤gh¤tana</span> (so read in the text), meaning literally 'shambles, place of execution.' The ordinary phrase would have been <span class="mozp">parammara¼ik¤.</span></p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n174" href="#fn174">174</a>]</sup>So the <span class="mozp">Aj¨vakas,</span> says Buddhaghosa.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n175" href="#fn175">175</a>]</sup>So the <span class="mozp">Niga¼Âhas,</span> says Buddhaghosa.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n176" href="#fn176">176</a>]</sup>&sect;&sect; 9-18 are discussed by James D'Alwis in 'Buddhist Nirvana,' p. 47. Comp. Jacobi, 'Jaina <span class="mozp">S¬tras</span>,' II, 236, 339.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n177" href="#fn177">177</a>]</sup>Sato sattassa. Insert the word sato in the text (as in &sect;&sect; 17,19, 41, 42). The <span class="mozp">KaÂha</span> Upanishad I, 20 alludes to such belief.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n178" href="#fn178">178</a>]</sup>Compare the 4th Vimokha. See Rh. D. 'Buddhist Suttas,' pp. 5 2, 213. The idea of resistance, <span class="mozp">paÂigha,</span> is here not ethical, but refers to the senses. Having no sense of reaction to touch, of opposition to muscular effort. it appears from M. I, 164 that this was pretty much the view put forth by Gotama's first teacher <span class="mozp">¤l¤ra K¤l¤ma.</span></p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n179" href="#fn179">179</a>]</sup>Compare the 5th Vimokha. This seems from M. I 165 to have been much the same as the view held by <span class="mozp">R¤ma,</span> whose son and pupil, Uddaka, was Gotama's second teacher.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n180" href="#fn180">180</a>]</sup>Compare the 6th Vimokha.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n181" href="#fn181">181</a>]</sup>Though it is not explicitly so stated, this last of these seven theorisers is no doubt to be considered as believing in all the sorts of soul held by the others, so that he believes in seven. One may compare the five souls each more subtle than the last, made respectively of anna, <span class="mozp">pr¤¼a,</span> manas, <span class="mozp">vij¾¤¼a,</span> and <span class="mozp">¤nanda</span> (food. breadth mind, consciousness, and joy), described in the <span class="mozp">Taittir¨ya</span> Upanishad II, 1-5. The Buddhist modification of these 'theories omits the souls, and treats instead of various states of mind (produced by stages of meditation), the attainment of which, during this life, leads to rebirth in corresponding worlds, or planes of existence, named after those stages. of meditations. But the oldest <span class="mozp">PiÂaka</span> texts say very little about it, and the history of Buddhist speculation on the matter has yet to be formulated.</p>

<p class="lgqt">Centuries afterwards we find a somewhat analogous conception in the gradually ascending series of seven, each more subtle than the last (<span class="mozp">Sth¬la-sar¨ra</span>, <span class="mozp">²i¸ga-sar¨ra</span>, indriya, manas, <span class="mozp">aha¸kara, buddhi, and ¤tman</span>), set out in the <span class="mozp">S¤¸khya</span> texts, and the later Vedanta has a similar series. There is sufficient truth in the idea of the series of seven set out in our text to explain the persistence of the general idea in all the Indian systems, but the details and the application are strikingly different.</p>

<p class="lgqt">The text shows that the four <span class="mozp">Ar¬pa Vimokhas</span> of the Buddhist theory were regarded by the early Buddhists as derived from closely allied speculations, older than Buddhism, and expressed in almost identical phraseology.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n182" href="#fn182">182</a>]</sup>Buddhaghosa here (Sum. 1, 121) explains <span class="mozp">Nirv¤¼a.</span> as the suppression of pain; pain, dukkha, being bodily, as opposed to domanassa, mental. 'In this visible world' means in whatever world the particular soul happens to be at the time. On <span class="mozp">parik¤reti</span> compare V. II, 290 <span class="mozp">r¤j¤ uyy¤ne paric¤resi,</span> 'the king indulged himself, enjoyed himself, in the garden.' All its functions' is added from the Commentary.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n183" href="#fn183">183</a>]</sup>The text shows that the four <span class="mozp">Jh¤na</span>s were regarded by the early Buddhists as older than Buddhism. The very words used are identical; the only modification introduced in Buddhism being the omission of the 'souls.' These four, Together. with the four <span class="mozp">Ar¬pa</span> Vimokhas (see note on &sect; 19), make up the Eight Attainments <span class="mozp">(Sam¤pattiyo),</span> often mentioned in the <span class="mozp">J¤taka</span> commentary as practised by pre Buddhistic recluses.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n184" href="#fn184">184</a>]</sup>On paritasita compare M. 1, 36 na asati paritassati, 'is not worried at what is not': paritasita, 'fidgetiness' or 'worry,' at M. 1, 136; S. III, 15-19; and Mil. 253, 400. On vipphandita, M. I, 8, 486; Dh. S. 381 (Asl. 253); <span class="mozp">J¤t.</span> IV, 495.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n185" href="#fn185">185</a>]</sup>In the text the first three of these four propositions are repeated of each of the eleven classes of theorisers. 'The fourth is put in the form which, to avoid repetition, I have adopted for all the four.</p>

<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a name="n186" href="#fn186">186</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Tath¤gata</span>, that is the speaker himself, the Buddha.</p>
