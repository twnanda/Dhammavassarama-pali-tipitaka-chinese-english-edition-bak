Hello.

This is a reformatted version of the first volume of the Pali Text Society Digha Nikaya. It has not had much time to get and incorporate feedback, so there may be errors. I believe internal links stay within the files in this download, but it's possible I may have missed one. The Links at the top of each page and those to the Webmaster's Statement etc., lead to on-line locations.

The index from the paper edition has not been included in this version, everything else is as close as an HTML version can come to the original.

Please let me know of any errors you find:  MikeOlds@buddhadust.org
