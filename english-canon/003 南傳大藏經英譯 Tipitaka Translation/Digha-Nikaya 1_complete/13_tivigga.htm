<h4 class="ctr c"><b>Introduction<br />
to the<br />
Tevijja Sutta</b></h4>.

<p>This is the only Suttanta, among the thirteen translated in this volume, in which the discourse does not lead up to Arahatship. It leads up only to the so-called Brahma <span class="mozp">Vih¤ras</span> -- the supreme conditions -- four states of mind held to result, after death, in a rebirth in the heavenly worlds of <span class="mozp">Brahm¤.</span> Why is it -- the Buddhist ideal being Arahatship, which leads to no rebirth at all -- that this lower ideal is thus suddenly introduced?</p>

<p>It would seem that the particular point here discussed was regarded as so important that it could scarcely be left out. And when we recollect that the highest teaching current before the Buddha, and still preserved in the pre-Buddhistic Upanishads, was precisely about union with <span class="mozp">Brahm¤</span>; we may, without much danger of error, explain the position occupied in the series of dialogues by this Suttanta by the supposition that it was deliberately inserted here as the Buddhist answer to the Upanishad theory. In this respect it is noteworthy that the neuter Brahman is quietly ignored. That is quite in accordance with the method of the Suttantas. The Buddha is in them often represented as using, in his own sense, words familiar to his interlocutors in a different sense. The neuter Brahman is, so far as I am aware, entirely unknown in the <span class="mozp">Nik¤yas,</span> and of course the Buddha's idea of <span class="mozp">Brahm¤,</span> in the masculine, really differs widely from that of the Upanishads.</p>

<p>There is nothing original in the Buddhist belief that a man's habit of mind at the time of his death would determine, save only in the one case of the Arahat, the nature of his rebirth. It is an Indian -- not an exclusively Buddhist theory. The Buddhist texts represent it as held by non-Buddhists, and already long before. the Buddha's time, and as accepted by all as a matter of course. And it is even not exclusively Indian. As I have pointed out elsewhere, it is ascribed by Plato to Socrates<sup>[<a name="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup>. The essentially Buddhist parts of the theory are three. In the first place, the choice of the particular details they held essential to such a habit of mind as would lead to rebirth in the <span class="mozp">Brahm¤</span>-worlds ; secondly, their doctrine that there was not really any 'soul' to be reborn ; and thirdly, that the highest ideal was not to be reborn at all (even only once, and into union with <span class="mozp">Brahm¤</span>).</p>

<p>The <span class="mozp">J¤taka</span> commentary in numerous passages states that the four Brahma <span class="mozp">vih¤ras</span> were practised, long before the time of the rise of Buddhism, by the sages of old. I have not found such a statement in the <span class="mozp">Nik¤yas;</span> and it is most probable therefore that the <span class="mozp">J¤taka</span> commentator is ante-dating the particular meditations in question. However this may be, they remained, throughout the long history of Buddhism, an essential part of Buddhist practice. They are even mentioned in the <span class="mozp">J¤taka M¤l¤,</span> a work usually supposed to be <span class="mozp">Mah¤y¤nist,</span> and dated about a thousand years later than the Buddha<sup>[<a name="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup>. They are well known to-day in Burma, Siam, and Ceylon. And it would be interesting to know whether they still form a part of the regulated meditations which are known to be practised by Buddhists in Thibet, China, and Japan. But they have not been found in any Indian book not a Buddhist work, and are therefore almost certainly exclusively Buddhist. Even the most determined anti-Buddhist must admit the beauty of the language (in spite of its repetitions &sect;&sect; 76-78), the subtle depth of the ideas, and the great value of the practice from the point of view of ethical self-training. He would probably rejoin, and with truth, that similar sentiments are met with in other (post-Buddhistic) Indian books. But it is one thing to give expression in isolated passages to such views, and quite another to have selected just these four as the four cornerstones of habitual endeavour.</p>

<p>It should be recollected that the argument here is only an argumettium ad hominem. If you want union with <span class="mozp">Brahm¤</span> -- which you had much better not want -- this is the way to attain to it<sup>[<a name="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup>.</p>


<h4 class="ctr c">XIII. Tevijja Sutta</h4>


<h1>On Knowledge Of The Vedas<span class="f3"><sup>[<a name="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></h1>


<p>1. T<span class="f2">HUS</span> H<span class="f2">AVE</span> I <span class="f2">HEARD</span>. When the Exalted One was once journeying through Kosala with a great company of the brethren, with about five hundred brethren, he came to the Brahman village in Kosala which is called <span class="mozp">Manas¤kaÂa</span>. And there at <span class="mozp">Manas¤kaÂa</span> the Exalted One stayed in the mango grove, on the bank of the river <span class="mozp">Akiravat¨,</span> to the north of <span class="mozp">Manas¤kaÂa</span>.</p>

<p>2. Now at that time many very distinguished and wealthy Brahmans were staying at <span class="mozp">Manas¤kaÂa</span>; to wit, <span class="mozp">Ka¸k¨ the Brahman, T¤rukkha the Brahman, Pokkharas¤di the Brahman, J¤¼usso¼i</span> the Brahman, Todeyya the Brahman, and other very distinguished and wealthy Brahmans<sup>[<a name="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup>.</p>

<p>3. Now a conversation sprung up between <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha and Bh¤radv¤ja,</span> when they were taking exercise (after their bath) and walking up and down, in thoughtful mood, as to which was the true path, and which the false<sup>[<a name="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup>.</p>

<p>4. The young Brahman <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha</span> spake thus:</p>

<p>'This is the straight path, this the direct way which makes for salvation, and leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of union with <span class="mozp">Brahm¤.</span> I mean that which has been announced by the Brahman <span class="mozp">Pokkharas¤di.</span>'</p>

<p>5. The young Brahman <span class="mozp">Bh¤radv¤ja</span> spake thus:</p>

<p>'This is the straight path, this the direct way which makes for salvation, and leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of union with <span class="mozp">Brahm¤.</span> I mean that which has been announced by the Brahman <span class="mozp">T¤rukkha.</span>'</p>

<p>6. But neither was the young Brahman <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha</span> able to convince the young Brahman <span class="mozp">Bh¤radv¤ja,</span> nor was the young Brahman <span class="mozp">Bh¤radv¤ja</span> able to convince the young Brahman <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha.</span></p>

<p>7. Then the young Brahman <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha</span> said to the young Brahman <span class="mozp">Bh¤radv¤ja:</span></p>

<p>'That <span class="mozp">Sama¼a</span> Gotama, <span class="mozp">Bh¤radv¤ja,</span> of the sons of the <span class="mozp">S¤kyas,</span> who went out from the <span class="mozp">S¤kya</span> clan to adopt the religious life, is now staying at <span class="mozp">Manas¤kaÂa,</span> in the mango grove, on the bank of the river <span class="mozp">Aciravat¨,</span> to the north of <span class="mozp">Manas¤kaÂa.</span> Now regarding that venerable Gotama, such is the high reputation that has been noised abroad: "That Exalted One is an Arahat, a fully enlightened one, abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy, with knowledge of the worlds, unsurpassed as a guide to mortals willing to be led, a teacher of gods and men, an Exalted One, a Buddha."</p>

<p>Come, then, <span class="mozp">Bh¤radv¤ja,</span> let us go to the place where the <span class="mozp">Sama¼a</span> Gotama is; and when we have come there, let us ask the <span class="mozp">Sama¼a</span> Gotama touching this matter. What the <span class="mozp">Sama¼a</span> Gotama shall declare unto us, that let us bear in mind<sup>[<a name="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup>.</p>

<p>'Very well, my friend!' said the young Brahman <span class="mozp">Bh¤radv¤ja,</span> in assent, to the young Brahman <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha.</span></p>

<p>8. Then the young Brahman <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha</span> and the young Brahman <span class="mozp">Bh¤radv¤ja</span> went on to the place where the Exalted One was.</p>

<p>And when they had come there, they exchanged with the Exalted One the greetings and compliments of politeness and courtesy, and sat down beside him.</p>

<p>And while they were thus seated the young Brahman <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha</span> said to the Exalted One:</p>

<p>'As we, Gotama, were taking exercise and walking up and down, there sprung up a conversation between us on which was the true path, and which the false. I said thus:</p>

<p>"'This is the straight path, this the direct way which makes for salvation, and leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of union with <span class="mozp">Brahm¤.</span> I mean that which has been announced by the Brahman <span class="mozp">Pokkharas¤di.</span>"'</p>

<p>'<span class="mozp">Bh¤radv¤ja</span> said thus:</p>

<p>"This is the straight path, this the direct way which makes for salvation, and leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of union with <span class="mozp">Brahm¤.</span> I mean that which has been announced by the Brahman <span class="mozp">T¤rukkha.</span>"'</p>

<p>'Regarding this matter, Gotama, there is a strife, a dispute, a difference of opinion between us.'</p>

<p>9. 'So you say, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha,</span> that you said thus:</p>

<p>This is the straight path, this the direct way which makes for salvation, and leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of union with <span class="mozp">Brahm¤</span>. I mean that which has been announced by the Brahman <span class="mozp">Pokkharas¤di.</span>" '</p>

<p>'While <span class="mozp">Bh¤radv¤ja</span> said thus:</p>

<p>' "This is the straight path, this the direct way which makes for salvation, and leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of union with Brahm¤. I mean that which has been announced by the Brahman <span class="mozp">T¤rukkha.</span>"'</p>

<p>'Wherein, then, O <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha,</span> is there a strife, a dispute, a difference of opinion between you<sup>[<a name="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup>?'</p>

<p>10. 'Concerning the true path and the false, Gotama. Various Brahmans, Gotama, teach various paths. The <span class="mozp">Addhariy¤</span> Brahmans, the <span class="mozp">Tittiriy¤</span> Brahmans, the <span class="mozp">Chandok¤</span> Brahmans [the <span class="mozp">Chandav¤</span> Brahmans], the <span class="mozp">Bavharij¤</span> Brahmans<sup>[<a name="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup>. Are all those saving paths? Are they all paths which will lead him, who acts according to them, into a state of union with <span class="mozp">Brahm¤</span>?</p>

<p>'Just, Gotama, as near a village or a town there are many and various paths<sup>[<a name="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup>, yet they all meet together in the village -- just in that way are all the various paths taught by various Brahmans -- the <span class="mozp">Addhariy¤</span> Brahmans, the <span class="mozp">Tittiriy¤</span> Brahmans, the <span class="mozp">Chandok¤,</span> Brahmans [the <span class="mozp">Chandav¤</span> Brahmans], the <span class="mozp">Bavharij¤</span> Brahmans. Are all these saving paths? Are they all paths which will lead him, who acts according to them, into a state of union with <span class="mozp">Brahm¤</span>?'</p>

<p>11. 'Do you say that they all lead aright, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha</span>?'</p>

<p>'I say so, Gotama.'</p>

<p>'Do you really say that they all lead aright, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha?</span></p>

<p>'So I say, Gotama.'</p>

<p>12. 'But yet, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha,</span> is there a single one of the Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas, who has ever seen <span class="mozp">Brahm¤,</span> face to face</p>

<p>'No, indeed, Gotama.'</p>

<p>'Or is there then, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha,</span> a single one of the teachers of the Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas who has seen <span class="mozp">Brahm¤</span> face to face</p>

<p>'No, indeed, Gotama!'</p>

<p>'Or is there then, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha,</span> a single one of the pupils of the teachers of the Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas who has seen <span class="mozp">Brahm¤</span> face to face 'No, indeed, Gotama!'</p>

<p>'Or is there then, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha,</span> a single one of the Brahmans up to the seventh generation who has seen <span class="mozp">Brahm¤</span> face to face?'</p>

<p>'No, indeed, Gotama!'</p>

<p>13. 'Well then, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha,</span> those ancient Rishis of the Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas, the authors of the verses, the utterers of the verses, whose, ancient form of words so chanted, uttered, or composed, the Brahmans of to-day chant over again or repeat; intoning or reciting exactly as has been intoned or recited-to wit, <span class="mozp">AÂÂhaka, V¤maka, V¤madeva, Vess¤mitta, Yamataggi, A¸girasa, Bh¤radv¤ja, V¤seÂÂha, Kassapa, and Bhagu</span><sup>[<a name="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup> -- did even they speak thus, saying: " We know it, we have seen it, where <span class="mozp">Brahm¤</span> is whence <span class="mozp">Brahm¤</span> is, whither <span class="mozp">Brahm¤</span> is?</p>

<p>Not so, Gotama!'</p>

<p>14. 'Then you say, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha</span> that none of the Brahmans, or of their teachers, or of their pupils, even up to the seventh generation, has ever seen <span class="mozp">Brahm¤</span> face to face. And that even the Rishis of old, the authors and utterers of the verses, of the ancient form of words which the Brahmans of to-day so carefully intone and recite precisely as they have been handed down-even they did not pretend to know or to have seen where or whence or whither <span class="mozp">Brahm¤</span> is<sup>[<a name="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup>. So that the Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas have forsooth said thus: "What we know not, what we have not seen, 'to a state of union with that we can show the way, and can say: 'This Is the straight path, this is the direct way which makes for salvation, and leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of union with <span class="mozp">Brahm¤!</span></p>

<p>'Now' what think you, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha</span>? Does it not follow, this being so, that the talk of the Brahmans, versed though they be in the Three Vedas, turns out to be foolish talk</p>

<p>In sooth, Gotama, that being, so, it follows that the talk of the Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas is foolish talk!'</p>

<p>15. 'Verily, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha,</span> that Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas should be able to show the way to a state of union with that which they do not know, neither have seen-such a condition of things can in no wise be!</p>

<p>'Just, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha,</span> as when a string of blind men are clinging one to the other<sup>[<a name="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup>, neither can the foremost see, nor can the middle one see, nor can the hindmost see -- just even so, methinks, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha,</span> is the talk of the Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas but blind talk: the first sees not, the middle one sees not, nor can the latest see. The talk then of these Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas turns out to be ridiculous, mere words, a vain and empty thing!'</p>

<p>16. 'Now what think you, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha?</span> Can the Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas -- like other, ordinary, folk -- see the Moon and the Sun as they pray to, and praise, and worship them, turning round with clasped hands towards the place whence they rise and where they set?'</p>

<p>'Certainly, Gotama, they can<sup>[<a name="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup>'.</p>

<p>17. 'Now what think you, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha?</span> The Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas, who can very well -- like other, ordinary, folk -- see the Moon and the Sun as they pray to, and praise, and worship them, turning round with clasped hands to the place whence they rise and where they set -- are those Brahmans, versed in the Three Vedas, able to point out the way to a state of union with the Moon or the Sun, saying: " This is the straight path, this the direct way which makes for salvation, and leads him, who acts according to it, to a state of union with the Moon or the Sun?</p>

<p>'Certainly, not, Gotama !'</p>

<p>18. 'So you say, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha,</span> that the Brahmans are not able to point out the way to union with that which they have seen, and you further say that neither any one of them, nor of their pupils, nor of their predecessors even to the seventh generation has ever seen <span class="mozp">Brahm¤,</span> And you further say that even the Rishis of old, whose words they hold in such deep respect, did not pretend to know, or to have seen where, or whence, or whither <span class="mozp">Brahm¤</span> is. Yet these Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas say, forsooth, that they can point out the way to union with that which they know not, neither have seen<sup>[<a name="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup>. Now what think you, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha?</span> Does it not follow that, this being so, the talk of the Brahmans, versed though they be in the Three Vedas, turns out to be foolish talk?'</p>

<p>' In sooth, Gotama, that being so, it follows that the talk of the Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas is foolish talk!'</p>

<p>19. 'Very good, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha.</span> Verily then, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha,</span> that Brahmans versed in the Three Vedas should be able to show the way to a state of union with that which they do not know, neither have seen-such a condition of things can in no wise be!'</p>


<p>'Just, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha,</span> as if a man should say, "How I long for, how I love the most beautiful woman in this land!"</p>

<p>'And people should ask him, "Well! good friend! this most beautiful woman in the land, whom you thus love and long for, do you know whether that beautiful woman is a noble lady or a Brahman woman, or of the trader class, or a <span class="mozp">S¬dra?</span></p>

<p>'But when so asked, he should answer: "No."</p>

<p>'And when people should ask him, " Well! good friend! this most beautiful woman in all the land, whom you so love and long for, do you know what the name of that most beautiful woman is, or what is her family name, whether she be tall or short or of medium height, dark or brunette or golden in colour, or in what village or town or city she dwells?</p>

<p>'But when so asked, he should answer: No."</p>

<p>'And then people should say to him, So then, good friend, whom you know not, neither have seen, her do you love and long for?</p>

<p>'Now what think you, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha,</span> suppose there were a man born in <span class="mozp">Manas¤kaÂa,</span> and people should ask him, who never till that time had left <span class="mozp">Manas¤kaÂa,</span> which was the way to <span class="mozp">Manas¤kaÂa.</span> Would that man, born and brought up in <span class="mozp">Manas¤kaÂa,</span> be in any doubt or difficulty?'</p>

<p>' Certainly not, Gotama! And why? If the man had been born and brought up in <span class="mozp">Manas¤kaÂa,</span> every road that leads to <span class="mozp">Manas¤kaÂa</span> would be perfectly familiar to him.'</p>

<p>38. 'That man, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha,</span> born and brought up at <span class="mozp">Manas¤kaÂa</span> might, if he were asked the way to <span class="mozp">Manas¤kaÂa,</span> fall into doubt and difficulty, but to the <span class="mozp">Tath¤gata,</span> when asked touching the path which leads to the world of <span class="mozp">Brahm¤,</span> there can be neither doubt nor difficulty. For <span class="mozp">Brahm¤,</span> I know, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha,</span> and the world of <span class="mozp">Brahm¤,</span> and the path which leadeth unto it.

<p>39. When he had thus spoken, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha,</span> the young Brahman, said to the Blessed One:</p>

<p>'Just so has it been told me, Gotama, even that the <span class="mozp">Sama¼a</span> Gotama knows the way to a state of union with <span class="mozp">Brahm¤.</span> It is well! Let the venerable Gotama be pleased to show us the way to a state of union with <span class="mozp">Brahm¤,</span> let the venerable Gotama save the Brahman race'<sup>[<a name="fn26" href="#n26">26</a>]</sup>!</p>

<p>'Listen then, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha,</span> and give ear attentively, and I will speak!'</p>

<p>'So be it, Lord!' said the young Brahman <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha,</span> in assent, to the Blessed One.</p>

<p>40. Then the Blessed One spake, and said:</p>

<p>Know, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha,</span> that (from time to time) a <span class="mozp">Tath¤gata</span> is born into the world, an Arahat, a fully awakened one, abounding, in wisdom and goodness, happy, with knowledge of the worlds, unsurpassed as a guide to mortals willing to be led, a teacher of gods and men, a Blessed One, a Buddha. He, by himself, thoroughly understands, and sees, as it were, face to face this universe -- including the worlds above with the gods, the <span class="mozp">M¤ras, and the Brahm¤s;</span> and the world below with its <span class="mozp">Sama¼as</span> and Brahmans, its princes and peoples; -- and he then makes his knowledge known to others. The truth doth he proclaim both in the letter and in the spirit, lovely in its origin, lovely in its progress, lovely in its consummation: the higher life doth he make known, in all its purity and in all its perfectness.</p>

<p>41. 'A householder (gahapati), or one of his children, or a man of inferior birth in any class, listens to that truth<sup>[<a name="fn27" href="#n27">27</a>]</sup>. On hearing the truth he has faith in the <span class="mozp">Tath¤gata,</span> and when he has acquired that faith he thus considers with himself:</p>

<p>"Full of hindrances is household life, a path defiled by passion : free as the air is the life of him who has renounced all worldly things. How difficult it is for the man who dwells at home to live the higher life in all its fullness, in all its purity, in all its bright perfection! Let me then cut off my hair and beard, let me clothe myself in the orange-coloured robes, and let me go forth from a household life into the homeless state.</p>

<p>'Then before long, forsaking his portion of wealth, be it great or be it small; forsaking his circle of relatives, be they many or be they few, he cuts off his hair and beard, he clothes himself in the orange -- coloured robes. and he goes forth from the household life into the homeless state.</p>

<p><a name="42">42.</a> 'When he has thus become a recluse he passes a life self-restrained by that restraint which should be binding on a recluse. Uprightness is his delight, and he sees danger in the least of those things he should avoid. He adopts and trains himself in the precepts. He encompasses himself with goodness in word and deed. He sustains his life by means that are quite pure; good is his conduct, guarded the door of his senses; mindful and self-possessed, he is altogether happy!'</p>

<p>43-75. 'And how, <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha,</span> is his conduct good?'</p>

<p>[The answer is set forth in the words of the tract on the <span class="mozp">S¨las,</span> translated above, pp. <a href="http://www.buddhadust.org/sutta/dn/1_brahmagala/1_brahmagala_pts.htm">3-26,</a> but with the refrain as in the <span class="mozp">S¤ma¾¾a-phala</span> Suttanta above, <a href="http://www.buddhadust.org/sutta/dn/2_samana-phala.htm">p.79</a>.

On <span class="mozp">Pokkharas¤di,</span> see above, pp. 108, 135, 147; and on Todeyya, see above, p. 267; and on all the names, see Majjhima <span class="mozp">Nik¤ya</span>, No. 98= Sutta <span class="mozp">Nip¤ta,</span> 9.</p>

<p>Buddhaghosa adds that because <span class="mozp">Manas¤kaÂa</span> was a pleasant place the Brahmans had built huts there on the bank of the river and fenced them in, and used to go and stay there from time to time to repeat their mantras.</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Ja¸gh¤vih¤raµ anuca¸kamant¤naµ anuvicarant¤naµ. Ca¸kamati</span> is to walk up and down thinking. I have added 'after their bath,' from Buddhaghosa, who says that this must be understood to have taken place when, after learning by heart and repeating all day, they, went down in the evening to the riverside to bathe, and then walked up and down on the sand. COMP. Mil. 22; <span class="mozp">J¤t.</span> II, 240,272.</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup>Comp. <span class="mozp">Divy¤vad¤na</span> 196, 246; and <span class="mozp">A¸guttara</span> II, pp. 23, 24.</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup>This is either mildly sarcastic-as much as to say, 'that is six of one, and half a dozen of the other'-- or is intended to lead on <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha</span> to confess still more directly the fact that the different theologians held inconsistent opinions.</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup>The Mss. differ as to the last name, and some of them omit the last but one. The Adhvaryu, <span class="mozp">Taittir¨ya,</span> Chandoga, and Bahvrica priests-those skilled in liturgy generally, and in the Yajur, <span class="mozp">S¤ma,</span> and Rig Vedas respectively -- are probably meant. If we adopt the other reading for the last in the list, then those priests who relied on liturgy, sacrifice, or chant would be contrasted with those who had 'gone forth' as religieux, either as <span class="mozp">T¤pasas</span> or as Bhikshus.</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Magg¤ni,</span> which is noteworthy as a curious change of gender.</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup>See the note on these names at 'Vinaya Texts,' II, 130.</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup>In the text &sect;&sect; 12, 13 are repeated word for word.</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Andhave¼¨ paramparaµ sa¸satt¤.</span> The Phayre Ms. has replaced <span class="mozp">ve¼¨</span> by <span class="mozp">pave¼¨,</span> after the constant custom of the Burmese Mss. to improve away unusual or difficult expressions. Buddhaghosa explains <span class="mozp">andhave¼i by andhapave¼i;</span> and tells a tale of a wicked wight, who meeting a company of blind men, told them of a certain village wherein plenty of good food was to be had. When they besought him for hire to lead them there, he took the money, made one blind man catch hold of his stick, the next of that one, and so on, and then led them on till they came to a wilderness. There he deserted them, and they all -- still holding each the other, and vainly, and with tears, seeking both their guide and the path -- came to a miserable end! Comp. M. II, 170.</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup>The words of the question are repeated in the text in this and the following answers. It must be remembered, for these sections, that the Sun and Moon were gods just as much as <span class="mozp">Brahm¤;</span> and that the Moon always comes first in <span class="mozp">Nik¤ya</span> and other ancient texts.</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup>The text repeats at length the words of &sect;&sect; 12, 13, 14.</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup>Samatittika <span class="mozp">k¤kapeyy¤.</span> See on this phrase the note in my Buddhist Suttas (S. B. E.), pp. 178, 179.</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup>The Sinhalese Mss. omit Mahiddhi and Yama, but repeat the verb, 'we call upon,' three times after <span class="mozp">Brahm¤.</span> It is possible that the Burmese copyist has wrongly inserted them to remove the strangeness of this repetition. The comment is silent.</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup>The Buddha, as usual, here takes the 'further bank' in the meaning attached to it by the theologians he is talking to, as union with <span class="mozp">Brahm¤.</span> In his own system, of course, the 'further bank' is Arahatship. So <span class="mozp">A¸guttara</span> V, 232, 233, and elsewhere.</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Gathit¤ mucchit¤ ajjhopann¤.</span> See A. I, 74, 274; <span class="mozp">Ud¤na</span> VII, 3, 4; Sum. 59, etc.</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup>Ariyassa vinaye. This may possibly mean 'in the disciple recommended by the Arahat' (that is, by the Buddha). But the latter is expressed rather by Sugata-vinaye. Comp. <span class="mozp">A¸guttara</span> V, 237-239 with 234, 235.</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup>These Five 'Hindrances are more fully dealt with above, p. 82.</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Sapariggaho v¤ Brahm¤</span> apariggaho va ti. Buddhaghosa says on <span class="mozp">V¤seÂÂha's reply, 'K¤macchandassa ,¤bhavato itthipariggahena apariggaho,'</span> thus restricting the 'possession' to women. But the reference is no doubt to the first 'hindrance' ; and the word in the text, though doubtless alluding to possession of women also. includes more. Compare, on the general idea of the passage, the English expression, 'no encumbrances,' and Jacobi, 'Jaina-<span class="mozp">S¬tras</span>' (S. B. E.) I, xxiii.</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Asa¸kiliÂÂha-citto.</span> That is, says Buddhaghosa, free from mental torpor and idleness, worry and flurry.'</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">Vasavatt¨ v¤ avasavatt¨ v¤.</span> Buddhaghosa says, in explanation of the, answer, 'By the absence of wavering he has his mind under control (vase vatteti).'</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup><span class="mozp">¤s¨ditva sa¸s¨danti.</span> I have no doubt the commentator is right in his explanation of these figurative expressions. Confident in their knowledge of the Vedas, and in their practice of Vedic ceremonies, they neglect higher things; and so, sinking into folly and superstition, 'they are arriving only at despair, thinking the while that they are crossing over into some happier land.'</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup>Buddhaghosa takes this to mean, 'Save me of the Brahman race.'</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup>'The point is, that the acceptance of this 'Doctrine and Discipline' is open to all; not of course that Brahmans never accept it.</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup>These paragraphs occur frequently; see. inter <span class="mozp">alia, Mah¤-Sudassana</span> Sutta II, 8, in my 'Buddhist Suttas' (S. B. E.). It will be seen from 'Buddhism,' pp. 170, 171, that these meditations play a great part in later Buddhism, and occupy very much the place that prayer takes in Christianity. A fifth, the meditation on Impurity, has been added, at what time I do not know, before the last. These four (or-five), are called the Brahma <span class="mozp">Vih¤ras,</span> and the practice of them leads, not to Arahatship, but to rebirth in the <span class="mozp">Brahm¤</span>-world.</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup>Paragraphs 76, 77 are supposed to be repeated of each.</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup>Paragraphs 76, 77 are supposed to be repeated of each.</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup>Paragraphs 76, 77 are supposed to be repeated of each.</p>

<p><sup>[<a name="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup>Literally 'The Suttanta about those who have the knowledge of the Three (Vedas).' Sec p.303, where the names of these, 'doctors' are given.</p>
