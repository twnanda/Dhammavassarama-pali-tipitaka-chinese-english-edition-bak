<p>Chapter I</p>
<p>The Twin-Verses</p>
<p>1. All that we are is the result of what we have
thought: it is</p>
<p>founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts.
If a man</p>
<p>speaks or acts with an evil thought, pain follows him,
as the wheel</p>
<p>follows the foot of the ox that draws the carriage.</p>
<p>2. All that we are is the result of what we have
thought: it is</p>
<p>founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts.
If a man</p>
<p>speaks or acts with a pure thought, happiness follows
him, like a</p>
<p>shadow that never leaves him.</p>
<p>3. &quot;He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he
robbed me,&quot;--in those</p>
<p>who harbour such thoughts hatred will never cease.</p>
<p>4. &quot;He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he
robbed me,&quot;--in those</p>
<p>who do not harbour such thoughts hatred will cease.</p>
<p>5. For hatred does not cease by hatred at any time:
hatred ceases by</p>
<p>love, this is an old rule.</p>
<p>6. The world does not know that we must all come to an
end here;--but</p>
<p>those who know it, their quarrels cease at once.</p>
<p>7. He who lives looking for pleasures only, his senses
uncontrolled,</p>
<p>immoderate in his food, idle, and weak, Mara (the
tempter) will</p>
<p>certainly overthrow him, as the wind throws down a weak
tree.</p>
<p>8. He who lives without looking for pleasures, his
senses well</p>
<p>controlled, moderate in his food, faithful and strong,
him Mara will</p>
<p>certainly not overthrow, any more than the wind throws
down a rocky</p>
<p>mountain.</p>
<p>9. He who wishes to put on the yellow dress without
having cleansed</p>
<p>himself from sin, who disregards temperance and truth,
is unworthy of</p>
<p>the yellow dress.</p>
<p>10. But he who has cleansed himself from sin, is well
grounded in all</p>
<p>virtues, and regards also temperance and truth, he is
indeed worthy of</p>
<p>the yellow dress.</p>
<p>11. They who imagine truth in untruth, and see untruth
in truth, never</p>
<p>arrive at truth, but follow vain desires.</p>
<p>12. They who know truth in truth, and untruth in
untruth, arrive at</p>
<p>truth, and follow true desires.</p>
<p>13. As rain breaks through an ill-thatched house,
passion will break</p>
<p>through an unreflecting mind.</p>
<p>14. As rain does not break through a well-thatched
house, passion will</p>
<p>not break through a well-reflecting mind.</p>
<p>15. The evil-doer mourns in this world, and he mourns in
the next; he</p>
<p>mourns in both. He mourns and suffers when he sees the
evil of his</p>
<p>own work.</p>
<p>16. The virtuous man delights in this world, and he
delights in the</p>
<p>next; he delights in both. He delights and rejoices,
when he sees the</p>
<p>purity of his own work.</p>
<p>17. The evil-doer suffers in this world, and he suffers
in the next;</p>
<p>he suffers in both. He suffers when he thinks of the
evil he has</p>
<p>done; he suffers more when going on the evil path.</p>
<p>18. The virtuous man is happy in this world, and he is
happy in the</p>
<p>next; he is happy in both. He is happy when he thinks of
the good he</p>
<p>has done; he is still more happy when going on the good
path.</p>
<p>19. The thoughtless man, even if he can recite a large
portion (of the</p>
<p>law), but is not a doer of it, has no share in the
priesthood, but is</p>
<p>like a cowherd counting the cows of others.</p>
<p>20. The follower of the law, even if he can recite only
a small</p>
<p>portion (of the law), but, having forsaken passion and
hatred and</p>
<p>foolishness, possesses true knowledge and serenity of
mind, he, caring</p>
<p>for nothing in this world or that to come, has indeed a
share in the</p>
<p>priesthood.</p>

<p>Chapter II</p>
<p>On Earnestness</p>
<p>21. Earnestness is the path of immortality (Nirvana),
thoughtlessness</p>
<p>the path of death. Those who are in earnest do not die,
those who are</p>
<p>thoughtless are as if dead already.</p>
<p>22. Those who are advanced in earnestness, having
understood this</p>
<p>clearly, delight in earnestness, and rejoice in the
knowledge of the</p>
<p>Ariyas (the elect).</p>
<p>23. These wise people, meditative, steady, always
possessed of strong</p>
<p>powers, attain to Nirvana, the highest happiness.</p>
<p>24. If an earnest person has roused himself, if he is
not forgetful,</p>
<p>if his deeds are pure, if he acts with consideration, if
he restrains</p>
<p>himself, and lives according to law,--then his glory
will increase.</p>
<p>25. By rousing himself, by earnestness, by restraint and
control, the</p>
<p>wise man may make for himself an island which no flood
can overwhelm.</p>
<p>26. Fools follow after vanity, men of evil wisdom. The
wise man keeps</p>
<p>earnestness as his best jewel.</p>
<p>27. Follow not after vanity, nor after the enjoyment of
love and lust!</p>
<p>He who is earnest and meditative, obtains ample joy.</p>
<p>28. When the learned man drives away vanity by
earnestness, he, the</p>
<p>wise, climbing the terraced heights of wisdom, looks
down upon the</p>
<p>fools, serene he looks upon the toiling crowd, as one
that stands on a</p>
<p>mountain looks down upon them that stand upon the plain.</p>
<p>29. Earnest among the thoughtless, awake among the
sleepers, the wise</p>
<p>man advances like a racer, leaving behind the hack.</p>
<p>30. By earnestness did Maghavan (Indra) rise to the
lordship of the</p>
<p>gods. People praise earnestness; thoughtlessness is
always blamed.</p>
<p>31. A Bhikshu (mendicant) who delights in earnestness,
who looks with</p>
<p>fear on thoughtlessness, moves about like fire, burning
all his</p>
<p>fetters, small or large.</p>
<p>32. A Bhikshu (mendicant) who delights in reflection,
who looks with</p>
<p>fear on thoughtlessness, cannot fall away (from his
perfect state)--he</p>
<p>is close upon Nirvana.</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p>Chapter III</p>
<p>Thought</p>
<p>33. As a fletcher makes straight his arrow, a wise man
makes straight</p>
<p>his trembling and unsteady thought, which is difficult
to guard,</p>
<p>difficult to hold back.</p>
<p>34. As a fish taken from his watery home and thrown on
dry ground, our</p>
<p>thought trembles all over in order to escape the
dominion of Mara (the</p>
<p>tempter).</p>
<p>35. It is good to tame the mind, which is difficult to
hold in and</p>
<p>flighty, rushing wherever it listeth; a tamed mind
brings happiness.</p>
<p>36. Let the wise man guard his thoughts, for they are
difficult to</p>
<p>perceive, very artful, and they rush wherever they list:
thoughts well</p>
<p>guarded bring happiness.</p>
<p>37. Those who bridle their mind which travels far, moves
about alone,</p>
<p>is without a body, and hides in the chamber (of the
heart), will be</p>
<p>free from the bonds of Mara (the tempter).</p>
<p>38. If a man's thoughts are unsteady, if he does not
know the true</p>
<p>law, if his peace of mind is troubled, his knowledge
will never be</p>
<p>perfect.</p>
<p>39. If a man's thoughts are not dissipated, if his mind
is not</p>
<p>perplexed, if he has ceased to think of good or evil,
then there is no</p>
<p>fear for him while he is watchful.</p>
<p>40. Knowing that this body is (fragile) like a jar, and
making this</p>
<p>thought firm like a fortress, one should attack Mara
(the tempter)</p>
<p>with the weapon of knowledge, one should watch him when
conquered, and</p>
<p>should never rest.</p>
<p>41. Before long, alas! this body will lie on the earth,
despised,</p>
<p>without understanding, like a useless log.</p>
<p>42. Whatever a hater may do to a hater, or an enemy to
an enemy, a</p>
<p>wrongly-directed mind will do us greater mischief.</p>
<p>43. Not a mother, not a father will do so much, nor any
other</p>
<p>relative; a well-directed mind will do us greater
service.</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p>Chapter IV</p>
<p>Flowers</p>
<p>44. Who shall overcome this earth, and the world of Yama
(the lord of</p>
<p>the departed), and the world of the gods? Who shall find
out the</p>
<p>plainly shown path of virtue, as a clever man finds out
the (right)</p>
<p>flower?</p>
<p>45. The disciple will overcome the earth, and the world
of Yama, and</p>
<p>the world of the gods. The disciple will find out the
plainly shown</p>
<p>path of virtue, as a clever man finds out the (right)
flower.</p>
<p>46. He who knows that this body is like froth, and has
learnt that it</p>
<p>is as unsubstantial as a mirage, will break the
flower-pointed arrow</p>
<p>of Mara, and never see the king of death.</p>
<p>47. Death carries off a man who is gathering flowers and
whose mind is</p>
<p>distracted, as a flood carries off a sleeping village.</p>
<p>48. Death subdues a man who is gathering flowers, and
whose mind is</p>
<p>distracted, before he is satiated in his pleasures.</p>
<p>49. As the bee collects nectar and departs without
injuring the</p>
<p>flower, or its colour or scent, so let a sage dwell in
his village.</p>
<p>50. Not the perversities of others, not their sins of
commission or</p>
<p>omission, but his own misdeeds and negligences should a
sage take</p>
<p>notice of.</p>
<p>51. Like a beautiful flower, full of colour, but without
scent, are</p>
<p>the fine but fruitless words of him who does not act
accordingly.</p>
<p>52. But, like a beautiful flower, full of colour and
full of scent,</p>
<p>are the fine and fruitful words of him who acts
accordingly.</p>
<p>53. As many kinds of wreaths can be made from a heap of
flowers, so</p>
<p>many good things may be achieved by a mortal when once
he is born.</p>
<p>54. The scent of flowers does not travel against the
wind, nor (that</p>
<p>of) sandal-wood, or of Tagara and Mallika flowers; but
the odour of</p>
<p>good people travels even against the wind; a good man
pervades every</p>
<p>place.</p>
<p>55. Sandal-wood or Tagara, a lotus-flower, or a Vassiki,
among these</p>
<p>sorts of perfumes, the perfume of virtue is unsurpassed.</p>
<p>56. Mean is the scent that comes from Tagara and
sandal-wood;--the</p>
<p>perfume of those who possess virtue rises up to the gods
as the</p>
<p>highest.</p>
<p>57. Of the people who possess these virtues, who live
without</p>
<p>thoughtlessness, and who are emancipated through true
knowledge, Mara,</p>
<p>the tempter, never finds the way.</p>
<p>58, 59. As on a heap of rubbish cast upon the highway
the lily will</p>
<p>grow full of sweet perfume and delight, thus the
disciple of the truly</p>
<p>enlightened Buddha shines forth by his knowledge among
those who are</p>
<p>like rubbish, among the people that walk in darkness.</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p>Chapter V</p>
<p>The Fool</p>
<p>60. Long is the night to him who is awake; long is a
mile to him who</p>
<p>is tired; long is life to the foolish who do not know
the true law.</p>
<p>61. If a traveller does not meet with one who is his
better, or his</p>
<p>equal, let him firmly keep to his solitary journey;
there is no</p>
<p>companionship with a fool.</p>
<p>62. &quot;These sons belong to me, and this wealth
belongs to me,&quot; with</p>
<p>such thoughts a fool is tormented. He himself does not
belong to</p>
<p>himself; how much less sons and wealth?</p>
<p>63. The fool who knows his foolishness, is wise at least
so far. But</p>
<p>a fool who thinks himself wise, he is called a fool
indeed.</p>
<p>64. If a fool be associated with a wise man even all his
life, he will</p>
<p>perceive the truth as little as a spoon perceives the
taste of soup.</p>
<p>65. If an intelligent man be associated for one minute
only with a</p>
<p>wise man, he will soon perceive the truth, as the tongue
perceives the</p>
<p>taste of soup.</p>
<p>66. Fools of little understanding have themselves for
their greatest</p>
<p>enemies, for they do evil deeds which must bear bitter
fruits.</p>
<p>67. That deed is not well done of which a man must
repent, and the</p>
<p>reward of which he receives crying and with a tearful
face.</p>
<p>68. No, that deed is well done of which a man does not
repent, and the</p>
<p>reward of which he receives gladly and cheerfully.</p>
<p>69. As long as the evil deed done does not bear fruit,
the fool thinks</p>
<p>it is like honey; but when it ripens, then the fool
suffers grief.</p>
<p>70. Let a fool month after month eat his food (like an
ascetic) with</p>
<p>the tip of a blade of Kusa grass, yet he is not worth
the sixteenth</p>
<p>particle of those who have well weighed the law.</p>
<p>71. An evil deed, like newly-drawn milk, does not turn
(suddenly);</p>
<p>smouldering, like fire covered by ashes, it follows the
fool.</p>
<p>72. And when the evil deed, after it has become known,
brings sorrow</p>
<p>to the fool, then it destroys his bright lot, nay, it
cleaves his</p>
<p>head.</p>
<p>73. Let the fool wish for a false reputation, for
precedence among the</p>
<p>Bhikshus, for lordship in the convents, for worship
among other</p>
<p>people!</p>
<p>74. &quot;May both the layman and he who has left the
world think that this</p>
<p>is done by me; may they be subject to me in everything
which is to be</p>
<p>done or is not to be done,&quot; thus is the mind of the
fool, and his</p>
<p>desire and pride increase.</p>
<p>75. &quot;One is the road that leads to wealth, another
the road that leads</p>
<p>to Nirvana;&quot; if the Bhikshu, the disciple of
Buddha, has learnt this,</p>
<p>he will not yearn for honour, he will strive after
separation from the</p>
<p>world.</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p>Chapter VI</p>
<p>The Wise Man (Pandita)</p>
<p>76. If you see an intelligent man who tells you where
true treasures</p>
<p>are to be found, who shows what is to be avoided, and
administers</p>
<p>reproofs, follow that wise man; it will be better, not
worse, for</p>
<p>those who follow him.</p>
<p>77. Let him admonish, let him teach, let him forbid what
is improper!-</p>
<p>-he will be beloved of the good, by the bad he will be
hated.</p>
<p>78. Do not have evil-doers for friends, do not have low
people for</p>
<p>friends: have virtuous people for friends, have for
friends the best</p>
<p>of men.</p>
<p>79. He who drinks in the law lives happily with a serene
mind: the</p>
<p>sage rejoices always in the law, as preached by the
elect (Ariyas).</p>
<p>80. Well-makers lead the water (wherever they like);
fletchers bend</p>
<p>the arrow; carpenters bend a log of wood; wise people
fashion</p>
<p>themselves.</p>
<p>81. As a solid rock is not shaken by the wind, wise
people falter not</p>
<p>amidst blame and praise.</p>
<p>82. Wise people, after they have listened to the laws,
become serene,</p>
<p>like a deep, smooth, and still lake.</p>
<p>83. Good people walk on whatever befall, the good do not
prattle,</p>
<p>longing for pleasure; whether touched by happiness or
sorrow wise</p>
<p>people never appear elated or depressed.</p>
<p>84. If, whether for his own sake, or for the sake of
others, a man</p>
<p>wishes neither for a son, nor for wealth, nor for
lordship, and if he</p>
<p>does not wish for his own success by unfair means, then
he is good,</p>
<p>wise, and virtuous.</p>
<p>85. Few are there among men who arrive at the other
shore (become</p>
<p>Arhats); the other people here run up and down the
shore.</p>
<p>86. But those who, when the law has been well preached
to them, follow</p>
<p>the law, will pass across the dominion of death, however
difficult to</p>
<p>overcome.</p>
<p>87, 88. A wise man should leave the dark state (of
ordinary life), and</p>
<p>follow the bright state (of the Bhikshu). After going
from his home</p>
<p>to a homeless state, he should in his retirement look
for enjoyment</p>
<p>where there seemed to be no enjoyment. Leaving all
pleasures behind,</p>
<p>and calling nothing his own, the wise man should purge
himself from</p>
<p>all the troubles of the mind.</p>
<p>89. Those whose mind is well grounded in the (seven)
elements of</p>
<p>knowledge, who without clinging to anything, rejoice in
freedom from</p>
<p>attachment, whose appetites have been conquered, and who
are full of</p>
<p>light, are free (even) in this world.</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p>Chapter VII</p>
<p>The Venerable (Arhat).</p>
<p>90. There is no suffering for him who has finished his
journey, and</p>
<p>abandoned grief, who has freed himself on all sides, and
thrown off</p>
<p>all fetters.</p>
<p>91. They depart with their thoughts well-collected, they
are not happy</p>
<p>in their abode; like swans who have left their lake,
they leave their</p>
<p>house and home.</p>
<p>92. Men who have no riches, who live on recognised food,
who have</p>
<p>perceived void and unconditioned freedom (Nirvana),
their path is</p>
<p>difficult to understand, like that of birds in the air.</p>
<p>93. He whose appetites are stilled, who is not absorbed
in enjoyment,</p>
<p>who has perceived void and unconditioned freedom
(Nirvana), his path</p>
<p>is difficult to understand, like that of birds in the
air.</p>
<p>94. The gods even envy him whose senses, like horses
well broken in by</p>
<p>the driver, have been subdued, who is free from pride,
and free from</p>
<p>appetites.</p>
<p>95. Such a one who does his duty is tolerant like the
earth, like</p>
<p>Indra's bolt; he is like a lake without mud; no new
births are in</p>
<p>store for him.</p>
<p>96. His thought is quiet, quiet are his word and deed,
when he has</p>
<p>obtained freedom by true knowledge, when he has thus
become a quiet</p>
<p>man.</p>
<p>97. The man who is free from credulity, but knows the
uncreated, who</p>
<p>has cut all ties, removed all temptations, renounced all
desires, he</p>
<p>is the greatest of men.</p>
<p>98. In a hamlet or in a forest, in the deep water or on
the dry land,</p>
<p>wherever venerable persons (Arhanta) dwell, that place
is delightful.</p>
<p>99. Forests are delightful; where the world finds no
delight, there</p>
<p>the passionless will find delight, for they look not for
pleasures.</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p>Chapter VIII</p>
<p>The Thousands</p>
<p>100. Even though a speech be a thousand (of words), but
made up of</p>
<p>senseless words, one word of sense is better, which if a
man hears, he</p>
<p>becomes quiet.</p>
<p>101. Even though a Gatha (poem) be a thousand (of
words), but made up</p>
<p>of senseless words, one word of a Gatha is better, which
if a man</p>
<p>hears, he becomes quiet.</p>
<p>102. Though a man recite a hundred Gathas made up of
senseless words,</p>
<p>one word of the law is better, which if a man hears, he
becomes quiet.</p>
<p>103. If one man conquer in battle a thousand times
thousand men, and</p>
<p>if another conquer himself, he is the greatest of
conquerors.</p>
<p>104, 105. One's own self conquered is better than all
other people;</p>
<p>not even a god, a Gandharva, not Mara with Brahman could
change into</p>
<p>defeat the victory of a man who has vanquished himself,
and always</p>
<p>lives under restraint.</p>
<p>106. If a man for a hundred years sacrifice month after
month with a</p>
<p>thousand, and if he but for one moment pay homage to a
man whose soul</p>
<p>is grounded (in true knowledge), better is that homage
than sacrifice</p>
<p>for a hundred years.</p>
<p>107. If a man for a hundred years worship Agni (fire) in
the forest,</p>
<p>and if he but for one moment pay homage to a man whose
soul is</p>
<p>grounded (in true knowledge), better is that homage than
sacrifice for</p>
<p>a hundred years.</p>
<p>108. Whatever a man sacrifice in this world as an
offering or as an</p>
<p>oblation for a whole year in order to gain merit, the
whole of it is</p>
<p>not worth a quarter (a farthing); reverence shown to the
righteous is</p>
<p>better.</p>
<p>109. He who always greets and constantly reveres the
aged, four things</p>
<p>will increase to him, viz. life, beauty, happiness,
power.</p>
<p>110. But he who lives a hundred years, vicious and
unrestrained, a</p>
<p>life of one day is better if a man is virtuous and
reflecting.</p>
<p>111. And he who lives a hundred years, ignorant and
unrestrained, a</p>
<p>life of one day is better if a man is wise and
reflecting.</p>
<p>112. And he who lives a hundred years, idle and weak, a
life of one</p>
<p>day is better if a man has attained firm strength.</p>
<p>113. And he who lives a hundred years, not seeing
beginning and end, a</p>
<p>life of one day is better if a man sees beginning and
end.</p>
<p>114. And he who lives a hundred years, not seeing the
immortal place,</p>
<p>a life of one day is better if a man sees the immortal
place.</p>
<p>115. And he who lives a hundred years, not seeing the
highest law, a</p>
<p>life of one day is better if a man sees the highest law.</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p>Chapter IX</p>
<p>Evil</p>
<p>116. If a man would hasten towards the good, he should
keep his</p>
<p>thought away from evil; if a man does what is good
slothfully, his</p>
<p>mind delights in evil.</p>
<p>117. If a man commits a sin, let him not do it again;
let him not</p>
<p>delight in sin: pain is the outcome of evil.</p>
<p>118. If a man does what is good, let him do it again;
let him delight</p>
<p>in it: happiness is the outcome of good.</p>
<p>119. Even an evil-doer sees happiness as long as his
evil deed has not</p>
<p>ripened; but when his evil deed has ripened, then does
the evil-doer</p>
<p>see evil.</p>
<p>120. Even a good man sees evil days, as long as his good
deed has not</p>
<p>ripened; but when his good deed has ripened, then does
the good man</p>
<p>see happy days.</p>
<p>121. Let no man think lightly of evil, saying in his
heart, It will</p>
<p>not come nigh unto me. Even by the falling of
water-drops a water-pot</p>
<p>is filled; the fool becomes full of evil, even if he
gather it little</p>
<p>by little.</p>
<p>122. Let no man think lightly of good, saying in his
heart, It will</p>
<p>not come nigh unto me. Even by the falling of
water-drops a water-pot</p>
<p>is filled; the wise man becomes full of good, even if he
gather it</p>
<p>little by little.</p>
<p>123. Let a man avoid evil deeds, as a merchant, if he
has few</p>
<p>companions and carries much wealth, avoids a dangerous
road; as a man</p>
<p>who loves life avoids poison.</p>
<p>124. He who has no wound on his hand, may touch poison
with his hand;</p>
<p>poison does not affect one who has no wound; nor is
there evil for one</p>
<p>who does not commit evil.</p>
<p>125. If a man offend a harmless, pure, and innocent
person, the evil</p>
<p>falls back upon that fool, like light dust thrown up
against the wind.</p>
<p>126. Some people are born again; evil-doers go to hell;
righteous</p>
<p>people go to heaven; those who are free from all worldly
desires</p>
<p>attain Nirvana.</p>
<p>127. Not in the sky, not in the midst of the sea, not if
we enter into</p>
<p>the clefts of the mountains, is there known a spot in
the whole world</p>
<p>where death could not overcome (the mortal).</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p>Chapter X</p>
<p>Punishment</p>
<p>129. All men tremble at punishment, all men fear death;
remember that</p>
<p>you are like unto them, and do not kill, nor cause
slaughter.</p>
<p>130. All men tremble at punishment, all men love life;
remember that</p>
<p>thou art like unto them, and do not kill, nor cause
slaughter.</p>
<p>131. He who seeking his own happiness punishes or kills
beings who</p>
<p>also long for happiness, will not find happiness after
death.</p>
<p>132. He who seeking his own happiness does not punish or
kill beings</p>
<p>who also long for happiness, will find happiness after
death.</p>
<p>133. Do not speak harshly to anybody; those who are
spoken to will</p>
<p>answer thee in the same way. Angry speech is painful,
blows for blows</p>
<p>will touch thee.</p>
<p>134. If, like a shattered metal plate (gong), thou utter
not, then</p>
<p>thou hast reached Nirvana; contention is not known to
thee.</p>
<p>135. As a cowherd with his staff drives his cows into
the stable, so</p>
<p>do Age and Death drive the life of men.</p>
<p>136. A fool does not know when he commits his evil
deeds: but the</p>
<p>wicked man burns by his own deeds, as if burnt by fire.</p>
<p>137. He who inflicts pain on innocent and harmless
persons, will soon</p>
<p>come to one of these ten states:</p>
<p>138. He will have cruel suffering, loss, injury of the
body, heavy</p>
<p>affliction, or loss of mind,</p>
<p>139. Or a misfortune coming from the king, or a fearful
accusation, or</p>
<p>loss of relations, or destruction of treasures,</p>
<p>140. Or lightning-fire will burn his houses; and when
his body is</p>
<p>destroyed, the fool will go to hell.</p>
<p>141. Not nakedness, not platted hair, not dirt, not
fasting, or lying</p>
<p>on the earth, not rubbing with dust, not sitting
motionless, can</p>
<p>purify a mortal who has not overcome desires.</p>
<p>142. He who, though dressed in fine apparel, exercises tranquillity,</p>
<p>is quiet, subdued, restrained, chaste, and has ceased to
find fault</p>
<p>with all other beings, he indeed is a Brahmana, an
ascetic (sramana),</p>
<p>a friar (bhikshu).</p>
<p>143. Is there in this world any man so restrained by
humility that he</p>
<p>does not mind reproof, as a well-trained horse the whip?</p>
<p>144. Like a well-trained horse when touched by the whip,
be ye active</p>
<p>and lively, and by faith, by virtue, by energy, by
meditation, by</p>
<p>discernment of the law you will overcome this great pain
(of reproof),</p>
<p>perfect in knowledge and in behaviour, and never
forgetful.</p>
<p>145. Well-makers lead the water (wherever they like);
fletchers bend</p>
<p>the arrow; carpenters bend a log of wood; good people
fashion</p>
<p>themselves.</p>
<font SIZE="2">

<p>Chapter XI</p>
<p>Old Age</p>
<p>146. How is there laughter, how is there joy, as this
world is always</p>
<p>burning? Why do you not seek a light, ye who are
surrounded by</p>
<p>darkness?</p>
<p>147. Look at this dressed-up lump, covered with wounds,
joined</p>
<p>together, sickly, full of many thoughts, which has no
strength, no</p>
<p>hold!</p>
<p>148. This body is wasted, full of sickness, and frail;
this heap of</p>
<p>corruption breaks to pieces, life indeed ends in death.</p>
<p>149. Those white bones, like gourds thrown away in the
autumn, what</p>
<p>pleasure is there in looking at them?</p>
<p>150. After a stronghold has been made of the bones, it
is covered with</p>
<p>flesh and blood, and there dwell in it old age and
death, pride and</p>
<p>deceit.</p>
<p>151. The brilliant chariots of kings are destroyed, the
body also</p>
<p>approaches destruction, but the virtue of good people
never approaches</p>
<p>destruction,--thus do the good say to the good.</p>
<p>152. A man who has learnt little, grows old like an ox;
his flesh</p>
<p>grows, but his knowledge does not grow.</p>
<p>153, 154. Looking for the maker of this tabernacle, I
shall have to</p>
<p>run through a course of many births, so long as I do not
find (him);</p>
<p>and painful is birth again and again. But now, maker of
the</p>
<p>tabernacle, thou hast been seen; thou shalt not make up
this</p>
<p>tabernacle again. All thy rafters are broken, thy
ridge-pole is</p>
<p>sundered; the mind, approaching the Eternal (visankhara,
nirvana), has</p>
<p>attained to the extinction of all desires.</p>
<p>155. Men who have not observed proper discipline, and
have not gained</p>
<p>treasure in their youth, perish like old herons in a
lake without</p>
<p>fish.</p>
<p>156. Men who have not observed proper discipline, and
have not gained</p>
<p>treasure in their youth, lie, like broken bows, sighing
after the</p>
<p>past.</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p>Chapter XII</p>
<p>Self</p>
<p>157. If a man hold himself dear, let him watch himself
carefully;</p>
<p>during one at least out of the three watches a wise man
should be</p>
<p>watchful.</p>
<p>158. Let each man direct himself first to what is
proper, then let him</p>
<p>teach others; thus a wise man will not suffer.</p>
<p>159. If a man make himself as he teaches others to be,
then, being</p>
<p>himself well subdued, he may subdue (others); one's own
self is indeed</p>
<p>difficult to subdue.</p>
<p>160. Self is the lord of self, who else could be the
lord? With self</p>
<p>well subdued, a man finds a lord such as few can find.</p>
<p>161. The evil done by oneself, self-begotten, self-bred,
crushes the</p>
<p>foolish, as a diamond breaks a precious stone.</p>
<p>162. He whose wickedness is very great brings himself
down to that</p>
<p>state where his enemy wishes him to be, as a creeper
does with the</p>
<p>tree which it surrounds.</p>
<p>163. Bad deeds, and deeds hurtful to ourselves, are easy
to do; what</p>
<p>is beneficial and good, that is very difficult to do.</p>
<p>164. The foolish man who scorns the rule of the
venerable (Arahat), of</p>
<p>the elect (Ariya), of the virtuous, and follows false
doctrine, he</p>
<p>bears fruit to his own destruction, like the fruits of
the Katthaka</p>
<p>reed.</p>
<p>165. By oneself the evil is done, by oneself one
suffers; by oneself</p>
<p>evil is left undone, by oneself one is purified. Purity
and impurity</p>
<p>belong to oneself, no one can purify another.</p>
<p>166. Let no one forget his own duty for the sake of
another's, however</p>
<p>great; let a man, after he has discerned his own duty,
be always</p>
<p>attentive to his duty.</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p>Chapter XIII</p>
<p>The World</p>
<p>167. Do not follow the evil law! Do not live on in
thoughtlessness! Do</p>
<p>not follow false doctrine! Be not a friend of the world.</p>
<p>168. Rouse thyself! do not be idle! Follow the law of
virtue! The</p>
<p>virtuous rests in bliss in this world and in the next.</p>
<p>169. Follow the law of virtue; do not follow that of
sin. The virtuous</p>
<p>rests in bliss in this world and in the next.</p>
<p>170. Look upon the world as a bubble, look upon it as a
mirage: the</p>
<p>king of death does not see him who thus looks down upon
the world.</p>
<p>171. Come, look at this glittering world, like unto a
royal chariot;</p>
<p>the foolish are immersed in it, but the wise do not
touch it.</p>
<p>172. He who formerly was reckless and afterwards became
sober,</p>
<p>brightens up this world, like the moon when freed from
clouds.</p>
<p>173. He whose evil deeds are covered by good deeds,
brightens up this</p>
<p>world, like the moon when freed from clouds.</p>
<p>174. This world is dark, few only can see here; a few
only go to</p>
<p>heaven, like birds escaped from the net.</p>
<p>175. The swans go on the path of the sun, they go
through the ether by</p>
<p>means of their miraculous power; the wise are led out of
this world,</p>
<p>when they have conquered Mara and his train.</p>
<p>176. If a man has transgressed one law, and speaks lies,
and scoffs at</p>
<p>another world, there is no evil he will not do.</p>
<p>177. The uncharitable do not go to the world of the
gods; fools only</p>
<p>do not praise liberality; a wise man rejoices in
liberality, and</p>
<p>through it becomes blessed in the other world.</p>
<p>178. Better than sovereignty over the earth, better than
going to</p>
<p>heaven, better than lordship over all worlds, is the
reward of the</p>
<p>first step in holiness.</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p>Chapter XIV</p>
<p>The Buddha (The Awakened)</p>
<p>179. He whose conquest is not conquered again, into
whose conquest no</p>
<p>one in this world enters, by what track can you lead
him, the</p>
<p>Awakened, the Omniscient, the trackless?</p>
<p>180. He whom no desire with its snares and poisons can
lead astray, by</p>
<p>what track can you lead him, the Awakened, the
Omniscient, the</p>
<p>trackless?</p>
<p>181. Even the gods envy those who are awakened and not
forgetful, who</p>
<p>are given to meditation, who are wise, and who delight
in the repose</p>
<p>of retirement (from the world).</p>
<p>182. Difficult (to obtain) is the conception of men,
difficult is the</p>
<p>life of mortals, difficult is the hearing of the True
Law, difficult</p>
<p>is the birth of the Awakened (the attainment of
Buddhahood).</p>
<p>183. Not to commit any sin, to do good, and to purify
one's mind, that</p>
<p>is the teaching of (all) the Awakened.</p>
<p>184. The Awakened call patience the highest penance,
long-suffering</p>
<p>the highest Nirvana; for he is not an anchorite (pravragita)
who</p>
<p>strikes others, he is not an ascetic (sramana) who
insults others.</p>
<p>185. Not to blame, not to strike, to live restrained
under the law, to</p>
<p>be moderate in eating, to sleep and sit alone, and to
dwell on the</p>
<p>highest thoughts,--this is the teaching of the Awakened.</p>
<p>186. There is no satisfying lusts, even by a shower of
gold pieces; he</p>
<p>who knows that lusts have a short taste and cause pain,
he is wise;</p>
<p>187. Even in heavenly pleasures he finds no
satisfaction, the disciple</p>
<p>who is fully awakened delights only in the destruction
of all desires.</p>
<p>188. Men, driven by fear, go to many a refuge, to
mountains and</p>
<p>forests, to groves and sacred trees.</p>
<p>189. But that is not a safe refuge, that is not the best
refuge; a man</p>
<p>is not delivered from all pains after having gone to
that refuge.</p>
<p>190. He who takes refuge with Buddha, the Law, and the
Church; he who,</p>
<p>with clear understanding, sees the four holy truths:--</p>
<p>191. Viz. pain, the origin of pain, the destruction of
pain, and the</p>
<p>eightfold holy way that leads to the quieting of pain;--</p>
<p>192. That is the safe refuge, that is the best refuge;
having gone to</p>
<p>that refuge, a man is delivered from all pain.</p>
<p>193. A supernatural person (a Buddha) is not easily
found, he is not</p>
<p>born everywhere. Wherever such a sage is born, that race
prospers.</p>
<p>194. Happy is the arising of the awakened, happy is the
teaching of</p>
<p>the True Law, happy is peace in the church, happy is the
devotion of</p>
<p>those who are at peace.</p>
<p>195, 196. He who pays homage to those who deserve
homage, whether the</p>
<p>awakened (Buddha) or their disciples, those who have
overcome the host</p>
<p>(of evils), and crossed the flood of sorrow, he who pays
homage to</p>
<p>such as have found deliverance and know no fear, his
merit can never</p>
<p>be measured by anybody.</p>
<font SIZE="2">

<p>Chapter XV</p>
<p>Happiness</p>
<p>197. Let us live happily then, not hating those who hate
us! among men</p>
<p>who hate us let us dwell free from hatred!</p>
<p>198. Let us live happily then, free from ailments among
the ailing!</p>
<p>among men who are ailing let us dwell free from
ailments!</p>
<p>199. Let us live happily then, free from greed among the
greedy! among</p>
<p>men who are greedy let us dwell free from greed!</p>
<p>200. Let us live happily then, though we call nothing
our own! We</p>
<p>shall be like the bright gods, feeding on happiness!</p>
<p>201. Victory breeds hatred, for the conquered is
unhappy. He who has</p>
<p>given up both victory and defeat, he, the contented, is
happy.</p>
<p>202. There is no fire like passion; there is no losing
throw like</p>
<p>hatred; there is no pain like this body; there is no
happiness higher</p>
<p>than rest.</p>
<p>203. Hunger is the worst of diseases, the body the
greatest of pains;</p>
<p>if one knows this truly, that is Nirvana, the highest
happiness.</p>
<p>204. Health is the greatest of gifts, contentedness the
best riches;</p>
<p>trust is the best of relationships, Nirvana the highest
happiness.</p>
<p>205. He who has tasted the sweetness of solitude and tranquillity, is</p>
<p>free from fear and free from sin, while he tastes the
sweetness of</p>
<p>drinking in the law.</p>
<p>206. The sight of the elect (Arya) is good, to live with
them is</p>
<p>always happiness; if a man does not see fools, he will
be truly happy.</p>
<p>207. He who walks in the company of fools suffers a long
way; company</p>
<p>with fools, as with an enemy, is always painful; company
with the wise</p>
<p>is pleasure, like meeting with kinsfolk.</p>
<p>208. Therefore, one ought to follow the wise, the
intelligent, the</p>
<p>learned, the much enduring, the dutiful, the elect; one
ought to</p>
<p>follow a good and wise man, as the moon follows the path
of the stars.</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p>Chapter XVI</p>
<p>Pleasure</p>
<p>209. He who gives himself to vanity, and does not give
himself to</p>
<p>meditation, forgetting the real aim (of life) and
grasping at</p>
<p>pleasure, will in time envy him who has exerted himself
in meditation.</p>
<p>210. Let no man ever look for what is pleasant, or what
is unpleasant.</p>
<p>Not to see what is pleasant is pain, and it is pain to
see what is</p>
<p>unpleasant.</p>
<p>211. Let, therefore, no man love anything; loss of the
beloved is</p>
<p>evil. Those who love nothing and hate nothing, have no
fetters.</p>
<p>212. From pleasure comes grief, from pleasure comes
fear; he who is</p>
<p>free from pleasure knows neither grief nor fear.</p>
<p>213. From affection comes grief, from affection comes
fear; he who is</p>
<p>free from affection knows neither grief nor fear.</p>
<p>214. From lust comes grief, from lust comes fear; he who
is free from</p>
<p>lust knows neither grief nor fear.</p>
<p>215. From love comes grief, from love comes fear; he who
is free from</p>
<p>love knows neither grief nor fear.</p>
<p>216. From greed comes grief, from greed comes fear; he
who is free</p>
<p>from greed knows neither grief nor fear.</p>
<p>217. He who possesses virtue and intelligence, who is
just, speaks the</p>
<p>truth, and does what is his own business, him the world
will hold</p>
<p>dear.</p>
<p>218. He in whom a desire for the Ineffable (Nirvana) has
sprung up,</p>
<p>who is satisfied in his mind, and whose thoughts are not
bewildered by</p>
<p>love, he is called urdhvamsrotas (carried upwards by the
stream).</p>
<p>219. Kinsmen, friends, and lovers salute a man who has
been long away,</p>
<p>and returns safe from afar.</p>
<p>220. In like manner his good works receive him who has
done good, and</p>
<p>has gone from this world to the other;--as kinsmen
receive a friend on</p>
<p>his return.</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p>Chapter XVII</p>
<p>Anger</p>
<p>221. Let a man leave anger, let him forsake pride, let
him overcome</p>
<p>all bondage! No sufferings befall the man who is not
attached to name</p>
<p>and form, and who calls nothing his own.</p>
<p>222. He who holds back rising anger like a rolling
chariot, him I call</p>
<p>a real driver; other people are but holding the reins.</p>
<p>223. Let a man overcome anger by love, let him overcome
evil by good;</p>
<p>let him overcome the greedy by liberality, the liar by
truth!</p>
<p>224. Speak the truth, do not yield to anger; give, if
thou art asked</p>
<p>for little; by these three steps thou wilt go near the
gods.</p>
<p>225. The sages who injure nobody, and who always control
their body,</p>
<p>they will go to the unchangeable place (Nirvana), where,
if they have</p>
<p>gone, they will suffer no more.</p>
<p>226. Those who are ever watchful, who study day and
night, and who</p>
<p>strive after Nirvana, their passions will come to an
end.</p>
<p>227. This is an old saying, O Atula, this is not only of
to-day: `They</p>
<p>blame him who sits silent, they blame him who speaks
much, they also</p>
<p>blame him who says little; there is no one on earth who
is not</p>
<p>blamed.'</p>
<p>228. There never was, there never will be, nor is there
now, a man who</p>
<p>is always blamed, or a man who is always praised.</p>
<p>229, 230. But he whom those who discriminate praise
continually day</p>
<p>after day, as without blemish, wise, rich in knowledge
and virtue, who</p>
<p>would dare to blame him, like a coin made of gold from
the Gambu</p>
<p>river? Even the gods praise him, he is praised even by
Brahman.</p>
<p>231. Beware of bodily anger, and control thy body! Leave
the sins of</p>
<p>the body, and with thy body practise virtue!</p>
<p>232. Beware of the anger of the tongue, and control thy
tongue! Leave</p>
<p>the sins of the tongue, and practise virtue with thy
tongue!</p>
<p>233. Beware of the anger of the mind, and control thy
mind! Leave the</p>
<p>sins of the mind, and practise virtue with thy mind!</p>
<p>234. The wise who control their body, who control their
tongue, the</p>
<p>wise who control their mind, are indeed well controlled.</p>
<font SIZE="2">

</font>
<p>Chapter XVIII</p>
<p>Impurity</p>
<p>235. Thou art now like a sear leaf, the messengers of
death (Yama)</p>
<p>have come near to thee; thou standest at the door of thy
departure,</p>
<p>and thou hast no provision for thy journey.</p>
<p>236. Make thyself an island, work hard, be wise! When
thy impurities</p>
<p>are blown away, and thou art free from guilt, thou wilt
enter into the</p>
<p>heavenly world of the elect (Ariya).</p>
<p>237. Thy life has come to an end, thou art come near to
death (Yama),</p>
<p>there is no resting-place for thee on the road, and thou
hast no</p>
<p>provision for thy journey.</p>
<p>238. Make thyself an island, work hard, be wise! When
thy impurities</p>
<p>are blown away, and thou art free from guilt, thou wilt
not enter</p>
<p>again into birth and decay.</p>
<p>239. Let a wise man blow off the impurities of his self,
as a smith</p>
<p>blows off the impurities of silver one by one, little by
little, and</p>
<p>from time to time.</p>
<p>240. As the impurity which springs from the iron, when
it springs from</p>
<p>it, destroys it; thus do a transgressor's own works lead
him to the</p>
<p>evil path.</p>
<p>241. The taint of prayers is non-repetition; the taint
of houses, non-</p>
<p>repair; the taint of the body is sloth; the taint of a
watchman,</p>
<p>thoughtlessness.</p>
<p>242. Bad conduct is the taint of woman, greediness the
taint of a</p>
<p>benefactor; tainted are all evil ways in this world and
in the next.</p>
<p>243. But there is a taint worse than all
taints,--ignorance is the</p>
<p>greatest taint. O mendicants! throw off that taint, and
become</p>
<p>taintless!</p>
<p>244. Life is easy to live for a man who is without
shame, a crow hero,</p>
<p>a mischief-maker, an insulting, bold, and wretched
fellow.</p>
<p>245. But life is hard to live for a modest man, who
always looks for</p>
<p>what is pure, who is disinterested, quiet, spotless, and
intelligent.</p>
<p>246. He who destroys life, who speaks untruth, who in
this world takes</p>
<p>what is not given him, who goes to another man's wife;</p>
<p>247. And the man who gives himself to drinking
intoxicating liquors,</p>
<p>he, even in this world, digs up his own root.</p>
<p>248. O man, know this, that the unrestrained are in a
bad state; take</p>
<p>care that greediness and vice do not bring thee to grief
for a long</p>
<p>time!</p>
<p>249. The world gives according to their faith or
according to their</p>
<p>pleasure: if a man frets about the food and the drink
given to others,</p>
<p>he will find no rest either by day or by night.</p>
<p>250. He in whom that feeling is destroyed, and taken out
with the very</p>
<p>root, finds rest by day and by night.</p>
<p>251. There is no fire like passion, there is no shark
like hatred,</p>
<p>there is no snare like folly, there is no torrent like
greed.</p>
<p>252. The fault of others is easily perceived, but that
of oneself is</p>
<p>difficult to perceive; a man winnows his neighbour's
faults like</p>
<p>chaff, but his own fault he hides, as a cheat hides the
bad die from</p>
<p>the gambler.</p>
<p>253. If a man looks after the faults of others, and is
always inclined</p>
<p>to be offended, his own passions will grow, and he is
far from the</p>
<p>destruction of passions.</p>
<p>254. There is no path through the air, a man is not a
Samana by</p>
<p>outward acts. The world delights in vanity, the
Tathagatas (the</p>
<p>Buddhas) are free from vanity.</p>
<p>255. There is no path through the air, a man is not a
Samana by</p>
<p>outward acts. No creatures are eternal; but the awakened
(Buddha) are</p>
<p>never shaken.</p>

<p>Chapter XIX</p>
<p>The Just</p>
<p>256, 257. A man is not just if he carries a matter by
violence; no, he</p>
<p>who distinguishes both right and wrong, who is learned
and leads</p>
<p>others, not by violence, but by law and equity, and who
is guarded by</p>
<p>the law and intelligent, he is called just.</p>
<p>258. A man is not learned because he talks much; he who
is patient,</p>
<p>free from hatred and fear, he is called learned.</p>
<p>259. A man is not a supporter of the law because he
talks much; even</p>
<p>if a man has learnt little, but sees the law bodily, he
is a supporter</p>
<p>of the law, a man who never neglects the law.</p>
<p>260. A man is not an elder because his head is grey; his
age may be</p>
<p>ripe, but he is called `Old-in-vain.'</p>
<p>261. He in whom there is truth, virtue, love, restraint,
moderation,</p>
<p>he who is free from impurity and is wise, he is called
an elder.</p>
<p>262. An envious greedy, dishonest man does not become
respectable by</p>
<p>means of much talking only, or by the beauty of his
complexion.</p>
<p>263. He in whom all this is destroyed, and taken out
with the very</p>
<p>root, he, when freed from hatred and wise, is called
respectable.</p>
<p>264. Not by tonsure does an undisciplined man who speaks
falsehood</p>
<p>become a Samana; can a man be a Samana who is still held
captive by</p>
<p>desire and greediness?</p>
<p>265. He who always quiets the evil, whether small or
large, he is</p>
<p>called a Samana (a quiet man), because he has quieted
all evil.</p>
<p>266. A man is not a mendicant (Bhikshu) simply because
he asks others</p>
<p>for alms; he who adopts the whole law is a Bhikshu, not
he who only</p>
<p>begs.</p>
<p>267. He who is above good and evil, who is chaste, who
with knowledge</p>
<p>passes through the world, he indeed is called a Bhikshu.</p>
<p>268, 269. A man is not a Muni because he observes
silence (mona, i.e.</p>
<p>mauna), if he is foolish and ignorant; but the wise who,
taking the</p>
<p>balance, chooses the good and avoids evil, he is a Muni,
and is a Muni</p>
<p>thereby; he who in this world weighs both sides is
called a Muni.</p>
<p>270. A man is not an elect (Ariya) because he injures
living</p>
<p>creatures; because he has pity on all living creatures,
therefore is a</p>
<p>man called Ariya.</p>
<p>271, 272. Not only by discipline and vows, not only by
much learning,</p>
<p>not by entering into a trance, not by sleeping alone, do
I earn the</p>
<p>happiness of release which no worldling can know.
Bhikshu, be not</p>
<p>confident as long as thou hast not attained the
extinction of desires.</p>

<p>Chapter XX</p>
<p>The Way</p>
<p>273. The best of ways is the eightfold; the best of
truths the four</p>
<p>words; the best of virtues passionlessness; the best of
men he who has</p>
<p>eyes to see.</p>
<p>274. This is the way, there is no other that leads to
the purifying of</p>
<p>intelligence. Go on this way! Everything else is the
deceit of Mara</p>
<p>(the tempter).</p>
<p>275. If you go on this way, you will make an end of
pain! The way was</p>
<p>preached by me, when I had understood the removal of the
thorns (in</p>
<p>the flesh).</p>
<p>276. You yourself must make an effort. The Tathagatas
(Buddhas) are</p>
<p>only preachers. The thoughtful who enter the way are
freed from the</p>
<p>bondage of Mara.</p>
<p>277. `All created things perish,' he who knows and sees
this becomes</p>
<p>passive in pain; this is the way to purity.</p>
<p>278. `All created things are grief and pain,' he who
knows and sees</p>
<p>this becomes passive in pain; this is the way that leads
to purity.</p>
<p>279. `All forms are unreal,' he who knows and sees this
becomes</p>
<p>passive in pain; this is the way that leads to purity.</p>
<p>280. He who does not rouse himself when it is time to
rise, who,</p>
<p>though young and strong, is full of sloth, whose will
and thought are</p>
<p>weak, that lazy and idle man will never find the way to
knowledge.</p>
<p>281. Watching his speech, well restrained in mind, let a
man never</p>
<p>commit any wrong with his body! Let a man but keep these
three roads</p>
<p>of action clear, and he will achieve the way which is
taught by the</p>
<p>wise.</p>
<p>282. Through zeal knowledge is gotten, through lack of
zeal knowledge</p>
<p>is lost; let a man who knows this double path of gain
and loss thus</p>
<p>place himself that knowledge may grow.</p>
<p>283. Cut down the whole forest (of lust), not a tree
only! Danger</p>
<p>comes out of the forest (of lust). When you have cut
down both the</p>
<p>forest (of lust) and its undergrowth, then, Bhikshus,
you will be rid</p>
<p>of the forest and free!</p>
<p>284. So long as the love of man towards women, even the
smallest, is</p>
<p>not destroyed, so long is his mind in bondage, as the
calf that drinks</p>
<p>milk is to its mother.</p>
<p>285. Cut out the love of self, like an autumn lotus,
with thy hand!</p>
<p>Cherish the road of peace. Nirvana has been shown by
Sugata (Buddha).</p>
<p>286. `Here I shall dwell in the rain, here in winter and
summer,' thus</p>
<p>the fool meditates, and does not think of his death.</p>
<p>287. Death comes and carries off that man, praised for
his children</p>
<p>and flocks, his mind distracted, as a flood carries off
a sleeping</p>
<p>village.</p>
<p>288. Sons are no help, nor a father, nor relations;
there is no help</p>
<p>from kinsfolk for one whom death has seized.</p>
<p>289. A wise and good man who knows the meaning of this,
should quickly</p>
<p>clear the way that leads to Nirvana.</p>

<p>Chapter XXI</p>
<p>Miscellaneous</p>
<p>290. If by leaving a small pleasure one sees a great
pleasure, let a</p>
<p>wise man leave the small pleasure, and look to the
great.</p>
<p>291. He who, by causing pain to others, wishes to obtain
pleasure for</p>
<p>himself, he, entangled in the bonds of hatred, will
never be free from</p>
<p>hatred.</p>
<p>292. What ought to be done is neglected, what ought not
to be done is</p>
<p>done; the desires of unruly, thoughtless people are
always increasing.</p>
<p>293. But they whose whole watchfulness is always
directed to their</p>
<p>body, who do not follow what ought not to be done, and
who steadfastly</p>
<p>do what ought to be done, the desires of such watchful
and wise people</p>
<p>will come to an end.</p>
<p>294. A true Brahmana goes scatheless, though he have
killed father and</p>
<p>mother, and two valiant kings, though he has destroyed a
kingdom with</p>
<p>all its subjects.</p>
<p>295. A true Brahmana goes scatheless, though he have
killed father and</p>
<p>mother, and two holy kings, and an eminent man besides.</p>
<p>296. The disciples of Gotama (Buddha) are always well
awake, and their</p>
<p>thoughts day and night are always set on Buddha.</p>
<p>297. The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and
their thoughts</p>
<p>day and night are always set on the law.</p>
<p>298. The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and
their thoughts</p>
<p>day and night are always set on the church.</p>
<p>299. The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and
their thoughts</p>
<p>day and night are always set on their body.</p>
<p>300. The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and
their mind day</p>
<p>and night always delights in compassion.</p>
<p>301. The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and
their mind day</p>
<p>and night always delights in meditation.</p>
<p>302. It is hard to leave the world (to become a friar),
it is hard to</p>
<p>enjoy the world; hard is the monastery, painful are the
houses;</p>
<p>painful it is to dwell with equals (to share everything
in common) and</p>
<p>the itinerant mendicant is beset with pain. Therefore
let no man be</p>
<p>an itinerant mendicant and he will not be beset with
pain.</p>
<p>303. Whatever place a faithful, virtuous, celebrated,
and wealthy man</p>
<p>chooses, there he is respected.</p>
<p>304. Good people shine from afar, like the snowy
mountains; bad people</p>
<p>are not seen, like arrows shot by night.</p>
<p>305. He alone who, without ceasing, practises the duty
of sitting</p>
<p>alone and sleeping alone, he, subduing himself, will
rejoice in the</p>
<p>destruction of all desires alone, as if living in a
forest.</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p>Chapter XXII</p>
<p>The Downward Course</p>
<p>306. He who says what is not, goes to hell; he also who,
having done a</p>
<p>thing, says I have not done it. After death both are
equal, they are</p>
<p>men with evil deeds in the next world.</p>
<p>307. Many men whose shoulders are covered with the
yellow gown are</p>
<p>ill-conditioned and unrestrained; such evil-doers by
their evil deeds</p>
<p>go to hell.</p>
<p>308. Better it would be to swallow a heated iron ball,
like flaring</p>
<p>fire, than that a bad unrestrained fellow should live on
the charity</p>
<p>of the land.</p>
<p>309. Four things does a wreckless man gain who covets
his neighbour's</p>
<p>wife,--a bad reputation, an uncomfortable bed, thirdly,
punishment,</p>
<p>and lastly, hell.</p>
<p>310. There is bad reputation, and the evil way (to
hell), there is the</p>
<p>short pleasure of the frightened in the arms of the
frightened, and</p>
<p>the king imposes heavy punishment; therefore let no man
think of his</p>
<p>neighbour's wife.</p>
<p>311. As a grass-blade, if badly grasped, cuts the arm, badly-practised</p>
<p>asceticism leads to hell.</p>
<p>312. An act carelessly performed, a broken vow, and
hesitating</p>
<p>obedience to discipline, all this brings no great
reward.</p>
<p>313. If anything is to be done, let a man do it, let him
attack it</p>
<p>vigorously! A careless pilgrim only scatters the dust of
his passions</p>
<p>more widely.</p>
<p>314. An evil deed is better left undone, for a man
repents of it</p>
<p>afterwards; a good deed is better done, for having done
it, one does</p>
<p>not repent.</p>
<p>315. Like a well-guarded frontier fort, with defences
within and</p>
<p>without, so let a man guard himself. Not a moment should
escape, for</p>
<p>they who allow the right moment to pass, suffer pain
when they are in</p>
<p>hell.</p>
<p>316. They who are ashamed of what they ought not to be
ashamed of, and</p>
<p>are not ashamed of what they ought to be ashamed of,
such men,</p>
<p>embracing false doctrines enter the evil path.</p>
<p>317. They who fear when they ought not to fear, and fear
not when they</p>
<p>ought to fear, such men, embracing false doctrines,
enter the evil</p>
<p>path.</p>
<p>318. They who forbid when there is nothing to be
forbidden, and forbid</p>
<p>not when there is something to be forbidden, such men,
embracing false</p>
<p>doctrines, enter the evil path.</p>
<p>319. They who know what is forbidden as forbidden, and
what is not</p>
<p>forbidden as not forbidden, such men, embracing the true
doctrine,</p>
<p>enter the good path.</p>

<p>Chapter XXIII</p>
<p>The Elephant</p>
<p>320. Silently shall I endure abuse as the elephant in
battle endures</p>
<p>the arrow sent from the bow: for the world is
ill-natured.</p>
<p>321. They lead a tamed elephant to battle, the king
mounts a tamed</p>
<p>elephant; the tamed is the best among men, he who
silently endures</p>
<p>abuse.</p>
<p>322. Mules are good, if tamed, and noble Sindhu horses,
and elephants</p>
<p>with large tusks; but he who tames himself is better
still.</p>
<p>323. For with these animals does no man reach the
untrodden country</p>
<p>(Nirvana), where a tamed man goes on a tamed animal,
viz. on his own</p>
<p>well-tamed self.</p>
<p>324. The elephant called Dhanapalaka, his temples
running with sap,</p>
<p>and difficult to hold, does not eat a morsel when bound;
the elephant</p>
<p>longs for the elephant grove.</p>
<p>325. If a man becomes fat and a great eater, if he is
sleepy and rolls</p>
<p>himself about, that fool, like a hog fed on wash, is
born again and</p>
<p>again.</p>
<p>326. This mind of mine went formerly wandering about as
it liked, as</p>
<p>it listed, as it pleased; but I shall now hold it in
thoroughly, as</p>
<p>the rider who holds the hook holds in the furious
elephant.</p>
<p>327. Be not thoughtless, watch your thoughts! Draw
yourself out of</p>
<p>the evil way, like an elephant sunk in mud.</p>
<p>328. If a man find a prudent companion who walks with
him, is wise,</p>
<p>and lives soberly, he may walk with him, overcoming all
dangers,</p>
<p>happy, but considerate.</p>
<p>329. If a man find no prudent companion who walks with
him, is wise,</p>
<p>and lives soberly, let him walk alone, like a king who
has left his</p>
<p>conquered country behind,--like an elephant in the
forest.</p>
<p>330. It is better to live alone, there is no
companionship with a</p>
<p>fool; let a man walk alone, let him commit no sin, with
few wishes,</p>
<p>like an elephant in the forest.</p>
<p>331. If an occasion arises, friends are pleasant;
enjoyment is</p>
<p>pleasant, whatever be the cause; a good work is pleasant
in the hour</p>
<p>of death; the giving up of all grief is pleasant.</p>
<p>332. Pleasant in the world is the state of a mother,
pleasant the</p>
<p>state of a father, pleasant the state of a Samana,
pleasant the state</p>
<p>of a Brahmana.</p>
<p>333. Pleasant is virtue lasting to old age, pleasant is
a faith firmly</p>
<p>rooted; pleasant is attainment of intelligence, pleasant
is avoiding</p>
<p>of sins.</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p>Chapter XXIV</p>
<p>Thirst</p>
<p>334. The thirst of a thoughtless man grows like a
creeper; he runs</p>
<p>from life to life, like a monkey seeking fruit in the
forest.</p>
<p>335. Whomsoever this fierce thirst overcomes, full of
poison, in this</p>
<p>world, his sufferings increase like the abounding Birana
grass.</p>
<p>336. He who overcomes this fierce thirst, difficult to
be conquered in</p>
<p>this world, sufferings fall off from him, like
water-drops from a</p>
<p>lotus leaf.</p>
<p>337. This salutary word I tell you, `Do ye, as many as
are here</p>
<p>assembled, dig up the root of thirst, as he who wants
the sweet-</p>
<p>scented Usira root must dig up the Birana grass, that
Mara (the</p>
<p>tempter) may not crush you again and again, as the
stream crushes the</p>
<p>reeds.'</p>
<p>338. As a tree, even though it has been cut down, is
firm so long as</p>
<p>its root is safe, and grows again, thus, unless the
feeders of thirst</p>
<p>are destroyed, the pain (of life) will return again and
again.</p>
<p>339. He whose thirst running towards pleasure is
exceeding strong in</p>
<p>the thirty-six channels, the waves will carry away that
misguided man,</p>
<p>viz. his desires which are set on passion.</p>
<p>340. The channels run everywhere, the creeper (of
passion) stands</p>
<p>sprouting; if you see the creeper springing up, cut its
root by means</p>
<p>of knowledge.</p>
<p>341. A creature's pleasures are extravagant and
luxurious; sunk in</p>
<p>lust and looking for pleasure, men undergo (again and
again) birth and</p>
<p>decay.</p>
<p>342. Men, driven on by thirst, run about like a snared
hare; held in</p>
<p>fetters and bonds, they undergo pain for a long time,
again and again.</p>
<p>343. Men, driven on by thirst, run about like a snared
hare; let</p>
<p>therefore the mendicant drive out thirst, by striving
after</p>
<p>passionlessness for himself.</p>
<p>344. He who having got rid of the forest (of lust) (i.e.
after having</p>
<p>reached Nirvana) gives himself over to forest-life (i.e.
to lust), and</p>
<p>who, when removed from the forest (i.e. from lust), runs
to the forest</p>
<p>(i.e. to lust), look at that man! though free, he runs
into bondage.</p>
<p>345. Wise people do not call that a strong fetter which
is made of</p>
<p>iron, wood, or hemp; far stronger is the care for
precious stones and</p>
<p>rings, for sons and a wife.</p>
<p>346. That fetter wise people call strong which drags
down, yields, but</p>
<p>is difficult to undo; after having cut this at last,
people leave the</p>
<p>world, free from cares, and leaving desires and
pleasures behind.</p>
<p>347. Those who are slaves to passions, run down with the
stream (of</p>
<p>desires), as a spider runs down the web which he has
made himself;</p>
<p>when they have cut this, at last, wise people leave the
world free</p>
<p>from cares, leaving all affection behind.</p>
<p>348. Give up what is before, give up what is behind,
give up what is</p>
<p>in the middle, when thou goest to the other shore of
existence; if thy</p>
<p>mind is altogether free, thou wilt not again enter into
birth and</p>
<p>decay.</p>
<p>349. If a man is tossed about by doubts, full of strong
passions, and</p>
<p>yearning only for what is delightful, his thirst will
grow more and</p>
<p>more, and he will indeed make his fetters strong.</p>
<p>350. If a man delights in quieting doubts, and, always
reflecting,</p>
<p>dwells on what is not delightful (the impurity of the
body, &amp;c.), he</p>
<p>certainly will remove, nay, he will cut the fetter of
Mara.</p>
<p>351. He who has reached the consummation, who does not
tremble, who is</p>
<p>without thirst and without sin, he has broken all the
thorns of life:</p>
<p>this will be his last body.</p>
<p>352. He who is without thirst and without affection, who
understands</p>
<p>the words and their interpretation, who knows the order
of letters</p>
<p>(those which are before and which are after), he has
received his last</p>
<p>body, he is called the great sage, the great man.</p>
<p>353. `I have conquered all, I know all, in all
conditions of life I am</p>
<p>free from taint; I have left all, and through the
destruction of</p>
<p>thirst I am free; having learnt myself, whom shall I
teach?'</p>
<p>354. The gift of the law exceeds all gifts; the
sweetness of the law</p>
<p>exceeds all sweetness; the delight in the law exceeds
all delights;</p>
<p>the extinction of thirst overcomes all pain.</p>
<p>355. Pleasures destroy the foolish, if they look not for
the other</p>
<p>shore; the foolish by his thirst for pleasures destroys
himself, as if</p>
<p>he were his own enemy.</p>
<p>356. The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged
by passion:</p>
<p>therefore a gift bestowed on the passionless brings
great reward.</p>
<p>357. The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged
by hatred:</p>
<p>therefore a gift bestowed on those who do not hate
brings great</p>
<p>reward.</p>
<p>358. The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged
by vanity:</p>
<p>therefore a gift bestowed on those who are free from
vanity brings</p>
<p>great reward.</p>
<p>359. The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged
by lust:</p>
<p>therefore a gift bestowed on those who are free from
lust brings great</p>
<p>reward.</p>

<p>Chapter XXV</p>
<p>The Bhikshu (Mendicant)</p>
<p>360. Restraint in the eye is good, good is restraint in
the ear, in</p>
<p>the nose restraint is good, good is restraint in the
tongue.</p>
<p>361. In the body restraint is good, good is restraint in
speech, in</p>
<p>thought restraint is good, good is restraint in all
things. A</p>
<p>Bhikshu, restrained in all things, is freed from all
pain.</p>
<p>362. He who controls his hand, he who controls his feet,
he who</p>
<p>controls his speech, he who is well controlled, he who
delights</p>
<p>inwardly, who is collected, who is solitary and content,
him they call</p>
<p>Bhikshu.</p>
<p>363. The Bhikshu who controls his mouth, who speaks
wisely and calmly,</p>
<p>who teaches the meaning and the law, his word is sweet.</p>
<p>364. He who dwells in the law, delights in the law,
meditates on the</p>
<p>law, follows the law, that Bhikshu will never fall away
from the true</p>
<p>law.</p>
<p>365. Let him not despise what he has received, nor ever
envy others: a</p>
<p>mendicant who envies others does not obtain peace of
mind.</p>
<p>366. A Bhikshu who, though he receives little, does not
despise what</p>
<p>he has received, even the gods will praise him, if his
life is pure,</p>
<p>and if he is not slothful.</p>
<p>367. He who never identifies himself with name and form,
and does not</p>
<p>grieve over what is no more, he indeed is called a Bhikshu.</p>
<p>368. The Bhikshu who acts with kindness, who is calm in
the doctrine</p>
<p>of Buddha, will reach the quiet place (Nirvana),
cessation of natural</p>
<p>desires, and happiness.</p>
<p>369. O Bhikshu, empty this boat! if emptied, it will go
quickly;</p>
<p>having cut off passion and hatred thou wilt go to
Nirvana.</p>
<p>370. Cut off the five (senses), leave the five, rise
above the five.</p>
<p>A Bhikshu, who has escaped from the five fetters, he is
called</p>
<p>Oghatinna, `saved from the flood.'</p>
<p>371. Meditate, O Bhikshu, and be not heedless! Do not
direct thy</p>
<p>thought to what gives pleasure that thou mayest not for
thy</p>
<p>heedlessness have to swallow the iron ball (in hell),
and that thou</p>
<p>mayest not cry out when burning, `This is pain.'</p>
<p>372. Without knowledge there is no meditation, without
meditation</p>
<p>there is no knowledge: he who has knowledge and
meditation is near</p>
<p>unto Nirvana.</p>
<p>373. A Bhikshu who has entered his empty house, and
whose mind is</p>
<p>tranquil, feels a more than human delight when he sees
the law</p>
<p>clearly.</p>
<p>374. As soon as he has considered the origin and
destruction of the</p>
<p>elements (khandha) of the body, he finds happiness and
joy which</p>
<p>belong to those who know the immortal (Nirvana).</p>
<p>375. And this is the beginning here for a wise Bhikshu:
watchfulness</p>
<p>over the senses, contentedness, restraint under the law;
keep noble</p>
<p>friends whose life is pure, and who are not slothful.</p>
<p>376. Let him live in charity, let him be perfect in his
duties; then</p>
<p>in the fulness of delight he will make an end of
suffering.</p>
<p>377. As the Vassika plant sheds its withered flowers,
men should shed</p>
<p>passion and hatred, O ye Bhikshus!</p>
<p>378. The Bhikshu whose body and tongue and mind are
quieted, who is</p>
<p>collected, and has rejected the baits of the world, he
is called</p>
<p>quiet.</p>
<p>379. Rouse thyself by thyself, examine thyself by
thyself, thus self-</p>
<p>protected and attentive wilt thou live happily, O Bhikshu!</p>
<p>380. For self is the lord of self, self is the refuge of
self;</p>
<p>therefore curb thyself as the merchant curbs a good
horse.</p>
<p>381. The Bhikshu, full of delight, who is calm in the
doctrine of</p>
<p>Buddha will reach the quiet place (Nirvana), cessation
of natural</p>
<p>desires, and happiness.</p>
<p>382. He who, even as a young Bhikshu, applies himself to
the doctrine</p>
<p>of Buddha, brightens up this world, like the moon when
free from</p>
<p>clouds.</p>

<p>Chapter XXVI</p>
<p>The Brahmana (Arhat)</p>
<p>383. Stop the stream valiantly, drive away the desires,
O Brahmana!</p>
<p>When you have understood the destruction of all that was
made, you</p>
<p>will understand that which was not made.</p>
<p>384. If the Brahmana has reached the other shore in both
laws (in</p>
<p>restraint and contemplation), all bonds vanish from him
who has</p>
<p>obtained knowledge.</p>
<p>385. He for whom there is neither this nor that shore,
nor both, him,</p>
<p>the fearless and unshackled, I call indeed a Brahmana.</p>
<p>386. He who is thoughtful, blameless, settled, dutiful,
without</p>
<p>passions, and who has attained the highest end, him I
call indeed a</p>
<p>Brahmana.</p>
<p>387. The sun is bright by day, the moon shines by night,
the warrior</p>
<p>is bright in his armour, the Brahmana is bright in his
meditation; but</p>
<p>Buddha, the Awakened, is bright with splendour day and
night.</p>
<p>388. Because a man is rid of evil, therefore he is
called Brahmana;</p>
<p>because he walks quietly, therefore he is called Samana;
because he</p>
<p>has sent away his own impurities, therefore he is called
Pravragita</p>
<p>(Pabbagita, a pilgrim).</p>
<p>389. No one should attack a Brahmana, but no Brahmana
(if attacked)</p>
<p>should let himself fly at his aggressor! Woe to him who
strikes a</p>
<p>Brahmana, more woe to him who flies at his aggressor!</p>
<p>390. It advantages a Brahmana not a little if he holds
his mind back</p>
<p>from the pleasures of life; when all wish to injure has
vanished, pain</p>
<p>will cease.</p>
<p>391. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who does not offend by
body, word,</p>
<p>or thought, and is controlled on these three points.</p>
<p>392. After a man has once understood the law as taught
by the Well-</p>
<p>awakened (Buddha), let him worship it carefully, as the
Brahmana</p>
<p>worships the sacrificial fire.</p>
<p>393. A man does not become a Brahmana by his platted
hair, by his</p>
<p>family, or by birth; in whom there is truth and
righteousness, he is</p>
<p>blessed, he is a Brahmana.</p>
<p>394. What is the use of platted hair, O fool! what of
the raiment of</p>
<p>goat-skins? Within thee there is ravening, but the
outside thou</p>
<p>makest clean.</p>
<p>395. The man who wears dirty raiments, who is emaciated
and covered</p>
<p>with veins, who lives alone in the forest, and
meditates, him I call</p>
<p>indeed a Brahmana.</p>
<p>396. I do not call a man a Brahmana because of his
origin or of his</p>
<p>mother. He is indeed arrogant, and he is wealthy: but
the poor, who</p>
<p>is free from all attachments, him I call indeed a
Brahmana.</p>
<p>397. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has cut all
fetters, who never</p>
<p>trembles, is independent and unshackled.</p>
<p>398. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has cut the strap
and the thong,</p>
<p>the chain with all that pertains to it, who has burst
the bar, and is</p>
<p>awakened.</p>
<p>399. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who, though he has
committed no</p>
<p>offence, endures reproach, bonds, and stripes, who has
endurance for</p>
<p>his force, and strength for his army.</p>
<p>400. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who is free from
anger, dutiful,</p>
<p>virtuous, without appetite, who is subdued, and has
received his last</p>
<p>body.</p>
<p>401. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who does not cling to
pleasures,</p>
<p>like water on a lotus leaf, like a mustard seed on the
point of a</p>
<p>needle.</p>
<p>402. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who, even here, knows
the end of his</p>
<p>suffering, has put down his burden, and is unshackled.</p>
<p>403. Him I call indeed a Brahmana whose knowledge is
deep, who</p>
<p>possesses wisdom, who knows the right way and the wrong,
and has</p>
<p>attained the highest end.</p>
<p>404. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who keeps aloof both
from laymen and</p>
<p>from mendicants, who frequents no houses, and has but
few desires.</p>
<p>405. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who finds no fault
with other</p>
<p>beings, whether feeble or strong, and does not kill nor
cause</p>
<p>slaughter.</p>
<p>406. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who is tolerant with
the intolerant,</p>
<p>mild with fault-finders, and free from passion among the
passionate.</p>
<p>407. Him I call indeed a Brahmana from whom anger and
hatred, pride</p>
<p>and envy have dropt like a mustard seed from the point
of a needle.</p>
<p>408. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who utters true
speech, instructive</p>
<p>and free from harshness, so that he offend no one.</p>
<p>409. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who takes nothing in
the world that</p>
<p>is not given him, be it long or short, small or large,
good or bad.</p>
<p>410. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who fosters no desires
for this</p>
<p>world or for the next, has no inclinations, and is
unshackled.</p>
<p>411. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has no interests,
and when he</p>
<p>has understood (the truth), does not say How, how? and
who has reached</p>
<p>the depth of the Immortal.</p>
<p>412. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who in this world is
above good and</p>
<p>evil, above the bondage of both, free from grief from
sin, and from</p>
<p>impurity.</p>
<p>413. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who is bright like the
moon, pure,</p>
<p>serene, undisturbed, and in whom all gaiety is extinct.</p>
<p>414. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has traversed this
miry road,</p>
<p>the impassable world and its vanity, who has gone
through, and reached</p>
<p>the other shore, is thoughtful, guileless, free from
doubts, free from</p>
<p>attachment, and content.</p>
<p>415. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who in this world,
leaving all</p>
<p>desires, travels about without a home, and in whom all
concupiscence</p>
<p>is extinct.</p>
<p>416. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who, leaving all
longings, travels</p>
<p>about without a home, and in whom all covetousness is
extinct.</p>
<p>417. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who, after leaving all
bondage to</p>
<p>men, has risen above all bondage to the gods, and is
free from all and</p>
<p>every bondage.</p>
<p>418. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has left what
gives pleasure and</p>
<p>what gives pain, who is cold, and free from all germs
(of renewed</p>
<p>life), the hero who has conquered all the worlds.</p>
<p>419. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who knows the
destruction and the</p>
<p>return of beings everywhere, who is free from bondage,
welfaring</p>
<p>(Sugata), and awakened (Buddha).</p>
<p>420. Him I call indeed a Brahmana whose path the gods do
not know, nor</p>
<p>spirits (Gandharvas), nor men, whose passions are
extinct, and who is</p>
<p>an Arhat (venerable).</p>
<p>421. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who calls nothing his
own, whether</p>
<p>it be before, behind, or between, who is poor, and free
from the love</p>
<p>of the world.</p>
<p>422. Him I call indeed a Brahmana, the manly, the noble,
the hero, the</p>
<p>great sage, the conqueror, the impassible, the
accomplished, the</p>
<p>awakened.</p>
<p>423. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who knows his former
abodes, who</p>
<p>sees heaven and hell, has reached the end of births, is
perfect in</p>
<p>knowledge, a sage, and whose perfections are all
perfect.</p>
