<A name="100"></A><B>100.</B> Better than a thousand useless words is one useful word, hearing which one attains peace.
<p>
<A name="101"></A><B>101.</B> Better than a thousand useless verses is one useful verse, hearing which one attains peace.
<p>
<A name="102"></A><B>102.</B> Better than reciting a hundred meaningless verses is the reciting of one verse of Dhamma, hearing which one attains peace.
<p>
<A name="103"></A><B>103.</B> Though one may conquer a thousand times a thousand men in battle, yet he indeed is the noblest victor who conquers himself.
<p>
<A name="104-105"></A><B>104-105.</B> Self-conquest is far better then the conquest of others. Not even a god, an angel, Mara or Brahma can turn into defeat the victory of a person who is self-subdued and ever restrained in conduct.

<p>
<A name="106"></A><B>106.</B> Though month after month for a hundred years one should offer sacrifices by the thousands, yet if only for a moment one should worship those of perfected minds that honor is indeed better than a century of sacrifice.
<p>
<A name="107"></A><B>107.</B> Though for a hundred years one should tend the sacrificial fire in the forest, yet if only for a moment one should worship those of perfected minds, that worship is indeed better than a century of sacrifice.
<p>
<A name="108"></A><B>108.</B> Whatever gifts and oblations one seeking merit might offer in this world for a whole year, all that is not worth one fourth of the merit gained by revering the Upright Ones, which is truly excellent.
<p>
<A name="109"></A><B>109.</B> To one ever eager to revere and serve the elders, these four blessing accrue: long life and beauty, happiness and power.
<p>
<A name="110"></A><B>110.</B> Better it is to live one day virtuous and meditative than to live a hundred years immoral and uncontrolled.
<p>
<A name="111"></A><B>111.</B> Better it is to live one day wise and meditative than to live a hundred years foolish and uncontrolled.
<p>
<A name="112"></A><B>112.</B> Better it is to live one day strenuous and resolute than to live a hundred years sluggish and dissipated.
<p>
<A name="113"></A><B>113.</B> Better it is to live one day seeing the rise and fall of things than to live as hundred years without ever seeing the rise and fall of things.
<p>
<A name="114"></A><B>114.</B> Better it is to live one day seeing the Deathless than to live a hundred years without ever seeing the Deathless.
<p>
<A name="115"></A><B>115.</B> Better it is to live one day seeing the Supreme Truth than to live a hundred years without ever seeing the Supreme Truth.
