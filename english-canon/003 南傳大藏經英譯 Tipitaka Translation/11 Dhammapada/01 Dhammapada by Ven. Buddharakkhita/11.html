<A name="146"></A><B>146.</B> When this world is ever ablaze, why this laughter, why this jubilation? Shrouded in darkness, will you not see the light?
<p>
<A name="147"></A><B>147.</B> Behold this body -- a painted image, a mass of heaped up sores, infirm, full of hankering -- of which nothing is lasting or stable!
<p>
<A name="148"></A><B>148.</B> Fully worn out is this body, a nest of disease, and fragile. This foul mass breaks up, for death is the end of life.
<p>
<A name="149"></A><B>149.</B> These dove-colored bones are like gourds that lie scattered about in autumn. Having seen them, how can one seek delight?
<p>
<A name="150"></A><B>150.</B> This city (body) is built of bones, plastered with flesh and blood; within are decay and death, pride and jealousy.
<p>
<A name="151"></A><B>151.</B> Even gorgeous royal chariots wear out, and indeed this body too wears out. But the Dhamma of the Good does not age; thus the Good make it known to the good.
<p>
<A name="152"></A><B>152.</B> The man of little learning grows old like a bull. He grows only in bulk, but, his wisdom does not grow.
<p>
<A name="153"></A><B>153.</B> Through many a birth in samsara have I wandered in vain, seeking in the builder of this house (of life). Repeated birth is indeed suffering!
<p>
<A name="154"></A><B>154.</B> O house-builder, you are seen! You will not build this house again. For your rafters are broken and your ridgepole shattered. My mind has reached the Unconditioned; I have attained the destruction of craving.
[<A HREF="notes.html#13">13</A>]
<p>
<A name="155"></A><B>155.</B> Those who in youth have not led the holy life, or have failed to acquire wealth, languish like old cranes in the pond without fish.
<p>
<A name="156"></A><B>156.</B> Those who in youth have not lead the holy life, or have failed to acquire wealth, lie sighing over the past, like worn out arrows (shot from) a bow.
