<A name="256"></A><B>256.</B>
Not by passing arbitrary judgments does a man become just; a wise man is he who investigates both right and wrong.
<p>
<A name="257"></A><B>257.</B>
He who does not judge others arbitrarily, but passes judgment impartially according to the truth, that sagacious man is a guardian of law and is called just.
<p>
<A name="258"></A><B>258.</B>
One is not wise because one speaks much. He who is peaceable, friendly and fearless is called wise.
<p>
<A name="259"></A><B>259.</B>
A man is not versed in Dhamma because he speaks much. He who, after hearing a little Dhamma, realizes its truth directly and is not heedless of it, is truly versed in the Dhamma. 4
<p>
<A name="260"></A><B>260.</B>
A monk is not Elder because his head is gray. He is but ripe in age, and he is called one grown old in vain.
<p>
<A name="261"></A><B>261.</B>
One in whom there is truthfulness, virtue, inoffensiveness, restraint and self-mastery, who is free from defilements and is wise -- he is truly called an Elder.
<p>
<A name="262"></A><B>262.</B>
Not by mere eloquence nor by beauty of form does a man become accomplished, if he is jealous, selfish and deceitful.
<p>
<A name="263"></A><B>263.</B>
But he in whom these are wholly destroyed, uprooted and extinct, and who has cast out hatred -- that wise man is truly accomplished.
<p>
<A name="264"></A><B>264.</B>
Not by shaven head does a man who is indisciplined and untruthful become a monk. How can he who is full of desire and greed be a monk?
<p>
<A name="265"></A><B>265.</B>
He who wholly subdues evil both small and great is called a monk, because he has overcome all evil.
<p>
<A name="266"></A><B>266.</B>
He is not a monk just because he lives on others' alms. Not by adopting outward form does one become a true monk.
<p>
<A name="267"></A><B>267.</B>
Whoever here (in the Dispensation) lives a holy life, transcending both merit and demerit, and walks with understanding in this world -- he is truly called a monk.
<p>
<A name="268"></A><B>268.</B>
Not by observing silence does one become a sage, if he be foolish and ignorant. But that man is wise who, as if holding a balance-scale accepts only the good.
<p>
<A name="269"></A><B>269.</B>
The sage (thus) rejecting the evil, is truly a sage. Since he comprehends both (present and future) worlds, he is called a sage.
<p>
<A name="270"></A><B>270.</B>
He is not noble who injures living beings. He is called noble because he is harmless towards all living beings.
<p>
<A name="271-272"></A><B>271-272.</B>
Not by rules and observances, not even by much learning, nor by gain of absorption, nor by a life of seclusion, nor by thinking, "I enjoy the bliss of renunciation, which is not experienced by the worldling" should you, O monks, rest content, until the utter destruction of cankers (Arahatship) is reached.
