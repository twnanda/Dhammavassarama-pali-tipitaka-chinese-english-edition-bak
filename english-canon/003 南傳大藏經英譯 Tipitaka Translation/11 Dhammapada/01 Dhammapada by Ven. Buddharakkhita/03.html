<A name="33"></A><B>33.</B> Just as a fletcher straightens an arrow shaft, even so the discerning man straightens his mind -- so fickle and unsteady, so difficult to guard.
<p>
<A name="34"></A><B>34.</B> As a fish when pulled out of water and cast on land throbs and quivers, even so is this mind agitated. Hence should one abandon the realm of Mara.
<p>
<A name="35"></A><B>35.</B> Wonderful, indeed, it is to subdue the mind, so difficult to subdue, ever swift, and seizing whatever it desires. A tamed mind brings happiness.
<p>
<A name="36"></A><B>36.</B> Let the discerning man guard the mind, so difficult to detect and extremely subtle, seizing whatever it desires. A guarded mind brings happiness.
<p>
<A name="37"></A><B>37.</B> Dwelling in the cave (of the heart), the mind, without form, wanders far and alone. Those who subdue this mind are liberated from the bonds of Mara.
<p>
<A name="38"></A><B>38.</B> Wisdom never becomes perfect in one whose mind is not steadfast, who knows not the Good Teaching and whose faith wavers.
<p>
<A name="39"></A><B>39.</B> There is no fear for an awakened one, whose mind is not sodden (by lust) nor afflicted (by hate), and who has gone beyond both merit and demerit.
[<A HREF="notes.html#6">6</A>]
<p>
<A name="40"></A><B>40.</B> Realizing that this body is as fragile as a clay pot, and fortifying this mind like a well-fortified city, fight out Mara with the sword of wisdom. Then, guarding the conquest, remain unattached.
<p>
<A name="41"></A><B>41.</B> Ere long, alas! this body will lie upon the earth, unheeded and lifeless, like a useless log.
<p>
<A name="42"></A><B>42.</B> Whatever harm an enemy may do to an enemy, or a hater to a hater, an ill-directed mind inflicts on oneself a greater harm.
<p>
<A name="43"></A><B>43.</B> Neither mother, father, nor any other relative can do one greater good than one's own well-directed mind.
