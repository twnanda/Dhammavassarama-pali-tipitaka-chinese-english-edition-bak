<a name="209"></a>Having applied himself<BR>
to what was not his own task,<BR>
and not having applied himself<BR>
to what was,<BR>
having disregarded the goal<BR>
to grasp at what he held dear,<BR>
he now envies those<BR>
who kept after themselves,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; took themselves <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to task.

<b>210-211:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="210"></a>Don't ever -- regardless -- <BR>
be conjoined with what's dear <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or undear.<BR>
It's painful <BR>
not to see what's dear<BR>
or to see what's not.<BR>
<P>
<a name="211"></a>So don't make anything dear,<BR>
for it's dreadful to be far<BR>
from what's dear.<BR>
No bonds are found<BR>
for those for whom<BR>
there's neither dear<BR>
nor undear.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<br><p>
<b>212-216:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="212"></a>From what's dear is born grief,<BR>
from what's dear is born fear.<BR>
For one freed from what's dear<BR>
there's no grief<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- so how fear?<BR>
<P>
<a name="213"></a>From what's loved is born grief,<BR>
from what's loved is born fear.<BR>
For one freed from what's loved<BR>
there's no grief<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- so how fear?<BR>
<P>
<a name="214"></a>From delight is born grief,<BR>
from delight is born fear.<BR>
For one freed from delight<BR>
there's no grief<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- so how fear?<BR>
<P>
<a name="215"></a>From sensuality is born grief,<BR>
from sensuality is born fear.<BR>
For one freed from sensuality<BR>
there's no grief<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- so how fear?<BR>
<P>
<a name="216"></a>From craving is born grief,<BR>
from craving is born fear.<BR>
For one freed from craving<BR>
there's no grief<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- so how fear?

<b>217:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="217"></a>One consummate in virtue &amp; vision,<BR>
judicious,<BR>
speaking the truth,<BR>
doing his own task:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the world holds him dear.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="218"></a>If your heart has blossomed<BR>
&amp; given birth to a wish<BR>
for what can't be expressed,<BR>
your mind not enmeshed<BR>
in sensual passions:<BR>
you're said to be <BR>
in the up-flowing stream.

<b>219-220:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="219"></a>A man long absent<BR>
comes home safe from afar.<BR>
His kin, his friends, his companions,<BR>
delight in his return.<BR>
<P>
<a name="220"></a>In just the same way,<BR>
when you've done good <BR>
&amp; gone from this world <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the world beyond,<BR>
your good deeds receive you -- <BR>
as kin, someone dear<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; come home.
