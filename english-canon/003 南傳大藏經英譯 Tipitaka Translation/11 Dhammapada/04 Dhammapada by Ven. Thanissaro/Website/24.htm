<h1 align=center>XXIV. Craving</h1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="334"></a>When a person lives heedlessly,<BR>
his craving grows like a creeping vine.<BR>
He runs now here<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; now &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there,<BR>
as if looking for fruit:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a monkey in the forest.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="335"></a>If this sticky, uncouth craving<BR>
overcomes you in the world, <BR>
your sorrows grow like wild grass<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; after rain.<BR>
<P>
<a name="336"></a>If, in the world, you overcome<BR>
this uncouth craving, hard to escape,<BR>
sorrows roll off you,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like water beads off<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a lotus.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="337"></a>To all of you gathered here<BR>
I say: Good fortune.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dig up craving<BR>
-- as when seeking medicinal roots, wild grass -- <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the root.<BR>
Don't let Mara cut you down<BR>
-- as a raging river, a reed -- <BR>
over &amp; over again.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="338"></a>If its root remains<BR>
undamaged &amp; strong,<BR>
a tree, even if cut,<BR>
will grow back.<BR>
So too if latent craving<BR>
is not rooted out,<BR>
this suffering returns <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; again<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; again.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="339"></a>He whose 36 streams,<BR>
flowing to what is appealing, are strong:<BR>
the currents -- resolves based on passion -- <BR>
carry him, of base views, away.<BR>
<P>
<a name="340"></a>They flow every which way, the streams,<BR>
but the sprouted creeper stays <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in place.<BR>
Now, seeing that the creeper's arisen,<BR>
cut through its root <BR>
with discernment.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="341"></a>Loosened &amp; oiled<BR>
are the joys of a person.<BR>
People, bound by enticement,<BR>
looking for ease:<BR>
to birth &amp; aging they go.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="342"></a>Encircled with craving,<BR>
people hop round &amp; around<BR>
like a rabbit caught in a snare.<BR>
Tied with fetters &amp; bonds<BR>
they go on to suffering,<BR>
again &amp; again, for long.<BR>
<P>
<a name="343"></a>Encircled with craving,<BR>
people hop round &amp; around<BR>
like a rabbit caught in a snare.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So a monk <BR>
should dispel &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; craving, <BR>
should aspire &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to dispassion<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for himself.

<b>344:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="344"></a>Cleared of the underbrush <BR>
but obsessed with the forest,<BR>
set free from the forest, <BR>
right back to the forest he runs.<BR>
Come, see the person set free<BR>
who runs right back to the same old chains!

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="345"></a><a name="346"></a>That's not a strong bond<BR>
-- so say the enlightened -- <BR>
the one made of iron, of wood, or of grass.<BR>
To be smitten, enthralled, <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with jewels &amp; ornaments,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; longing for children &amp; wives:<BR>
that's the strong bond,<BR>
-- so say the enlightened -- <BR>
one that's constraining,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; elastic,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hard to untie.<BR>
But having cut it, they<BR>
-- the enlightened -- go forth,<BR>
free of longing, abandoning<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sensual ease.<BR>
<P>
<a name="347"></a>Those smitten with passion <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fall back <BR>
into a self-made stream,<BR>
like a spider snared in its web.<BR>
But, having cut it, the enlightened set forth,<BR>
free of longing, abandoning<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all suffering &amp; stress.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you let go of <I>in front,<BR>
</I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let go of <I>behind,<BR>
</I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; let go of <I>between.<BR>
</I>With a heart everywhere let-go,<BR>
you don't come again to birth <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; aging.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forced on by his thinking,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fierce in his passion,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; focused on beauty,<BR>
craving grows all the more.<BR>
He's the one <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who tightens the bond.<BR>
But one who delights<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the stilling of thinking,<BR>
always &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mindful<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cultivating<BR>

the one who will cut Mara's bond.

<a name="351"></a><a name="352"></a>Arrived at the finish,<BR>
unfrightened, unblemished, free<BR>

the arrows of becoming.<BR>
This physical heap is his last.<BR>
Free from craving,<BR>
ungrasping,<BR>
astute in expression,<BR>
knowing the combination of sounds -- <BR>
which comes first &amp; which after.<BR>
He's called a <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; great man.
