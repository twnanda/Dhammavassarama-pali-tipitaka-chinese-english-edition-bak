Jetavana monastery. In the evening, while the bhikkhus were talking about the
trip, especially the condition of the land, whether it was level or hilly, or
whether the soil was clayey or sandy, red or black, etc., the Buddha came to
them. Knowing the subject of their talk, he said to them, &quot;Bhikkhus, the
earth you are talking about is external to the body; it is better, indeed, to
examine your own body and make preparations (for meditation practice).&quot;

occasion, a certain bhikkhu, after taking a subject of meditation from the
Buddha, went to the forest. Although he tried hard he made little progress in
his meditation; so he decided to go back to the Buddha for further instruction.
On his way back he saw a mirage, which, after all, was only an illusive
appearance of a sheet of water. At that instant, he came to realize that the
body also was insubstantial like a mirage. Thus keeping his mind on the
insubstantiality of the body he came to the bank of the river Aciravati. While
sitting under a tree close to the river, seeing big froths breaking up, he
realized the impermanent nature of the body.</P>

ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; King
Pasenadi of Kosala, wishing to marry into the clan of the Sakyans, sent some
emissaries to Kapilavatthu with a request for the hand of one of the Sakyan
princesses. Not wishing to offend King Pasenadi, the Sakyan princes replied
that they would comply with his request, but instead of a Sakyan princess they
sent a very beautiful girl born of King Mahanama and a slave woman. King
Pasenadi made that girl one of his chief queens and subsequently she gave birth
to a son. This son was named Vitatubha. When the prince was sixteen years old,
he was sent on a visit to King Mahanama and the Sakyan princes. There he was
received with some hospitality but all the Sakyan princes who were younger than
Vitatubha had been sent away to a village, so that they would not have to pay
respect to Vitatubha. After staying a few days in Kapilavatthu, Vitatubha and
his company left for home. Soon after they left, a slave girl was washing with
milk the place where Vitatubha had sat; she was also cursing him, shouting,
&quot;This is the place where that son of a slave woman had sat&quot;. At that
moment, a member of Vitatubha's entourage returned to fetch something which he
had left at the place and heard what the slave girl said. The slave girl also
told him that Vitatubha's mother, Vasabhakhattiya, was the daughter of a slave
girl belonging to Mahanama.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When
Vitatubha was told about the above incident, he became wild with rage and
declared that one day he would wipe out the whole clan of the Sakyans. True to
his word, when Vitatubha became king, he marched on the Sakyan clan and
massacred them all, with the exception of a few who were with Mahanama and some
others. On their way home, Vitatubha and his army encamped on the sandbank in
the river Aciravati. As heavy rain fell in the upper parts of the country on
that very night, the river swelled and rushed down with great force carrying
away Vitatubha and his army into the ocean.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On
hearing about these two tragic incidents, the Buddha explained to the bhikkhus
that his relatives, the Sakyan princes, had in one of their previous
existences, put poison into the river killing the fishes. It was as a result of
that particular action that the Sakyan princes had to die en masse. Then,
referring to the incident about Vitatubha and his army, the Buddha said,
&quot;As a great flood sweeps away all the villagers in a sleeping village, so
also, Death carries away all the creatures hankering after sensual
pleasures.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then

Patipujika Kumari was a lady from Savatthi. She married at the age of sixteen
and had four sons. She was a virtuous as well as a generous lady, who loved to
make offerings of food and other requisites to the bhikkhus. She would often go
to the monastery and clean up the premises, fill the pots and jars with water
and perform other services. Patipujika. also possessed Jatissara Knowledge
through which she remembered that in her previous existence she was one of the
numerous wives of Malabhari, in the deva world of Tavatimsa. She also
remembered that she had passed away from there when all of them were out in the
garden enjoying themselves, plucking and picking flowers. So, every time she
made offerings to the bhikkhus or performed any other meritorious act, she
would pray that she might be reborn in the Tavatimsa realm as a wife of
Malabhari, her previous husband.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One
day, Patipujika fell ill and passed away that same evening. As she had so
ardently wished, she was reborn in Tavatimsa deva world as a wife of Malabhari.
As one hundred years in the human world is equivalent to just one day in
Tavatimsa world, Malabhari and his other wives were still in the garden
enjoying themselves and Patipujika was barely missed by them. So, when she
rejoined them, Malabhari asked her where she had been the whole morning. She
then told him about her passing away from Tavatimsa, her rebirth in the human
world, her marriage to a man and also about how she had given birth to four
sons, her passing away from there and finally her return to Tavatimsa.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When
the bhikkhus learned about the death of Patipujika, they were stricken with
grief. They went to the Buddha and reported that Patipujika, who was offering
alms-food to them early in the morning, had passed away in the evening. To them
the Buddha replied that the life of beings was very brief; and that before they
could hardly be satiated in their sensual pleasures, they were overpowered by
Death.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then

ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the
village of Sakkara, near Rajagaha, there lived a miserly rich man by the name
of Kosiya, who was very reluctant to give away even the tiniest part of
anything belonging to him. One day, to avoid sharing with others, the rich man
and his wife were making some pancakes in the uppermost storey of their house,
where no one would see them.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early
in the morning, on that day, the Buddha through his supernormal power, saw the
rich man and his wife in his vision, and knew that both of them would soon
attain Sotapatti Fruition. So he sent his Chief Disciple Maha Moggallana to the
house of the rich man, with instructions to bring the couple to the Jetavana
monastery in time for the midday meal. The Chief Disciple, by supernormal
power, reached Kosiya's house in an instant and stood at the window. The rich
man saw him and asked him to leave; the Venerable Maha Moggallana just stood
there without saying anything. In the end, Kosiya said to his wife, &quot;Make
a very small pancake and give it to the bhikkhu.&quot; So she took just a
little amount of dough and put it in the pan, and the cake filled up the whole
pan. Kosiya thought his wife must have put in too much, so he took just a pinch
of dough and put it into the pan; his pancake also swelled into a big one. It
so happened that however little dough they might put in, they wore unable to
make small pancakes. At last, Kosiya asked his wife to offer one from the
basket to the bhikkhu. When she tried to take out one from the basket it would
not come off because all the pancakes were sticking together and could not be
separated. By this time Kosiya has lost all appetite for pancakes and offered
the whole basket of pancakes to Maha Moggallana. The Chief Disciple then
delivered a discourse on charity to the rich man and his wife. He also told the
couple about how the Buddha was waiting with five hundred bhikkhus at the
Jetavana monastery in Savatthi, forty-five yojanas away from Rajagaha. Maha
Moggallana, by his supernormal power, then took both Kosiya and his wife
together with their basket of pancakes, to the presence of the Buddha. There,
they offered the pancakes to the Buddha and the five hundred bhikkhus. At the
end of the meal, the Buddha delivered a discourse on charity, and both Kosiya
and his wife attained Sotapatti Fruition.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next
evening, while the bhikkhus were talking in praise of Maha Moggallana, the
Buddha came to them and said, &quot;Bhikkhus, you should also dwell and act in
the village like Maha Moggallana, receiving the offerings of the villagers
without affecting their faith and generosity, or their wealth.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then

Buddha was invited and choice food was offered. As the Buddha was expressing
appreciation (anumodana), Paveyya, who was in the next room, fumed with rage.
He blamed and cursed the lady for venerating the Buddha. The lady heard him
cursing and shouting and felt so ashamed that she could not concentrate on what

came to the Buddha. Chattapani did not stand up because he thought that by
standing up, it might mean that he was paying respect to the king, but not
paying due respect to the Buddha. The king took that as an insult and was very
much offended. The Buddha knew exactly how the king was feeling; so he spoke in
praise of Chattapani, who was well-versed in the Dhamma and had also attained
the Anagami Fruition. On hearing this, the king was impressed and favourably
inclined towards Chattapani.</P>

the Buddha to assign a bhikkhu for this purpose. So, the king approached the
Buddha in connection with this, and the Buddha directed the Venerable Ananda to
go regularly to the palace and teach the Dhamma to queen Mallika and queen
Vasabhakhattiya. After some time, the Buddha asked the Venerable Ananda about
the progress of the two queens. The Venerable Ananda answered that although
Mallika was learning the Dhamma seriously, Vasabhakhattiya was not paying

rage and told her to leave his house. But Visakha said she was not going away,
and that she would send for the eight elderly rich men who were sent by her
father to accompany her and to advise her. It was for them to decide whether
she was guilty or not. When the elders came, Migara said to them, &quot;While I
was having my rice-with-milk in a golden bowl, Visakha said that I was taking
only dirt and filth. For this offence, I'm sending her away.&quot; Thereupon,
Visakha explained as follows: &quot;When I saw my father-in-law completely
ignoring the bhikkhu standing for alms-food, I thought to myself that my
father-in-law was not doing any meritorious deed in this existence. he was only
eating the fruits of has past good deeds. So, I said, 'My father-in-law only
eats leftovers.' Now Sirs, what do you think, am I guilty?&quot; The elders
decided that Visakha was not guilty. Visakha then said that she was one who had
absolute and unshakable faith in the Teaching of the Buddha and so could not
stay where the bhikkhus were not welcome; and also, that if she was not given
permission to invite the bhikkhus to the house to offer alms-food and make
other offerings, she would leave the house. So permission was granted her to
invite the Buddha and his bhikkhus to the house. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
next day, the Buddha and his disciples were invited to the house of Visakha
When alms-food was about to be offered, she sent word to her father-in-law to
join her in offering food; but he did not come. When the meal was over, again
she sent a message, this time requesting her father-in-law to join her in
hearing the discourse that would soon be given by the Buddha. Her father-in-law
felt that he should not refuse for a second time. But his ascetic teachers, the
Niganthas, would not let him go; however, they conceded that he could listen
from behind a curtain. After hearing the Buddha's discourse Migara attained
Sotapatti Fruition. He felt very thankful to the Buddha and also to his
daughter-in-law. Being so thankful, he declared that henceforth Visakha would
be like a mother to him, and Visakha came to be known as Migaramata.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Visakha gave birth to ten sons and ten daughters, and ten sons and ten
daughters each were born to everyone of her children and grand-children.
Visakha possessed an immensely valuable gem-encrusted cloak given by her father
as a wedding present. One day, Visakha went to the Jetavana monastery with her
entourage. On arrival at the monastery, she found that her bejeweled cloak was
too heavy. So, she took it off, wrapped it up in her shawl, and gave it to the
maid to hold it and take care of it. The maid absentmindedly left it at the
monastery. It was the custom for the Venerable Ananda to look after the things
left by any one of the lay disciples. Visakha sent the maid back to the
monastery saying, &quot;Go and look for the bejeweled cloak, but if the
Venerable Ananda had already found it and kept it in a place do not bring it
back; I donate the bejeweled clock to the Venerable Ananda.&quot; But the
Venerable Ananda did not accept her donation. So Visakha decided to sell the
bejeweled cloak and donate the sale proceeds. But there was no one who could
afford to buy that bejeweled cloak. So Visakha bought it back for nine crores
and one lakh. With this money, she built a monastery on the eastern side of the
city; this monastery came to be known as Pubbarama.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After
the libation ceremony she called all her family to her and on that night she
told them that all her wishes had ken fulfilled and that she had nothing more
to desire. Then reciting five verses of exultation she went round and round the
monastery. Some bhikkhus hearing her, thought she was singing and reported to
the Buddha that Visakha was not like before, and that she was going round and
round the monastery, singing. &quot;Could it be that she had gone off her
head?&quot; they asked the Buddha. To this question, the Buddha replied,
&quot;Today, Visakha had all her wishes of the past and present existences
fulfilled and on account of that sense of achievement, she was feeling elated
and contented; Visakha was just reciting some verses of exultation; she
certainly had not gone off her head. Visakha, throughout her previous
existences, had always been a generous donor and an ardent promoter of the
Doctrine of successive Buddhas. She was most strongly inclined to do good deeds
and had done much good in her previous existences, just as an expert florist
makes many garlands from a collection of flowers.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then
the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:</P>

the Venerable Ananda was sitting by himself one evening, the problem relating
to scents and perfumes came to his mind and he pondered: &quot;The scent of
wood, the scent of flowers, and the scent of roots all spread with the current
of wind but not against it. Is there no scent which would spread with the
current of wind as well as against it? Is there no scent which would pervade
every part of the world?&quot; Without answering the question himself, the
Venerable Ananda approached the Buddha and solicited an answer from him. The
Buddha said, &quot;Ananda, supposing, there is one who takes refuge in the
Three Gems (the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Samgha), who observes the five moral
precepts, who is generous and not avaricious; such a man is truly virtuous and
truly worthy of praise. The reputation of that virtuous one would spread far

him, wherever he lives.&quot;</P>

from nirodhasamapatti*, Thera Mahakassapa entered a poor section of the city of
Rajagaha for alms-food. His intention was to give a poor man an opportunity of
gaining great merit as a. result of offering alms-food to one who had just come
out of nirodhasamapatti. Sakka, king of the devas, wishing to take the
opportunity of offering alms-food to Thera Mahakassapa, assumed the form of a
poor old weaver and came to Rajagaha with his wife Sujata in the form of an old
woman. Thera Mahakassapa stood at their door; the poor old weaver took the bowl
from the thera and filled up the bowl with rice and curry, and the delicious
smell of the curry spread throughout the city. Then it occurred to the thera
that this person must be no ordinary human being, and he came to realize that
this must be Sakka himself. Sakka admitted the fact and claimed that he too was
poor because he had had no opportunity of offering anything to anyone during
the time of the Buddhas. So saying, Sakka and his wife Sujata left the thera
after paying due respect to him.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Buddha, from his monastery, saw Sakka and Sujata leaving and told the bhikkhus
about Sakka offering alms-food to Theta Mahakassapa. The bhikkhus wondered how
Sakka knew that Thera Mahakassapa had just come out of nirodhasamapatti, and
that it was the right and auspicious time for him to make offerings to the
thera. This question was put up to the Buddha, and the Buddha answered,
&quot;Bhikkhus, the reputation of a virtuous one as my son, Thera Mahakassapa,
spreads far aid wide; it reaches even the deva world. On account of his good
reputation, Sakka himself has come to offer alms-food to him.&quot;</P>

Godhika was, on one occasion, diligently practising Tranquillity and Insight
Development, on a stone slab on the side of Isigili mountain in Magadha. When
he had achieved one-pointedness of the mind (jhana) he became very ill; that
impaired the effectiveness of his practice. In spite of his sickness, he kept
on striving hard; but every time he was making some progress he was overcome by
sickness. He was thus inflicted for six times. Finally, he made up his mind to
overcome all obstacles and attain arahatship even if he were to die. So,
without relaxing he continued to practise diligently; in the end he decided to
give up his life by cutting his throat; at the point of death he attained
arahatship.</P>

Mara approached the Buddha and enquired where Thera Godhika was. The Buddha
replied to him, &quot;It will be of no benefit to you to learn of the

became an arahat. One like you, Mara, for all your power will not be able to

ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There
were two friends named Sirigutta and Garahadinna in Savatthi. Sirigutta was a
follower of the Buddha and Garahadinna was a follower of the Niganthas, the
ascetics who were hostile to the Buddhists. At the instance of the Niganthas,
Garahadinna often said to Sirigutta, &quot;What benefit do you get by following
the Buddha? Come, be a follower of my teachers.&quot; Having been told thus
many times, Sirigutta said to Garahadinna, &quot;Tell me, what do your teachers
know?&quot; To this, Garahadinna replied that his teachers knew everything;
with their great power they knew the past, the present and the future and also
the thoughts of others. So, Sirigutta invited the Niganthas to his house for
alms-food.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sirigutta wanted to find out the truth about the Niganthas, whether they really
possessed the power of knowing other people's thoughts, etc. So he made a long,
deep trench and filled it up with excreta and filth. Seats were then placed
precariously over the trench; and big empty pots were brought in and covered up
with cloth and banana leaves to make them appear as if they were full of rice
and curries. When the Niganthas arrived, they were requested to enter one by
one, to stand near their respective seats, and to sit down simultaneously. As
all of them sat down, the flimsy strings broke and the Niganthas fell into the
filthy trench. Then Sirigutta taunted them, &quot;Why don't you know the past,
the present and the future? Why don't you know the thoughts of others?&quot;
All the Niganthas then fled in terror.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Garahadinna naturally was furious with Sirigutta and refused to talk to him for
two weeks. Then, he decided that he would have his revenge on Sirigutta. He
pretended that he was no longer angry, and one day asked Sirigutta to invite,
on his behalf, the Buddha and his five hundred disciples to partake of
alms-food. So Sirigutta went to the Buddha and invited him to the house of
Garahadinna. At the same time, he told the Buddha about what he had done to the
Niganthas, the teachers of Garahadinna. He also expressed his fear that this
invitation might be a reprisal and so the invitation should be accepted only
after due consideration.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Buddha, with his supernormal power, knew that this would be the occasion for
the two friends to attain Sotapatti Fruition, and therefore accepted the
invitation. Garahadinna made a trench, filled it with live coals and covered it
with mats. He also kept some empty pots covered with cloth and banana leaves to
make them appear as if filled with rice and curries. The next day, the Buddha
came followed by five hundred bhikkhus in single file. When the Buddha stepped
on the mat over the trench, the mat and live coals miraculously disappeared,
and five hundred lotus flowers, each as large as a cart wheel, sprang up for
the Buddha and his disciples to sit upon.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Seeing this miracle, Garahadinna was very much alarmed and he said rather
incoherently to Sirigutta, &quot;Help me, dear friend. Out of my desire for
revenge, I have truly done a great wrong. My bad designs have had no effect at
all on your Teacher. The pots in my kitchen are all empty. Please help
me.&quot; Sirigutta then told Garahadinna to go and look at the pots. When
Garahadinna found all the pots filled with food he was astounded and at the
same time very much relieved and very happy. So the food was offered to the
Buddha and his disciples. After the meal, the Buddha expressed his appreciation
(anumodana) of the meritorious act and then said, &quot;Ignorant worldlings,
lacking in knowledge, do not know the unique qualities of the Buddha, the
Dhamma and the Samgha and so they are like the blind; but the wise, having
knowledge, are like people with sight.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then
