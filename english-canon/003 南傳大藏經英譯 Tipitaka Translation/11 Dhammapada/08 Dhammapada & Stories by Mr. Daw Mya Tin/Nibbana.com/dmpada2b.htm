<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While residing on the Calika Mountain, the Buddha uttered
Verses (33) and (34) of this book, with reference to Thera Meghiya.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At that time, Thera Meghiya was attending upon the Buddha.
On one occasion, on his return from alms-round, the thera noticed a pleasant
and beautiful mango grove, which he thought was an ideal spot for meditation.
He asked the Buddha's permission to let him go there, but as the Buddha was
alone at that time, he was told to wait for awhile until the arrival of some
other bhikkhus. The thera was in a hurry to go and so he repeated his request
again and again, until finally the Buddha told him to do as he wished.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus, Thera Meghiya set out for the mango grove, sat at the
foot of a tree and practised meditation. He stayed there the whole day, but his
mind kept wandering and he made no progress. He returned in the evening and
reported to the Buddha how all the time he was assailed by thoughts associated
with the senses, ill will and cruelty ( kama vitakka, byapada vitakka and
vihimsa vitakka).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So, the Buddha told him that as the mind is easily excitable
and fickle, one should control one's mind.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>III (2) The Story of a <A NAME="CertainBhikkhu">Certain
Bhikkhu</A></B></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered
Verse (35) of this book, with reference to a certain bhikkhu.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On one occasion, sixty bhikkhus, after obtaining a subject
of meditation from the Buddha, went to Matika village, at the foot of a
mountain. There, Matikamata, mother of the village headman, offered them
alms-food; she also built a monastery for them, so that they could stay in the
village during the rainy season. One day she asked the group of bhikkhus to
teach her the practice of meditation. They taught her how to meditate on the
thirty-two constituents of the body leading to the awareness of the decay and
dissolution of the body. Matikamata practised with diligence and attained the
three Maggas and Phalas together with Analytical Insight and mundane
supernormal powers, even before the bhikkhus did.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rising from the bliss of the Magga and Phala she looked with
the Divine Power of Sight (Dibbacakkhu) and saw that the bhikkhus had not
attained any of the Maggas yet. She also learnt that those bhikkhus had enough
potentiality for the attainment of arahatship, but that they needed proper
food. So, she prepared good, choice food for them. With proper food and right
effort, the bhikkhus developed right concentration and eventually attained
arahatship.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the end of the rainy season, the bhikkhus returned to the
Jetavana monastery, where the Buddha was in residence. They reported to the
Buddha that all of them were in good health and in comfortable circumstances
and that they did not have to worry about food. They also mentioned about
Matikamata who was aware of their thoughts and prepared and offered them the
very food they wished for.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A certain bhikkhu, hearing them talking about Matikamata,
decided that he, too, would go to that village. So, taking a subject of
meditation from the Buddha he arrived at the village monastery. There, he found
that everything he wished for was sent to him by Matikamata, the lay-devotee.
When he wished her to come she personally came to the monastery, bringing along
choice food with her. After taking the food, he asked her if he knew the
thoughts of others, but she evaded his question and replied, &quot;People who
can read the thoughts of others behave in such and such a way.&quot; Then, the
bhikkhu thought, &quot;Should I, like an ordinary worldling, entertain any
impure thought, she is sure to find out.&quot; He therefore got scared of the
lay-devotee and decided to return to the Jetavana monastery. He told the Buddha
that he could not stay in Matika village because be was afraid that the
lay-devotee might detect impure thoughts in him. The Buddha then asked him to
observe just one thing; that is, to control his mind. The Buddha also told the
bhikkhu to return to Matika village monastery, and not to think of anything
else, but the object of his meditation only. The bhikkhu went back. The
lay-devotee offered him good food as she had done to others before, so that he
might able to practise meditation without worry. Within a short time, he, too,
attained arahatship.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">With reference to this bhikkhu, the Buddha spoke in verse as

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered
Verse (36) of this book, with reference to a young disgruntled bhikkhu who was
the son of a banker.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once, there lived in Savatthi, the son of a banker. This
young man asked the bhikkhu, who used to come to his house for alms, what he
should do to be liberated from the ills of life. The bhikkhu instructed him to
divide his property into three parts; one part to do business with, one part to
support the family and one part to give in charity. He did as he was told and
again asked what else should be done next. So he was further instructed; first
to take refuge in the Three Gems* and to observe the five precepts; secondly,
to observe the ten precepts; and thirdly, to renounce the world and enter the
Buddhist religious Order. The young man complied with all these instructions
and became a bhikkhu.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a bhikkhu, he was taught the Abhidhamma** by one teacher
and the Vinaya by another. Being taught in this way, he felt that there was too
much to be learnt, that the disciplinary rules were too strict and too many, so
much so that there was not enough freedom even to stretch out one's hands. He
thought that it might be better to return to the life of a householder. As a
result of doubt and discontent, he became unhappy and neglected his duties; he
also became thin and emaciated. When the Buddha came to know about this, he
said to the young bhikkhu, &quot;if you can only control your mind, you will
have nothing more to control; so guard your own mind.&quot;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered
Verse (37) of this book, with reference to the nephew of Thera Samgharakkhita. 
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once, there lived in Savatthi, a senior bhikkhu by the name
of Samgharakkhita. When his sister gave birth to a son, she named the child
after the thera and he came to be known as Samgharakkhita Bhagineyya. The
nephew Samgharakkhita, in due course, was admitted into the Order. While the
young bhikkhu was staying in a village monastery he was offered two sets of
robes, and he intended to offer one to his uncle, the thera.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the end of the vassa he went to his uncle to pay respect
to him and offered the robe to the thera. But, the uncle declined to accept the
robe, saying that he had enough. Although he repeated his request, the thera
would not accept. The young bhikkhu felt disheartened and thought that since
his uncle was so unwilling to share the requisites with him, it would be better
for him to leave the Order and live the life of a layman.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From that point, his mind wandered and a train of thoughts
followed. He thought that after leaving the Order he would sell the robe and
buy a she-goat; that she-goat would breed quickly and soon he would make enough
money to enable him to marry; his wife would give birth to a son. He would take
his wife and child in a small cart to visit his uncle at the monastery. On the
way, he would say that he would carry the child; she would tell him to drive
the cart and not to bother about the child. He would insist and grab the child
from her; between them the child would drop on the cart-track and the wheel
would pass over the child. He would get so furious with his wife that he would
strike her with the goading-stick.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At that time he was fanning the thera with a palmyra fan and
he absentmindedly struck the head of the thera with the fan. The thera, knowing
the thoughts of the young bhikkhu, said, &quot;You were unable to beat your
wife; why have you beaten an old bhikkhu ?&quot; Young Samgharakkhita was very
much surprised and embarrassed at the words of the old bhikkhu; he also became
extremely frightened. So he fled. Young bhikkhus and novices of the monastery
chased him and finally took him to the presence of the Buddha.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When told about the whole episode, the Buddha said that the
mind has the ability to think of an object even though it might be far away,
and that one should strive hard for liberation from the bondage of passion, ill
will and ignorance.</P>

NAME="Cittahattha">Cittahattha</A></B></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered
Verses (38) and (39) of this book, with reference to Thera Cittahattha.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A man from Savatthi, after looking for his lost ox in the
forest, felt very hungry and went to a village monastery, where he was given
the remains of the morning meal. While taking his food, it occurred to him that
even though he worked hard every day he could not get such good food and that
it might be a good idea to become a bhikkhu. So he asked the bhikkhus to admit
him into the Order. At the monastery, he performed the duties of a bhikkhu and
as there was plenty of food he soon gained weight. After some time, he got
weary of going round for alms-food and returned to the life of a lay man. A few
days later, he felt that life at home was too strenuous and he went back to the
monastery to be admitted as a bhikkhu for a second time. For a second time, he
left the Order and returned to home-life. Again, he went back to the monastery
for a third time and left it. This shuttling process went on for six times, and
because he acted only according to his whims he was known as Thera Cittahattha.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While he was going back and forth between his home and the
monastery, his wife became pregnant. One day, during his last stay at home, he
happened to enter the bedroom while his wife was asleep. She was almost naked
as the clothes she was wearing had partially fallen off. She was also snoring
loudly through her nose and mouth and saliva was trickling down her mouth.
Thus, with her mouth open and her bloated stomach, she looked just like a
corpse. Seeing her thus, he instantly came to perceive the impermanent and
unpleasant nature of the body, and he reflected, &quot;I have been a bhikkhu
for several times and it is only because of this woman that I have not been
able to remain as a bhikkhu.&quot; Hence, taking the yellow robe with him he
left his home for the monastery for the seventh time. As he went along he
repeated the words &quot;impermanence&quot; and &quot;unpleasantness&quot;
(anicca and dukkha) and thus attained Sotapatti Fruition on the way to the
monastery.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On arrival at the monastery he asked the bhikkhus to admit
him into the Order. They refused and said, &quot;We cannot admit you as a
bhikkhu. You have been shaving your head so often that your head is like a
whetting stone.&quot; Still, he entreated them to admit him into the Order just
once more and they complied. Within a few days, the bhikkhu Cittahattha
attained arahatship together with Analytical Insight. Other bhikkhus, seeing
him staying on for a long time in the monastery, were surprised and they asked
him the reason why. To this, he replied. &quot;I went home when I still had
attachment in me, but now that attachment has been cut off&quot; The bhikkhus,
not believing him, approached the Buddha and reported the matter. To them, the
Buddha said, &quot;Thera Cittahattha was speaking the truth; he shifted between
home and monastery before because at that time, his mind was not steadfast and
he did not understand the Dhamma. But at this moment, Thera Cittahattha is
already an arahat; he has discarded both good and evil.&quot;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered
Verse (40) of this book, with reference to five hundred bhikkhus.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Five hundred bhikkhus from Savatthi, after obtaining a
subject of meditation from the Buddha, travelled for a distance of one hundred
yojanas* away from Savatthi and came to a large forest grove, a suitable place
fur meditation practice. The guardian spirits of the trees dwelling in that
forest thought that if those bhikkhus were staying in the forest, it would not
be proper for them to live with their families in the trees. So they descended
from the trees, thinking that the bhikkhus would stop there only for one night.
But the bhikkhus were still there at the end of a fortnight; then it occurred
to them that the bhikkhus might be staying there till the end of the vassa. In
that case, they and their families would have to be living on the ground for a
long time. So, they decided to frighten away the bhikkhus, by making ghostly
sounds and frightful apparitions. They showed up with bodies without heads, and
with heads without bodies, etc. The bhikkhus were very upset and left the place
and returned to the Buddha, to whom they related everything. On hearing their
account, the Buddha told them that this had happened because previously they
went without any weapon and that they should go back there armed with a
suitable weapon. So saying, the Buddha taught them the entire Metta Sutta
(discourse on Loving-Kindness) beginning with the following stanza:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT COLOR="#800040">Karaniyamattha kusalena</FONT></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">[The above stanza may be translated as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He who is skilled in (acquiring) what is good and
beneficial, (mundane as well as supra-mundane), aspiring to attain Perfect
Peace (Nibbana) should act (thus): He should be efficient, upright, perfectly
upright, compliant, gentle and free from conceit.]</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The bhikkhus were instructed to recite the sutta from the
time they came to the outskirts of the forest grove and to enter the monastery
reciting the same. The bhikkhus returned to the forest grove and did as they
were told. The guardian spirits of the trees receiving loving-kindness from the
bhikkhus reciprocated by readily welcoming and not harming them. There were no
more ghostly sounds and ungainly sights. Thus left in peace, the bhikkhus
meditated on the body and came to realize its fragile and impermanent nature. 
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha, by his supernormal
power, learned about the progress of the bhikkhus and sent forth his radiance
making them feel his presence. To them he said, &quot;Bhikkhus just as you have
realized, the body is, indeed, impermanent.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered
Verse (41) of this book, with reference to Thera Tissa.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After taking a subject of meditation from the Buddha, Thera
Tissa was diligently practising meditation when he was afflicted with a
disease. Small boils appeared all over his body and these developed into big
sores. When these sores burst, his upper and lower robes became sticky and
stained with pus and blood, and his whole body was stinking. For this reason,
he was known as Putigattatissa, Tissa the thera with stinking body.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Buddha surveyed the universe with the light of his
own intellect, the thera appeared in his vision. He saw the sorrowful state of
the thera, who had been abandoned by his resident pupils on account of his
stinking body. At the same time, he also knew that Tissa would soon attain
arahatship. So, the Buddha proceeded to the fire-shed, close to the place where
the thera was staying. There, he boiled some water, and then going, to where
the thera was lying down, took hold of the edge of the couch. It was then only
that the resident pupils gathered round the thera, and a instructed by the
Buddha, they carried the thera to the fire-shed, where he was washed and
bathed. While he was being bathed, his upper and lower robes were washed and
dried. After the bath, the thera became fresh in body and mind and soon
developed one-pointedness of concentration. Standing at the head of the couch,
the Buddha said to him that this body when devoid of life would be as useless
as a log and would be laid on the earth.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nanda was a herdsman who looked after the cows of
Anathapindika. Although only a herdsman, he had some means of his own.
Occasionally, he would go to the house of Anathapindika and there he sometimes

Buddha went off his route to visit Nanda, knowing that the time was ripe for
Nanda to receive his teaching properly. Nanda respectfully received the Buddha
and his followers; he served them milk and milk products and other choice food
for seven days. On the last day, after hearing the discourse given by the
Buddha, Nanda attained Sotapatti Fruition. As the Buddha was leaving that day,
Nanda carrying the bowl of the Buddha, followed him for some distance, paid
obeisance and turned back to go home.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At that instant, a hunter who was an old enemy of Nanda,

you on your return was killed as he was turning back to go home.&quot; To them,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One day, a rich man's son from the city of Soreyya came to
Taxila with five hundred carts. Lady-Soreyya recognizing him to be an old
friend sent for him. The man from Soreyya city was surprised that he was
invited, because he did not know the lady who invited him. He told the
lady-Soreyya that he did not know her, and asked her whether she knew him. She
answered that she knew him and also enquired after the health of her family and
other people in Soreyya city. The man from Soreyya city next told her about the
rich man's son who disappeared mysteriously while going out for a bath. Then
the Lady-Soreyya revealed her identity and related all that had happened, about
the wrongful thoughts with regard to Thera Mahakaccayana, about the change of
sex, and her marriage to the young rich man of Taxila. The man from the city of
Soreyya then advised the lady-Soreyya to ask pardon of the thera. Thera
Mahakaccayana was accordingly invited to the home of Soreyya and alms-food was
offered to him. After the meal, the lady-Soreyya was brought to the presence of
the thera, and the man from Soreyya told the thera that the lady was at one
time the son of a rich man from Soreyya city. He then explained to the thera
how Soreyya was turned into a female on account of his wrongful thoughts
towards the respected thera. Lady-Soreyya then respectfully asked pardon of
Thera Mahakaccayana. The thera then said, &quot;Get up, I forgive you.&quot; As
soon as these words were spoken, the woman was changed back to a man. Soreyya
then pondered how within a single existence and with a single body he had
undergone change of sex and how sons were born to him, etc. And feeling very
weary and repulsive of all these things, he decided to leave the household life
and joined the Order under the thera.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After that, he was often asked, &quot;Whom do you love more,
the two sons you had as a man or the other two you had as a wife?&quot; To
them, he would answer that his love for those born of the womb was greater.
This question was put to him so often, he felt very much annoyed and ashamed.
So he stayed by himself and with diligence, contemplated the decay and
dissolution of the body. He soon attained arahatship together with the
Analytical Insight. When the old question was next put to him he replied that
he had no affection for any one in particular. Other bhikkhus hearing him
thought he must be telling a lie. When reported about Soreyya giving a
different answer, the Buddha said, &quot;My son is not telling lies, he is
speaking the truth. His answer now is different because he has now realized
arahatship and so has no more affection for anyone in particular. By his
well-directed mind my son has brought about in himself a well-being which
neither the father nor the mother can bestow on him.&quot;</P>
