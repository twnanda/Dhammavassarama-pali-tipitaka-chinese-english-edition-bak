<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered
Verse (76) of this hook, with reference to Thera Radha, who was at one time a
poor old Brahmin.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Radha was a poor brahmin who stayed in the monastery doing
small services for the bhikkhus. For his services he was provided with food arid
clothing and other needs, but was not encouraged to join the Order, although he
had a strong desire to become a bhikkhu.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One day, early in the morning, when the Buddha surveyed the
world with his supernormal power, he saw the poor old brahmin in his vision and
knew that he was due for arahatship. So the Buddha went to the old man, and
learned from him that the bhikkhus of the monastery did not want him to join the
Order. The Buddha therefore called all the bhikkhus to him and asked them, &quot;is
there any bhikkhu here who recollects any good turn done to him by this old man?&quot;
To this question, the Venerable Sariputta replied, &quot;Venerable Sir, I do
recollect an instance when this old man offered me a spoonful of rice.&quot; &quot;If
that be so,&quot; the Buddha said, &quot;shouldn't you help your benefactor get
liberated from the ills of life?&quot; Then the Venerable Sariputta agreed to
make the old man a bhikkhu and he was duly admitted to the Order. The Venerable
Sariputta guided the old bhikkhu and the old bhikkhu strictly followed his
guidance. Within a few days, the old bhikkhu attained arahat ship.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Buddha next came to see the bhikkhus, they reported
to him how strictly the old bhikkhu followed the guidance of the Venerable
Sariputta. To them, the Buddha replied that a bhikkhu should be amenable to
guidance like Radha ,and should not resent when rebuked for any fault or
failing.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows :</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered
Verse (77) of this book, with reference to bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka and their five hundred
disciples were staying at Kitagiri village. While staying there they made their
living by planting flowering plants and fruit trees for gain, thus violating the
rules of Fundamental Precepts for bhikkhus.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Buddha hearing about these bhikkhus sent his two Chief
Disciples Sariputta and Maha Moggallana, to stop them from committing further
misconduct. To his two Chief Disciples the Buddha said, &quot;Tell those
bhikkhus not to destroy the faith and generosity of the lay disciples by
misconduct and if anyone should disobey, drive him out of the monastery. Do not
hesitate to do as I told you, for only fools dislike being given good advice and
being forbidden to do evil.&quot;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered
Verse (78) of this book, with reference to Thera Channa.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Channa was the attendant who accompanied Prince Siddhattha
when he renounced the world and left the palace on horseback. When the prince
attained Buddhahood, Channa also became a bhikkhu. As a bhikkhu, he was very
arrogant and overbearing because of his close connection to the Buddha. Channa
used to say, &quot;I came along with my Master when he left the palace for the
forest. At that time, I was the only companion of my Master and there was no one
else. But now, Sariputta and Moggallana are saying, 'we are the Chief
Disciples,' and are strutting about the place.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Buddha sent for him and admonished him for his
behaviour, he kept silent but continued to abuse and taunt the two Chief
Disciples. Thus the Buddha sent for him and admonished him three times; still,
he did not change. And again, the Buddha sent for Channa and said, &quot;Channa,
these two noble bhikkhus are good friends to you; you should associate with them
and be on good terms with them.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In spite of repeated admonitions and advice given by the
Buddha, Channa did as he pleased and continued to scold and abuse the bhikkhus.
The Buddha, knowing this, said that Channa would not change during the Buddha's
lifetime but after his demise (parinibbana) Channa would surely change. On the
eve of his parinibbana, the Buddha called Thera Ananda to his bedside and
instructed him to impose the Brahma-punishment (<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Brahmadanda</FONT>)
to Channa; i.e., for the bhikkhus to simply ignore him and to have nothing to do
with him.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the parinibbana of the Buddha, Channa, learning about
the punishment from Thera Ananda, felt a deep and bitter remorse for having done
wrong and he fainted three times. Then, he owned up his guilt to the bhikkhus
and asked for pardon. From that moment, he changed his ways and outlook. He also
obeyed their instructions in his meditation practice and soon attained
arahatship.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered
Verse (79) of this hook, with reference to Thera Mahakappina.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mahakappina was king of Kukkutavati. He had a queen named
Anoja; he also had one thousand ministers to help him rule the country. One day,
the king accompanied by those one thousand ministers, was out in the park.
There, they met some merchants from Savatthi. On learning about the Buddha, the
Dhamma, and the Samgha from these merchants the king and his ministers
immediately set out for Savatthi.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On that day, when the Buddha surveyed the world with his
supernormal power, he saw in his vision, Mahakappina and his ministers coming
towards Savatthi. He also knew that they were due for arahatship. The Buddha
went to a place one hundred and twenty yojanas away from Savatthi to meet them.
There, he waited for them under a banyan tree on the bank of the river
Candabhaga. King Mahakappina and his ministers came to the place where the
Buddha was waiting for them. When they saw the Buddha, with six-coloured rays
radiating from his body, they approached the Buddha and paid homage to him. The
Buddha then delivered a discourse to them. After listening to the discourse the
king and all his ministers attained Sotapatti Fruition, and they asked the
Buddha to permit them to join the Order. The Buddha, reflecting on their past
and finding that they had made offerings of yellow robes in a past existence,
said to them, &quot;Ehi bhikkhu&quot;, and they all became bhikkhus.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Meanwhile, Queen Anoja, learning about the king's departure
for Savatthi, sent for the wives of the one thousand ministers, and together
with them followed the king's trail. They too came to the place where the Buddha
was and seeing the Buddha with a halo of six colours, paid homage to him. All
this time, the Buddha by exercising his supernormal power had made the king and
his ministers invisible so that their wives did not see them. 'The queen
therefore enquired where the king and his ministers were. The Buddha told the
queen and her party to wait for a while and that the king would soon come with
his ministers. The Buddha then delivered another discourse; at the end of this
discourse the king and his ministers attained arahatship; the queen and the
wives of the ministers attained Sotapatti Fruition. At that instant, the queen
and her party saw the newly admitted bhikkhus and recognized them as their
former husbands.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ladies also asked permission from the Buddha to enter
the Order of Bhikkhunis; so they were directed to go ahead to Savatthi. There
they entered the Order and very soon they also attained arahatship. The Buddha
then. returned to the Jetavana monastery accompanied by one thousand bhikkhus.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the Jetavana monastery, Thera Mahakappina while resting
during the night or during the day would often say, &quot;Oh, what happiness!&quot;
(Aho Sukham). The bhikkhus, hearing him saying this so many times a day told the
Buddha about it. To them the Buddha replied, &quot;My son Kappina having had the
taste of the Dhamma lives happily with a serene mind; he is saying these words
of exultation repeatedly with reference to Nibbana.</P>

<A NAME="Pandita"><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Pandita</FONT></A></FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered
Verse (80) of this book, with reference to Samanera Pandita.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pandita was a young son of a rich man of Savatthi. He became
a samanera at the age of seven. On the eighth day after becoming a samanera, as
he was following Thera Sariputta on an alms-round, he saw some farmers
channeling water into their fields and asked the thera, &quot;Can water which
has no consciousness be guided to wherever one wishes ?&quot; The thera replied,
&quot;Yes, it can be guided to wherever one wishes.&quot; As they continued on
their way, the samanera next saw some fletchers heating their arrows with fire
and straightening them. Further on, he came across some carpenters cutting,
sawing and planing timber to make it into things like cart-wheels. Then he
pondered, &quot;If water which is without consciousness can be guided to
wherever one desires, if a crooked bamboo which is without consciousness can be
straightened, and if timber which is without consciousness can be made into
useful things, why should I, having consciousness, be unable to tame my mind and
practise Tranquillity and Insight Meditation?&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then and there he asked permission from the thera and
returned to his own room in the monastery. There he ardently and diligently
practised meditation, contemplating the body. Sakka and the devas also helped
him in his meditation by keeping the monastery and its precincts very quiet and
still. Before Meal time Samanera Pandita attained Anagami Fruition.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At that time Thera Sariputta was bringing food to the
samanera. The Buddha saw with his supernormal power that Samanera Pandita had
attained Anagami Fruition and also that if he continued to practise meditation
he would soon attain arahatship. So the Buddha decided to stop Sariputta from
entering the room, where the samanera was. The Buddha went to the door and kept
Sariputta engaged by putting some questions to him. While the conversation was
taking place, the samanera attained arahatship. Thus, the samanera attained
arahatship on the eighth day after becoming a novice.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this connection, the Buddha said to the bhikkhus of the
monastery, &quot;When one is earnestly practising the Dhamma, even Sakka and the
devas give protection and keep guard; I myself have kept Thera Sariputta engaged
at the door so that Samanera Pandita should not be disturbed. The samanera,
having seen the farmers irrigating their fields, the fletchers straightening
their arrows, and carpenters making cart-wheels and other things, tames his mind
and practises the dhamma; he has now become an arahat.&quot;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered
Verse (81) of this book, with reference to Thera Bhaddiya.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bhaddiya was one of the bhikkhus staying at the Jetavana
monastery. Because of his short stature he was known as Lakundaka (the dwarf) to
other bhikkhus. Lakundaka Bhaddiya was very good natured; even young bhikkhus
would often tease him by pulling his nose or his ear, or by patting him on his
head. Very often they would jokingly say, &quot;Uncle, how are you? Are you
happy, or are you bored with your life here as a bhikkhu?&quot;, etc. Lakundaka
Bhaddiya never retaliated in anger, or abused them; in fact, even in his heart
he did not get angry with them.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When told about the patience of Lakundaka Bhaddiya. the
Buddha said, &quot;An arahat never loses his temper, he has no desire to speak
harshly or to think ill of others. He is like a mountain of solid rock; as a
solid rock is unshaken, so also, an arahat is unperturbed by scorn or by praise.&quot;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered
Verse (82) of this book, with reference to the mother of Kana (Kanamata).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Kanamata was a devoted lay disciple of the Buddha. Her
daughter Kana was married to a man from another village. As Kana had been on a
visit to her mother for some time, her husband sent a message for her to come
home. Her mother told her to wait for one more day as she wanted to send along
some sweet meals with her for her husband. The next day, Kanamata. made some
sweetmeats, but when four bhikkhus stood at her door for alms she offered some
to them. The four bhikkhus told other bhikkhus about the sweetmeats from
Kanamata's house and they also came to stand at the door of  Kanamata, as a
devotee of the Buddha and his disciples, offered her sweetmeats to the bhikkhus
as they came in, one after another. The result was that in the end there was
none left for Kana and she did not go home on that day. The same thing happened
on the next two days; her mother made some sweetmeats, the bhikkhus stood at her
door, she offered her sweetmeats to the bhikkhus, there was nothing left for her
daughter to take home, and her daughter did not go home. On the third day, for
the third time, her husband sent her a message, which was also an ultimatum
stating that if she failed to come home the next day, he would take another
wife. But on the next day also Kana was unable to go home because her mother
offered all her sweetmeats to the bhikkhus. Kana's husband then took another
wife and Kana became very bitter towards the bhikkhus. She used to abuse all
bhikkhus so much so that the bhikkhus kept away from the house of Kanamata.</P>
<P>The Buddha heard about Kana and went to the house of Kanamata; there
Kanamata offered him some rice gruel. After the meal, the Buddha sent for Kana
and asked hers, &quot;Did my bhikkhus take what was given them or what was not
given them ?&quot; Kana answered that the bhikkhus had taken only what was given
them, and then added, &quot;They were not in the wrong; only I was in the wrong.&quot;
Thus, she owned up her fault and she also paid homage to the Buddha. The Buddha
then gave a discourse. At the end of the discourse, Kana attained Sotapatti
Fruition.</P>
<P>On the way back to the monastery, the Buddha met King Pasenadi of Kosala. On
being told about Kana and her bitter attitude towards the bhikkhus, King
Pasenadi asked the Buddha whether he had been able to teach her the Dhamma and
,make her see the Truth (Dhamma). The Buddha replied, &quot;Yes, I have taught
her the Dhamma, and I have also made her rich in her next existence.&quot; Then
the king promised the Buddha that he would make Kana rich even in this
existence. The king then sent his men with a palanquin to fetch Kana. When she
arrived, the king announced to his ministers, &quot;Whoever can keep my daughter
Kana in comfort may take her.&quot; One of the ministers volunteered to adopt
Kana as his daughter, gave her all his wealth, and said to her, &quot;You may
give in charity as much as you like.&quot; Every day, Kana made offerings to the
bhikkhus at the four city-gates. When told about Kana giving generously in
charity, the Buddha said, &quot;Bhikkhus, the mind of Kana which was foggy and
muddled was made clear and calm by my words.&quot;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered
Verse (83) of this book, with reference to five hundred bhikkhus.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the request of a brahmin from Veranja, the Buddha was, on
one occasion, staying at Veranja with five hundred bhikkhus. While they were at
Veranja, the brahmin failed to look after them. The people of Varanja, who were
then facing a famine, could offer very little to the bhikkhus when they went on
their rounds for alms-food. In spite of all these hardships, the bhikkhus were
not 'disheartened; they were quite contented with the small amount of shrivelled
grain which the horse-traders offered them daily. At the end of the vasa, after
informing the brabmin from Veranja, the Buddha returned to the Jetavana
monastery, accompanied by the five hundred bhikkhu. The people of Savatthi
welcomed them back with choice food of all kinds.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A group of people living with the bhikkhus, eating whatever
was left over by the bhikkhus, ate greedily like true gluttons and went to sleep
after their meals. On waking up, they were shouting, singing and dancing, thus
making themselves a thorough nuisance. When the Buddha came in the evening to
the congregation of bhikkhus, they reported to him about the behaviour of those
unruly persons, and said, &quot;These people living on the leftovers were quite
decent and well-behaved when all of us were facing hardship and famine in
Veranja. Now that they have enough good food they are going about shouting,
singing and dancing, and thus make themselves a thorough nuisance. The bhikkhus,
however, behave themselves here just as they were in Veranja&quot;.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To them the Buddha replied, &quot;It is in the nature of the
foolish to be full of sorrow and feel depressed when things go wrong, and to be
full of gladness and feel elated when things go well. The wise, however, can
withstand the ups and downs of life.&quot;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered
Verse (84) of this book, with reference to Thera Dhammika.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dhammika lived in Savatthi with his wife. One day, he told
his pregnant wife that he wished to become a bhikkhu; his wife pleaded with him
to wait until after the birth of their child. When the child was born, he again
requested his wife to let him go; again, she pleaded with him to wait until the
child could walk. Then Dhammika thought to himself, &quot;It will be useless for
me to ask my wife for her approval to join the Order; I shall work for my own
liberation.&quot; Having made a firm decision, he left his house to become a
bhikkhu. He took a subject of meditation from the Buddha and practised
meditation ardently and diligently and soon became an arahat.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some years later, he visited his house in order to teach the
Dhamma to his son and his wife. His son entered the Order and he too attained
arahatship. The wife then thought, &quot;Now that both my husband and my son
have left the house, I'd better leave it, too.&quot; With this thought she left
the house and became a bhikkhuni; eventually, she too attained arahatship.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the congregation of the bhikkhus, the Buddha was told how
Dhammika became a bhikkhu and attained arahatship, and how through him his son
and his wife also attained arahatship. To them the Buddha said, &quot;Bhikkhus,
a wise man does not wish for wealth and prosperity by doing evil, whether it is
for his own sake or for the sake of others. He only works for his own liberation
from the round of rebirths (samsara) by comprehending the Dhamma and living

Jivaka to the Buddha.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Devadatta, on one occasion, tried to kill the Buddha by
pushing a big rock from the peak ofGijjhakuta mountain (Vulture's Peak). The
rock struck a ledge on the side of the mountain and a splinter struck the big
toe of the Buddha. The Buddha was taken to the mango-grove monastery of Jivaka.
There, Jivaka, the renowned physician, attended on the Buddha; he put some
medicine on the toe of the Buddha and bandaged it. Jivaka then left to see
another patient in town, but promised to return and remove the bandage in the
evening. When Jivaka returned that night, the city-gates were already closed and
he could not come to see the Buddha that night. He was very upset because if the
bandage was not removed in time, the whole body would become very hot and the
Buddha would be very ill.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just about this time, the Buddha asked Thera Ananda to
remove the bandage from his big toe and found that the wound was completely
healed. Jivaka came to the monastery early next morning and asked the Buddha
whether he felt great pain and distress the previous night. The Buddha replied,
&quot;Jivaka! Ever since I attained Buddhahood there has been no pain and
distress for me.&quot;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While residing at the Veluvana monastery, the Buddha uttered
Verse (91) of this book, with reference to Thera Mahakassapa.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Buddha once spent the vassa at Rajagaha with a number of
bhikkhus. About two weeks before the end of the vassa, the Buddha informed the
bhikkhus that they would soon be leaving Rajagaha and told them to prepare for
departure. Some bhikkhus stitched and dyed new robes, some washed the old robes.
When some bhikkhus saw Mahakassapa washing his robes, they speculated, &quot;There
are so many people inside and outside Rajagaha who love and respect Thera
Mahakassapa and are constantly looking to all his needs; is it possible that the
thera would leave his lay devotees here and follow the Buddha elsewhere?&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the end of fifteen days, on the eve of his departure, the
Buddha thought that there might be some occasions like alms-food offering
ceremonies, initiation of novices, funerals, etc., and so it would not be proper
for all the bhikkhus to leave. So he decided that some bhikkhus should remain at
the Veluvana monastery and that the most suitable person would be Thera
Mahakassapa. Consequently, Thera Mahakassapa remained in Rajagaha with some
junior bhikkhus.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then the other bhikkhus said scornfully, &quot;Mahakassapa
has not accompanied the Buddha, just as we have predicted!&quot; The Buddha
heard their remark and said to them, &quot;Bhikkhus! Do you wish to say that my
son Kassapa is attached to his lay disciples of Rajagaha and to the things they
offer him? You are very much mistaken. My son Kassapa remains here under my
instruction; he is not attached to anything here.&quot;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thera Belatthasisa, after going on an alms-round in the
village, stopped on the way and took his food there. After the meal, he
continued his round of alms for more food. When he had collected enough food he
returned to the monastery, dried up the rice and hoarded it. Thus, there was no
need for him to go on an alms-round every day; he then remained in jhana
concentration for two or three days. Arising from jhana concentration he ate the
dried rice he had stored up, after soaking it in water. Other Bhikkhunis thought
ill of the thera on this account, and reported to the Buddha about his hoarding
of rice. Since then, the hoarding of food by the bhikkhus has been prohibited.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for Thera Belatthasisa, since he stored up rice before
the ruling on hoarding was made and because he did it not out of greed for food,
but only to save time for meditation practice, the Buddha declared that the
thera was quite innocent and that he was not to be blamed.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thera Anuruddha was one day looking for some discarded
pieces of cloth in a rubbish heap to make into a robe as his old robe was
getting soiled and torn. Jalini, his wife of a previous existence, who was now
in a deva world, saw him. Knowing that he was looking for some cloth, she took
three pieces of good deva material and put them in the rubbish heap, making them
barely visible. The thera found the pieces of cloth and took them to the
monastery. While he was making the robe, the Buddha arrived with his Chief
Disciples and senior disciples and they also helped stitch the robe.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Meanwhile, Jalini, assuming the form of a young lady, came
to the village and learnt about the arrival of the Buddha and his disciples and
also how they were helping Thera Anuruddha. She urged the villagers to send good
delicious food to the monastery and consequently there was more than enough for
all. Other bhikkhus, seeing so much surplus, put the blame on the thera and
said, &quot;Thera Anuruddha should have asked his relatives and lay disciples to
send just enough food; may be, he just wanted to show off that he had so many
devotees.&quot; To those bhikkhus, the Buddha said, &quot;Bhikkhus, do not think
my son Anuruddha has asked his relatives and lay disciples to send rice gruel
and other foods. My son the thera did not ask for anything; arahats do not talk
about such things like food and clothing. The excessive amount of food brought
to the monastery this morning was due to the promptings of a celestial being and
not of a man.&quot;</P>

young bhikkhu.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was the end of the vassa; and Thera Sariputta was about
to set out on a journey with some followers. A young bhikkhu, who bore some
grudge against the thera, approached the Buddha and falsely reported that Thera
Sariputta had abused him and beaten him. The Buddha therefore sent for the thera
and questioned him, and Thera Sariputta replied as follows: &quot;Venerable Sir!
How could a bhikkhu, who steadfastly keeps his mind on the body, set out on a
journey without apologizing, after doing wrong to a fellow bhikkhu? I am like
the earth, which feels no pleasure when flowers are cast on it, nor resentment
when rubbish and excreta are piled upon it. I am also like the door-mat, the
beggar, the bull with broken horns; I also feel abhorrence for the impurity of
the body and am no longer attached to it.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Thera Sariputta spoke thus, the young bhikkhu felt very
much distressed and wept bitterly, and admitted that he had lied about the Chief
Disciple Sariputta. Then the Buddha advised Thera Sariputta to accept the
apology of the young bhikkhu, lest a heavy punishment should fall on him and get
his head crushed. The young bhikkhu then admitted that he had done wrong and
respectfully asked for pardon. Thera Sariputta pardoned the young bhikkhu and
also asked to be forgiven if he also had done any wrong.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered

from Kosambi.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once, a seven year old boy was made a samanera at the
request of his father. Before his head was shaved the boy was given a subject of
meditation. While he was being shaved, the boy had his mind fixed steadfastly on
the object of meditation; as a result, he attained arahatship as soon as they
finished shaving his head.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After some time, Thera Tissa, accompanied by the samanera,
set out for Savatthi to pay homage to the Buddha. On the way, they spent one
night in a village monastery. The thera fell asleep, but the young samanera sat
up the whole night beside the bed of the old thera. Early in the morning, the
old thera thought it was time to wake up the young samanera. So he roused up the
samanera with a palm-leaf fan, and accidentally hit the eye of the samanera with
the handle of the fan and damaged the eye. The samanera covered that eye with
one hand and went about doing his duties of getting water for the thera to wash
his face and clean his mouth, sweeping the floor of the monastery, etc. When the
young samanera offered water with one hand to the thera, the thera chided him,
and said that he should offer things with both hands. Only then, did the thera
learn how the samanera lost his eye. At that instant, he realized that he had
wronged a truly noble person. Feeling very sorry and humiliated, he made an
apology to the samanera. But the samanera said that it was not the fault of the
thera, nor his own fault, but that it was only the result of kamma, and so the
thera was not to feel sad about it. But the thera could not get over the
unfortunate incident.</P>
<P>Then they continued their journey to Savatthi and arrived at the Jetavana
monastery where the Buddha was in residence. The thera then told tile Buddha
that the young samanera who came along with him was the most noble person he had
ever met, and related all that had happened on their way. The Buddha listened to
him, and replied, &quot;My son, an arahat does not get angry with anyone he is

Sariputta answered, &quot;Venerable Sir, in the matter of the realization of
Nibbana by meditating on the senses, it is not that I accept it because I have
faith in you; it is only those who have not personally realized it that accept

one hundred and twenty years old, and he realized that all beings are subject to
ageing and decay. So, he ran away from the house and went straight to a
monastery, where there were thirty bhikkhus. Those bhikkhus had been requested

it.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Samanera Revata took a subject of meditation from those

At the end of the vassa, the samanera attained arahatship. Thera Sariputta then

that he himself would go there. So the Buddha accompanied by Thera Sariputta,
Thera Sivali and five hundred other bhikkhus set out to visit Samanera Revata.</P>
