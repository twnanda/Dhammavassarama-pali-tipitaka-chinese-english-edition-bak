of <A NAME="Tambadathika">Tambadathika</A></FONT></B></FONT></P>
<P>While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (100) of
this book, with reference to Tambadathika, the executioner of thieves.</P>
<P>Tambadathika served the king as an executioner of thieves for fifty-five
years; he had just retired from that post. One day, after preparing rice gruel
at his house, he went to the river for a bath; he had intended to take the
specially prepared rice gruel on his return. As he was about to take the rice
gruel, Thera Sariputta, who had just arisen from sustained absorption in
Concentration (<I><FONT COLOR="#800040">jhana samapatti</FONT></I>), stood at
his door for alms-food. Seeing the thera, Tambadathika thought to himself,
&quot;Throughout my life, I have been executing thieves; now I should offer
this food to the thera.&quot; So, he invited Thera Sariputta to come in and
respectfully offered the rice gruel.</P>
<P>After the meal, the thera taught him the Dhamma, but Tambadathika could not
pay attention, because he was so agitated as he recollected his past life as an
executioner. When the thera knew this, he decided to ask Tambadathika tactfully
whether he killed the thieves because he wished to kill them or because he was
ordered to do so. Tambadathika answered that he was ordered to kill them by the
king and that he had no wish to kill. Then the thera asked, &quot;If that is
so, would you be guilty or not ?&quot;Tambadathika then concluded that, as he
was not responsible for the evil deeds, he was not guilty. He, therefore,
calmed down, and requested the thera to continue his exposition. As he listened
to the Dhamma with proper attention, he came very close to attaining Sotapatti
Magga, and reached as far as <I><FONT COLOR="#800040">anuloma
nana</FONT></I>.<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">* </FONT>After the discourse,
Tambadathika accompanied Thera Sariputta for some distance and then returned
home. On his way home a cow (actually a demon in the guise of a Cow) gored him
to death.</P>
<P>When the Buddha came to the congregation of the bhikkhus in the evening,
they informed him about the death of Tambadathika. When asked where
Tambadathika was reborn, the Buddha told them that although Tambadathika had
committed evil deeds throughout his life, because he comprehended the Dhamma
after hearing it from Thera Sariputta and had already attained anuloma nana
before he died, he was reborn in the Tusita deva world. The bhikkhus wondered
how such an evil-doer could have such great benefit after listening to the
Dhamma just once. To them the Buddha said that the length of a discourse is of
no consequence, for one single word of sense can produce much benefit.</P>

Story of <A
NAME="Bahiyadaruciriya">Bahiyadaruciriya</A></FONT></FONT></B></FONT></P>
<P>While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (101) of
this book, with reference to Bahiyadaruciriya.</P>
<P>A group of merchants went out to sea in a boat; their boat was wrecked at
sea and all, except one, died. The only survivor got hold of a plank and
eventually came to land at the port of Supparaka. As he was naked, he tied the
plank to his body, got hold of a bowl, and sat in a place where people could
see him. Passersby gave him rice and gruel; some took him for an arahat and
talked in praise of him. Some brought clothes for him to wear but he refused,
fearing that by wearing clothes, people would give less to him. Besides,
because some said that he was an arahat, he mistakenly came to think that he
really was one. Thus, because he was a man of wrong views who was wearing a
piece of wood as his clothing, he came to be known as Bahiyadaruciriya.</P>
<P>At about this time, Mahabrahma, who had been his friend in one of his
previous existences, saw him going astray and felt that it was his duty to put
Bahiya on the right path. So, Mahabrahma came to him in the night and said to
him &quot;Bahiya, you are not an arahat yet, and what is more, you do not have
the qualities that make one an arahat.&quot; Bahiya looked up at Mahabrahma and
said, &quot;Yes, I must admit that I am not an arahat, as you have said. I now
realize that I have done a great wrong. But is there anyone else in this world
now who is an arahat?&quot; Mahabrahma then told him that there lived in
Savatthi Gotama Buddha, an arahat, who was perfectly self-enlightened.</P>
<P>Bahiya, realizing the enormity of his guilt, felt very much distressed and
ran all the way to Savatthi. Mahabrahma helped him by his supernormal power, so
that the whole stretch of one hundred and twenty <I>yojanas</I> was covered in
one night. Bahiya found the Buddha going on an alms-round with other bhikkhus
and respectfully followed him. He pleaded with the Buddha to teach him the
Dhamma, but the Buddha replied that since they were on an alms-round it was not
yet time for a religious discourse. And again, Bahiya pleaded, &quot;Venerable
Sir, one cannot know the danger to your life or to my life, so please talk to
me about the Dhamma. The Buddha knew that Bahiya had made the journey of one
hundred and twenty yojanas in one night, and also that he was overwhelmed with
joy at seeing the Buddha. That was why the Buddha did not want to talk about
the Dhamma immediately but wanted him to calm down to enable him to take in the
Dhamma properly. Still, Bahiya persistently pleaded. So, while standing on the
road, the Buddha said to Bahiya, <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;Bahiya, when you
see an object, be conscious of just the visible object; when you hear a sound,
be conscious of just the sound; when you smell or taste or touch something, be
conscious of just the smell, the taste or the touch; and when you think of
anything, be conscious of just the mind-object.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P>After hearing the above discourse, Bahiya attained arahatship and he asked
permission from the Buddha to join the Order. The Buddha told him to get the
robes, the bowl and other requisites of a bhikkhu. On his way to get them, he
was gored to death by a cow which was, in fact, an ogress in the likeness of a
cow. When the Buddha and the other bhikkhus came out after having had their
meal, they found Bahiya lying dead on a rubbish heap. As instructed by the
Buddha, the bhikkhus cremated the body of Bahiya and had his bones enshrined in
a stupa.</P>
<P>Back at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha told the bhikkhus that Bahiya had
realized Nibbana. He also told them that as far as speed was concerned in
attaining Magga Insight (abhinna), Bahiya was the fastest, the best
(Etadaggam). The bhikkhus were puzzled by the statement made by the Buddha and
they asked him why and when Bahiya became an arahat. To this, the Buddha
replied, &quot;Bahiya attained arahatship while he listened to my instructions
given to him on the road when we were on the alms-round.&quot; The bhikkhus
wondered how one could attain arahatship after listening to just a few
sentences of the Dhamma. So, the Buddha told them that the number of words or
the length of a speech did not matter if it was beneficial to someone.</P>

<P>While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verses (102)
and (103) of this book, with reference to Then Kundalakesi.</P>
<P>Kundalakesi was the daughter of a rich man from Rajagaha. She had led a very
secluded life; but one day, she happened to see a thief being led out to be
killed and she immediately fell in love with him. Her parents had to pay for
the freedom of the thief, and they married her off to him. Although she loved
her husband very dearly, her husband being a thief, was only attracted to her
property and her jewels. One day, he coaxed her to put on all her jewellery and
led her to a mountain saying that he wanted to make some offerings to the
guardian spirit of the mountain because that guardian spirit had saved his life
when he was about to be killed. Kundalakesi went along with her husband, but
when they reached their destination, the thief revealed that he intended to
kill her and take her jewels. She pleaded with him to take her jewels, but to
spare her life, but it was of no avail. She then realized that if she did not
get rid of her husband, there would be no way of escape for her. She felt she
must be cautious and crafty. So she said to her husband that as they would be
together only for a few moments more, she wanted to pay respect to him for the
last time. So saying, and going round the man respectfully, she pushed him off
the crag, taking him unawares.</P>
<P>After this, she had no desire to return home. She left all her jewellery
hanging on a tree, and went on her way, without any idea where she was going.
She happened to come to a place of some <I><FONT
COLOR="#800040">Paribbajikas</FONT></I> (female wandering ascetics) and she
herself became a Paribbajikas. The Paribbajikas taught her all their one
thousand problems in sophistry; being intelligent she mastered all of them
within a short time. Then her teachers told her to go out into the world and if
she should find somebody who could answer all her questions, to become a pupil
to him. Kundalakesi went throughout the length and breadth of <I>Jambudipa</I>,
openly challenging everyone else to compete with her. Accordingly, she came to
be known as &quot;<I><FONT COLOR="#800040">Jambukaparibbajika</FONT></I>.&quot;
</P>
<P>On one occasion, she came to Savatthi. Before entering the city for
alms-food she made a mound of sand and stuck a branch of eugenia on it, her
usual sign of invitation to all others to take up her challenge. <I><FONT COLOR="#800040">Thera
Sariputta</FONT></I> took up her challenge. Kundalakesi asked him a thousand
questions and Thera Sariputta answered them all. When his turn came, he asked
her just this, &quot;What is the one? (<I><FONT COLOR="#800040">ekam nama
kim</FONT></I>).&quot; Kundalakesi could not answer, so she asked Thera
Sariputta to teach her the answer to the question. Thera Sariputta replied that
she should first become a<I><FONT COLOR="#800040">bhikkhuni</FONT></I>; so she
became a bhikkhuni, by the name of<I><FONT COLOR="#800040"> Thera
Kundalakesi</FONT></I>. Within a few days, she became an arahat.</P>
<P>Soon after this, the bhikkhus asked the Buddha, &quot;Could it be possible
for Bhikkhuni Kundalakesi to become an arahat after listening to the Dhamma
only a little?&quot; They also added that this lady had fought and won a
victory over her husband, who was a thief, before she became a paribbajika.</P>

<P>On one occasion, a Brahmin by the name of Anatthapucchaka came to the Buddha
and said to him, &quot;Venerable Sir, I think that you know only the practices
that are beneficial and not the practices that are unbeneficial.&quot; To him,
the Buddha answered that he also knew the practices which were unbeneficial and
harmful. Then the Buddha enumerated six practices which cause dissipation of
wealth; they are: (1) sleeping until the sun has risen, (2) habitual idleness,
(3) cruelty, (4) indulgence in intoxicants which causes drunkenness and
negligence, (5) sauntering alone in streets at unearthly hours, and (6) sexual
misconduct.</P>
<P>Further, the Buddha asked the brahmin how he earned his living, and the
brahmin replied that he earned his living by playing dice, i.e., by gambling.
Next, the Buddha asked him whether he won or lost. When the brahmin answered
that he sometimes lost and sometimes won, the Buddha said to him, 'To win in a
game of dice is nothing compared to a victory over moral defilements.&quot;</P>

<P>While residing in a village monastery near Dighalanghika., the Buddha
uttered Verse (109) of this book, with reference to Ayuvaddhanakumara.</P>
<P>Once, there were two hermits who fixed together practising religious
austerities (<I><FONT COLOR="#800040">tapacaranam</FONT></I>) for forty eight
years. Later, one of the two left the hermit life and got married. After a son
was born, the family visited the old hermit and paid obeisance to him. To the
parents the hermit said, &quot;May you live long,&quot; but he said nothing to
the child. The parents were puzzled and asked the hermit the reason for his
silence. The hermit told them that the child would live only seven more days
and that he did not know how to prevent his death, but Gotama Buddha might know
how to do it.</P>
<P>So the parents took the child to the Buddha; when they paid obeisance to the
Buddha, he also said, &quot;May you live long&quot; to the parents only and not
to the child. The Buddha also predicted the impending death of the child. To
prevent his death, the parents were told to build a pavilion at the entrance to
the house, and put the child on a couch in the pavilion. Then some bhikkhus
were sent there to recite the <FONT COLOR="#800040"><I>parittas*</I></FONT> for
seven days. On the seventh day the Buddha himself came to that pavilion; the
devas from all over the universe also came. At that time the ogre Avaruddhaka
was at the entrance, waiting for a chance to take the child away. But as more
powerful devas arrived the ogre had to step back and make room for them so that
he had to stay at a place two yojanas away from the child. That whole night,
recitation of parittas continued, thus protecting the child. The next day, the
child was taken up from the couch and made to pay obeisance to the Buddha. This
time, the Buddha said, &quot;May you live long&quot; to the child. When asked
how long the child would live, the Buddha replied that he would live up to one
hundred and twenty years. So the child was named Ayuvaddhana.</P>
<P>When the child grew up, he went about the country with a company of five
hundred fellow devotees. One day, they came to the Jetavana monastery, and the
bhikkhus, recognizing him, asked the Buddha, &quot;For beings is there any
means of gaining longevity?&quot; To this question the Buddha answered,
&quot;<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">By respecting and honouring the elders and those
who are wise and virtuous, one would gain not only longevity, but also beauty,

<P>While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (110) of

<P>On one occasion, thirty bhikkhus each took a subject of meditation from the
Buddha and left for a large village, one hundred and twenty yojanas away from
Savatthi. At that time, five hundred robbers were staying in a thick jungle,
and they wanted to make an offering of human flesh and blood to the guardian
spirits of the forest. So they came to the village monastery and demanded that
one of the bhikkhus be given up to them for sacrifice to the guardian spirits.
From the eldest to the youngest, each one of the bhikkhus volunteered to go.
With the bhikkhus, there was also a young samanera by the name of
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Samkicca</FONT>, who was sent along with them by
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Thera Sariputta</FONT>. This samanera was only seven
years old, but had already attained arahatship. Samkicca said that Thera
Sariputta, his teacher, knowing this danger in advance, had purposely sent him
to accompany the bhikkhus, and that he should be the one to go with the
robbers. So saying, he went along with the robbers. The bhikkhus felt very bad
for having let the young samanera go. The robbers made preparations for the
sacrifice; when everything was ready, their leader came to the samanera, who
was then seated, with his mind fixed on jhana concentration. The leader of the
robbers lifted his sword and struck hard at the young samanera, but the blade
of the sword curled up without cutting the flesh. He straightened up the blade
and struck again; this time, it bent upwards right up to the hilt without
harming the samanera. Seeing this strange happening, the leader of the robbers
dropped his sword, knelt at the feet of the samanera and asked his pardon. All
the five hundred robbers were amazed and terror-stricken; they repented and
asked permission from Samkicca to become bhikkhus. He complied with their
request.</P>
<P>The young samanera accompanied by five hundred new bhikkhus returned to the
village monastery and the thirty bhikkhus felt very much relieved and happy on
seeing him. Then Samkicca and the five hundred bhikkhus continued on their way
to pay respect to Thera Sariputta, his teacher, at the Jetavana monastery.
After seeing Thera Sariputta they went to pay homage to the Buddha. When told
what had happened, the Buddha said,<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"> &quot;Bhikkhus, if
you rob or steal and commit all sorts of evil deeds, your life would be

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Thera Kondanna</FONT></I>, after taking a subject
of meditation from the Buddha, went into the jungle to practise meditation and
there attained arahatship. Coming back to pay homage to the Buddha, he stopped
on the way because he was very tired. He sat on a large stone-slab, his mind
fixed in jhana concentration. At that moment five hundred robbers after looting
a large village came to the place where the thera was. Taking him for a tree
stump they put their bundles of loot all over and around the body of the thera.
When day broke they realized that what they took to be a tree stump was, in
fact, a living being. Then again, they thought it was an ogre and ran away in
fright.</P>
<P>The thera revealed to them that he was only a bhikkhu and not an ogre and
told them not to get frightened. The robbers were awed by his words, and asked
his pardon for having wronged him. Soon after wards, all the robbers requested
the thera to admit them into the Order. From that time, Thera Kondanna came to
be known as <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;Khanu Kondanna&quot;</FONT> (tree-stump

<P>While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (112) of
this book, with reference to Thera Sappadasa.</P>
<P>Once a bhikkhu was not feeling happy with the life of a bhikkhu; at the same
time he felt that it would be improper and humiliating for him to return to the
life of a householder. So he thought it would be better to die. So thinking, on
one occasion, he put his hand into a pot where there was a snake but the snake
did not bite him. This was because in a past existence the snake was a slave
and the bhikkhu was his master. Because of this incident the bhikkhu was known
as <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Thera Sappadasa</FONT>. On another occasion, Thera
Sappadasa took a razor to cut his throat; but as he placed the razor on his
throat he reflected on the purity of his morality practice throughout his life
as a bhikkhu and his whole body was suffused with delightful satisfaction
(<FONT COLOR="#800040"><I>piti</I></FONT>) and bliss (<I><FONT

directed his mind to the development of Insight Knowledge and soon attained
arahatship, and he returned to the monastery.</P>
<P>On arrival at the monastery, other bhikkhus asked him where he had been and
why he took the knife along with him. When he told them about his intention to
take his life, they asked him why he did not do so. He answered, &quot;I
originally intended to cut my throat with this knife, but I have now cut off
all moral defilements with the knife of Insight Knowledge.&quot; The bhikkhus
did not believe him; so they went to the Buddha and asked. &quot;Venerable Sir,
this bhikkhu claims, that he has attained arahatship as he was rutting the
knife to his throat to kill himself. Is it possible to attain Arahatta Magga
within such a short time?&quot; To them the Buddha said, <FONT

arahatship even before his raised foot touches the ground.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P>While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (113) of
this book, with reference to Patacara.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Patacara</FONT> was the daughter of a rich man from
Savatthi. She was very beautiful and was guarded very strictly by her parents.
But one day, she eloped with a young male attendant of the family and went to
live in a village, as a poor man's wife. In due course she became pregnant and
as the time for confinement drew near, she asked permission from her husband to
return to her parents in Savatthi. but her husband discouraged her. So, one
day, while her husband was away, she set out for the home of her parents. Her
husband followed her and caught up with her on the way and pleaded with her to
return with him; but she refused. It so happened that as her time was drawing
so near, she had to give birth to a son in one of the bushes. After the birth
of her son she returned home with her husband.</P>
<P>Then, she was again with child and as the time for confinement drew nears
taking her son with her, she again set out for the home of her parents in
Savatthi. Her husband followed her and caught up with her on the way; but her
time for delivery was coming on very fast and it was also raining hard. The
husband looked for a suitable place for confinement and while he was clearing a
little patch of land, he was bitten by a poisonous snake, and died
instantaneously. Patacara waited for her husband, and while waiting for his
return she gave birth to her second son. In the morning, she searched for her
husband, but only found his dead body. Saying to herself that her husband died
on account of her, she continued on her way to her parents.</P>
<P>Because it had rained incessantly the whole night, the river Aciravati was
in spate; so it was not possible for her to cross the river carrying both her
sons. Leaving the elder boy on this side of the river, she crossed the stream
with her day-old son and left him on the other bank. She then came back for the
elder boy. While she was still in the middle of the river, a large hawk hovered
over the younger child taking it for a piece of meat. She shouted to frighten
away the bird, but it was all in vain; the child was carried away by the hawk.
Meanwhile, the elder boy heard his mother shouting from the middle of the
stream and thought she was calling out to him to come to her. So he entered the
stream to go to his mother, and was carried away by the strong current. Thus,
Patacara lost her two sons as well as her husband.</P>
<P>So she wept and lamented loudly, &quot;A son is carried away by a hawk,
another son is carried away by the current, my husband is also dead, bitten by
a poisonous snake!&quot; Then, she saw a man from Savatthi and she tearfully
asked after her parents. The man replied that due to a violent storm in
Savatthi the previous night, the house of her parents had fallen down and that
both her parents together with her three brothers, had died, and had been
cremated on one funeral pyre. On hearing this tragic news, Patacara went stark
mad. She did not even notice that her clothes had fallen off from her and that
she was half-naked. She went about the streets, shouting out her woes.</P>
<P>While the Buddha was giving a discourse at the Jetavana monastery, he saw
Patacara at a distance; so he willed that she should come to the congregation.
The crowd seeing her coming tried to stop her, saying &quot;Don't let the mad
woman come in. &quot;But the Buddha told them not to prevent her coming in.
When Patacara was close enough to hear him, he told her to be careful and to
keep calm. Then, she realized that she did not have her skirt on and
shamefacedly sat down. Some one gave her a piece of cloth and she wrapped
herself up in it. She then told the Buddha how she had lost her sons, her
husband, her brothers and her parents.</P>
<P>The Buddha said to her, <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;Patacara, have no fear;
you have now come to one who can protect you and guide you. Throughout this
round of existences (samsara), the amount of tears you have shed on account of
the death of your sons, husbands, parents and brothers is voluminous; it is
even more than the waters of the four oceans.&quot;</FONT> Thus the Buddha
expounded to her the <I><B><FONT COLOR="#800040">Anamatagga
Sutta</FONT></B></I>, which dealt with countless existences, and she felt
relieved. Then, the Buddha added that one should not think too much about those
who were gone, but that one should purify oneself and strive to realize
Nibbana. On hearing this exhortation from the Buddha, Patacara attained
Sotapatti Fruition.</P>
<P>Then, Patacara became a bhikkhuni. One day, she was cleaning her feet with
water from a water-pot. As she poured the water for the first time, it flowed
only a short distance and disappeared; then she poured for the second time and
the water went a little farther, but the water she poured for the third time
went the farthest. As she looked at the flow and the disappearance of water
poured cut successively for three times, she came to perceive clearly the three
stages in the life of beings. The Buddha seeing her through supernormal power
from the Jetavana monastery sent forth his radiance and appeared to her in
person. He then said to her, <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;Patacara, you are now
on the right track, and you now have the true perception of the aggregates
(khandhas). One who does not perceive the impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Kisagotami</FONT> was the daughter of a rich man from
Savatthi; she was known as Kisagotami because of her slim body. Kisagotami was
married to a rich young man and a son was born to them. The boy died when he
was just a toddler and Kisagotami was stricken with grief. Carrying the dead
body of her son, she went about asking for medicine that would restore her son
to life from everyone she happened to meet. People began to think that she had
gone mad. But a wise man seeing her condition thought that he should be of some
help to her. So, he said to her, &quot;The Buddha is the person you should
approach, he has the medicine you want; go to him.&quot; Thus, she went to the
Buddha and asked him to give her the medicine that would restore her dead son
to life.</P>
<P>The Buddha told her to get some mustard seeds from a house where there had
been no death. Carrying her dead child in her bosom. Kisagotami went from house
to house, with the request for some mustard seeds. Everyone was willing to help
her, but she could not find a single house where death had not occurred. Then,
she realized that hers was not the only family that had faced death and that
there were more people dead than living. As soon as she realized this, her
attitude towards her dead son changed; she was no longer attached to the dead
body of her son.</P>
<P>She left the corpse in the jungle and returned to the Buddha and reported
that she could find no house where death had not occurred. Then the Buddha
said,<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"> &quot;Gotami, you thought that you were the only
one who had lost a Son. As you have now realized, death comes to all beings;
before their desires are satiated death takes them away.&quot; </FONT>On
hearing this, Kisagotami fully realized the impermanence, unsatisfactoriness
and insubstantiality of the aggregates and attained Sotapatti Fruition.</P>
<P>Soon afterwards, Kisagotami became a bhikkhuni. One day, as she was lighting
the lamps she saw the flames flaring up and dying out, and suddenly she clearly
perceived the arising and the perishing of beings. The Buddha, through
supernormal power, saw her from his monastery, and sent forth his radiance and
appeared to her in person. Kisagotami was told to continue meditating on the

of many children.</P>
<P>Once in Savatthi, there lived a couple, with their seven sons and seven
daughters. All the children got married and the family was doing quite well.
Then, the father died and the mother kept all the property without giving
anything to the children. Her sons and daughters wanted the inheritance, so
they said, to their mother, &quot;What benefit do we get from our property?
Can't we make it multiply? Can't we look after our mother?&quot; They said such
things again and again so their mother thought that her children would look
after her, and she finally divided up the property without leaving anything for
herself.</P>
<P>After the division of the property, she first went to stay with her eldest
son, but her daughter-in-law complained and said, &quot;She has come and stayed
with us, as if she has given us two shares!&quot;, and such other things. So,
Bahuputtika went to stay with her second son, and the same things were said.
Thus, she went from one son to another, from one daughter to the next; but none
of them was willing to take her on for a long stretch of time and none paid her
due respect.</P>
<P>The old lady was hurt and felt bitter against her children; she left her
family and became a bhikkhuni. Because she was a mother of many children she
came to he known as Bahuputtika. Bahuputika realized that she became a
bhikkhuni only in her old age and that she must not be negligent, but must make
use of the remaining period of her life to the utmost. So, for the whole night,
she meditated on the Dhamma taught by the Buddha. The Buddha seeing her from
the Jetavana monastery, through supernormal power, sent forth the radiance and

The Story of Culekasataka</FONT></A></B></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
uttered Verse (116) of this book, with reference to a brahmin couple by the
name of Culekasataka.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> There was once a brahmin couple in Savatthi, who had only
one outer garment between the two of them. Because of this they were also known
as Ekasataka. As they had only one outer garment, both of them could not go out
at the same time. So, the wife would go to listen to the discourse given by the
Buddha during the day and the husband would go at night. One night, as the
brahmin listened to the Buddha, his whole body came to be suffused with
delightful satisfaction and he felt a strong desire to offer the outer garment
he was wearing to the Buddha. But he realized that if he were to give away the
only outer garment he had, there would be none left for him and his wife. So he
wavered and hesitated. Thus, the first and the second watches of the night
passed. Came the third watch and he said to himself, &quot;If I am so miserly
and hesitant, I will not be able to avoid falling to the four Lower Worlds
(apayas); I shall now offer my outer garment to the Buddha.&quot; So saying, he
placed the piece of cloth at the feet of the Buddha and cried out &quot;I have
won&quot; three times.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> King Pasenadi of Kosala, who was among the audience, heard
those words and ordered a courtier to investigate. Learning about the brahmin's
offering to the Buddha, the king commented that the brahmin had done something
which was not easy to do and so should be rewarded. The king ordered his men to
give the brahmin a piece of cloth as a reward for his faith and generosity. The
brahmin offered that piece of cloth also to the Buddha and he was rewarded by
the king with two pieces of cloth. Again, the brahmin offered the two pieces of
cloth to the Buddha and he was rewarded with four. Thus, he offered to the
Buddha whatever was given him by the king, and each time the king doubled his
reward. When finally, the reward came up to thirty-two pieces of cloth, the
brahmin kept one piece for himself and another for his wife, and offered the
remaining thirty pieces to the Buddha.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Then, thinking again commented that the brahmin had truly
performed a very difficult task and so must be rewarded fittingly. The king
sent a messenger to the palace to bring two pieces of velvet cloth, each of
which was worth one hundred thousand, and gave them to the brahmin. The brahmin
made those two pieces of valuable cloth into two canopies and kept one in the
Perfumed Chamber where the Buddha slept and the other in his own house above
the place where a bhikkhu was regularly offered alms-food. When the king next
went to Jatavana monastery to pay homage to the Buddha, he saw the velvet
canopy and recognized it as the offering made by the brahmin and he was very
pleased. This time he made a reward of seven kinds in fours (sabbacatukka),
viz., four elephants, four horses, four female slaves, four male slaves, four
errand boys, four villages and four thousands in cash.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> When the bhikkhus heard about this, they asked the Buddha,
&quot;How is it that, in the case of this brahmin, a good deed done at present
bears fruit immediately?&quot; To them the Buddha replied <FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;If the brahmin had offered his outer garment in the first
watch of the night, he would have been rewarded with sixteen of each kind; if
he had made his offering during the middle watch, he would have been rewarded
with eight of each kind; since he had rnade his offering only during the last
watch of the night, he was rewarded with only four of each kind.&quot;</FONT>
So, when one wants to give in charity, one should do so quickly; if one
procrastinates, the reward comes slowly and only sparingly. Also, if one is too
slow in doing good deeds, one may not be able to do it at all, for the mind
tends to take delight in doing evil.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Laja realized that she was reborn in Tavatimsa because she

she concluded that she should keep on doing some services to the thera in order
to make her good fortune more enduring. So, every morning she went to the
monastery of the thera, swept the premises, filled up water pots, and did other
services. At first, the thera thought that young samaneras had done those
services; but one day, he found out that a female deva had been performing
those services. So he told her not to come to the monastery any more, as people
might start talking if she kept on coming to the monastery. Lajadevadhita was
very upset; she pleaded with the thera and cried, &quot;Please do not destroy

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Anathapindika drove the guardian spirit out of his house
for saying such things, and as Anathapindika was a sotapanna the guardian
spirit could not disobey him and so had to leave the premises. He had nowhere
to go and wanted to return but was afraid of Anathapindika . So, he approached
Sakka, king of the devas. Sakka advised him first to do a good turn to
Anathapindika, and after that, to ask his pardon. Then Sakka continued,
&quot;There are about eighteen crores taken as loans by some traders which are
not yet repaid to Anathapindika; another eighteen crores buried by the
ancestors of Anathapindika, which have been washed away into the ocean, and
another eighteen crores, which belong to no one, buried in a certain place. Go
and recover all these wealth by your supernatural power and fill up the rooms
of Anathapindika. Having done so, you may ask his pardon&quot;. The guardian
spirit did as instructed by Sakka, and Anathapindika again became rich.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> When the guardian spirit told Anathapindika about the
information and instructions given by Sakka, about the recovery of his riches
from underneath the earth, from within the ocean and from the debtors, he was
struck with awe. Then Anathapindika took the guardian spirit to the Buddha. To
both of them the Buddha said,<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"> &quot;One may not enjoy the

</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Once, a man from Savatthi, having heard a discourse given
by the Buddha, was very much impressed, and decided to practise what was taught
by the Buddha. The exhortation was to give in charity not only by oneself but
also to get others to do so and that by so doing one would gain much merit and
have a large number of followers in the next existence. So, that man invited
the Buddha and all the resident bhikkhus in the Jetavana monastery for
alms-food the next day. Then he went round to each one of the houses and
informed the residents that alms-food would he offered the next day to the
Buddha and other bhikkhus and so to contribute according to their wishes. The
rich man Bilalapadaka seeing the man goings round from house to house
disapproved of his behaviour and felt a strong dislike for him and murmured to
himself, &quot;O this wretched man! Why did he not invite as many bhikkhus as
he could himself offer alms, instead of going round coaxing people?&quot; So he
asked the man to bring his bowl and into this bowl, he put only a little rice,
only a little butter, only a little molass. These were taken away separately
and not mixed with what others had given. The rich men could not understand why
his thing; were kept separately, and he thought perhaps that man wanted others
to know that a rich man like him had contributed very little and so put him to
shame. Therefore, he sent a servant to find out. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The promoter of charity put a little of everything that was
given by the rich man into various pots of rice and curry and sweetmeats so
that the rich man may gain much merit. His servant reported what he had seen;
but Bilalapadaka did not get the meaning and was not sure of the intention of
the promoter of charity. However, the next day he went to the place where
alms-food was being offered. At the same time, he took a knife with him,
intending to kill the chief promoter of charity, if he were to reveal in public
just how little a rich man like him had contributed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> But this promoter of charity said to the Buddha,
&quot;Venerable Sir, this charity is a joint offering of all; whether one has
given much or little is of no account; each one of us has given in faith and
generosity; so may all of us gain equal merit.&quot; When he heard those words,
Bilalpadaka realized that he had wronged the man and pondered that if he were
not to own up his mistake and ask the promoter of charity to pardon him, he
would he reborn in one of the four lower worlds (apayas). So he said, &quot;My
friend, I have done you a great wrong by thinking ill of you; please forgive
me.&quot; The Buddha heard the rich man asking for pardon, and on enquiry found
out the reason. So, the Buddha said, <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;My disciple,
you should not think lightly of a good deed, however small it may be, for small
deeds will become big if you do them habitually.&quot;</FONT></P>

merchant Mahadhana also invited the bhikkhus who would like to go on the same
journey to accompany him, and he promised to look to their needs on the way. So
five hundred bhikkhus accompanied him. The robbers got news of the trip and
went ahead to lie in wait for the caravan of the merchant. But the merchant
stopped at the outskirts of the forest where the robbers were waiting. The
caravan was to move on after camping there for a few days. The robbers got the
news of the impending departure and made ready to loot the caravan; the
merchant, in his turn, also got news of the movements of the bandits and he
decided to return home. The bandits now heard that the merchant would go home;
so they waited on the homeward way. Some villagers sent word to the merchant
about the movements of the bandits, and the merchant finally decided to remain

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> While residing at the Veluvana monastery, the Buddha
uttered Verse (124) of this book, with reference to the hunter Kukkutamitta and
his family.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> At Rajagaha there was once a rich man's daughter who had
attained Sotapatti Fruition as a young girl. One day, Kukkutamitta, a hunter,
came into town in a cart to sell venison. Seeing Kukkutamitta the hunter, the
rich young lady fell in love with him immediately; she followed him, married
him and lived with him in a small village. As a result of that marriage, seven
sons were born to them and in course of time, all the sons got married. One
day, the Buddha surveyed the world early in the morning with his supernormal
power and found that the hunter, his seven son and their wives were due for
attainment of Sotapatti Fruition. So, the Buddha went to the place where the
hunter had set his trap in the forest. He put his footprint close to the trap
and seated himself under the shade of a bush, not far from the trap.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> When the hunter came, he saw no animal in the trap; he saw
the footprint and surmised that someone must have come before him and let cut
the animal. So, when he saw the Buddha under the shade of the bush, he took him
for the man who had freed the animal from his trap and flew into a rage. He
took out his bow and arrow to shoot at the Buddha, but as he drew his bow, he
became immobilized and remained fixed in that position like a statue. His sons
followed and found their father; they also saw the Buddha at some distance and
thought he must he the enemy of their father. All of them took out their bows
and arrows to shoot at the Buddha, but they also became immobilized and
remained fixed in their respective postures. When the hunter and his sons
failed to return, the hunter's wife followed them into the forest, with her
seven daughters-in-law. Seeing her husband and all her sons with their arrows
aimed at the Buddha, she raised both her hands and shout: &quot;Do not kill my
father.&quot; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> When her husband heard her words, he thought, &quot;This
must be my father-in-law&quot;, and her sons thought, &quot;This must be our
grandfather; and thoughts of loving-kindness came into them. Then the lady said
to them, ''Put away your bows and arrows and pay obeisance to my father&quot;.
The Buddha realized that, by this time, the minds of the hunter and his son;
had softened and so he willed that they should be able to move and to put away
their bows and arrows. After putting away their bows and arrows, they pad
obeisance to the Buddha and the Buddha expounded the Dhamma to them. In the
end, the hunter, his seven sons and seven daughters-in-law, all fifteen of
them, attained Sotapatti Fruition. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Then the Buddha returned to the monastery and told Thera
Ananda and other bhikkhus about the hunter Kukkutamitta and his family
attaining Sotapatti Fruition in the early part of the morning. The bhikkhus
then asked the Buddha, 'Venerable Sir, is the wife of the hunter who is a
sotapanna, also not guilty of taking life, if she has been getting things like
nets, bows and arrows for her husband when he goes out hunting?&quot; To this
question her Buddha answered,<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"> &quot;Bhikkhus, the
sotapannas do not kill, they do not wish others to get killed. The wife of the
hunter was only obeying her husband in getting things for him. Just as the hand
that has no wound is not affected by poison, so also, because she has no
intention to do evil she is not doing any evil.&quot;</FONT> </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> One morning, as Koka was going out to hunt with his pack of
hounds, he met a bhikkhu entering the city for alms-food. He took that as a bad
omen and grumbled to himself, &quot;Since I have seen this wretched one, I
don't think I would get anything today,&quot; and he went on his way. As
expected by him he did not get anything. On his way home also he again saw the
same bhikkhu returning to the monastery after having had his alms-food in the
city, and the hunter became very angry. So he set his hounds on the bhikkhu.
Swiftly, the bhikkhu climbed up a tree to a level just out of reach of the
hounds. Then the hunter went to the foot of the tree and pricked the heels of
the bhikkhu with the tip of his arrow. The bhikkhu was in great pain and was
not able to hold his robes on; so the robes slipped off his body on to the
hunter who was at the foot of the tree.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The dogs seeing the yellow robe thought that the bhikkhu
had fallen off the tree and pounced on the body, biting and pulling at it
furiously. The bhikkhu, from his shelter in the tree, broke a dry branch and
threw it at the dogs. Then the dogs discovered that they had been attacking
their own master instead of the bhikkhu, and ran away into the forest. The
bhikkhu came down from the tree and found that the hunter had died and felt
sorry for him. He also wondered whether he could be held responsible for the
death, since the hunter had died for having been covered up by his yellow
robes. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> So, he went to the Buddha to clear up his doubt. The Buddha
said, &quot;My son, rest assured and have no doubt; you are not responsible for
the death of the hunter; your morality (sila) is also not soiled on account of
that death. Indeed, that huntsman did a great wrong to one whom he should do no

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Once, there was a gem polisher and his wife in Savatthi;
there was also a thera, who was an arahat. Every day, the couple offered
alms-food to the thera. One day, while the gem polisher was handling meat, a
messenger of King Pasenadi of Kosala arrived with a ruby, which was to be cut
and polished and sent back to the king. The gem polisher took the ruby with his
hand which was covered with blood, put it on a table and went into the house to
wash his hands. The pet crane of the family seeing the blood stained ruby and
taking it for a piece of meat picked it up and swallowed it in the presence of
the thera. When the gem polisher returned, he found that the ruby was missing.
He asked his wife and his son and they answered that they had not taken it.
Then, he asked the thera and the thera said that he did not take it; but he was
not satisfied. As there was no one else in the house, the gem polisher
concluded that it must be the thera who had taken the precious ruby: so he told
his wife that he must torture the thera to get admission of theft.</P>
<P> But his wife replied, &quot;This thera had been our guide and teacher for
the last twelve years, and we have never seen him doing anything evil; please
do not accuse the thera. It would be better to take the king's punishment than
to accuse a noble one.&quot; But her husband paid no heed to her words; he took
a rope and tied up the thera and beat him many times with a stick, as a result
of which the thera bled profusely from the head, ears and nose, and dropped on
the floor. The crane, seeing blood and wishing to take it, came close to the
thera. The gem polisher, who was by then in a great rage, kicked the crane with
all his might and the bird died instantaneously. Then, the thera said,
&quot;Please see whether the crane is dead or not,&quot; and the gem polisher
replied, &quot;You too shall die like this crane. When the thera was sure the
crane had died, he said softly, &quot;My disciple, the crane swallowed the
ruby.&quot;</P>
<P> Hearing this, the gem polisher cut up the crane and found the ruby in the
stomach. Then the gem polisher realized his mistake and trembled with fear. He
pleaded with the thera to pardon him and also to continue standing at his door
for alms. To him the thera replied, &quot;My disciple, it is not your fault,
nor is it mine. This has happened on account of what has been done in our
previous existences; it is just our debt in samsara; I feel no ill will towards
you. As a matter of fact, this has happened because I have entered a house.
From today, I would not enter any house; I would only stand at the door.&quot;
Soon after saying this, the them expired as a result of his injuries. </P>
<P>Later, the bhikkhus asked the Buddha where the various characters in the
above episode were reborn, and the Buddha answered, &quot;The crane was reborn
as the son of the gem polisher; the gem polisher was reborn in niraya; the wife
of the gem polisher was reborn in one of the deva worlds; and the thera, who
was already an arahat when he was living, realized Parinibbana. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
uttered Verse (127) of this book, with reference to questions raised by three
groups of bhikkhus concerning three extraordinary incidents.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The first group: A group of bhikkhus were on their way to
pay homage to the Buddha and they stopped at a village on the way. Some people
were cooking alms-food for those bhikkhus when one of the houses caught fire
and a ring of fire flew up into the air. At that moment, a crow came flying,
got caught in the ring of fire and dropped dead in the central part of the
village. The bhikkhus seeing the dead crow observed that only the Buddha would
be able to explain for what evil deed this crow had to die in this manner.
After taking alms-food they continued on their journey to pay homage to the
Buddha, and also to ask about the unfortunate crow. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The second group: Another group of bhikkhus wore travelling
in a boat; they too wore on their way to pay homage to the Buddha. When they
were in the middle of the ocean the boat could not be moved. So, lots were
drawn to find out who the unlucky one was; three times the lot fell on the wife
of the skipper. Then the skipper said sorrowfully, &quot;Many people should not
die on account of this unlucky woman; tie a pot of sand to her neck and threw
her into the water so that I would not so her.&quot; The woman was thrown into
the sea as instructed by the skipper and the ship could move on. On arrival at
their destination. the bhikkhus disembarked and continued on their way to the
Buddha. They also intended to ask the Buddha due to what evil kamma the
unfortunate woman was thrown overboard. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The third group: A group of seven bhikkhus were also on
their way to pay homage to the Buddha. On the way, they enquired at a monastery
whether there was any suitable place for them to take shelter for the night in
the neighbourhood. They were directed to a cave, and there they spent the
night; but in the middle of the night, a large boulder slipped off from above
and effectively closed the entrance. In the morning, the bhikkhus from the
nearby monastery coming to the cave saw what had happened and they went to
bring people from seven villages. With the help of these people they tried to
move the boulder, but it was of no avail. Thus, the seven bhikkhus were trapped
in the cave without food or water for seven days. On the seventh day, the
boulder moved miraculously by itself, and the bhikkhus came out and continued
their way to the Buddha. They also intended to ask the Buddha due to what
previous evil deed they were thus shut up for seven days in a cave.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The three groups of travellers met on the way and together
they went to the Buddha. Each group related to the Buddha what they had seen or
experienced on their way and the Buddha answered their questions. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The Buddha answer to the first group: &quot;Bhikkhus, once
there was a farmer who had an ox. The ox was very lazy and also very stubborn.
It could not be coaxed to do any work; it would lie down chewing the cud or
else go to sleep. The farmer lost his temper many times on account of this
lazy, stubborn animal; so in anger he tied a straw rope round the neck of the
ox and set fire to it, and the ox died. On account of this evil deed the,
farmer had suffered for a long time in niraya. and in serving out the remaining
part of his punishment, he had been burnt to death in the last seven existences
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The Buddha's answer to the second group: &quot;Bhikkhus,
once there was a woman who had a pet dog. She used to take the dog along with
her wherever she went and young boys of the city poked fun at her. She was very
angry and felt so ashamed that she planned to kill the dog. She filled a pot
with sand, tied it round the neck of the dog and threw it into the water; and
the dog was drowned. On account of this evil deed that woman had suffered for a
long time in niraya and in serving the remaining part of her punishment, she
had been thrown into the water to drown in the last one hundred
existences.&quot; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The Buddha's answer to the third group: &quot;Bhikkhus,
once, seven cowherds saw an iguana going into a mound and they dosed all the
seven outlets of the mound with twigs and branches of trees. After closing the
outlets they went away, completely forgetting the iguana that was trapped in
the mound. Only after seven days, they remembered what they had done and
hurriedly returned to the scene of their mischief and let out the iguana. On
account of this evil deed, those seven had been imprisoned together for seven
days without any food, in the last fourteen existences.&quot; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Then, a bhikkhu remarked, &quot;O indeed! There is no
escape from evil consequences for one who has done evil, even if he were in the
sky, or in the ocean, or in a cave. To him, the Buddha said, &quot;Yes,
Bhikkhu! You are right; even in the sky or anywhere else, there is no place
which is beyond the reach of evil consequences.&quot; </P>

Suppabuddha, to renounce the world; and secondly, because his son Devadatta,
who was admitted into the Order by Gotama Buddha, had come to regard the Buddha
as his arch enemy. One day, knowing that the Buddha would be coming for
alms-food, he got himself drunk and blocked the way. When the Buddha and the
bhikkhus came, Suppabuddha refused to make way, and sent a message saying,
&quot;I cannot give way to Samana Gotama, who is so much younger than me.&quot;
Finding the road blocked, the Buddha and the bhikkhus turned back. Suppabuddha
then sent so someone to follow the Buddha secretly and find out what the Buddha
said, and to report to him. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> As the Buddha turned back, he said to Ananda, &quot;Ananda,
because King Suppabuddha had refused to give way to me, on the seventh day from
now he would be swallowed up by the earth, at the foot of the steps leading to
the pinnacled hall of his palace.&quot; The king's spy heard these words and
reported to the king. And the king said that he would not go near those steps
and would prove the words of the Buddha to be wrong. Further, he instructed his
men to remove those steps, so that he would not be able to use them; he also
kept some men on duty, with instructions to hold him back should he go in the
direction of the stairs. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> When the Buddha was told about the king's instructions to
his men, he said, &quot;Bhikkhus! Whether King Suppabuddha lives in a pinnacled
tower, or up in the sky, or in an ocean, or in a cave, my word cannot go wrong;
King Suppabuddha will be swallowed up by the earth at the very place I have
told you.&quot; </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"> Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows: </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> On the seventh day, about the time of the alms meal the
royal horse got frightened for some unknown reason and started neighing loudly
and kicking about furiously. Hearing frightening noises from his horse, the
king felt that he must handle his pet horse and forgetting all precautions, he
started towards the door. The door opened of its own accord, the steps which
had been pulled down earlier were also there, his men forgot to stop him from
going down. So the king went down the stairs and as soon as he stepped on the
earth, it opened and swallowed him up and dragged him right down to Avici
Niraya.</P>
