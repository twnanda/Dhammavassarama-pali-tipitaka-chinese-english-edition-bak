<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once
in Savatthi, there was a man who had been a butcher for fifty-five years. All
this time, he slaughtered cattle and sold the meat and everyday he took meat
curry with his rice. One day, he left some meat with his wife to cook it for
the family, and then left for the riverside to have his bath. During his
absence, a friend coaxed his wife to sell that particular piece of meat to him.
As a result, there was no meat curry for the butcher on that day. But as the
butcher never took his meal without meat curry, he hurriedly went to the back
of his house, where an ox was standing. He promptly cut off the tongue of the
ox and baked it over a fire. When having his meal, the butcher had a bite of
the tongue of the ox, but as he did so his own tongue was cut off and fell into
his plate of rice. Thus the ox and the butcher were in the same plight, both of
them having had their tongues cut off. The butcher was in great pain and agony,
and he went about agitatedly on his knees, with blood dripping profusely from
his mouth. Then the butcher died and was reborn in the Avici Niraya.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
butcher's wife was greatly disturbed and she was anxious for her son to get
away to some other place, lest this evil should befall him too. So she sent her
son to Taxila. At Taxila, he acquired the art of a goldsmith. Later, he married
the daughter of his master and some children were born to them. When their sons
came of age he returned to Savatthi. The sons were endowed with faith in the
Buddha and were religiously inclined. They were anxious about their father, who
had grown old with no thought of religion or of his future existence. So one
day, they invited the Buddha and the bhikkhus to their house for alms-food.
After the meal they said to the Buddha, 'Venerable Sir, we are making this
offering to you today on behalf of our father. Kindly give a discourse
specially for him. So the Buddha said, &quot;My disciple! You are getting old;
but you have not made any provisions of merit for your journey to the next
existence; you should now find a support for yourself.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once,
a brahmin saw a group of bhikkhus rearranging their robes as they were
preparing to enter the city for alms-food. While he was looking, he found that
the robes of some of the bhikkhus touched the ground and got wet because of dew
on the grass. So he cleared that patch of ground. The next day, he found that
as the robes of the bhikkhus touched bare ground, the robes got dirty. So he
covered that patch of ground with sand. Then again, he observed that the
bhikkhus would sweat when the sun was shining and that they got wet when it was
raining. So finally, he built a rest house for the bhikkhus at the place where
they gathered before entering the city for alms-food.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
the building was finished, he invited the Buddha and the bhikkhus for

wise perform their acts of merit little by little, and gradually and constantly
they remove the impurities of moral defilements.&quot;</P>

</TR>
<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#FEFEDA"> <BR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once
there was a thera named Tissa in Savatthi. One day, he received a set of fine
robes and was very pleased. He intended to wear those robes the next day. But
that very night he died and because he was attached to the fine set of robes,
he was reborn as a louse and lived within the folds of the robes. As there was
no one to inherit his belongings, it was decided that this particular set of
robes should be shared by other bhikkhus. When the bhikkhus were preparing to
share out among themselves, the louse was wry much agitated and cried out,
&quot;They are destroying my robes!&quot; This cry was heard by the Buddha by
means of his divine power of hearing. So he sent someone to stop the bhikkhus
and instructed them to dispose of the robes only at the end of seven days. On
the eighth day, the set of the robes which belonged to Thera Tissa was shared
out by the bhikkhus.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, the Buddha was
asked by the bhikkhus why he had told them to wait for seven days before
sharing out the robes of Thera Tissa. To them the Buddha replied, &quot;My
sons, Tissa had his mind attached to this particular set of robes at the time
of his death, and so he was reborn as a louse and stayed in the folds of the
robes. When you all were preparing to share out the robes, Tissa the louse was
very much in agony and was running about to and fro in the folds of the robes.
If you had taken the robes at that time Tissa the louse would have felt very
bitter against you and he would have to go to niraya. But now, Tissa has been
reborn in the Tusita deva world, and that is why I have allowed you to take the
robes. Indeed, bhikkhus, attachment is very dangerous; as rust corrodes iron
from which it is formed, so also, attachment destroys one and sends one io
niraya. A bhikkhu should not indulge too much in the use of the four requisites
or be very much attached to them.&quot;</P>
<P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Buddha spoke
in verse as follows:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B><FONT
COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT COLOR="#800040">Verse 240.</FONT> Just as rust is formed
from iron, and corrodes the iron from which it is formed, so also, his own
deeds lead the transgressor to a lower plane of existence (duggati).

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Savatthi, people
coming back after hearing the discourses given by Thera Sariputta and Thera
Maha Moggallana were always full of praise for the two Chief Disciples. On one
occasion, Laludayi, hearing their praises, said to those people that they would
be saying the same about him after listening to his discourses. So Laludayi was
asked to deliver a discourse; he climbed on to the platform but he could not
say anything. So he asked the audience to let another bhikkhu take the turn
first and that he would take the next turn. In this way, he put off three
times.</P>
<P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The audience lost
patience with him and shouted, &quot;You big fool! When we praised the two
Chief Disciples you were vainly boasting that you could preach like them. Why
don't you preach now ?&quot; So Laludayi ran away and the crowd chased him. As
he was frightened and was not looking where he was going, he fell into a
latrine pit.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
the Buddha was told about this incident, he said, &quot;Laludayi had learned
very little of the Dhamma; he does not recite the religious texts regularly; he
has not memorized anything. Whatever little he has learned gets rusty by not
reciting.&quot;</P>

only one who was respectfully and attentively listening to the Buddha. Thera
Ananda, who was near the Buddha fanning him saw the different behaviour of the
five disciples and said to the Buddha, &quot;Venerable Sir! While you were
expounding the Dhamma like big drops of rain falling from the sky, only one out
of those five people were listening attentively.&quot; 'Then Thera Ananda

they were behaving thus.</P>

these people could not get rid of their old habits. In their past existences,
the first one was a snake; as a snake usually coils itself up and goes to
sleep, so also, this man goes to sleep while listening to the Dhamma. The one
who was scratching the earth with his hand was an earthworm, the one who was
shaking the tree was a monkey, the one who was gazing up at the sky was an
astronomer and the one who was listening attentively to the Dhamma was a
learned astrologer. In this connection, Ananda, you must remember that one must
be attentive to be able to understand the Dhamma and that there are many people
who cannot follow what was being said.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thera
Ananda then asked the Buddha, &quot;Venerable Sir! What are the things that
prevent people from being able to take in the Dhamma? And the Buddha replied,
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;Ananda, passion (raga), ill will (dosa) and
ignorance (moha) are the three things that prevent people from taking in the
Dhamma. Passion burns one; there is no fire like passion. The world may burn up
when seven suns rise in the sky, but that happens very rarely. Passion burns
always and without any break.&quot;</FONT></P>

Mendaka was an extremely rich man. It was said that he found a large number of

known as Mendaka (a goat) the rich man. Again, it was also said that during the
time of Vipassi Buddha he had donated a monastery for Vipassi Buddha and a
congregation hall complete with a platform for the preacher. On completion of
these buildings he made offerings of alms-food to Vipassi Buddha and the
bhikkhus for four months. Then, in yet another of his past existences, when he
was a rich man in Baranasi, there was a famine throughout the region. One day,
they had cooked a meal just enough for the members of the family when a
paccekabuddha stood at the door for alms-food. Then and there he offered all
the food. But due to his great faith and generosity, the rice pot was later
found to be miraculously filled up again; so also were his granaries.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

pay homage to him. After hearing the discourse given by the Buddha, Mendaka,
his wife Candapaduma, his son Danancaya, his daughter-in-law Sumanadevi, his
granddaughter Visakha. and the servant Punna attained Sotapatti Fruition.
Mendaka then told the Buddha how on his way, some ascetics had spoken ill of
the Buddha and had tried to dissuade him from coming to see him. The Buddha
then said, <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;My disciple, it is natural for people

Subhadda the wandering ascetic was staying at Kusinara. when he heard that the
parinibbana of Gotama Buddha would take place in the last watch of that night.
Subhadda had three questions which had been troubling him for a long time. He
had already put these questions to other religious leaders, namely, Purana
Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya
Belatthaputta and Nigantha Nataputta, but their answers did not satisfy him. He
had not yet asked Gotama Buddha, and he felt that only the Buddha could answer
his questions. So, he hurried off to the Sal Grove, but the Venerable Ananda
did not allow him to see the Buddha, because the Buddha was by that time very
weak. The Buddha overheard their conversation and consented to see Subhadda.
Subhadda asked three questions. They are: <FONT COLOR="#FF0080">(1) Are there
any tracks in the sky? (2) Are there any ariya bhikkhus (samanas) outside the
Teaching of the Buddha? and (3) Is there any conditioned thing (sankhara) that
is permanent? </FONT>The Buddha's answer to all the above questions was
negative.</P>

day, he would exhort others to listen to the Dhamma, and he himself would
recite the one stanza he knew. Every time he had finished his recitation, the
guardian spirits (devas) of the forests praised him and applauded him

do the preaching himself. Ekudana held the fan in front of him and recited the

Hatthaka was in the habit of challenging ascetics of non-Buddhist faiths to
meet him in a certain place to debate on religious matters. He would then go
out by himself to the self-appointed place. When nobody appeared he would
boast, &quot;Look, those wandering ascetics dare not meet me, they have been

Buddha did not say anything after receiving something from their lay-disciples.
This was because during the first twenty years after the Buddha's attainment of

the followers of the Buddha were silent when ascetics of other doctrines were
saying things which were pleasing to their disciples, people began to compare
the two groups.</P>

to say words of blessing to their disciples after receiving offerings. As a

adhere to the practice of the muni and keep silent, whereas the followers of
Samana Gotama go about talking exuberantly in the eating places.&quot; On
hearing those disparaging remarks, the Buddha said, &quot;Bhikkhus! There are
some who keep silent because they are ignorant and timid, and some who keep
silent because they do not want to share their profound knowledge with others.

it occurred to him that it would be even better if he could make the other two
bhikkhus leave the place and have the monastery all to himself. Thus, he tried
to set one against the other. The two bhikkhus quarrelled and left the
monastery in different directions. On account of this evil deed, that bhikkhu
was reborn in Avici Niraya and he was serving out the remaining part of his
term of suffering as a swine-peta with its mouth swarming with maggots. Then
the Buddha exhorted,<FONT COLOR="#800040"> &quot;A bhikkhu should be calm and
well-restrained in thought, word and deed.&quot;</FONT></P>

evil. One should purify these three courses of action and accomplish the
practice of the Path of Eight Constituents made known by the Buddhas.

this book, with reference to Thera Potthila.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#FEFEDA"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Potthila was a senior
bhikkhu who knew the Pitaka well and was actually teaching the Dhamma to five
hundred bhikkhus. Because he knew the Pitaka, he was also very conceited. The
Buddha knew his weakness and wanted him to mend his ways and put him on the
right path. So, whenever Potthila came to pay obeisance, the Buddha would
address him as 'Useless Potthila'. When Potthila heard these remarks, he
pondered over those words of the Buddha and came to realize that the Buddha had
made those unkind remarks because he, Potthila, had not made any serious effort
to practise meditation and had not achieved any of the Maggas or even any level
of mental absorption (jhana).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thus, without telling anyone Thera Potthila left for a monastery at a place
twenty yojanas away from the Jetavana monastery. At that monastery there were
thirty bhikkhus. First, he went to the most senior bhikkhu and humbly requested
him to be his mentor; but the thera, wishing to humble him, asked him to go to
the next senior bhikkhu, who in his turn sent him on to the next. In this way,
he was sent from one to the other until he came to a seven year old arahat
samanera. The young samanera accepted him as a pupil only after ascertaining
that Potthila would obediently follow his instructions. As instructed by the
samanera, Thera Potthila kept his mind firmly fixed on the true nature of the
body; he was very ardent and vigilant in his meditation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Buddha saw Potthila in his vision and through supernormal power made Potthila
feel his presence and encouraged him to be steadfast and ardent.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then
the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:</P>

is born of meditation; without meditation wisdom is lost. Knowing this twofold
path of gain and loss of wisdom, one should conduct oneself so that wisdom may
increase. </FONT></B></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once, in Savatthi, there
were five friends who became bhikkhus only in their old age. These five
bhikkhus were in the habit of going together to their old homes for alms-food.
Of the former wives of those five, one lady in particular, by the name of
Madhurapacika was a good cook and she looked after them very well. Thus, the
five bhikkhus went mostly to her house. But one day, Madhurapacika fell ill and
died suddenly. The old bhikkhus felt their loss very deeply and together they
cried praising her virtues and lamenting their loss.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once, a young, handsome
son of a goldsmith was admitted into the Order by Thera Sariputta. The young
bhikkhu was given loathsomeness of the dead body as the subject of meditation
by Thera Sariputta. After taking the subject of meditation he left for the
forest and practised meditation there; but he made very little progress. So he
returned twice to Thera Sariputta for further instructions. Still, he made no
progress. So Thera Sariputta took the young bhikkhu to the Buddha, and related
everything about the young bhikkhu.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Buddha knew that the young bhikkhu was the son of a goldsmith, and also that he
had been born in the family of goldsmiths during his past five hundred
existences. Therefore the Buddha changed the subject of meditation for the
young bhikkhu; instead of loathsomeness, he was instructed to meditate on
pleasantness. With his supernormal power, the Buddha created a beautiful lotus
flower as big as a cart-wheel and told the young bhikkhu to stick it on the
mound of sand just outside the monastery. The young bhikkhu, concentrating on
the big, beautiful, fragrant lotus flower, was able to get rid of the
hindrances. He was filled with delightful satisfaction (piti), and step by step
he progressed until he reached as far as the fourth level of mental absorption
(jhana).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Buddha saw him from his perfumed chamber and with his supernormal power made
the flower wither instantly. Seeing the flower wither and change its colour,
the bhikkhu perceived the impermanent nature of the flower and of all other
things and beings. That led to the realization of the impermanence,
unsatisfactoriness and the insubstantiality of all conditioned things. At that
instant, the Buddha sent forth his radiance and appeared as if in person to the
young bhikkhu and instructed him to get rid of craving (tanha).</P>
<P> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Buddha spoke

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once, a merchant from
Baranasi came to a festival in Savatthi with five hundred carts fully loaded
with textiles and other merchandise. When he reached a river bank near Savatthi
the river was in spate; so he could not cross the river. He was held up for
seven days as it was raining hard and the water did not subside. By that time,
he was already late for the festival, and there was no need for him to cross
the river.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since he had come from a long distance he did not want to return home with his
full load of merchandise. So he decided to spend the rainy season, the cold
season and the hot season in that place and said so to his assistants. The
Buddha while going on an alms-round knew the decision of the merchant and he
smiled. Ananda asked the Buddha why he smiled and the Buddha replied,
&quot;Ananda, do you see that merchant? He is thinking that he would stay here
and sell his goods the whole year. He is not aware that he would die here in
seven days' time. <FONT COLOR="#800040">What should be done should be done
today. Who would know that one would die tomorrow? We have no date fixed with
the King of Death. For one who is mindful by day or by night, who is not
disturbed by moral defilements and is energetic, to live for just one night is
a well-spent life. </FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then
the Buddha sent Ananda to Mahadhana, the merchant. Ananda explained to
Mahadhana that time was running out for him, and that he should practise
mindfulness instead of being negligent. On learning about his impending death,
Mahadhana was alarmed and frightened. So, for seven days, he invited the Buddha
and other bhikkhus for alms-food. On the seventh day, the Buddha expounded a
discourse in appreciation (anumodana</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then
the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:</P>

will I live in the rainy season; here will I live in the cold season and the
hot season&quot;, so imagines the fool, not realizing the danger (of
approaching death). </FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At
the end of the discourse Mahadhana the merchant attained Sotapatti Fruition. He
followed the Buddha for some distance and returned. On his return, he had a
severe headache and passed away soon after. Mahadhana was reborn in the Tusita
deva world.</P>
