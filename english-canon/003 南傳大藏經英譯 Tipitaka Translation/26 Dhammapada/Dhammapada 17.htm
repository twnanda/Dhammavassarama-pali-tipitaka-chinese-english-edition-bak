<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="221"></a>Abandon anger,<BR>
be done with conceit,<BR>
get beyond every fetter.<BR>
When for name &amp; form <BR>
you have no attachment<BR>
-- have nothing at all -- <BR>
no sufferings, no stresses, invade.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<b>222:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="222"></a>When anger arises,<BR>
whoever keeps firm control<BR>
as if with a racing chariot:<BR>
him <BR>
I call a master charioteer.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone else, <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a rein-holder -- <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that's all.

<b>223:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="223"></a>Conquer anger<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with lack of anger;<BR>
bad, with good;<BR>
stinginess, with generosity;<BR>
a liar, with truth.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<br><p>
<b>224:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="224"></a>By telling the truth;<BR>
by not growing angry;<BR>
by giving, when asked,<BR>
no matter how little you have:<BR>
by these three things<BR>
you enter the presence of devas.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<br><p>
<b>225:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="225"></a>Gentle sages,<BR>
constantly restrained in body,<BR>
go to the unwavering state<BR>
where, having gone, <BR>
there's no grief.

<b>226:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="226"></a>Those who always stay wakeful,<BR>
training by day &amp; by night,<BR>
keen on Unbinding:<BR>
their effluents come to an end.

<b>227-228:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="227"></a>This has come down from old, Atula,<BR>
&amp; not just from today:<BR>
they find fault with one<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who sits silent,<BR>
they find fault with one<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who speaks a great deal,<BR>
they find fault with one<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who measures his words.<BR>
There's no one unfaulted in the world.<BR>
<P>
<a name="228"></a>There never was,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will be,<BR>
nor at present is found<BR>
anyone entirely faulted<BR>
or entirely praised.

<b>229-230:</b>

<a name="229"></a><a name="230"></a>If knowledgeable people praise him,<BR>
having observed him<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; day after day<BR>
to be blameless in conduct, intelligent,<BR>
endowed with discernment &amp; virtue:<BR>
like an ingot of gold -- <BR>
who's fit to find fault with him?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even devas praise him.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even by Brahmas he's praised.
