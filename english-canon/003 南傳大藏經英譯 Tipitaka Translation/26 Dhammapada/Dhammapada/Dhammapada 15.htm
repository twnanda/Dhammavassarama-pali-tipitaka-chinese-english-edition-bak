<b>201:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="201"></a>Winning gives birth to hostility.<BR>
Losing, one lies down in pain.<BR>
The calmed lie down with ease,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; having set <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; winning &amp; losing<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aside.

<b>202-204:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="202"></a>There's no fire like passion,<BR>
no loss like anger,<BR>
no pain like the aggregates,<BR>
no ease other than peace.<BR>
<P>
<a name="203"></a>Hunger: the foremost illness.<BR>
Fabrications: the foremost pain.<BR>
For one knowing this truth <BR>
as it actually is,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbinding <BR>
is the foremost ease.<BR>
<P>
<a name="204"></a>Freedom from illness: the foremost good fortune.<BR>
Contentment: the foremost wealth.<BR>
Trust: the foremost kinship.<BR>
Unbinding: the foremost ease.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="205"></a>Drinking the nourishment,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the flavor,<BR>
of seclusion &amp; calm,<BR>
one is freed from evil, devoid <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of distress,<BR>
refreshed with the nourishment<BR>
of rapture in the Dhamma.

<b>206-208:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="206"></a>It's good to see Noble Ones.<BR>
Happy their company -- always.<BR>
Through not seeing fools<BR>
constantly, constantly<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one would be happy.<BR>
<P>
<a name="207"></a>For, living with a fool,<BR>
one grieves a long time.<BR>
Painful is communion with fools,<BR>
as with an enemy -- <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; always.<BR>
Happy is communion <BR>
with the enlightened,<BR>
as with a gathering of kin.<BR>
<P>
<a name="208"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So:<BR>
the enlightened man -- <BR>
discerning, learned,<BR>
enduring, dutiful, noble,<BR>
intelligent, a man of integrity:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; follow him<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- one of this sort -- <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as the moon, the path <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the zodiac stars.
