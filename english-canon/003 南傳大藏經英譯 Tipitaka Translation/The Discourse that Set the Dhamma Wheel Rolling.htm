</DIR>

<P>&szlig;There are these two extremes, monks, that one who has gone forth ought not to associate with,</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>which is this: devotion to the pleasure and happiness in sense pleasures,<BR>
which is low, vulgar, worldly, ignoble, and not connected with the goal;<BR>
and this: devotion to self-mortification,<BR>
which is painful, ignoble, and not connected with the goal.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Not having approached either of these two extremes, monks, the middle practice was awakened to by the Realised One, which produces vision, produces knowledge, and which leads to peace, deep knowledge, Complete Awakening, and Nibb&agrave;na.</P>
<P>Now what is this middle practice, monks, that was awakened to by the Realised One, which produces vision, produces knowledge, and which leads to peace, deep knowledge, Complete Awakening, and Nibb&agrave;na? </P>
<P>It is this noble path with eight factors, as follows:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>right view<BR>
right thought<BR>
right speech<BR>
right action<BR>
right livelihood<BR>
right endeavour<BR>
right mindfulness<BR>
right concentration.</P></DIR>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Now this, monks, is the noble truth of suffering:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>birth is suffering<BR>
also<B> </B>old age is suffering<BR>
also<B> </B>sickness is suffering<BR>
also<B> </B>death is suffering<BR>
being joined to what is not dear is suffering<BR>
being seperated from what is dear is suffering<BR>
also<B> </B>not to obtain what one longs for is suffering<BR>
in brief, the five constituents (of mind and body) that are attached to are suffering.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Now this, monks, is the noble truth of the arising of suffering:</P>
<P>it is that craving which leads to continuation in existence,<BR>
which is connected with enjoyment and passion, greatly enjoying this and that, as follows:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>craving for sense pleasures<BR>
craving for continuation<BR>
craving for discontinuation.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Now this, monks, is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering:<BR>
it is the complete fading away and cessation without remainder of that craving -<BR>
liberation, letting go, release, and non-adherence.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Now this, monks,</P>
<P>is the noble truth of the practice going to the end of suffering:<BR>
It is this noble path with eight factors, as follows:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>right view<BR>
right thought<BR>
right speech<BR>
right action<BR>
right livelihood<BR>
right endeavour<BR>
right mindfulness<BR>
right concentration.</P></DIR>

<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>- turned like this, in three ways, twelvefold -<BR>
knowledge and seeing as it really is was quite clear then, monks, I did declare to the world with its gods, M&agrave;ra, and Brahma, to this generation, with its ascetics and brahmins, princes and men, that I was a Full and Pefrect Sambuddha with unsurpassed complete awakening. </P>
<P>To me knowledge and seeing arose:</P><DIR>

and the group-of-five monks were uplifted and greatly rejoiced in what was said by the Auspicious One.</P></DIR>

<P>Moreover, as this sermon was being given, to venerable Ko&otilde;&oacute;a¤¤a the dust-free, stainless, Vision-of-the-Dhamma arose:</P><DIR>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"><P>Now when the Dhamma Wheel was set rolling by the Auspicious One the Earth gods let loose a cry: </P>
<P>&szlig;The Auspicious One, while near B&agrave;r&agrave;&otilde;as&atilde;, in the Deer Park at Isipatana,<BR>
has set rolling the unsurpassed Dhamma Wheel,<BR>
and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or by a brahmin<BR>
or by a god or by a demon or by a deity or by anyone in the world.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Having heard the cry of the Earth gods the gods called the Four Great Kings let loose a cry:</P>
<P>&szlig;The Auspicious One, while near B&agrave;r&agrave;&otilde;as&atilde;, in the Deer Park at Isipatana,<BR>
has set rolling the unsurpassed Dhamma Wheel,<BR>
and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or by a brahmin<BR>

<P>Having heard the cry of the gods called the Four Great Kings the T&agrave;vati&uuml;sa gods let loose a cry:</P>
<P>&szlig;The Auspicious One, while near B&agrave;r&agrave;&otilde;as&atilde;, in the Deer Park at Isipatana,<BR>

or by a god or by a demon or by a deity or by anyone in the world.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Having heard the cry of the T&agrave;vati&uuml;sa gods the Y&agrave;ma gods let loose a cry:</P>
<P>&szlig;The Auspicious One, while near B&agrave;r&agrave;&otilde;as&atilde;, in the Deer Park at Isipatana,<BR>
has set rolling the unsurpassed Dhamma Wheel,<BR>
and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or by a brahmin<BR>
or by a god or by a demon or by a deity or by anyone in the world.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Having heard the cry of the Y&agrave;ma gods the Tusita gods let loose a cry:</P>
<P>&szlig;The Auspicious One, while near B&agrave;r&agrave;&otilde;as&atilde;, in the Deer Park at Isipatana,<BR>
has set rolling the unsurpassed Dhamma Wheel,<BR>
and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or by a brahmin<BR>
or by a god or by a demon or by a deity or by anyone in the world.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Having heard the cry of the Tusita gods the Nimm&agrave;&otilde;arati gods let loose a cry:</P>
<P>&szlig;The Auspicious One, while near B&agrave;r&agrave;&otilde;as&atilde;, in the Deer Park at Isipatana,<BR>
has set rolling the unsurpassed Dhamma Wheel,<BR>
and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or by a brahmin<BR>
or by a god or by a demon or by a deity or by anyone in the world.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Having heard the cry of the Nimm&agrave;&otilde;arati gods the Paranimmitavasavatti gods let loose a cry:</P>

or by a god or by a demon or by a deity or by anyone in the world.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Thus at that moment, at that second, that cry reached as far as the Brahma worlds, and this ten thousand world-element moved, wavered, and shook, and great and measureless light became manifest in the world, transcending the godly power of the gods.</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One uttered this inspired utterance:</P>
<P>&szlig;My dear Ko&otilde;&oacute;a¤¤a surely knows,<BR>
my dear Ko&otilde;&oacute;a¤¤a surely knows.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Thus to the venerable Ko&otilde;&oacute;a¤¤a came the name A¤¤&agrave; Ko&otilde;&oacute;a¤¤a (Ko&otilde;&oacute;a¤¤a, he-who-knows).<A NAME="ms"></A></P>
