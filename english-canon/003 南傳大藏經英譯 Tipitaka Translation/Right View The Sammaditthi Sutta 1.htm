    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Sammaditthi Sutta, the Discourse on Right View, is the
    ninth sutta of the Majjhima Nikaya, the Collection of Middle
    Length Discourses.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its expositor is the Venerable
    Sariputta Thera, the Buddha's chief disciple and the foremost
    of the Master's bhikkhu disciples in the exercise of the
    faculty of wisdom.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Buddha declared that next
    to himself, it was the Venerable Sariputta who excelled in
    turning the incomparable Wheel of the Dhamma, in expounding
    in depth and in detail the Four Noble Truths realized with
    the attainment of enlightenment.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the
    Sammaditthi Sutta the great disciple bears ample testimony to
    the Buddha's words of praise, bequeathing upon us a discourse
    that has served as a primer of Buddhist doctrine for
    generations of monks in the monasteries of South and
    Southeast Asia.</p>
    <p>As its title suggests, the subject of the Sammaditthi
    Sutta is right view.&nbsp;&nbsp; The analysis of right view
    undertaken in the sutta brings us to the very core of the
    Dhamma, since right view constitutes the correct
    understanding of the central teachings of the Buddha, the
    teachings which confer upon the Buddha's doctrine its own
    unique and distinctive stamp.&nbsp;&nbsp; Though the practice
    of right mindfulness has rightly been extolled as the crest
    jewel of the Buddha's teaching, it cannot be stressed
    strongly enough that the practice of mindfulness, or any
    other approach to meditation, only becomes an effective
    instrument of liberation to the extent that it is founded
    upon and guided by right view.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, to confirm
    the importance of right view, the Buddha places it at the
    very beginning of the Noble Eightfold Path.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Elsewhere in the Suttas the Buddha calls right view the
    forerunner of the path (<i>pubbangama</i>), which gives
    direction and efficacy to the other seven path factors.</p>
    <p>Right view, as explained in the commentary to the
    Sammaditthi Sutta, has a variety of aspects, but it might
    best be considered as twofold:&nbsp;&nbsp; conceptual right
    view, which is the intellectual grasp of the principles
    enunciated in the Buddha's teaching, and experiential right
    view, which is the wisdom that arises by direct penetration
    of the teaching.&nbsp;&nbsp; Conceptual right view, also
    called the right view in conformity with the truths (<i>saccanulomika-sammaditthi</i>),
    is a correct conceptual understanding of the Dhamma arrived
    at by study of the Buddha's teachings and deep examination of
    their meaning.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such understanding, though
    conceptual rather than experiential, is not dry and
    sterile.&nbsp;&nbsp; When rooted in faith in the Triple Gem
    and driven by a keen aspiration to realize the truth embedded
    in the formulated principles of the Dhamma, it serves as a
    critical phase in the development of wisdom (<i>panna</i>),
    for it provides the germ out of which experiential right view
    gradually evolves.</p>
    <p>Experiential right view is the penetration of the truth of
    the teaching in one's own immediate experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Thus it is also called right view that penetrates the truths
    (<i>saccapativedha-sammaditthi</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp; This type of
    right view is aroused by the practice of insight meditation
    guided by a correct conceptual understanding of the
    Dhamma.&nbsp;&nbsp; To arrive at direct penetration, one must
    begin with a correct conceptual grasp of the teaching and
    transform that grasp from intellectual comprehension to
    direct perception by cultivating the threefold training in
    morality, concentration and wisdom.&nbsp;&nbsp; If conceptual
    right view van be compared to a hand, a hand that grasps the
    truth by way of concepts, then experiential right view can be
    compared to an eye -- the eye of wisdom that sees directly
    into the true nature of existence ordinarily hidden from us
    by our greed, aversion and delusion.</p>
    <p>The Discourse on Right View is intended to elucidate the
    principles that are to be comprehended by conceptual right
    view and penetrated by experiential right view.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The Venerable Sariputta expounds these principles under
    sixteen headings:&nbsp;&nbsp; the wholesome and the
    unwholesome, the four nutriments of life, the Four Noble
    Truths, the twelve factors of dependent arising, and the
    taints as the condition for ignorance.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be
    noted that from the second section to the end of the sutta,
    all the expositions are framed in accordance with the same
    structure, which reveals the principle of conditionality as
    the scaffolding for the entire teaching.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each
    phenomenon to be comprehended by right view is expounded in
    terms of its individual nature, its arising, its cessation,
    and the way leading to its cessation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The grasp
    of this principle thus makes it clear that any entity taken
    for examination is not an isolated occurrence with its being
    locked up in itself, but part of a web of conditionally
    arisen processes that can be terminated by understanding and
    eliminating the cause that gives it being.</p>
    <p>The right view arrived at by penetrating any of the
    sixteen subjects expounded in the sutta is discussed in terms
    of two aspects, both aspects of supramundane
    penetration.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first is the initial penetration
    of the supramundane path that transforms a person from a
    worldling (<i>puthujjana</i>) into a stream-enterer (<i>sotapanna</i>),
    a noble disciple who has entered irreversibly upon the stream
    to liberation.&nbsp;&nbsp; This aspect of right view is
    indicated by the words that open each section, &quot;(one)
    who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at
    this true Dhamma.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; These qualities are
    attributes only of the stream-enterer and those of higher
    attainment along the path.&nbsp;&nbsp; The description thus
    applies to the trainee (<i>sekha</i>), the disciple who has
    entered the path but has not yet reached its end.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The words signify right view as a transformative vision which
    has revealed the ultimate truths underlying our existence,
    but which must still be developed further to complete the
    full transformation it is capable of effecting.</p>
    <p>The second aspect of supramundane right view is indicated
    by the closing words of each section, from &quot;he entirely
    abandons the underlying tendency to lust&quot; to &quot;he
    here and now makes an end of suffering.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This description is fully applicable only to the Arahant, the
    liberated one, and thus indicates that the right view
    conceptually grasped by the wise worldling, and transformed
    into direct perception with the attainment of stream-entry,
    reaches its consummation with the arrival at the teaching's
    final goal, the attainment of complete emancipation from
    suffering.</p>

    <p>The translation of the Sammaditthi Sutta and its
    commentary presented here has been adapted from manuscripts
    left behind by Bhikkhu Nanamoli.&nbsp;&nbsp; The translation
    of the sutta has been adapted from Ven. Nanamoli's complete
    translation of the Majjhima Nikaya.&nbsp;&nbsp; The version
    used has been taken from the edition of the complete Majjhima
    Nikaya translation that I prepared for publication by Wisdom
    Publications in the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp; This version,
    tentatively scheduled for release in late 1992, employs
    extensive substitution of Ven. Nanamoli's own technical
    terminology with my own preferred renderings of Pali
    doctrinal terms.</p>
    <p>The commentary to the Sammaditthi Sutta is from the
    Papancasudani, Acariya Buddhaghosa's complete commentary (<i>atthakatha</i>)
    to the Majjhima Nikaya.&nbsp;&nbsp; The translation of the
    commentary has also been adapted from a rendering by Ven.
    Nanamoli, contained in a notebook of his that was discovered
    only a few years ago at Island Hermitage.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    terminology used in the notebook version suggests that it was
    one of Ven. Nanamoli's earliest attempts at translation from
    the Pali; it certainly preceded his translation of the
    Visuddhimagga, The Path of Purification, first completed at
    the end of 1953.&nbsp;&nbsp; In adapting the translation, I
    have naturally replaced the technical terminology used in the
    notebook version with that used in the sutta.&nbsp;&nbsp; In
    places I also decided to translate directly from the Pali
    text rather than adhere to Ven. Nanamoli's rendering, which
    sometimes tended to be literal to the point of
    awkwardness.&nbsp;&nbsp; A few passages from the commentary
    that are concerned solely with linguistic clarification have
    been omitted from the translation.</p>
    <p>Passages in the commentarial section enclosed in square
    brackets are taken from the subcommentary to the Sammaditthi
    Sutta, by Acariya Dhammapala.&nbsp;&nbsp; Passages in
    parenthesis are additions either by Ven. Nanamoli or by
    myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; The paragraph numbering of the
    commentarial section follows that of the sutta.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The phrases of the sutta that are selected for comment have
    been set in boldface.&nbsp;&nbsp; The backnotes are entirely
    my own.</p>
