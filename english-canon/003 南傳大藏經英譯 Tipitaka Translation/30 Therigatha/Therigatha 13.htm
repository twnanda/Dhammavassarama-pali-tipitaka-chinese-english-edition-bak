<h3><A NAME="1">XIII.1</A> -- Ambapali</h3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Black was my hair<br>
-- the color of bees -- <br>
&amp; curled at the tips;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with age, it looked like coarse hemp.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Fragrant, like a perfumed basket<br>
filled with flowers: my coiffure.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age it smelled musty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like animal fur.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Thick &amp; lush, like a well-tended grove,<br>
made splendid, the tips elaborate<br>
with comb &amp; pin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, it grew thin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; bare here &amp; there.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Adorned with gold &amp; delicate pins,<br>
it was splendid, ornamented with braids.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, with age,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that head has gone bald.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Curved, as if well-drawn by an artist,<br>
my brows were once splendid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, they droop down in folds.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Radiant, brilliant like jewels,<br>
my eyes: elongated, black -- deep black.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, they're no longer splendid.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Like a delicate peak, my nose<br>
was splendid in the prime of my youth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, it's like a long pepper.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Like bracelets -- well-fashioned, well-finished -- <br>
my ears were once splendid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, they droop down in folds.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Like plaintain buds in their color,<br>
my teeth were once splendid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, they're broken &amp; yellowed.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Like that of a cuckoo in the dense jungle,<br>
flitting through deep forest thickets:<br>
sweet was the tone of my voice.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, it cracks here &amp; there.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Smooth -- like a conch shell well-polished -- <br>
my neck was once splendid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, it's broken down, bent.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Like rounded door-bars -- both of them -- <br>
my arms were once splendid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, they're like dried up patali trees.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Adorned with gold &amp; delicate rings,<br>
my hands were once splendid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, they're like onions &amp; tubers.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Swelling, round, firm, &amp; high,<br>
both my breasts were once splendid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the drought of old age, they dangle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like empty old water bags.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Like a sheet of gold, well-burnished,<br>
my body was splendid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it's covered with very fine wrinkles.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Smooth in their lines, like an elephant's trunk,<br>
both my thighs were once splendid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, they're like knotted bamboo.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Adorned with gold &amp; delicate anklets,<br>
my calves were once splendid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, they're like sesame sticks.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
As if they were stuffed with soft cotton,<br>
both my feet were once splendid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, they're shriveled &amp; cracked.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Such was this physical heap,<br>
now: decrepit, the home of pains, many pains.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A house with its plaster all fallen off.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
