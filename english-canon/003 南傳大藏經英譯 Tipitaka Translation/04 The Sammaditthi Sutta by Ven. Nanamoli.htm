  <P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus have I heard.&nbsp;&nbsp; On one occasion the Blessed 
  One was living at Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Park.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  There the Venerable Sariputta addressed the bhikkhus thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  "Friends, bhikkhus."&nbsp;&nbsp; -- "Friend," they replied.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
  Venerable Sariputta said this:</P>
  <P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; "'One of right view, one of right view' is said, 
  friends.&nbsp;&nbsp; In what way is a noble disciple one of right view, whose 
  view is straight, who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma, and has arrived at 
  this true Dhamma?"</P>
  <P>"Indeed, friend, we would come from far away to learn from the Venerable 
  Sariputta the meaning of this statement.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be good if the 
  Venerable Sariputta would explain the meaning of this statement.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Having heard it from him, the bhikkhus will remember it."</P>
  <P>"Then, friends, listen and attend closely to what I shall say."</P>
  <P>"Yes, friend," the bhikkhus replied.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Venerable Sariputta 
  said this:</P>
  <H3><FONT color=#800080>The Wholesome and the Unwholesome</FONT></H3>
  <P>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; "When, friends, a noble disciple understands the 
  unwholesome, the root of the unwholesome, the wholesome, and the root of the 
  wholesome, in that way he is one of right view, whose view is straight, who 
  has perfect confidence in the Dhamma, and has arrived at this true Dhamma.</P>
  <P>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what, friends, is the unwholesome, what is the root of 
  the unwholesome, what is the wholesome, what is the root of the 
  wholesome?&nbsp;&nbsp; Killing living beings is unwholesome; taking what is 
  not given is unwholesome; misconduct in sensual pleasures is unwholesome; 
  false speech is unwholesome; malicious speech is unwholesome; harsh speech is 
  unwholesome; gossip is unwholesome; covetousness is unwholesome; ill will is 
  unwholesome; wrong view is unwholesome.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is called the 
  unwholesome.</P>
  <P>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what is the root of the unwholesome?&nbsp;&nbsp; Greed 
  is a root of the unwholesome; hate is a root of the unwholesome; delusion is a 
  root of the unwholesome.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is called the root of the 
  unwholesome.</P>
  <P>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what is the wholesome?&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstention from 
  killing living beings is wholesome; abstention from taking what is not given 
  is wholesome; abstention from misconduct in sensual pleasures is wholesome; 
  abstention from false speech is wholesome; abstention from malicious speech is 
  wholesome; abstention from harsh speech is wholesome; abstention from gossip 
  is wholesome; non-covetousness is wholesome; non-ill will is wholesome; right 
  view is wholesome.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is called the wholesome.</P>
  <P>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what is the root of the wholesome?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Non-greed is a root of the wholesome; non-hate is a root of the wholesome; 
  non-delusion is a root of the wholesome.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is called the root 
  of the wholesome.</P>
  <P>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; "When a noble disciple has thus understood the unwholesome, 
  the root of the unwholesome, the wholesome, and the root of the wholesome, he 
  entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust, he abolishes the underlying 
  tendency to aversion, he extirpates the underlying tendency to the view and 
  conceit 'I am,' and by abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge he 
  here and now makes an end of suffering.&nbsp;&nbsp; In that way too a noble 
  disciple is one of right view, whose view is straight, who has perfect 
  confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true Dhamma."</P>
  <H3><FONT color=#800080>Nutriment</FONT></H3>
  <P>9.&nbsp;&nbsp; Saying, "Good, friend," the bhikkhus delighted and rejoiced 
  in the Venerable Sariputta's words.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then they asked him a further 
  question:&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, friend, might there be another way in which a 
  noble disciple is one of right view &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  and has arrived at this true Dhamma?"&nbsp;&nbsp; -- "There might be, 
  friends.</P>
  <P>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; "When, friends, a noble disciple understands nutriment, the 
  origin of nutriment, the cessation of nutriment, and the way leading to the 
  cessation of nutriment, in that way he is one of right view 
  &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and has arrived at this true 
  Dhamma.</P>
  <P>11.&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what is nutriment, what is the origin of nutriment, 
  what is the cessation of nutriment, what is the way leading to the cessation 
  of nutriment?&nbsp;&nbsp; There are these four kinds of nutriment for the 
  maintenance of beings that already have come to be and for the support of 
  those seeking a new existence.&nbsp;&nbsp; What four?&nbsp;&nbsp; They are 
  physical food as nutriment, gross or subtle; contact as the second; mental 
  volition as the third; and consciousness as the fourth.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the 
  arising of craving there is the arising of nutriment.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the 
  cessation of craving there is the cessation of nutriment.&nbsp;&nbsp; The way 
  leading to the cessation of nutriment is just this Noble Eightfold Path; that 
  is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, 
  right effort, right mindfulness and right concentration.</P>
  <P>12.&nbsp;&nbsp; "When a noble disciple has thus understood nutriment, the 
  origin of nutriment, the cessation of nutriment, and the way leading to the 
  cessation of nutriment, he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to greed, 
  he abolishes the underlying tendency to aversion, he extirpates the underlying 
  tendency to the view and conceit 'I am,' and by abandoning ignorance and 
  arousing true knowledge he here and now makes an end of suffering.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  In that way too a noble disciple is one of right view, whose view is straight, 
  who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true 
  Dhamma."</P>

  <P>13.&nbsp;&nbsp; Saying, "Good, friend," the bhikkhus delighted and rejoiced 
  in the Venerable Sariputta's words.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then they asked him a further

  <P>14.&nbsp;&nbsp; "When, friends, a noble disciple understands suffering, the 
  origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the way leading to the 
  cessation of suffering, in that way he is one of right view 
  &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and has arrived at this true 
  Dhamma.</P>
  <P>15.&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what is suffering, what is the origin of suffering, 
  what is the cessation of suffering, what is the way leading to the cessation 
  of suffering?&nbsp;&nbsp; Birth is suffering; aging is suffering; sickness is 
  suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair 
  are suffering; not to obtain what one wants is suffering; in short, the five 
  aggregates affected by clinging are suffering.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is called 
  suffering.</P>
  <P>16.&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what is the origin of suffering?&nbsp;&nbsp; It is 
  craving, which brings renewal of being, is accompanied by delight and lust, 
  and delights in this and that; that is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving 
  for being and craving for non-being.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is called the origin of 
  suffering.</P>
  <P>17.&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what is the cessation of suffering?&nbsp;&nbsp; It is 
  the remainderless fading away and ceasing, the giving up, relinquishing, 
  letting go and rejecting of that same craving.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is called the 
  cessation of suffering.</P>
  <P>18.&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what is the way leading to the cessation of 
  suffering?&nbsp;&nbsp; It is just this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right 
  view &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right concentration.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  This is called the way leading to the cessation of suffering.</P>
  <P>19.&nbsp;&nbsp; "When a noble disciple has thus understood suffering, the 
  origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the way leading to the 
  cessation of suffering &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he here and now 
  makes an end of suffering.&nbsp;&nbsp; In that way too a noble disciple is one 
  of right view &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and has arrived at this

  <P>21.&nbsp;&nbsp; "When, friends, a noble disciple understands aging and 
  death, the origin of aging and death, the cessation of aging and death, and 
  the way leading to the cessation of aging and death, in that way he is one of 
  right view &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and has arrived at this 
  true Dhamma.</P>
  <P>22.&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what is aging and death, what is the origin of aging 
  and death, what is the cessation of aging and death, what is the way leading 
  to the cessation of aging and death?&nbsp;&nbsp; The aging of beings in the 
  various orders of beings, their old age, brokenness of teeth, grayness of 
  hair, wrinkling of skin, decline of life, weakness of faculties -- this is 
  called aging.&nbsp;&nbsp; The passing of beings out of the various orders of 
  beings, their passing away, dissolution, disappearance, dying, completion of 
  time, dissolution of the aggregates, laying down of the body -- this is called 
  death.&nbsp;&nbsp; So this aging and this death are what is called aging and 
  death.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the arising of birth there is the arising of aging and 
  death.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the cessation of birth there is the cessation of aging 
  and death.&nbsp;&nbsp; The way leading to the cessation of aging and death is 
  just this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view 
  &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right concentration.</P>
  <P>23.&nbsp;&nbsp; "When a noble disciple has thus understood aging and death, 
  the origin of aging and death, the cessation of aging and death, and the way

  <P>26.&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what is birth, what is the origin of birth, what is

  their coming to birth, precipitation (in a womb), generation, manifestation of 
  the aggregates, obtaining the bases for contact -- this is called 
  birth.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the arising of being there is the arising of

  <P>54.&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what is mentality-materiality, what is the origin of 
  mentality-materiality, what is the cessation of mentality-materiality, what is 
  the way leading to the cessation of mentality-materiality?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Feeling, perception, volition, contact and attention -- these are called 
  mentality.&nbsp;&nbsp; The four great elements and the material form derived 
  from the four great elements -- these are called materiality.&nbsp;&nbsp; So 
  this mentality and this materiality are what is called 
  mentality-materiality.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the arising of consciousness there is 
  the arising of mentality-materiality.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the cessation of 
  consciousness there is the cessation of mentality-materiality.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
  way leading to the cessation of mentality-materiality is just this Noble 
  Eightfold Path; that is, right view &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  right concentration.</P>

  mentality-materiality, the origin of mentality-materiality, the cessation of 
  mentality-materiality, and the way leading to the cessation of 
  mentality-materiality &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he here and now 
  makes an end of suffering.&nbsp;&nbsp; In that way too a noble disciple is one
