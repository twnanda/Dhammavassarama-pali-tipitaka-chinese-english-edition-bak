Mettagu:
<blockquote>
I ask you, O Blessed One.<br>
Please tell me.<br>
I regard you as knowledgeable,<br>
with your self developed.<br>
From what have the many<br>
forms of stress &amp; suffering<br>
arisen in the world?
</blockquote>
The Buddha:
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you ask me<br>
the coming-into-being<br>
of stress &amp; suffering,<br>
I will tell it to you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as one who discerns.<br>
From acquisition [<A HREF="#n1" NAME="1">1</a>] as cause<br>
the many forms of stress &amp; suffering<br>
come into being in the world.<br>
Whoever, unknowing, makes acquisitions<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -- the fool -- <br>
comes to stress &amp; suffering<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; again<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; again.<br>
<br>
So one who's discerning,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; focused on the birth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of stress &amp; suffering,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their coming-into-being,<br>
should make no acquisitions.
</blockquote>
Mettagu:
<blockquote>
What we asked, you've expounded.<br>
Now we ask something else.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please tell us.<br>
How do the prudent<br>
cross over the flood of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; birth &amp; aging,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lamentation &amp; sorrow?<br>
Please, sage, declare this to me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as this Dhamma has<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; been known by you.
</blockquote>
The Buddha:
<blockquote>
I will teach you the Dhamma<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -- in the here &amp; now,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not quoted words -- <br>
knowing which, living mindfully,<br>
you'll cross over beyond<br>
entanglement in the world.
</blockquote>
Mettagu:
<blockquote>
And I relish, Great Seer,<br>
that Dhamma &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; supreme,<br>
knowing which, living mindfully,<br>
I'll cross over beyond<br>
entanglement in the world.
</blockquote>
The Buddha:
<blockquote>
Whatever you're alert to,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; above, below,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; across, in between: [<A HREF="#n2" NAME="2">2</a>]<br>
dispelling any delight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any laying claim<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to those things,<br>
consciousness should not take a stance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in becoming.<br>
The monk who dwells thus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -- mindful, heedful -- <br>
letting go of his sense of <i>mine,</i><br>
knowing right here would abandon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; birth &amp; aging,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lamentation &amp; sorrow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stress &amp; suffering.
</blockquote>
Mettagu:
<blockquote>
I relish, Gotama, the Great Seer's words<br>
well-expounded, without acquisition,<br>
for yes, O Blessed One,<br>
you've abandoned stress &amp; suffering<br>
as this Dhamma has<br>
been known by you.<br>
And they, too, would abandon stress &amp; suffering<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those whom you, sage,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would admonish unceasingly.<br>
Having met you, I bow down to you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great One.<br>
Perhaps you will admonish me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unceasingly.
</blockquote>
The Buddha:
<blockquote>
Whoever you recognize<br>
as a knowledgeable brahmin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; possessing nothing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unentangled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in sensuality &amp; becoming<br>
yes, he has crossed over the flood.<br>
Having crossed to the far shore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he is without<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; harshness or doubt.<br>
<br>
And any one who has realized,<br>
who is knowledgeable here,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; having unentangled the bond<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to becoming and non-, [<A HREF="#n3" NAME="3">3</a>]<br>
free of craving,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; untroubled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; undesiring -- he,<br>
I tell you, has crossed over birth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; aging.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
<b><A NAME="n1">1</a>.</b> The term "acquisition" <i>(upadhi),</i> in its everyday sense, denotes the possessions, baggage, and other paraphernalia that a nomadic family might carry around with it in its wanderings. On the psychological level, it denotes anything for which one might have a sense of "I" or "mine" and which, consequently, one would carry around as a kind of mental baggage.
<!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<A HREF="#1">Go back</A>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END -->
<p>
<b><A NAME="n2">2</a>.</b> Nd.II gives six different valid interpretations for "above, below, across, in between":
<ul>
<li> above = the future; below = the past; across and in between = the present
<li> above = the deva world; below = hell; across and in between = the human world
<li> above = skillfulness; below = unskillfulness; across and in between = indeterminate mental qualities
<li> above = the property of formlessness; below = the property of sensuality; across and in between = the property of form
<li> above = feelings of pleasure; below = feelings of pain; across and in between = feelings of neither pleasure nor pain
<li> above = the body from the feet on up; below = the body from the crown of the head on down; across and in between = the middle of the body
</ul>

<p>
<b><A NAME="n3">3</a>.</b> Becoming and non-becoming (or dis-becoming) are the two most subtle objects of craving that lead on to continued existence -- and suffering -- in the round of birth &amp; death.
