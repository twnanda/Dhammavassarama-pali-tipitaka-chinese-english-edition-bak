<blockquote>
There are some who dispute<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; corrupted at heart,<br>
and those who dispute<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their hearts set on truth,<br>
but a sage doesn't enter into<br>
a dispute that's arisen,<br>
which is why he is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nowhere constrained.
<p>
Now, how would one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; led on by desire,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; entrenched in his likes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forming his own conclusions,<br>
overcome his own views?<br>
He'd dispute in line<br>
with the way that he knows.
<p>
Whoever boasts to others, unasked,<br>
of his practices, precepts,<br>
is, say the wise,<br>
ignoble by nature -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he who speaks of himself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of his own accord.
<p>
But a monk at peace,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fully unbound in himself,<br>
who doesn't boast of his precepts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- "That's how I am" -- <br>
<i>he, </i>say the wise,<br>
is noble by nature -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he with no vanity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with regard to the world.
<p>
One whose doctrines aren't clean -- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
fabricated, formed, given preference<br>
when he sees it to his own reward -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relies on a peace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dependent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on what can be shaken.
<p>
When one's convinced<br>
of what has been grasped among doctrines,<br>
entrenchments in views<br>
aren't easily overcome.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why<br>
a person takes up or rejects a doctrine -- <br>
in light of these very<br>
entrenchments.
<p>
Now, one who is cleansed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has no view<br>
formed about states of becoming<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or non-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anywhere in the world.<br>
Having abandoned conceit &amp; illusion,<br>
by what means would he go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anywhere in the world?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He isn't involved.
<p>
For one who's involved<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gets into disputes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over doctrines,<br>
but how -- through what means -- <br>
would you argue<br>
with one uninvolved?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has nothing<br>
taken up or rejected,<br>
has sloughed off every view<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right here -- every one.
