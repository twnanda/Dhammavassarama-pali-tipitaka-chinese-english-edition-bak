How short this life!<br>
You die this side of 100 years,<br>
but even if you live past,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you die of old age.
<p>
People grieve<br>
for what they see as <i>mine,</i><br>
for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing possessed is constant,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing is constantly possessed.<br>
Seeing this separation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; simply as it is,<br>
one should not live the household life.
<p>
At death a person abandons<br>
what he construes as <i>mine.</i><br>
Realizing this, the wise<br>
should not incline<br>
to be devoted to <i>mine.</i>
<p>
<A NAME="dream">Just as</A> a man doesn't see,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on awakening,<br>
what he met in a dream,<br>
even so he doesn't see,<br>
when they are dead<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- their time done -- <br>
those he held dear.
<p>
Even when they are seen &amp; heard,<br>
people are called by this or that name,<br>
but only the name remains<br>
to be pointed to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when they are dead.
<p>
Grief, lamentation, &amp; avarice<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are not let go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by those greedy for <i>mine,</i><br>
so sages<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; letting go of possessions,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seeing the Secure,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go wandering forth.
<p>
Of a monk, living &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; withdrawn,<br>
enjoying a dwelling &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; secluded:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they say it's congenial<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that he not, in any realm,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; display self.
<p>
Everywhere<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sage<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; independent<br>
holds nothing dear or undear.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A NAME="lotus">In him</A><br>
lamentation &amp; selfishness,<br>
like water on a white lotus,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do not adhere.
<p>
As a water bead on a lotus leaf,<br>
as water on a red lily,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does not adhere,
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so the sage<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does not adhere<br>
to the seen, the heard, or the sensed;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for, cleansed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he does not construe<br>
by means of the seen, the heard, or the sensed.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In no other way<br>
does he ask for purity,<br>
for neither impassioned<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor dispassioned<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is he.
