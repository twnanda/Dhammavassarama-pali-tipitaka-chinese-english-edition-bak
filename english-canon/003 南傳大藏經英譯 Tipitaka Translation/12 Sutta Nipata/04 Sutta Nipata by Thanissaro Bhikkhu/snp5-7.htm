Nanda:
<blockquote>
There are in the world<br>
sages, they say<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -- in what way?<br>
Do they call one a sage<br>
for possessing knowledge<br>
or possessing a way of life?
</blockquote>
The Buddha:
<blockquote>
Not for what he has seen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heard,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or known<br>
do the skilled here, Nanda,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; call one a sage.<br>
Those who live<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disarmed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; undesiring,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; untroubled:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those, I say, are called sages.
</blockquote>
Nanda:
<blockquote>
Whatever priests &amp; contemplatives<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say that purity's found<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through what's seen &amp; heard,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say that purity's found<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through precepts &amp; practices,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say that purity's found<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in manifold ways:<br>
have they, dear sir, living there in that way,<br>
crossed over birth &amp; aging?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ask you, O Blessed One.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please tell me.
</blockquote>
The Buddha:
<blockquote>
Whatever priests &amp; contemplatives<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say that purity's found<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through what's seen &amp; heard,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say that purity's found<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through precepts &amp; practices,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say that purity's found<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in manifold ways:<br>
none of them, living there in that way,<br>
I tell you, have crossed over birth &amp; aging.

Nanda:
<blockquote>
Whatever priests &amp; contemplatives<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say that purity's found<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through what's seen &amp; heard,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say that purity's found<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through precepts &amp; practices,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say that purity's found<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in manifold ways:<br>
if, sage, as you say,<br>
they've not crossed over the flood,<br>
then who in the world<br>
of beings divine &amp; human<br>
has crossed over birth &amp; aging?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ask you, O Blessed One.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please tell me.
</blockquote>
The Buddha:
<blockquote>
I don't say that all priests &amp; contemplatives<br>
are shrouded in birth &amp; aging.<br>
Those here who've abandoned<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what's seen, heard, &amp; sensed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; precepts &amp; practices [<A HREF="#n1" NAME="1">1</a>]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -- all -- <br>
who've abandoned their manifold ways<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -- again, all -- <br>
who, comprehending craving,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are effluent-free:<br>
they are the ones, I tell you,<br>
who've crossed over the flood.
</blockquote>
Nanda:
<blockquote>
I relish, Gotama, the Great Seer's words<br>
well-expounded, without acquisition.<br>
Those here who've abandoned<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what's seen, heard, &amp; sensed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; precepts &amp; practices<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -- all -- <br>
who've abandoned their manifold ways<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -- again, all -- <br>
who, comprehending craving,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are effluent-free:<br>
I, too, say they've crossed over the flood.
