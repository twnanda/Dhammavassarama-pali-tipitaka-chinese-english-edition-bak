<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A name=pp_766></A>1. If he who desires sensual pleasures 
is successful, he certainly becomes glad-minded, having obtained what a mortal 
wishes for. <FONT color=green>(766)</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A name=pp_767></A>2. But if those sensual pleasures fail 
the person who desires and wishes (for them), he will suffer, pierced by the 
arrow (of pain). <FONT color=green>(767)</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A name=pp_768></A>3. He who avoids sensual pleasures as 
(he would avoid treading upon) the head of a snake with his foot, such a one, 
being thoughtful (sato), will conquer this desire. <FONT 
color=green>(768)</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A name=pp_769></A>4. He who covets extensively (such) 
pleasures (as these), fields, goods, or gold, cows and horses, servants, women, 
relations, <FONT color=green>(769)</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A name=pp_770></A>5. Sins will overpower him, dangers will 
crush him, and pain will follow him as water (pours into) a broken ship. <FONT

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A name=pp_771></A>6. Therefore let one always be 
thoughtful, and avoid pleasures; having abandoned them, let him cross the

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A name=pp_774></A>3. Those who are greedy of, given to,

will become of us, when we die away from here?' <FONT
