What should be done by one skillful in good<br>
So as to gain the State of Peace is this:
<p>
Let him be able, and upright and straight,<br>
Easy to speak to, gentle, and not proud,<br>
Contented too, supported easily,<br>
With few tasks, and living very lightly;<br>
His faculties serene, prudent, and modest,<br>
Unswayed by the emotions of the clans;<br>
And let him never do the slightest thing<br>
That other wise men might hold blamable.
<p>
(And let him think:) "In safety and in bliss<br>
May creatures all be of a blissful heart.<br>
Whatever breathing beings there may be.<br>
No matter whether they are frail or firm,<br>
With none excepted, be they long or big<br>
Or middle-sized, or be they short or small<br>
Or thick, as well as those seen or unseen,<br>
Or whether they are dwelling far or near,<br>
Existing or yet seeking to exist.<br>
May creatures all be of a blissful heart.<br>
Let no one work another one's undoing<br>
Or even slight him at all anywhere:<br>
And never let them wish each other ill<br>
Through provocation or resentful thought."<br>
And just as might a mother with her life<br>
Protect the son that was her only child,<br>
So let him then for every living thing<br>
Maintain unbounded consciousness in being;
<p>
And let him too with love for all the world<br>
Maintain unbounded consciousness in being<br>
Above, below, and all round in between,<br>
Untroubled, with no enemy or foe.<br>
And while he stands or walks or while he sits<br>
Or while he lies down, free from drowsiness,<br>
Let him resolve upon this mindfulness:<br>
This is Divine Abiding here, they say.
<p>
But when he has no trafficking with views,<br>
Is virtuous, and has perfected seeing,<br>
And purges greed for sensual desires,<br>
He surely comes no more to any womb.
