<h3>Sutta Nipata IV.3</h3>
<h1>Dutthatthaka Sutta</h1>

<blockquote>
There are some who dispute<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; corrupted at heart,<br>
and those who dispute<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their hearts set on truth,<br>
but a sage doesn't enter<br>
a dispute that's arisen,<br>
which is why he is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nowhere constrained.
<p>
Now, how would one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; led on by desire,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; entrenched in his likes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forming his own conclusions,<br>
overcome his own views?<br>
He'd dispute in line<br>
with the way that he knows.
<p>
Whoever boasts to others, unasked,<br>
of his practices, precepts,<br>
is, say the skilled,<br>
ignoble by nature -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he who speaks of himself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of his own accord.
<p>
But a monk at peace,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fully unbound in himself,<br>
who doesn't boast of his precepts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- "That's how I am" -- <br>
<i>he, </i>say the skilled,<br>
is noble by nature -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he with no vanity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with regard to the world.
<p>
One whose doctrines aren't clean -- <br>
fabricated, formed, given preference<br>
when he sees it to his own advantage -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relies on a peace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dependent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on what can be shaken.
<p>
Because entrenchments[<a HREF="#n3-1" NAME="3-1">1</A>] in views<br>
aren't easily overcome<br>
when considering what's grasped<br>
among doctrines,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that's why<br>
a person embraces or rejects a doctrine -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in light of these very<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; entrenchments.
<p>
Now, one who is cleansed[<a HREF="#n3-2" NAME="3-2">2</A>]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has no preconceived view<br>
about states of becoming<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or not-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anywhere in the world.<br>
Having abandoned conceit[<a HREF="#n3-3" NAME="3-3">3</A>] &amp; illusion,<br>
by what means would he go?[<a HREF="#n3-4" NAME="3-4">4</A>]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He isn't involved.
<p>
For one who's involved<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gets into disputes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over doctrines,<br>
but how -- in connection with what[<a HREF="#n3-5" NAME="3-5">5</A>] -- <br>
would you argue<br>
with one uninvolved?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has nothing<br>
embraced or rejected,<br>
has sloughed off every view<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right here -- every one.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
<b><A NAME="n3-1">1</A>.</b> Entrenchments: a rendering of the Pali term, <i>nivesana,</i> which can also be rendered as abode, situation, home, or establishment.
[<A HREF="#3-1">Go back</A>]
<p>
<b><A NAME="n3-2">2</A>.</b> Nd.I: Cleansed through discernment.
[<A HREF="#3-2">Go back</A>]
<p>
<b><A NAME="n3-3">3</A>.</b> Nd.I explains a variety of ways of understanding the word "conceit," the most comprehensive being a list of nine kinds of conceit: viewing people better than oneself as worse than oneself, on a par with oneself, or better than oneself; viewing people on a par with oneself as worse than oneself, on a par with oneself, or better than oneself; viewing people worse than oneself as worse than oneself, on a par with oneself, or better than oneself. In other words, the truth of the view is not the issue here; the issue is the tendency to compare oneself with others.
[<A HREF="#3-3">Go back</A>]
<p>
<b><A NAME="n3-4">4</A>.</b> Nd.I: "By what means would he go" to any destination in any state of becoming.
[<A HREF="#3-4">Go back</A>]
<p>
<b><A NAME="n3-5">5</A>.</b> In connection with what: a rendering of the instrumental case that attempts to cover several of its meanings, in particular "by what means" and "in terms of what." For a discussion of the use of the instrumental case in the Atthaka Vagga, see <A HREF="snp4-09.html#n9-1">note 1 to Sn IV.9</A>.
