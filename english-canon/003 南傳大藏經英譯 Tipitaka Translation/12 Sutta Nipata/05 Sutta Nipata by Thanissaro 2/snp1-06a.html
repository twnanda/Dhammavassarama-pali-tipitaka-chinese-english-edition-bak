<hr>
Thus have I heard:
<p>
On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi, at Jetavana, at Anathapindika's monastery. Now when the night was far advanced, a certain deity, whose surpassing radiance illuminated the whole of Jetavana, came to the presence of the Blessed One, respectfully saluted him, and stood beside him. Standing thus he addressed the Blessed One in verse:
<p>
<i>[The Deity:]</i>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. About the declining man we question thee, Gotama. We have come to ask the Blessed One: What is the cause of his downfall?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<b><A NAME="n-s21-2">2</A>.</b> Apparently during the Buddha's time, in Indian society, a man could legally have more than one wife if he could maintain them. Kings had harems. What was prohibited was illegal sexual relations. [<A HREF="#s21-2">Go back</A>]
<p>
<b><A NAME="n-s21-3">3</A>.</b> By reason of his anxiety as to whether she would long for young men in preference to him. Comy. [<A HREF="#s21-3">Go back</A>]
