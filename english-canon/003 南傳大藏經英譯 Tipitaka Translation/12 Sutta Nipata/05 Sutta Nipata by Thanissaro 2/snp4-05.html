When dwelling on views<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as "supreme,"<br>
a person makes them<br>
the utmost thing<br>
in the world,<br>
&amp;, from that, calls<br>
all others inferior<br>
and so he's not free<br>
from disputes.<br>
When he sees his advantage<br>
in what's seen, heard, sensed,<br>
or in precepts &amp; practices,<br>
seizing it there<br>
he sees all else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as inferior.
<p>
That, too, say the skilled,<br>
is a binding knot: that<br>
in dependence on which<br>
you regard another<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as inferior.<br>
So a monk shouldn't be dependent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on what's seen, heard, or sensed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or on precepts &amp; practices;<br>
nor should he conjure a view in the world<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in connection with knowledge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or precepts &amp; practices;<br>
shouldn't take himself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be "equal";<br>
shouldn't think himself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inferior or superlative.
<p>
Abandoning &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what he had embraced,<br>
abandoning &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self,[<a HREF="#n5-1" NAME="5-1">1</A>]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not clinging,<br>
he doesn't make himself dependent<br>
even in connection with knowledge;<br>
doesn't follow a faction<br>
among those who are split;<br>
doesn't fall back<br>
on any view whatsoever.
<p>
One who isn't inclined<br>
toward either side<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- becoming or not-,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; here or beyond -- <br>
who has no entrenchment<br>
when considering what's grasped among doctrines,<br>
hasn't the least<br>
preconceived perception<br>
with regard to what's seen, heard, or sensed.<br>
By whom, with what,<br>
should he be pigeonholed<br>
here in the world?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- this brahman<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who hasn't adopted views.
<p>
They don't conjure, don't yearn,<br>
don't adhere even to doctrines.
<p>
A brahman not led<br>
by precepts or practices,<br>
gone to the beyond<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Such -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't fall back.
