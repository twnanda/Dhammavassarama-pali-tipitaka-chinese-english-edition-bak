<hr>
Thus have I heard.[<a HREF="#n2.1" NAME="2.1">1</a>] On one occasion the Exalted One was dwelling at Anathapindika's monastery, in Jeta's Grove,[<a HREF="#n2.2" NAME="2.2">2</A>] near Savatthi.[<a HREF="#n2.3" NAME="2.3">3</A>] Now when the night was far spent, a certain deity whose surpassing splendor illuminated the entire Jeta Grove, came to the presence of the Exalted One and, drawing near, respectfully saluted him and stood at one side. Standing thus, he addressed the Exalted One in verse:

<b><A NAME="n2.1">1</A>.</b> This Sutta appears in the Sutta-Nipata (v.258ff) and in the Khuddakapatha. See Maha-mangala Jataka (No. 453). For a detailed explanation see <i>Life's Highest Blessing</i> by Dr. R.L. Soni, WHEEL No. 254/256.

<p>
<b><A NAME="n2.2">2</A>.</b> Anathapindika, lit., 'He who gives alms to the helpless'; his former name was Sudatta. After his conversion to Buddhism, he bought the grove belonging to the Prince Jeta, and established a monastery which was subsequently named Jetavana. It was in this monastery that the Buddha observed most of his <i>vassana</i> periods (rainy seasons -- the three months' retreat beginning with the full-moon of July). Many are the discourses delivered and many are the incidents connected with the Buddha's life that happened at Jetavana. It was here that the Buddha ministered to the sick monk neglected by his companions, advising them: "Whoever, monks, would wait upon me, let him wait upon the sick." It was here that the Buddha so poignantly taught the law of impermanence, by asking the bereaved young woman Kisagotami who brought her dead child, to fetch a grain of mustard seed from a home where there has been no bereavement.
