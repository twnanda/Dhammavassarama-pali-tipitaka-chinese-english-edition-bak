    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b><i>The real followers of the Buddha can practise this
    religion without adhering to any school or sect.</i></b> </p>
    <p><font size="5">A</font> few hundred years after the
    Buddha's passing away, there arose eighteen different schools
    or sects all of which claimed to represent the original
    Teachings of the Buddha. The differences between these
    schools were basically due to various interpretations of the
    Teachings of the Buddha. Over a period of time, these schools
    gradually merged into two main schools: Theravada and
    Mahayana. Today, a majority of followers of Buddhism are
    divided into these two schools. </p>
    <p>Basically Mahayana Buddhism grew out of the Buddha's
    teaching that each individual carries within himself the
    potential for Buddhahood. Theravadins say that this potential
    can be realised through individual effort. Mahayanists, on
    the other hand, believe that they can seek salvation through
    the intervention of other superior beings called Bodhisattas.
    According to them, Bodhisattas are future Buddhas who, out of
    compassion for their fellow human beings, have delayed their
    own attainment of Buddhahood until they have helped others
    towards liberation. In spite of this basic difference,
    however, it must be stressed that doctrinally there is
    absolutely no disagreement concerning the Dhamma as contained
    in the sacred Tripitaka texts. Because Buddhists have been
    free to interpret the scriptures according to their
    understanding. But above all, both Mahayana and Theravada are
    one in their reverence for the Buddha.</p>
    <p>The areas of agreement between the two schools are as
    follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Both accept Sakyamuni Buddha as the Teacher. </li>
        <li>The Four Noble Truths are exactly the same in both
            schools. </li>
        <li>The Eightfold Path is exactly the same in both
            schools. </li>
        <li>The<i> Pattica-Samuppada</i> or teaching on Dependent
            Origination is the same in both schools. </li>
        <li>Both reject the idea of a supreme being who created
            and governed this world. </li>
        <li>Both accept<i> Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta</i> and <i>Sila,
            Samadhi, Panna</i> without any difference. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Some people are of the view that Theravada is selfish
    because it teaches that people should seek their own
    salvation. But how can a selfish person gain Enlightenment?
    Both schools accept the three<i> Yana</i> or<i> Bodhi</i> and
    consider the Bodhisatta Ideal as the highest. The Mahayana
    has created many mystical Bodhisattas, while the Theravada
    believes that a Bodhisatta is a man amongst us who devotes
    his entire life for the attainment of perfection, and
    ultimately becomes a fully Enlightened Buddha for the
    well-being and happiness of the world.</p>
    <p>The terms <em>Hinayana</em> (Small Vehicle) and <em>Mahayana</em>
    (Great Vehicle) are not known in the Theravada Pali
    literature. They are not found in the Pali Canon<i>
    (Tripitaka)</i> or in the Commentaries on the <i>Tripitaka</i>.</p>
    <p>Theravada Buddhists follow orthodox religious traditions
    that had prevailed in India two thousand five hundred years
    ago. They perform their religious services in the Pali
    language. They also expect to attain the final goa<i>l
    (Nibbana)</i> by becoming a Supreme Enlightened Buddha,
    Pacceka Buddha, or and Arahant (the highest stage of
    sainthood). The majority of them prefer the Arahantahood.
    Buddhists in Sri Lanka, Burma, and Thailand belong to this
    school. Mahayanists have changed the old religious customs.
    Their practices are in accordance with the customs and
    traditions of the countries where they live. Mahayanists
    perform their religious services in their mother tongue. They
    expect to attain the final goal <i>(Nibbana)</i> by becoming
    Buddhas. Hence, they honour both the Buddha and Bodhisatta
    (one who is destined to be a Buddha) with the same respect.
    Buddhists in China, Japan and Korea belong to this school.
    Most of those in Tibet and Mongolia follow another school of
    Buddhism which is known as Vajrayana. Buddhist scholars
    believe that this school inclines more towards the Mahayana
    sect.</p>
    <p>It is universally accepted by scholars that the terms<i>
    Hinayana</i> and<i> Mahayana</i> are later invention.
    Historically speaking, the Theravada already existed long
    before these terms came into being. That Theravada,
    considered to be the original teaching of the Buddha, was
    introduced to Sri Lanka and established there in the 3rd
    century B.C., during the time of Emperor Asoka of India. At
    that time there was nothing called <i>Mahayana</i>.<i>
    Mahayana</i> as such appeared later, about the beginning of
    the Christian Era. Buddhism that went to Sri Lanka, with its
    Tripitaka and Commentaries, in the 3rd Century B.C., remained
    there intact as <i>Theravada</i>, and did not come into the
    scene of the<i> Hinayana-Mahayana</i> dispute that developed
    later in India. It seems therefore not legitimate to include<i>
    Theravada</i> in either of these two categories. However,
    after the inauguration of the World Fellowship of Buddhists
    in 1950, well-informed people, both in the East and in the
    West, use the term <i>Theravada, </i>and not the term <i>Hinayana</i>.
    In fact, the <i>Samdhi Nirmorcana</i> Sutra (a Mahayana
    Sutra) clearly says that the <i>Sravakayana-Theravada</i> and
    the<i> Mahayana</i> constitute one<i> Yana</i> (ekayana) and
    that they are not two different and distinct
    &quot;vehicles&quot;. Although different schools of Buddhism
    held different opinions on the teaching of the Buddha, they
    never had any violence of blod shed for more than two
    thousands years. This is the uniqueness of Buddhist
    tolerance.</p>
