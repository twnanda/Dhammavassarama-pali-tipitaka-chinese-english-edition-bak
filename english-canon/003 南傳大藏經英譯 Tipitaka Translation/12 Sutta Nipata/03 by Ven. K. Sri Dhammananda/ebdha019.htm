<H4>I. The Development of the God-idea</H4>

To trace the origin and development
of the God-idea, one must go back to the time when civilisation
was still in its infancy and science was still unknown. Primitive
people, out of fear and admiration towards the natural phenomena,
had believed in different spirits and gods. They used their spirits
and gods to form religions of their own. According to their respective
circumstances and understanding capacity, different people founded
different gods and different faiths.
<P>
In the beginning of the God-idea, people worshipped
many gods -- gods of trees, streams, lightning, storm, winds,
the sun, and all other terrestrial phenomena. These gods were
related to each and every act of nature. Then gradually man began
to transfer to these gods, sex and form as well as the physical
and mental characteristics of human beings. Human attributes were
given to the gods: love, hate, jealousy, fear, pride, envy and
other emotions found among human beings. From all these gods,
there slowly grew a realisation that the phenomena of the Universe
were not many but were One. This understanding gave rise to the
monotheistic God of recent ages.
<P>
In the process of developing, the God-idea went through
a variety of changing social and intellectual climates. It was
regarded by different men in different ways. Some idealised God
as the King of heaven and earth; they had a conception of God
as a person. Others thought of God as an abstract principle. Some
raised the ideal of Supreme deity to the highest heaven, while
others brought it down to the lowest depths of the earth. Some
pictured God in a paradise while others made an idol and worshipped
it. Some went so far as to say that there is no salvation without
God -- no matter how much good you do, you will not receive the
fruits of your actions unless you act out of a faith in God. The
Theists said, 'Yes' and went on to affirm that God really did
exist. The Atheists said, 'No' and went on to affirm that God
did not really exist at all. The Sceptics or Agnostics said, 'We
do not or we cannot know.' The positivists said that the God-idea
is a meaningless problem since the idea of the term 'God' is not
clear. Thus there grew a variety of ideas and beliefs and names
for the God-idea: pantheism, idolatry, belief in a formless God,
belief in many gods and goddesses, etc.
<P>
Even the monotheistic God of recent times has gone
through a variety of changes as it passed through different nations
and people. The Hindu God is quite different from the Christian
God. The Christian God is again different from other Gods of other
faiths. Thus numerous religions came into existence; each one
differed greatly from the other and each one said that 'God is
One.'

<H4>II. The God-idea and Creation</H4>

As each religion came into existence
and developed around the God-idea, the religion developed its
own particular explanation of creation. Thus as the God-idea evolved
within different religious systems, this idea became associated
with various myths. People used the God-idea as a vehicle for
their explanations of the existence of man and the nature of the
life.
<P>
Today, intelligent men who have carefully reviewed
all the available facts, have come to the conclusion that, like
the God-idea, the creation myths must be regarded as an evolution
of the human imagination which began by the misunderstanding of
the phenomena of nature. These misunderstandings were rooted in
the fear and ignorance of primitive man. Even today, man still
retains his primitive interpretations of creation. In the light
of recent, scientific thinking, the theological definition of
God is vague and hence has no place in the recent, creation theories
or myths.
<P>
If man is created by an external source, then he
must belong to that source and not to himself. Buddhists believe
that man does belong to himself and that he is responsible for
everything he does. Thus Buddhists have no reason to believe that
man came into existence in the human form through any external
sources. They believe that man is here today because of his own
actions. He is neither punished nor rewarded by anyone but himself
according to his own good and bad actions. In the process of evolution,
the human being came into existence. However, there are no Buddha-words
to support the belief that the world was created by anybody. The
scientific discovery of gradual development of the world-system
conforms with the Buddha's teachings.

<H4>III. Human Weakness and the God-Religions</H4>

Both he God-idea and its associated
creation myths have been protected and defended by the God-religions
which need these ideas to justify their existence and usefulness
to human society. All the God-religions claim to have received
their respective scriptures as Revelation; in other words, they
all profess to come directly from the one God. Each claims that
their religion stands for Universal Peace and Universal Brotherhood
and other such high ideals.
<P>
However great the ideals of the religions might be,
the history of the world shows that the religions up to the present
day have also helped in spreading superstitions. Some have stood
against science and the advancement of knowledge, leading to quarrels,
ill-feelings, murders, and wars. In this respect, the God-religions
have failed in their attempt to enlighten mankind. For example,
in certain countries when people pray for mercy, their hands are
stained with blood of the morbid sacrifices of innocent animals
and, sometimes, even fellow human beings. These poor and helpless
creatures are slaughtered at the desecrated altars of imaginary
and imperceptible gods. It has taken a long time for people to
understand the futility of such cruel practices in the name of
religion. When will they realise that the path of real purification
is by love and understanding?
<P>
Another weakness of the God-religions is that they
offer no salvation without God. Thus a man might conceivably have
climbed to the highest pinnacle of virtue, and he might have led
a righteous way of life, and he might even have climbed to the
highest level of holiness. Yet he is to be condemned to eternal
hell just because he did not believe in the existence of God.
On the other hand, a man might have sinned deeply and yet, having
made a late repentance, he can be forgiven and therefore 'saved'
for God's sake. From the Buddhist point of view, there is no justification
in this kind of doctrine.
<P>
Despite the weaknesses of the God-religions, it is
not deemed advisable to preach a Godless doctrine since the belief
in God has also done a tremendous service to mankind especially
in times of places when where the God concept was desirable. This
belief in God has helped mankind to control his animal nature.
And so much help has been granted to others in the name of God.
At the same time, man feels insecure without the belief in God.
He finds protection and inspiration when that belief is in his
mind. The reality or validity of such a belief is based on man's
understanding capacity and spiritual maturity.
<P>
The basic cause for the failure of religion is when
the people are made to look upon their religion as an object of
mere worship. This means that the religion of essential living
is given over to dead functions and ceremonials. When a religion
allows these conditions to exist, the religion has ceased to be
of value but becomes an actual hindrance.
<P>
However, it is not the religion, but the people who
profess the religion and who create the demand for a blind faith
in their religion. This blind faith in turn creates party-feelings
and other forms of partisanship within and among religions. Thus
religions, in spite of their high ideals, have failed to enlighten
mankind.
<P>
Religion should concern our practical life. It is
to be used as a guide to regulate our conduct in the world. Religion
tells us what to do and what to know. If we do not do or know
accordingly, religion is no good and no use to us in our daily
life.
<P>
On the other hand, if the follower's of various religions
are going to fight and to condemn other beliefs and practices
-- specially to prove or disprove the existence of God -- and
if they are going to spread anger and hatred towards other religions
because of the different religious views, then they are creating
enormous disharmony amongst the various religious communities.
Whatever religious differences we have, it is our duty to practise
tolerance, patience and understanding. It is our duty to respect
the other man's religious belief even if we cannot accommodate
it; tolerance is necessary for the sake of harmonious and peaceful
living.

<H4>IV.Belief in Deities </H4>

Buddhists do not deny the existence
of various gods or deities who are more fortunate than human beings
as far as sensual pleasures are concerned. They also possess certain
powers which human beings usually lack. However the powers of
these deities are limited because they are also transitory beings.
They exist in happy abodes and enjoy their life for a longer period
than do human beings. When they have exhausted all the good kamma,
they have gathered during previous births, these deities pass
away and are reborn somewhere else according to their good and
bad kammas. According to the Buddha, human beings have more chances
to accure merits to be born in a better condition and the gods
have less chances in this respect.
<P>
Buddhists do not attribute any specific importance
to such gods. They do not regard the deities as a support to the
ethical development or as a support to the attainment of salvation
or Nibbana. Whether they are great or small, both human beings
and deities are perishable and subject to rebirth.
<P>
It is a common belief amongst the Buddhist public
that such deities can be influenced to grant their favours by
transferring merits to them whenever meritorious deeds are performed.
This belief is based on the Buddha's injunction to the deities
to protect those human beings who lead a religious way of life;
this is the reason why Buddhists transfer the merits to such deities
or remember them whenever they do some meritorious deeds. However,
worshipping and offering in the name of such deities are not that
important, although some Buddhist customs center around such activities.
When people are in great difficulties, naturally they turn to
the deities to express their grievances in a place of worship.
By doing this, they get some relief and consolation; in their
heart, they feel much better. However, to an intellectual who
has strong will power, sound education and understanding, such
beliefs and actions need not be resorted to. There is definitely
no such teaching in Buddhism to the effect Buddhists can attain
Nibbana by praying to any deity. Buddhists believe that purity
and impurity depend on oneself. No one from outside can purify
another. This method proved successful in attaining Buddhahood
and hence Nibbana without the least help from an external source.
Therefore, Buddhists can practise their religion with or without
the deities.
