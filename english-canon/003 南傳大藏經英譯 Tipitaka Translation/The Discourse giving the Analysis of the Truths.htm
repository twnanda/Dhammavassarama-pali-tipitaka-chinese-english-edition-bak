</DIR>

<P>at one time the Auspicious One was dwelling near B&agrave;r&agrave;&otilde;as&atilde; in the Deer Park at Isipatana. There it was that the Auspicious One addressed the monks, saying:</P>

and it cannot be rolled back by an ascetic or by a brahmin<BR>
or by a god or by a demon or by a deity or by anyone in the world.</P></DIR>

<P>The Auspicious One said this, and after saying this, the Fortunate One rose from his seat and went into his living quarters.</P>
