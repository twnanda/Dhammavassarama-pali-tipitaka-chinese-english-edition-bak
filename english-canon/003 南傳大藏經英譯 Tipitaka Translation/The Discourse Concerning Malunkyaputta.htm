</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"><P>Then venerable M&agrave;lu&iuml;kyaputta approached the Auspicious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Auspicious One, he sat down on one side. While sitting on one side the venerable M&agrave;lu&iuml;kyaputta said this to the Auspicious One:</P>
<P>&szlig;Please, reverend Sir, may the Auspicious One preach the Dhamma to me in brief, then I, having heard the Gracious One's Dhamma, may dwell solitary, secluded, heedful, ardent, and resolute.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Now what shall we say to the young monks, M&agrave;lu&iuml;kyaputta, if you, who are an old monk, elderly, of great age, far gone, advanced in years, ask for advice in brief?&ucirc; <A NAME="T1"></A></FONT><A HREF="#N1"><SUP><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" SIZE=2>1</SUP></FONT></A></P>

<P>&szlig;Surely not, reverend Sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&szlig;Those sounds cognizable by the ear, which have not been heard - which formerly have not been heard, (which) you are not hearing, and which you do not expect to hear - can there be desire or passion or love relating to them?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Surely not, reverend Sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Those smells cognizable by the nose, which have not been smelt - which formerly have not been smelt, (which) you are not smelling, and which you do not expect to smell - can there be desire or passion or love relating to them?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Surely not, reverend Sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&szlig;Those tastes cognizable by the tongue, which have not been tasted - which formerly have not been tasted, (which) you are not tasting, and which you do not expect to taste - can there be desire or passion or love relating to them?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Surely not, reverend Sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&nbsp;&szlig;Those tangibles cognizable by the body, which have not been touched - which formerly have not been touched, (which) you are not touching, and which you do not expect to touch - can there be desire or passion or love relating to them?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Surely not, reverend Sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Those thoughts cognizable by the mind, which have not been cognized - which formerly have not been cognized, (which) you are not cognizing, and which you do not expect to cognize - can there be desire or passion or love relating to them?&ucirc;</P>

<P>Of this, reverend Sir, that was spoken in brief by the Auspicious One so do I understand the meaning in detail.&ucirc;</P>

<P>Of this, M&agrave;lu&iuml;kyaputta, that was spoken in brief by me so should you understand the meaning in detail.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then venerable M&agrave;lu&iuml;kyaputta having rejoiced in and been gladdened by the Gracious One's speech, having risen from his seat and worshipped the Auspicious One, after circumambulating (him) departed.</P>
<P>Then venerable M&agrave;lu&iuml;kyaputta while dwelling solitary, secluded, heedful, ardent, and resolute, after no long time (attained) that good for which young gentlemen rightly go forth from the house to the houseless life, that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life, and dwelt having known, experienced, and attained (it) himself in this very life.</P><DIR>

</B></FONT><P><A HREF="#T1">1</A><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"> The commentary says the Buddha speaks like this both to reproach M&agrave;lu&iuml;kyaputta, and to encourage him, for while on the one hand he had been heedless during his youth, here he was in his old age dwelling in the wilderness and asking for a meditation subject.</P>
<P><A NAME="N2"></A></FONT><A HREF="#T2">2</A><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"> The instruction given here is identical to that given to B&agrave;hiya in the Ud&agrave;na (Ud 1. 10). The latter, who immediately understood the teaching, and put it into practice, attained to Arahantship then and there. Note that some of the notes given here are drawn from the Ud&agrave;na commentary.</P>
<P><A NAME="N3"></A></FONT><A HREF="#T3">3</A><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"> Commentary: Just as when a form comes into focus eye consciousness is not excited (not impassioned), not tainted, not deluded, so, being devoid of passion etc., in regard to the measure of eye consciousness there must be no impulsion. </P>
<P>Translator: Ethically impulsion (</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">javana</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">) is the most important stage in the cognitive series, because it is in the seven mind moments that are termed </FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">javana</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"> that wholesome and unwholesome volition takes place, and </FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">kamma</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"> is made. According to the instruction given here the cognitive process should be checked by mindfulness before it reaches the </FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">javana</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"> stage.</P>
<P><A NAME="N4"></A></FONT><A HREF="#T4">4</A><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"> Ud&agrave;na commentary: ...since you will not be excited with passion, tainted with hate, or confused with delusion...therefore you will not be in that which is seen etc. Or, you will not be adhering to, or established on, that which is seen, heard, (sensed), or cognized by way of craving, conceit, or views, thinking: `this is mine, this I am, this is my self'...</P>
<P><A NAME="N5"></A></FONT><A HREF="#T5">5</A><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"> The commentary to the Ud&agrave;na is at pains to point out that in the Abhidhamma (and the tradition it embodies) there is no intermediate becoming `between the two', but that what is meant here is either `you will not be here or hereafter or in both' - which seems a bit strained - or, `you will not be here or hereafter, and nor is there anywhere in between the two.'</P>
<P><A NAME="N6"></A></FONT><A HREF="#T6">6</A><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"> These 12 verse are also found as M&agrave;lu&iuml;kyaputta's verses in Therag&agrave;th&agrave;p&agrave;&euml;i 794-817 (with minor variations). The metre is Siloka, but the 2nd line of the first 6 verses is in Tu&ntilde;&ntilde;hubha metre (with a short 8th syllable). These verses nicely illustrate some of the changes that can occur in words and word forms because of the need to meet the requirements of the metre.</P>
<P>The first is that unusual forms sometimes appear (examples draw upon the commentary to Therag&agrave;th&agrave;): </FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">gh&agrave;tv&agrave;</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"> = </FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">ghayitv&agrave;</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">, </FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">phussa</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"> = </FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">phusitv&agrave;</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">. Secondly, cognate forms occasionally occur: </FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">¤atv&agrave;</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"> = </FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">vij&agrave;nitv&agrave;</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">, where </FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">¤atv&agrave;</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">, absolutive to </FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">j&agrave;n&agrave;ti</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">, with the normal meaning of `having known', is being used in place of </FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">vij&agrave;nitv&agrave;</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">, which has the meaning `having cognized'. Thirdly, an altogether different word may be introduced: </FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">bhotv&agrave;</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"> = </FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">sayitv&agrave;</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">, where the absolutive from </FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">bhu¤jati</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"> (to eat, to enjoy), itself an unusual form, is being made equivalent to </FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">sayitv&agrave;</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">, `having tasted'. Needless to say, great care must be taken when translating verse to take these factors into consideration.</P>
<P><A NAME="N7"></A></FONT><A HREF="#T7">7</A><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"> These verses bring out very clearly the crucial function that mindfulness (</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">sati</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">) plays in meditation practice, and in particular its relation to restraint (</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">sa&uuml;vara</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">), one of the four right endeavours. Someone who is un-mindful, or who for the moment forgets to be mindful, is liable to fall prey to all sorts of proliferation (</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">papa¤ca</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">), which can very quickly end up in giving an opening to one of the unwholesome roots (</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">akusalam&aring;la</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">) of lust (</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">lobha</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">), hate (</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">dosa</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">), or delusion (</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">moha</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">). It is for this reason that mindfulness, which when properly understood and applied, protects the aspirant from these roots, is regarded as basic to the practice of meditation.</P>
<P><A NAME="N8"></A></FONT><A HREF="#T8">8</A><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"> This and the following verse show how important it is to maintain a balanced and objective state of mind if one wishes to establish mindfulness. One who is initially dispassionate in regard to sensory contact can easily attend to mindfulness. In that case there is simply the feeling (</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">vedan&agrave;</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">), but it doesn't lead to craving (</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">ta&otilde;h&agrave;</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">), and so the arising of the whole mass of suffering as outlined in conditional arising (</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">pa&ntilde;iccasamupp&agrave;da</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">) is terminated at this point.</P></FONT></BODY>
