"Monks, I will teach you new &amp; old kamma, the cessation of kamma, and the path of practice leading to the cessation of kamma. Listen and pay close attention. I will speak.
<p>
"Now what, monks, is old kamma? The eye is to be seen as old kamma, fabricated &amp; willed, capable of being felt. The ear...The nose...The tongue...The body...The intellect is to be seen as old kamma, fabricated &amp; willed, capable of being felt. This is called old kamma.
<p>
"And what is new kamma? Whatever kamma one does now with the body, with speech, or with the intellect: This is called new kamma.
<p>
"And what is the cessation of kamma? Whoever touches the release that comes from the cessation of bodily kamma, verbal kamma, &amp; mental kamma: This is called the cessation of kamma.
<p>
"<A NAME="8fp">And what</A> is the path of practice leading to the cessation of kamma? Just this noble eightfold path: right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration. This is called the path of practice leading to the cessation of kamma.
<p>
"So, monks, I have taught you new &amp; old kamma, the cessation of kamma, and the path of practice leading to the cessation of kamma. Whatever a teacher should do -- seeking the welfare of his disciples, out of sympathy for them -- that have I done for you. Over there are the roots of trees; over there, empty dwellings. Practice jhana, monks. Don't be heedless. Don't later fall into regret. This is our message to you."
