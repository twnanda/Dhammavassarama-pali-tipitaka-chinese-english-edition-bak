<hr>
Dwelling at <a name="savatthi">Savatthi</a>. "Monks, gains, tribute, &amp; fame are a cruel thing, a harsh, bitter obstacle to the attainment of the unexcelled rest from bondage.
<p>
"Have you heard the jackal howling in the last hours of the night?"
<p>
"Yes, lord."
<p>
"That jackal is suffering from mange. He finds no pleasure whether he goes to a bluff, to the foot of a tree, or to the open air. Wherever he goes, wherever he stands, wherever he sits, wherever he lies down, he is sunk in misery.
<p>
"In the same way there is the case where a certain monk is conquered by gains, offerings, &amp; fame, his mind consumed. He finds no pleasure whether he goes to an empty dwelling, to the foot of a tree, or to the open air. Wherever he goes, wherever he stands, wherever he sits, wherever he lies down, he is sunk in misery. That's how cruel gains, offerings, &amp; fame are: a harsh, bitter obstacle to the attainment of the unexcelled rest from bondage.
<p>
"Thus you should train yourselves: 'We will put aside any gains, tribute, &amp; fame that have arisen; and we will not let any gains, tribute, &amp; fame that have arisen keep our minds consumed.' That's how you should train yourselves."
