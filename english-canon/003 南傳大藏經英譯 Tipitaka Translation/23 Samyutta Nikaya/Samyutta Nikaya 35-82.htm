<p>
"Insofar as it disintegrates <i>(lujjati),</i> monk, it is called the 'world.' Now what disintegrates? The eye disintegrates. Forms disintegrate. Consciousness at the eye consciousness disintegrates. Contact at the eye disintegrates. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye -- experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain -- that too disintegrates.
<p>
"The ear disintegrates. Sounds disintegrate...
<p>
"The nose disintegrates. Aromas disintegrate...
<p>
"The tongue disintegrates. Tastes disintegrate...
<p>
"The body disintegrates. Tactile sensations disintegrate...
<p>
"The intellect disintegrates. Ideas disintegrate. Consciousness at the intellect consciousness disintegrates. Contact at the intellect disintegrates. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the intellect -- experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain -- that too disintegrates.

"Insofar as it disintegrates, it is called the 'world.'"
