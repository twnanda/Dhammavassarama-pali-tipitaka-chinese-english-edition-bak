<hr>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="vesali">Vesali</A>, in the Great Forest, at the Gabled Pavilion. Then, in the late afternoon, he left his seclusion and went to the sick ward and on arrival sat down on a prepared seat. As he was sitting there, he addressed the monks: "A monk should approach the time of death mindful &amp; alert. This is our instruction to you all.
<p>
"And how is a monk mindful? There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in &amp; of itself -- ardent, alert, &amp; mindful -- putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. He remains focused on feelings in &amp; of themselves...mind in &amp; of itself...mental qualities in &amp; of themselves -- ardent, alert, &amp; mindful -- putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. This is how a monk is mindful.
<p>
"And how is a monk alert? When going forward &amp; returning, he makes himself fully alert; when looking toward &amp; looking away...when bending &amp; extending his limbs...when carrying his outer cloak, his upper robe &amp; his bowl...when eating, drinking, chewing, &amp; savoring...when urinating &amp; defecating...when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, &amp; remaining silent, he makes himself fully alert. This is how a monk is alert.
<p>
"So a monk should approach the time of death mindful &amp; alert. This is our instruction to you all.
<p>
"As a monk is dwelling thus mindful &amp; alert -- heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute -- a feeling of pleasure arises in him. He discerns that 'A feeling of pleasure has arisen in me. It is dependent on a requisite condition, not independent. Dependent on what? Dependent on this body. Now, this body is inconstant, fabricated, dependently co-arisen. Being dependent on a body that is inconstant, fabricated, &amp; dependently co-arisen, how can this feeling of pleasure that has arisen be constant?' He remains focused on inconstancy with regard to the body &amp; to the feeling of pleasure. He remains focused on dissolution...dispassion...cessation...relinquishment with regard to the body &amp; to the feeling of pleasure. As he remains focused on inconstancy...dissolution...dispassion...cessation...relinquishment with regard to the body &amp; to the feeling of pleasure, he abandons any latent tendency to passion with regard to the body &amp; the feeling of pleasure.
<p>
"As he is dwelling thus mindful &amp; alert -- heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute -- a feeling of pain arises in him. He discerns that 'A feeling of pain has arisen in me. It is dependent on a requisite condition, not independent. Dependent on what? Dependent on this body. Now, this body is inconstant, fabricated, dependently co-arisen. Being dependent on a body that is inconstant, fabricated, &amp; dependently co-arisen, how can this feeling of pain that has arisen be constant?' He remains focused on inconstancy with regard to the body &amp; to the feeling of pain. He remains focused on dissolution...dispassion...cessation...relinquishment with regard to the body &amp; to the feeling of pain. As he remains focused on inconstancy...dissolution...dispassion...cessation...relinquishment with regard to the body &amp; to the feeling of pain, he abandons any latent tendency to resistance with regard to the body &amp; the feeling of pain.
<p>
"As he is dwelling thus mindful &amp; alert -- heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute -- a feeling of neither-pleasure-nor-pain arises in him. He discerns that 'A feeling of neither-pleasure-nor-pain has arisen in me. It is dependent on a requisite condition, not independent. Dependent on what? Dependent on this body. Now, this body is inconstant, fabricated, dependently co-arisen. Being dependent on a body that is inconstant, fabricated, &amp; dependently co-arisen, how can this feeling of neither-pleasure-nor-pain that has arisen be constant?' He remains focused on inconstancy with regard to the body &amp; to the feeling of neither-pleasure-nor-pain. He remains focused on dissolution...dispassion...cessation...relinquishment with regard to the body &amp; to the feeling of neither-pleasure-nor-pain. As he remains focused on inconstancy...dissolution...dispassion...cessation...relinquishment with regard to the body &amp; to the feeling of neither-pleasure-nor-pain, he abandons any latent tendency to ignorance with regard to the body &amp; the feeling of neither-pleasure-nor-pain.
<p>
"Sensing a feeling of pleasure, he discerns that it is inconstant, not grasped at, not relished. Sensing a feeling of pain...Sensing a feeling of neither-pleasure-nor-pain, he discerns that it is inconstant, not grasped at, not relished. Sensing a feeling of pleasure, he senses it disjoined from it. Sensing a feeling of pain...Sensing a feeling of neither-pleasure-nor-pain, he senses it disjoined from it. When sensing a feeling limited to the body, he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to the body.' When sensing a feeling limited to life, he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to life.' He discerns that 'With the break-up of the body, after the termination of life, all that is experienced, not being relished, will grow cold right here.'
<p>
"<A NAME="oil">Just as</A> an oil lamp burns in dependence on oil &amp; wick; and from the termination of the oil &amp; wick -- and from not being provided any other sustenance -- it goes out unnourished; in the same way, when sensing a feeling limited to the body, he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to the body.' When sensing a feeling limited to life, he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to life.' He discerns that 'With the break-up of the body, after the termination of life, all that is sensed, not being relished, will grow cold right here.'"

<b>Note:</b> The next sutta, SN XXXVI.8, is identical to this one, except that it states that the feeling of pleasure, etc., is dependent on <I>contact</I> rather than dependent on the <I>body.</I>
