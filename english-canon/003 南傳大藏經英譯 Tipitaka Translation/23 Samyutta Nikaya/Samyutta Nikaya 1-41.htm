<hr>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="savatthi">Savatthi</A> in Jeta's Grove, <A name="anatha">Anathapindika's monastery</A>. Then a certain devata, in the far extreme of the night, her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta's Grove, went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, stood to one side. As she was standing there, she recited these verses in the Blessed One's presence:
<blockquote>
When a house is on fire<br>
the vessel salvaged<br>
is the one that will be of use,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not the one left there to burn.
<p>
So when the world is on fire<br>
with aging and death,<br>
one should salvage [one's wealth] by giving:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what's given is well salvaged.
<p>
What's given bears fruit as pleasure.<br>
What isn't given does not:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thieves take it away, or kings;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it gets burnt by fire or lost.
<p>
Then in the end<br>
one leaves the body<br>
together with one's possessions.<br>
Knowing this, the intelligent man<br>
enjoys possessions &amp; gives.
<p>
Having enjoyed &amp; given<br>
in line with his means,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uncensured he goes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the heavenly state.
