"I will teach you the frames of reference, their development, and the path of practice leading to their development. Listen &amp; pay close attention. I will speak.
<p>
"Now, <A NAME="frames">what are the frames</A> of reference? There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in &amp; of itself -- ardent, alert, &amp; mindful -- putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. He remains focused on feelings in &amp; of themselves...mind in &amp; of itself...mental qualities in &amp; of themselves -- ardent, alert, &amp; mindful -- putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.
<p>
"This is called the frames of reference.
<p>
"And what is the development of the frames of reference? There is the case where a monk remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body, remains focused on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body, remains focused on the phenomenon of origination &amp; passing away with regard to the body -- ardent, alert, &amp; mindful -- putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.
<p>
"He remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to feelings, remains focused on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to feelings, remains focused on the phenomenon of origination &amp; passing away with regard to feelings -- ardent, alert, &amp; mindful -- putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.
<p>
"He remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the mind, remains focused on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the mind, remains focused on the phenomenon of origination &amp; passing away with regard to the mind -- ardent, alert, &amp; mindful -- putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.
<p>
"He remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to mental qualities, remains focused on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to mental qualities, remains focused on the phenomenon of origination &amp; passing away with regard to mental qualities -- ardent, alert, &amp; mindful -- putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.
<p>
"This is called the development of the frames of reference.
<p>
"<A NAME="8fp">And what</A> is the path of practice to the development of the frames of reference? Just this noble eightfold path: right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration. This is called the path of practice to the development of the frames of reference."
