Dwelling at <A NAME="savatthi">Savatthi</A>. "Monks, gains, tribute, &amp; fame are a cruel thing, a harsh, bitter obstacle to the attainment of the unexcelled rest from bondage. <A NAME="beetle">Suppose there</A> were a beetle, a dung-eater, full of dung, gorged with dung, with a huge pile of dung in front of him. He, because of that, would look down on other beetles: 'Yes, sirree! I am a dung-eater, full of dung, gorged with dung, with a huge pile of dung in front of me!' In the same way, there is the case where a certain monk -- conquered by gains, offerings, &amp; fame, his mind consumed -- puts on his robes and, carrying his bowl &amp; outer robe, goes into a village or town for alms. Having eaten there as much as he likes -- full of almsfood &amp; invited again for the next day -- he goes to the monastery and, in the midst of a group of monks, boasts, 'I have eaten as much as I like, I am full of almsfood &amp; have been invited again for tomorrow. I am a recipient of robes, almsfood, lodgings, &amp; medicinal requisites for curing illness. These other monks, though, have next to no merit, next to no influence. They aren't recipients of robes, almsfood, lodgings, &amp; medicinal requisites for curing illness.' Conquered by gains, offerings, &amp; fame, his mind consumed, he looks down on other well-behaved monks. That will be for this worthless man's long-term suffering &amp; harm. That's how cruel gains, tribute, &amp; fame are: a harsh, bitter obstacle to the attainment of the unexcelled rest from bondage.
<p>
"Thus you should train yourselves: 'We will put aside any gains, tribute, &amp; fame that have arisen; and we will not let any gains, tribute, &amp; fame that have arisen keep our minds consumed.' That's how you should train yourselves."
