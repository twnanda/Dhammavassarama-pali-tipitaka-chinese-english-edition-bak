<h3><A name="1">Bhaddiya Sutta (Ud VII.1)</A> -- About Bhaddiya the Dwarf (1) <A HREF="#top">go to top</A></h3>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="sav7.1">Savatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana7.1">Anathapindika's</A> monastery. At that time <A NAME="sariputta7.1">Ven. Sariputta</A> was with a variety of approaches instructing, urging, rousing, and encouraging <A NAME="bhaddiya7.1">Ven. Bhaddiya the Dwarf</A> with Dhamma-talk. As Ven. Bhaddiya the Dwarf was, with a variety of approaches, being instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged by Ven. Sariputta with Dhamma-talk, his mind, through lack of clinging/sustenance, was released from the effluents.
<p>
The Blessed One saw that as Ven. Bhaddiya the Dwarf was, with a variety of approaches, being instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged by Ven. Sariputta with Dhamma-talk, his mind, through lack of clinging/sustenance, was released from the effluents.
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Above, below, everywhere released,<br>
he does not focus on 'I am this.'<br>
Thus released, he crosses the flood<br>
not crossed before,<br>
for the sake of no further becoming.

<h3><A name="2">Bhaddiya Sutta (Ud VII.2)</A> -- About Bhaddiya the Dwarf (2) <A HREF="#top">go to top</A></h3>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="sav7.2">Savatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana7.2">Anathapindika's</A> monastery. At that time <A NAME="sariputta7.2">Ven. Sariputta</A> was with a variety of approaches instructing, urging, rousing, and encouraging <A NAME="bhaddiya7.2">Ven. Bhaddiya the Dwarf</A> with Dhamma-talk to an even greater extent, as he thought that Bhaddiya was still just a learner.
<p>
The Blessed One saw that Ven. Sariputta was with a variety of approaches instructing, urging, rousing, and encouraging Ven. Bhaddiya the Dwarf with Dhamma-talk to an even greater extent, as he thought that Bhaddiya was still just a learner.
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
He has broken the cycle,<br>
attained freedom from desire.<br>
The dried-up stream<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no longer flows.<br>
The cycle, broken,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no longer turns.<br>
This, just this,<br>
is the end of stress.

<h3><A name="3">Kamesu Satta Sutta (Ud VII.3)</A> -- Attached to Sensual Pleasures (1) <A HREF="#top">go to top</A></h3>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="sav7.3">Savatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana7.3">Anathapindika's</A> monastery. Now at that time, most of the people in Savatthi were excessively attached to sensual pleasures. They lived delighting in, addicted to, infatuated with, fastened to, absorbed in sensual pleasures. Then in the early morning, a large number of monks, having put on their robes and carrying their bowls and outer robes, went into Savatthi for alms. Having gone for alms in Savatthi, after the meal, returning from their alms round, they went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they said to the Blessed One: "Most of the people in Savatthi are excessively attached to sensual pleasures. They live delighting in, addicted to, infatuated with, fastened to, absorbed in sensual pleasures."
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Clinging to sense pleasures, to sensual ties,<br>
seeing no blame in the fetter,<br>
never will those tied up in the fetter<br>
cross over the flood so great &amp; wide.

<h3><A name="4">Kamesu Satta Sutta (Ud VII.4)</A> -- Attached to Sensual Pleasures (2) <A HREF="#top">go to top</A></h3>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="sav7.4">Savatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana7.4">Anathapindika's</A> monastery. Now at that time, most of the people in Savatthi were excessively attached to sensual pleasures. They lived delighting in, addicted to, infatuated with, fastened to, absorbed in sensual pleasures. Then early in the morning the Blessed One, having put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. He saw that most of the people in Savatthi were excessively attached to sensual pleasures, that they live delighting in, addicted to, infatuated with, fastened to, absorbed in sensual pleasures.
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="fish7.4">Blinded</A> by sensuality<br>
covered by the net,<br>
veiled with the veil of craving,<br>
bound by the bond of heedlessness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like fish in the mouth of a trap,<br>
they go to aging &amp; death,<br>
like a suckling calf to its mother.

<h3><A name="6">Tanhakhaya Sutta (Ud VII.6)</A> -- The Ending of Craving <A HREF="#top">go to top</A></h3>
<P>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <a name="sav7.6">Savatthi</a>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana7.6">Anathapindika</A>'s monastery. Now at that time <A NAME="kondanna7.6">Ven</A>. A&ntilde;&ntilde;a Konda&ntilde;&ntilde;a was sitting not far from the Blessed One, his legs crossed, his body held erect, reflecting on [his] release through the total ending of craving. The Blessed One saw Ven. A&ntilde;&ntilde;a Konda&ntilde;&ntilde;a sitting not far away, his legs crossed, his body held erect, reflecting on [his] release through the total ending of craving.
<P>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For someone with no root, no soil,<br>
no leaves -- how creepers?<br>
Who's fit to blame him,<br>
the enlightened one freed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from bonds.<br> <!--{AG says no question mark here!}-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even devas praise him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even by <A NAME="brahma7.6">Brahma</A> he's praised.

<h3><A name="9">Udapana Sutta (Ud VII.9)</A> -- The Well <A HREF="#top">go to top</A></h3>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was wandering among the <A NAME="mallans7.9">Mallans</A>, together with a large community of monks, and came to a brahmin village of the Mallans name <A NAME="thuna7.9">Thuna</A>. The brahmin householders of Thuna heard that "Gotama the Sakyan contemplative, gone forth from the Sakyan clan, is wandering among the Mallans together with a large community of monks, and has arrived at Thuna." So they filled the well all the way to the brim with grass and chaff, [thinking], "Don't let these shaven-headed contemplatives draw drinking water."
<p>
Then the Blessed One came down from the road, went to a certain tree, and on arrival sat down on a seat made ready. As he sat down, he said to <A NAME="ananda7.9">Ven. Ananda</A>: "Come, Ananda, get me some drinking water from that well."
<p>
When this was said, Ven. Ananda replied, "Just now the brahmin householders of Thuna filled that well all the way to the brim with grass and chaff, [thinking], 'Don't let these shaven-headed contemplatives draw drinking water.'"
<p>
A second time, the Blessed One said to Ven. Ananda: "Come, Ananda, get me some drinking water from that well."
<p>
A second time, Ven. Ananda replied, "Just now the brahmin householders of Thuna filled that well all the way to the brim with grass and chaff, [thinking], 'Don't let these shaven-headed contemplatives draw drinking water.'"
<p>
A third time, the Blessed One said to Ven. Ananda: "Come, Ananda, get me some drinking water from that well."
<p>
"As you say, lord," Ven. Ananda replied and, taking a bowl, went to the well. As he was approaching the well, it expelled all the grass and chaff from its mouth and stood filled to the brim -- streaming, as it were -- with clear, clean, radiant water. The thought occurred to Ven. Ananda, "Isn't it amazing! Isn't it awesome! How great the Tathagata's power! How great his might! While I was approaching the well, it expelled all the grass and chaff from its mouth and stood filled to the brim -- streaming, as it were -- with clear, clean, radiant water."
<p>
Taking drinking water in his bowl, he went to the Blessed One and on arrival said, "How amazing, lord! How awesome! How great the Tathagata's power! How great his might! While I was approaching the well, it expelled all the grass and chaff from its mouth and stood filled to the brim -- streaming, as it were -- with clear, clean, radiant water. Drink this water, O Blessed One! Drink this water, O One-Well-Gone!"
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
What's the need for a well<br>
if water is everywhere?<br>
Having cut craving<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the root,<br>
One would go about searching for what?

<h3><A name="10">Udena Sutta (Ud VII.10)</A> -- About King Udena <A HREF="#top">go to top</A></h3>
<P>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in <A NAME="kosambi7.10">Kosambi</A> at <A NAME="ghosita7.10">Ghosita</A>'s monastery. Now at that time the inner quarters of King Udena's royal park had burned down, and 500 women, headed by <A NAME="samavati7.10">Samavati</A>, had died.
<P>
Then in the early morning, a large number of monks, having put on their robes and carrying their bowls &amp; outer robes, went into Kosambi for alms. Having gone for alms in Kosambi, after the meal, returning from their alms round, they went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they said to the Blessed One: "Lord, the inner quarters of King Udena's royal park have burned down, and 500 women, headed by Samavati, have died. What is the destination of those female lay followers? What is their future course?"
<P>
"Monks, among those female lay followers are stream-winners, once-returners, &amp; non-returners. In no case was the death of any of those female lay followers without [noble] fruit."
<P>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Bound round with delusion, the world<br>
only appears to be competent.<br>
Bound with acquisitions, foolish,<br>
surrounded by darkness,<br>
it seems eternal,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but for one who sees,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there is nothing.
