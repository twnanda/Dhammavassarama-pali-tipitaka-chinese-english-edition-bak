</B><P>Thus I heard:</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>at one time the Auspicious One was dwelling near Ves&agrave;l&atilde;, in the Gabled Hall in the Great Wood. Then the Auspicious One, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, entered Ves&agrave;l&atilde; for alms. After walking for alms in Ves&agrave;l&atilde;, when he had returned from the alms-round after the meal, he addressed venerable &acirc;nanda, (saying): &szlig;Take up the sitting mat, &acirc;nanda, we will go to the C&agrave;p&agrave;la shrine to dwell for the day.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Yes, reverend Sir,&ucirc; said venerable &acirc;nanda, and after replying to the Auspicious One, and taking the sitting mat, he followed along close behind the Auspicious One. Then the Auspicious One went to the C&agrave;p&agrave;la shrine, and after going, he sat down on the prepared seat. While sat the Auspicious One addressed venerable &acirc;nanda, (saying): &szlig;Delightful, &acirc;nanda, is Ves&agrave;l&atilde;, delightful is the Udena shrine, delightful is the Gotamaka shrine, delightful is the Sattamba shrine, delightful is the Bahuputta shrine, delightful is the S&agrave;randada shrine, delightful is the C&agrave;p&agrave;la shrine. Whoever has developed, &acirc;nanda, made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the four paths to power, could, if he wanted, remain for the life-span or for what is left of the life-span. The Realised One has developed, &acirc;nanda, made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the four paths to power. If he wanted, &acirc;nanda, the Realised One could remain for the life-span or for what is left of the life-span.&ucirc;</P>
<P>But venerable &acirc;nanda, despite such a gross hint being made by the Auspicious One, such a gross suggestion being made, was unable to penetrate it, and did not beg the Auspicious One, (saying): &szlig;May the Auspicious One remain, reverend Sir, for the life-span; may the Fortunate One remain for the life-span, for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of devas and men,&ucirc; like one whose mind was possessed by M&agrave;ra.</P>
<P>For a second time the Auspicious One addressed venerable &acirc;nanda, (saying): &szlig;Delightful, &acirc;nanda, is Ves&agrave;l&atilde;, delightful is the Udena shrine, delightful is the Gotamaka shrine, delightful is the Sattamba shrine, delightful is the Bahuputta shrine, delightful is the S&agrave;randada shrine, delightful is the C&agrave;p&agrave;la shrine. Whoever has developed, &acirc;nanda, made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the four paths to power, could, if he wanted, remain for the life-span or for what is left of the life-span. The Realised One has developed, &acirc;nanda, made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the four paths to power. If he wanted, &acirc;nanda, the Realised One could remain for the life-span or for what is left of the life-span.&ucirc; </P>
<P>But venerable &acirc;nanda, despite such a gross hint being made by the Auspicious One, such a gross suggestion being made, was unable to penetrate it, and did not beg the Auspicious One, (saying): &szlig;May the Auspicious One remain, reverend Sir, for the life-span, may the Fortunate One remain for the life-span, for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of devas and men,&ucirc; like one whose mind was possessed by M&agrave;ra.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#808080"><P>&nbsp;</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080">For a third time the Auspicious One addressed venerable &acirc;nanda, (saying): &szlig;Delightful, &acirc;nanda, is Ves&agrave;l&atilde;, delightful is the Udena shrine, delightful is the Gotamaka shrine, delightful is the Sattamba shrine, delightful is the Bahuputta shrine, delightful is the S&agrave;randada shrine, delightful is the C&agrave;p&agrave;la shrine. Whoever has developed, &acirc;nanda, made much of, carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated the four paths to power, could, if he wanted, remain for the life-span or for what is left of the life-span.

<P>But venerable &acirc;nanda, despite such a gross hint being made by the Auspicious One, such a gross suggestion being made, was unable to penetrate it, and did not beg the Auspicious One, (saying): &szlig;May the Auspicious One remain, reverend Sir, for the life-span, may the Fortunate One remain for the life-span, for the benefit of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of devas and men,&ucirc; like one whose mind was possessed by M&agrave;ra.</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One addressed venerable &acirc;nanda, (saying): &szlig;Go, &acirc;nanda, now is the time for whatever you are thinking.&ucirc; </P>
<P>&szlig;Yes, reverend Sir,&ucirc; said venerable &acirc;nanda, and after replying to the Auspicious One, rising from his seat, worshipping and circumambulating the Auspicious One, he sat down not far away at the root of a certain tree. </P>
<P>Then M&agrave;ra the Bad, not long after the venerable &acirc;nanda had gone, went to the Auspicious One, and after going, he stood on one side. While stood on one side M&agrave;ra the Bad said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;May the Auspicious One attain complete emancipation, reverend Sir, may the Fortunate One attain complete emancipation, now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Auspicious One's complete emancipation. For the Auspicious One, reverend Sir, has said these words: `I will not attain complete emancipation, Bad One, for as long as my monks are not (true) disciples, accomplished, disciplined, confident, secure, learn‚d, bearers of Dhamma, practicing in conformity with the Dhamma, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Dhamma, and having learned it from their own teacher, will declare, reveal, make known, set forth, open up, analyse, make plain - after giving a good rebuke with reason to the arguments of others that have arisen - <A NAME="Text_5"></A>and teach the wonderful Dhamma.'</P>
<P>But at present, reverend Sir, the Auspicious One's monks are (true) disciples, accomplished, disciplined, confident, secure, learn‚d, bearers of Dhamma, practicing in conformity with the Dhamma, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Dhamma, and having learned it from their own teacher, do declare, reveal, make known, set forth, open up, analyse, make plain - after giving a good rebuke with reason to the arguments of others that have arisen - and teach the wonderful Dhamma. May the Auspicious One attain complete emancipation, reverend Sir, may the Fortunate One attain complete emancipation, now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Auspicious One's complete emancipation. </P>
<P>For the Auspicious One has said these words: `I will not attain complete emancipation, Bad One, for as long as my nuns are not (true) disciples, accomplished, disciplined, confident, secure, learn‚d, bearers of Dhamma, practicing in conformity with the Dhamma, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Dhamma, and having learned it from their own teacher, will declare, reveal, make known, set forth, open up, analyse, make plain - after giving a good rebuke with reason to the arguments of others that have arisen - and teach the wonderful Dhamma.' But at present, reverend Sir, the Auspicious One's nuns are (true) disciples, accomplished, disciplined, confident, secure, learn‚d, bearers of Dhamma, practicing in conformity with the Dhamma, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Dhamma, and having learned it from their own teacher, do declare, reveal, make known, set forth, open up, analyse, make plain - after giving a good rebuke with reason to the arguments of others that have arisen - and teach the wonderful Dhamma. May the Auspicious One attain complete emancipation, reverend Sir, may the Fortunate One attain complete emancipation, now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Auspicious One's complete emancipation.</P>
<P>For the Auspicious One has said these words: `I will not attain complete emancipation, Bad One, for as long as my male lay followers are not (true) disciples, accomplished, disciplined, confident, secure, learn‚d, bearers of Dhamma, practicing in conformity with the Dhamma, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Dhamma, and having learned it from their own teacher, will declare, reveal, make known, set forth, open up, analyse, make plain - after giving a good rebuke with reason to the arguments of others that have arisen - and teach the wonderful Dhamma.' But at present, reverend Sir, the Auspicious One's male lay followers are (true) disciples, accomplished, disciplined, confident, secure, learn‚d, bearers of Dhamma, practicing in conformity with the Dhamma, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Dhamma, and having learned it from their own teacher, do declare, reveal, make known, set forth, open up, analyse, make plain - after giving a good rebuke with reason to the arguments of others that have arisen - and teach the wonderful Dhamma. May the Auspicious One attain complete emancipation, reverend Sir, may the Fortunate One attain complete emancipation, now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Auspicious One's complete emancipation.</P>
<P>For the Auspicious One has said these words: `I will not attain complete emancipation, Bad One, for as long as my female lay followers are not (true) disciples, accomplished, disciplined, confident, secure, learn‚d, bearers of Dhamma, practicing in conformity with the Dhamma, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Dhamma, and having learned it from their own teacher, will declare, reveal, make known, set forth, open up, analyse, make plain - after giving a good rebuke with reason to the arguments of others that have arisen - and teach the wonderful Dhamma.' But at present, reverend Sir, the Auspicious One's female lay followers are (true) disciples, accomplished, disciplined, confident, secure, learn‚d, bearers of Dhamma, practicing in conformity with the Dhamma, correct in their practice, living in conformity with the Dhamma, and having learned it from their own teacher, do declare, reveal, make known, set forth, open up, analyse, make plain - after giving a good rebuke with reason to the arguments of others that have arisen - and teach the wonderful Dhamma. May the Auspicious One attain complete emancipation, reverend Sir, may the Fortunate One attain complete emancipation, now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Auspicious One's complete emancipation.</P>
<P>For the Auspicious One has said these words: `I will not attain complete emancipation, Bad One, for as long as this spiritual life of mine has not become prosperous and successful, well spread out, possessed by many, become great, until it is well explained amongst devas and men.' But at present, reverend Sir, the Auspicious One's spiritual life is prosperous and successful, well spread out, possessed by many, become great, it is well explained amongst devas and men. May the Auspicious One attain complete emancipation, reverend Sir, may the Fortunate One attain complete emancipation, now is the time, reverend Sir, for the Auspicious One's complete emancipation.&ucirc;</P>
<P>When that was said the Auspicious One said this to M&agrave;ra the Bad: &szlig;You should have little concern, Bad One, in no long time the Realised One will become completely emancipated, after three months have passed from now, the Realised One will attain complete emancipation.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then at the C&agrave;p&agrave;la shrine the Auspicious One, mindfully and clearly knowing, relinquished the life process. With the relinquishment of the life process by the Auspicious One there was a great earthquake, and a fearful, horrifying crash of the devas' (thunder) drum. </P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Measureable and immeasureable continuity,<BR>
And the process of continuation the Sage relinquished.<BR>
Internally content, and concentrated,<BR>
He broke continuity of self like a coat of mail.&ucirc;</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="six2"></A>2: The Discourse about Those with Knotted Hair</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</B><P>Thus I heard:</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>at one time the Auspicious One was dwelling near S&agrave;vatth&atilde;, at the Eastern Monastery in Mig&agrave;ra's mother's mansion. Then at that time the Auspicious One having risen from seclusion in the evening time, was sitting outside the doorway. </P>
<P>Then the Kosalan King Pasenadi went to the Auspicious One, and after going and worshipping the Auspicious One, he sat down on one side. Then at that time seven knotted hair ascetics, seven of those knot-free (i.e. Jainas), seven naked ascetics, seven one-cloakers, and seven wanderers, with their nails, armpit-hair, and body hair grown long, having taken up their various requisites, were passing by not far away from the Auspicious One.</P>
<P>The Kosalan King Pasenadi saw those seven knotted hair ascetics, seven of those knot-free, seven naked ascetics, seven one-cloakers, and seven wanderers, with their nails, armpit-hair, and body hair grown long, who, having taken up their various requisites, were passing by not far away from the Auspicious One. And having seen (them), after rising from his seat, arranging his outer robe on one shoulder, placing his right knee-cap on the ground, towards the place where those seven knotted hair ascetics, seven of those knot-free, seven naked ascetics, seven one-cloakers, and seven wanderers were, raising his hands in respectful salutation, he three times announced his name, (saying): &szlig;Reverend Sirs, I am the Kosalan King Pasenadi.&ucirc; </P>
<P>Then the Kosalan King Pasenadi, not long after those seven knotted hair ascetics, seven of those knot-free, seven naked ascetics, seven one-cloakers, and seven wanderers had gone, went to the Auspicious One, and after going and worshipping the Auspicious One, he sat down on one side, While sat on one side the Kosalan King Pasenadi said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;Among those in the world reverend Sir, who are Worthy Ones, or have entered the path to Worthiness, these are some of them.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;But this is hard to know, Great King, by you, a householder, partaking of sense pleasures, by one dwelling in a sleeping place crowded with sons, by one enjoying sandalwood from K&agrave;si, by one wearing garlands, scents, and creams, by one accepting gold and silver: `These are Worthy Ones, or these have entered the path to Worthiness,'</P>
<P>Through living together, Great King, one can understand (a person's) virtue, and that after a long time, and not after a short one, by one applying the mind, not by one not applying the mind, by one with wisdom, not by one with poor wisdom.</P>

<P>&szlig;It is wonderful, reverend Sir, it is marvellous, reverend Sir, how well spoken that was, reverend Sir, by the Auspicious One: `But this is hard to know, Great King, by you, a householder, partaking of sense pleasures, by one dwelling in a sleeping place crowded with sons, by one enjoying sandalwood from K&agrave;si, by one wearing garlands, scents, and creams, by one accepting gold and silver: &szlig;These are Worthy, or these have entered the path to Worthiness,&ucirc;</P>

<P>These are my men, imposters and spies, reverend Sir, who are returning after spying on the country, for first they have gone down (to the country), and afterwards I will go down. Now these, reverend Sir, having removed dust and dirt, being bathed, well annointed, with trimmed hair and beards, dressed in clean clothes, and provided with and possessing the five strands of sensual pleasures, will amuse themselves.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;One should not endeavour in all circumstances,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one should not be another's man,<BR>
One should not live depending on another,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one should not live trading in Dhamma.&ucirc;</P>

<P>at one time the Auspicious One was dwelling near S&agrave;vatth&atilde;, at An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika's monastery in Jeta's Wood. Then at that time many and various sectarians, ascetics, br&agrave;hma&otilde;as, and wanderers were living at S&agrave;vatth&atilde;, having various views, various likings, various tendencies, subject to dependence on various views, (such as):</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>There are some ascetics and br&agrave;hma&otilde;as who were of this argument, this view: &szlig;The world is eternal - this alone is the truth, (all) else is foolish.&ucirc;</P>
<P>But there are some ascetics and br&agrave;hma&otilde;as who were of this argument, this view: &szlig;The world is not eternal - this alone is the truth, (all) else is foolish.&ucirc;</P>
<P>There are some ascetics and br&agrave;hma&otilde;as who were of this argument, this view: &szlig;The world is finite - this alone is the truth, (all) else is foolish.&ucirc;</P>
<P>But there are some ascetics and br&agrave;hma&otilde;as who were of this argument, this view: &szlig;The world is infinite - this alone is the truth, (all) else is foolish.&ucirc;</P>
<P>There are some ascetics and br&agrave;hma&otilde;as who were of this argument, this view: &szlig;That which is soul, that is (also) the body - this alone is the truth, (all) else is foolish.&ucirc;</P>
<P>But there are some ascetics and br&agrave;hma&otilde;as who were of this argument, this view: &szlig;The soul is one thing, the body is another thing, - this alone is the truth, (all) else is foolish.&ucirc;</P>

</DIR>

<P>They lived contending, quarelling, disputing, attacking each other with sharp tongues, (saying): &szlig;Such is Dhamma, such is not Dhamma; such is not Dhamma, such is Dhamma.&ucirc; </P>
<P>Then many monks, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up their bowl and robe, entered S&agrave;vatth&atilde; for alms. After walking for alms in S&agrave;vatth&atilde;, while returning from the alms-round after the meal, they went to the Auspicious One, and after going and worshipping the Auspicious One, they sat down on one side.</P>
<P>While sat on one side those monks said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;Here, reverend Sir, many and various sectarians, ascetics, br&agrave;hma&otilde;as, and wanderers are living at S&agrave;vatth&atilde;, having various views, various likings, various tendencies, subject to dependence on various views, (such as): </P><DIR>

<P>They live contending, quarelling, disputing, attacking each other with sharp tongues, (saying): `Such is Dhamma, such is not Dhamma; such is not Dhamma, such is Dhamma.' &ucirc; </P>
<P>&szlig;Wanderers from other sects, monks, are blind, without vision, they do not know what is good, they do not know what is not good, they do not know what is Dhamma, they do not know what is not Dhamma. They, not knowing what is good, not knowing what is not good, not knowing what is Dhamma, not knowing what is not Dhamma, live contending, quarelling, disputing, attacking each other with sharp tongues, (saying): `Such is Dhamma, such is not Dhamma; such is not Dhamma, such is Dhamma.' </P>
<P>Formerly, monks, in this S&agrave;vatth&atilde; there was a certain King. Then that King, monks, addressed a certain man, (saying): `Please go, dear Sir, and as many of those congenitally blind as there are in S&agrave;vatth&atilde; assemble them in one place.' </P>
<P>`Yes, your Majesty', said that man, monks, and after replying to the King, after grabbing all of those congenitally blind as there were in S&agrave;vatth&atilde;, he went to the King, and after going he said this to the King: `As many of those congenitally blind as there are in S&agrave;vatth&atilde;, your Majesty, have assembled.'</P>
<P>`Then show an elephant, I say, to those congenitally blind.'</P>
<P>`Yes, your Majesty', said that man, monks, and after replying to the King, he showed an elephant to those congenitally blind, (saying): `Such is an elephant, blind men!'</P>
<P>To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephant's head, (saying): `Such is an elephant, blind men!' To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephant's ear, (saying): `Such is an elephant, blind men!' To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephant's tusk, (saying): `Such is an elephant, blind men!' To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephant's trunk, (saying): `Such is an elephant, blind men!' To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephant's body, (saying): `Such is an elephant, blind men!' To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephant's leg, (saying): `Such is an elephant, blind men!' To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephant's thigh, (saying): `Such is an elephant, blind men!' To some of those congenitally blind he showed the top of the elephant's tail, (saying): `Such is an elephant, blind men!' To some of those congenitally blind he showed the tip of the elephant's tail, (saying): `Such is an elephant, blind men!'</P>
<P>Then, monks, that man, having shown the elephant to those congenitally blind, went to the King, and after going he said this to the King: `Those congenitally blind have seen the elephant, your Majesty, now is the time for whatever you are thinking, your Majesty.' Then that king, monks, went to the blind men, and after going he said this to those blind men: `Did you see the elephant, blind men?'</P>

<P>&szlig;Just so, &acirc;nanda, for as long as the Realised Ones, &acirc;nanda, do not arise in the world, the Worthy Ones, the Perfect Sambuddhas, for that long the wanderers from other sects are venerated, respected, revered, honoured, esteemed, and in receipt of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal requisites to help when sick.

<P>Then the Auspicious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;The glow worm shines forth<BR>
for as long as the light-maker (the sun) does not rise,<BR>
But when the brilliant one (the sun) has risen,<BR>
The (glow worm's) light is destroyed, and does not shine forth.</P>
<P>In the same way the reasoners shine forth<BR>
for as long as the Perfect Sambuddhas do not arise in the world.<BR>
The reasoners are not purified, nor are their disciples,<BR>
of wrong view, they are not released from suffering.&ucirc;</P>
