</DIR>

<P>at one time the Auspicious One was dwelling near S&agrave;vatth&atilde;, at An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika's monastery in Jeta's Wood. Then at that time the Kosalan King Pasenadi had gone to the top of the royal palace with Queen Mallik&agrave;. Then the Kosalan King Pasenadi said this to Queen Mallika: &szlig;Is there anyone, Mallika, you love more than yourself?&ucirc; &szlig;There is no one, Great King, I love more than myself. But is there, Great King, anyone you love more than yourself?&ucirc; &szlig;For me also, Mallika, there is no one I love more than myself.&ucirc; </P>
<P>Then the Kosalan King Pasenadi having come down from the palace went to the Auspicious One, and after going and worshipping the Auspicious One, he sat down on one side. While sat on one side the Kosalan King Pasenadi said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;Here, reverend Sir, having gone to the top of the royal palace with Queen Mallik&agrave; I said this to Queen Mallik&agrave;: `Is there anyone, Mallik&agrave;, you love more than yourself?' When that was said, Queen Mallik&agrave; said this to me: `There is no one, Great King, I love more than myself. But is there, Great King, anyone you love more than yourself?' When that was said, reverend Sir, I said this to Queen Mallika: `For me also, Mallika, there is no one I love more than myself.' &ucirc;</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Having gone around in all directions with the mind,<BR>
There is surely no one found who is loved more than oneself.<BR>
In the same way others each love themselves,<BR>
Therefore one who cares for himself should not harm another.&ucirc;</P>

</DIR>

<P>at one time the Auspicious One was dwelling near S&agrave;vatth&atilde;, at An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika's monastery in Jeta's Wood. Then venerable &acirc;nanda, having risen from seclusion in the evening time, went to the Auspicious One, and after going and worshipping the Auspicious One, he sat down on one side. While sat on one side the venerable &acirc;nanda said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;It is wonderful, reverend Sir, it is marvellous, reverend Sir, just how short-lived, reverend Sir, the Auspicious One's mother was, seven days after the Auspicious One was born, the Auspicious One's mother died, and arose among the Tusita hosts.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;It is just so, &acirc;nanda, the mothers of Awakening-Beings are indeed short-lived, seven days after the Awakening-Beings are born, the mothers of Awakening-Beings die, and arise among the Tusita hosts.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Whatsoever beings there are, or [ever] will be,<BR>
They will all go on after giving up the body.<BR>
The one who is skilful, having understood all that deprivation, <BR>
Should live the spiritual life with ardour.&ucirc;</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="five3"></A>3: The Discourse about the Leper Suppabuddha</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</B><P>Thus I heard:</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>at one time the Auspicious One was dwelling near R&agrave;jagaha, at the Squirrel's Feeding Place in Bamboo Wood. Then at that time the leper known as Suppabuddha (Wide Awake) was in R&agrave;jagaha, a poor man, a wretched man, a miserable man. Then at that time the Auspicious One was sitting teaching Dhamma surrounded by a great assembly. The leper Suppabuddha saw while still a far away that a great body of people had assembled together. Having seen (that), this occurred to him: &szlig;Undoubtedly in this place some comestibles and edibles will be distributed. Well now, I could go to that great crowd of people, perhaps I will get some comestibles or edibles in this place.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then the leper Suppabuddha went to that great crowd of people. The leper Suppabuddha saw the Auspicious One was sitting teaching Dhamma surrounded by a great assembly. Having seen (that), this occurred to him: &szlig;Here there are no comestibles or edibles being distributed, this ascetic Gotama is teaching Dhamma to the assembly. Perhaps I also could hear the Dhamma&ucirc;, and he sat down right there (and then), (thinking): &szlig;I will also listen to the Dhamma.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, applied his mind and encompassed fully the whole of that assembly with his mind, (thinking): &szlig;Who here is able to understand the Dhamma?&ucirc; The Auspicious One saw the leper Suppabuddha sat in that assembly, and having seen (him), this occurred to him: &szlig;This one here is able to understand the Dhamma&ucirc;, and having regard to the leper Suppabuddha he related a gradual talk, that is to say: talk on giving, talk on virtue, talk on heaven, the danger, degradation, and defilement of sensual desires, and the advantages in renunciation - (these) he explained.</P>
<P>When the Auspicious One knew that the leper Suppabuddha was of ready mind, malleable mind, unhindered mind, uplifted mind, trusting mind, then he explained the Dhamma teaching the Awakened Ones have discovered themselves: suffering, arising, cessation, path.</P>
<P>Just as it is known that a clean cloth without a stain would take the dye well, so to the leper Suppabuddha on that very seat, the dust-free, stainless Vision-of-the-Dhamma arose: </P>
<P>&szlig;Whatever has the nature of arising, all that has the nature of ceasing.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then the leper Suppabuddha having seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, penetrated the Dhamma, crossed over uncertainty, being without doubts, attained full confidence, having become independent of others in the Teacher's teaching, after rising from his seat went to the Auspicious One, and after going and worshipping the Auspicious One, he sat down at one side. While he was sitting on one side the leper Suppabuddha said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;Excellent, reverend Sir! Excellent reverend Sir! Just as, reverend Sir, one might set upright what has been overturned, or open up what has been closed, or show a path to one who is lost, or bear an oil lamp in the darkness so that those who have eyes can see forms, just so has the Dhamma been explained by the Auspicious One in countless ways. I go, reverend Sir, to the Auspicious One for refuge, and to the Dhamma, and to the Community of monks. Please bear it in mind, reverend Gotama, that I am a lay follower who has gone for refuge from today forward for as long as I have the breath of life.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered the leper Suppabuddha with a Dhamma talk, and after greatly rejoicing and gladly receiving this word of the Auspicious One, after rising from his seat, worshipping and circumambulating the Auspicious One, he went away. </P>
<P>Then not long after the leper Suppabuddha had gone a cow with a young calf having attacked him, deprived him of life. Then many monks went to the Auspicious One, and after going and worshipping the Auspicious One, they sat down on one side. While sat on one side those monks said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;That leper called Suppabuddha, reverend Sir, who was instucted, roused, enthused, and cheered by the Auspicious One with a Dhamma talk - he has died. What is his destination? What is his future state?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;A wise man, monks, was Suppabuddha, who practiced Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, and did not trouble me on account of the Dhamma. The leper Suppabuddha, monks, through the destruction of three fetters, is a stream-enterer, not subject to the fall, and is assured of arriving at Full Awakening.&ucirc;</P>
<P>When that was said, a certain monk said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;What was the reason, reverend Sir, what was the cause, through which the leper Suppabuddha became a poor man, a wretched man, a miserable man?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Formerly, monks, the leper Suppabuddha was a son of a wealthy merchant in this very R&agrave;jagaha. While going to his pleasure park he saw the Pacceka Buddha Tagarasikkhi entering the city for alms, and having seen (him), this occurred to him: &szlig;Where is this leper roaming around with his leper's robe?&ucirc; And having spat, and circumambulated him (disrespectfully) on the left side, he went away. </P>
<P>As a result of that deed for many years, for many hundreds of years, for many thousands of years, for many hundreds of thousands of years, he boiled in the nether regions. As a result of the remaining part of that deed he became a leper in this very R&agrave;jagaha, a poor man, a wretched man, a miserable man. (But) he came to the Dhamma and Discipline taught by the Realised One, and obtained faith, obtained virtue, obtained learning, obtained liberality, obtained wisdom. After coming to the Dhamma and Discipline taught by the Realised One, and obtaining faith, obtaining virtue, obtaining learning, obtaining liberality, obtaining wisdom, at the break up of the body, after death, he arose in a fortunate destiny, in the world of Heaven, in the companionship of the T&agrave;vati&uuml;sa devas. And there he surely outshines the other devas with his beauty and repute.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;As a man with vision, who is endeavouring, (would avoid) dangerous paths,<BR>
(So) a wise man in the world of the living,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should avoid bad deeds.&ucirc;</P>

</B><P>Thus I heard:</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>at one time the Auspicious One was dwelling near S&agrave;vatth&atilde;, at An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika's monastery in Jeta's Wood. Then at that time many young boys who were between S&agrave;vatth&atilde; and Jeta's Wood were catching little fish. </P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, was entering S&agrave;vatth&atilde; for alms. The Auspicious One saw those many young boys who were between S&agrave;vatth&atilde; and Jeta's Wood catching fish. Having seen (that), he went to those young boys, and after going, he said this to those young boys: &szlig;Are you afraid, boys, of suffering? Is suffering unpleasant to you?&ucirc; &szlig;Yes, reverend Sir, we are afraid of suffering, suffering is unpleasant to us.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;If you have fear of suffering,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if suffering is unpleasant to you,<BR>
Don't do (any) bad deeds,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether in the open or in secret.<BR>
But if you will do, or (now) do do bad deeds,<BR>
For you there is no freedom from suffering,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even after going, while running away.&ucirc;</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="five5"></A>5: The Discourse about the Observance</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</B><P>Thus I heard:</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>at one time the Auspicious One was dwelling near S&agrave;vatth&atilde;, at the Eastern Monastery in Mig&agrave;ra's mother's mansion. Then at that time the Auspicious One was sitting surrounded by the Community of monks on the Observance Day. Then venerable &acirc;nanda, when the night had passed, when the first watch of the night had gone, after rising from his seat, arranging his robe on one shoulder, and raising his hands in respectful salutation, said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;The night has passed, reverend Sir, the first watch of the night has gone, for a long time the Community of monks has been sitting, may the Auspicious One recite the P&agrave;timokkha for the monks.&ucirc;</P>
<P>When that was said, the Auspicious One was silent. For a second time venerable &acirc;nanda, when the night had passed, when the middle watch of the night had gone, after rising from his seat, arranging his robe on one shoulder, and raising his hands in respectful salutation, said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;The night has passed, reverend Sir, the middle watch of the night has gone, for a long time the Community of monks has been sitting, may the Auspicious One recite the P&agrave;timokkha for the monks.&ucirc;</P>
<P>For a second time the Auspicious One was silent. For a third time venerable &acirc;nanda, when the night had passed, when the last watch of the night had gone, when dawn had risen, when the night had a joyful appearance, after rising from his seat, arranging his robe on one shoulder, and raising his hands in respectful salutation, said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;The night has passed, reverend Sir, the last watch of the night has gone, dawn has risen, the night has a joyful appearance, for a long time the Community of monks has been sitting, may the Auspicious One recite the P&agrave;timokkha for the monks.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;The assembly is not compeletly pure, &acirc;nanda.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then it occurred to venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na: &szlig;With regard to which person did the Auspicious One say this: `The assembly is not compeletly pure, &acirc;nanda'? &ucirc; Then venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na applied his mind and encompassed fully the whole of that assembly with his mind. Venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na saw that person who was lacking in virtue, of bad character, of impure and doubtful conduct, who covered up his deeds, who was not an ascetic, though making it known he was an ascetic, who was not living the spiritual life, though making it known he was living the spiritual life, who was filthy inside, polluted, and rotten, sat in the middle of the Community of monks.</P>
<P>Having seen (him), he went to that person, and after going, he said this to that person: &szlig;Get up, friend, you have been seen by the Auspicious One, there is no communion for you with the monks.&ucirc; Then that person was silent.</P>
<P>For a second time venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na said this to that person: &szlig;Get up, friend, you have been seen by the Auspicious One, there is no longer communion for you with the monks.&ucirc; For a second time that person was silent.</P>
<P>For a third time venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na said this to that person: &szlig;Get up, friend, you have been seen by the Auspicious One, there is no longer communion for you with the monks.&ucirc; For a third time that person was silent.</P>
<P>Then venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na, having taken that person by the arm, having expelled him outside the doorway, and drawn the lock, went to the Auspicious One, and after going, he said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;I have expelled that person, reverend Sir, the assembly is (now) compeletly pure, may the Auspicious One, venerable Sir, recite the P&agrave;timokkha for the monks.&ucirc; </P>
<P>&szlig;It is wonderful, Moggall&agrave;na, it is marvellous, Moggall&agrave;na, how that foolish person waited until he was grabbed by the arm.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One addressed the monks: &szlig;From now onwards, monks, I will not make the Observance, or recite the P&agrave;timokkha. From now onwards, monks, you must make the Observance, and recite the P&agrave;timokkha. It is impossible, monks, it is not permitted, that the Realised One should make the Observance in an assembly that is not compeletly pure, and should recite the P&agrave;timokkha.</P>
<P>There are these eight wonderful and marvellous things about the great ocean, monks, which, having seen and considered, the Asur&agrave;s delight in the great ocean. Which eight?</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The great ocean, monks, gradually inclines, gradually slopes, gradually slants, certainly does not have an abrupt falling away.

<P>Furthermore, monks, whatever great rivers there are, that is to say: The Ga&iuml;ga, the Yamun&agrave;, the Aciravat&atilde;, the Sarabh&aring;, and the Mah&atilde;, having arrived at the great ocean, they give up their former lineage names, and are then designated as the great ocean.

<P>Furthermore, monks, the streams in the world flow into the great ocean, and showers fall from the sky, but it is not known that there is a depletion or filling of the great ocean by that.

That, monks, the great ocean has one taste, the taste of salt, monks, is the sixth wonderful and marvellous thing about the great ocean, which, having seen and considered, the Asuras delight in the great ocean. Furthermore, monks, the great ocean has many precious things, countless precious things, and therein are these precious things, that is to say: pearls, crystals, lapis lazuli, mother-of-pearl, quartz, coral, silver, gold, ruby, and cat's eyes.

<P>Furthermore, monks, the great ocean is a dwelling place for great beings, and therein are these beings: Timis, Timi&iuml;galas, Timirapi&iuml;galas, Asuras, N&agrave;gas, Gandhabbas, and there are in the great ocean individuals of a hundred leagues, and individuals of two hundred leagues, and individuals of three hundred leagues, and individuals of four hundred leagues, and individuals of five hundred leagues.

<P>These are these eight wonderful and marvellous things about the great ocean, which, having seen and considered, the Asuras delight in the great ocean. </P>
<P>In the same way, monks, there are eight wonderful and marvellous things about this Dhamma and Discipline, which, having seen and considered, the monks delight in this Dhamma and Discipline. Which eight?</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Just as the great ocean, monks, gradually inclines, gradually slopes, gradually slants, certainly does not fall away abruptly, so, monks, in this Dhamma and Discipline there is a gradual training, a gradual performance, a gradual practice, it certainly does not have an abrupt penetration of knowledge.

<P>Just as, monks, the great ocean does not endure a dead corpse, and when there is a dead corpse in the great ocean it quickly carries it to the bank, throws it up on dry ground, so, monks, he who is a person who is lacking in virtue, of bad character, of impure and doubtful conduct, who covers up his deeds, who is not an ascetic, though making it known he is an ascetic, who is not living the spiritual life, though making it known he is living the spiritual life, who is filthy inside, polluted, and rotten, the Community does not endure that (person), but quickly having assembled together, suspend him, and whoever was sitting in the midst of the Community of monks is then far from the Community, and the Community from him.

<P>Just as, monks, whatever great rivers there are, that is to say: The Ga&iuml;ga, the Yamun&agrave;, the Aciravat&atilde;, the Sarabh&aring;, and the Mah&atilde;, having arrived at the great ocean, they give up their former lineage names, and are then designated as the great ocean, so, monks, there are these four classes: Khattiyas, Br&agrave;hma&otilde;as, Vessas, and Suddas, who, having gone forth from the home to homelessness in the Dhamma and Discipline taught by the Realised One, give up their former lineage names, and are then designated as Sakyan ascetics.

<P>Just as, monks, the streams in the world flow into the great ocean, and showers fall from the sky, but it is not known that there is a depletion or filling of the great ocean by that, so, monks, even if many monks, are completely emancipated in the Emancipation-element which has no basis for attachment remaining, it is not known that the Emancipation-element is either depleted or filled by that. That, monks, even if many monks, are completely emancipated in the Emancipation-element which has no basis for attachment remaining, it is not known that the Emancipation-element is either depleted or filled by that, is the fifth wonderful and marvellous thing about this Dhamma and Discipline, which, having seen and considered, the monks delight in this Dhamma and Discipline.

Well now, after shaving off head-hair and beard, and donning ochre clothes, I could go forth from the home to homelessness.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then the lay follower So&otilde;a Ku&ntilde;ika&otilde;&otilde;a went to venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;yana, and after going and worshipping venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;yana, he sat down on one side. While sat on one side the lay follower So&otilde;a Ku&ntilde;ika&otilde;&otilde;a said this to venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;yana: &szlig;Here, reverend Sir, having gone into hiding, into seclusion, this reflection arose in my mind: `According to the way Master Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;yana teaches the Dhamma, it is not easy, while dwelling in the home, to live the spiritual life absolutely fulfilled, absolutely pure, like a polished shell.

<P>When that was said, venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;yana said this to the lay follower So&otilde;a Ku&ntilde;ika&otilde;&otilde;a: &szlig;A solitary meal, a solitary bed, and celibacy, So&otilde;a, for as long as life lasts, is difficult, come on, So&otilde;a, right now while still living as a householder, you should devote yourself to the Buddhas' teaching, and at suitable times (i.e. on Observance days) (have only) a solitary meal, a solitary bed, and celibacy.&ucirc; Then that determination the lay follower So&otilde;a Ku&ntilde;ika&otilde;&otilde;a had to go forth abated.</P>
<P>For a second time when the lay follower So&otilde;a Ku&ntilde;ika&otilde;&otilde;a had gone into hiding, into seclusion, this reflection arose in his mind: &szlig;According to the way Master Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;yana teaches the Dhamma, it is not easy, while dwelling in the home, to live the spiritual life, absolutely fulfilled, absolutely pure, like a polished shell.

<P>For a third time when the lay follower So&otilde;a Ku&ntilde;ika&otilde;&otilde;a had gone into hiding, into seclusion, this reflection arose in his mind: &szlig;In the way Master Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;yana teaches the Dhamma, it is not easy, while dwelling in the home, to live the spiritual life, absolutely fulfilled, absolutely pure, like a polished shell.

<P>Then venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;yana let the lay follower So&otilde;a Ku&ntilde;ika&otilde;&otilde;a go forth. </FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080"><P>Then at that time there were few monks in the Southern State of Avanti. Then with the passing of three years venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;yana, having, with difficulty and with trouble, from here and there, brought together a group of ten monks from the Order, fully ordained venerable So&otilde;a. </P>
<P>Then when venerable So&otilde;a, after residing for the Rains Retreat, had gone into hiding, into seclusion, this reflection arose in his mind: &szlig;I have not seen the Auspicious One face to face, but I have heard that the Auspicious One is such and such a one. If the preceptor would allow me I could go to see the Auspicious One, the Worthy One, the Perfect Sambuddha.&ucirc; Then the venerable So&otilde;a, having risen from seclusion in the evening time, went to venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;yana, and after going and worshipping venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;yana, he sat down on one side. While sat on one side venerable So&otilde;a said this to venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;yana: &szlig;Here, reverend Sir, having gone into hiding, into seclusion, this reflection arose in my mind: `I have not seen the Auspicious One face to face, but I have heard that the Auspicious One is such and such a one.' If the preceptor would allow me I could go to see the Auspicious One, the Worthy One, the Perfect Sambuddha.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Good, good, So&otilde;a, you must go, So&otilde;a, to see the Auspicious One, the Worthy One, the Perfect Sambuddha. You will see, So&otilde;a, that Auspicious One who is confident, inspiring confidence, with (sense) faculties at peace, mind at peace, having attained supreme self-control and calm, controlled, guarded, with restrained faculties, a (true) n&agrave;ga. Having seen (him), in my name you should worship the Auspicious One's feet with your head, ask (if he is) free from affliction, free from sickness, in good health, strong, and living comfortably, (saying): `My Preceptor, venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;yana, reverend Sir, worships the Auspicious One's feet with his head, and asks (if you are) free from affliction, free from sickness, in good health, strong, and living comfortably?' &ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Yes, reverend Sir&ucirc;, and venerable So&otilde;a, and after greatly rejoicing and gladly receiving this word of venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;yana, having worshipped and circumambulated venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;yana, after putting his dwelling place in order, and picking up his robe and bowl, he went on walking tour towards S&agrave;vatth&atilde;. </P>
<P>Walking gradually on walking tour he went to S&agrave;vatth&atilde;, Jeta's Wood, An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika's monastery, and the Auspicious One, and after going and worshipping the Auspicious One, he sat down on one side. While sat on one side venerable So&otilde;a said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;My Preceptor, venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;yana, reverend Sir, worships the Auspicious One's feet with his head, and asks (if you are) free from affliction, free from sickness, in good health, strong, and living comfortably?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Can you bear up, monk? Can you carry on? Did you come along the road without fatigue, and without going short of alms?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;I can bear up, reverend Sir, I can carry on, and I did come along the road without fatigue, and without going short of alms.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One addressed Venerable &acirc;nanda, (saying): &szlig;Please prepare a dwelling place, &acirc;nanda, for this visiting monk.&ucirc; Then it occurred to venerable &acirc;nanda: &szlig;When the Auspicious One orders me, (saying): `Please prepare a dwelling place, &acirc;nanda, for this visiting monk,' he wants to to dwell together with that monk in one living quarters. The Auspicious One wants to dwell together with venerable So&otilde;a in one living quarters.&ucirc; And in the living quarters where the Auspicious One was living, there he prepared a dwelling place for venerable So&otilde;a.</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One having spent most of the night sitting in the open air, having washed his feet, entered the living quarters. Also venerable So&otilde;a having spent most of the night sitting in the open air, having washed his feet, entered the living quarters. Then towards the time of dawn, after rising, the Auspicious One requested venerable So&otilde;a, (saying): &szlig;May the Dhamma inspire you to speak, monk.&ucirc; &szlig;Yes, reverend Sir,&ucirc; said venerable So&otilde;a, and after replying to the Auspicious One, he melodiously recited (all) sixteen (discourses) of the Chapter of the Eights.</P>
<P>Then at the end of venerable So&otilde;a's melodious recitation the Auspicious One greatly rejoiced, (saying): &szlig;Good, good, monk, well learned, monk, well remembered, well born in mind, are the sixteen (discourses) of the Chapter of the Eights, you are endowed with a good voice, with good enunciation, pure articulation, which makes the meaning clear. How many Rains do you have, monk?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;I have one Rains, Auspicious One.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;But why, monk, did it take you so long (to ordain)?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;For a long time, reverend Sir, I have seen the danger in sensual desires, but dwelling in the home there was obstruction, with many duties and many things to do.&ucirc; </P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</P><DIR>
