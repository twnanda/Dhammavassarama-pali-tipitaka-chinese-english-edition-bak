<DIR>

</B><P>Thus I heard:</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>at one time the Auspicious One was dwelling near C&agrave;lik&agrave;, on the C&agrave;lik&agrave; mountain. Then at that time venerable Meghiya was the Auspicious One's attendent. Then venerable Meghiya went to the Auspicious One, and after going and worshipping the Auspicious One, he stood on one side. While stood on one side venerable Meghiya said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;Reverend Sir, I want to enter Jantug&agrave;ma for alms.&ucirc; &szlig;Now is the time for whatever you are thinking, Meghiya.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then venerable Meghiya having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, entered Jantug&agrave;ma for alms. Having walked for alms in Jantug&agrave;ma, while returning from the alms-round after the meal, he went to the bank of the river Kimik&agrave;l&agrave;, and after going to the bank of the river Kimik&agrave;l&agrave;, while wandering around and strolling around on a walk, he saw a pleasing and delightful mango grove. Having seen (it), this occured to him: &szlig;This is surely a pleasing and delightful mango grove. For a son of a good family who desires to strive this is surely enough for striving. If the Auspicious One would allow me I could come to this mango grove to strive.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then venerable Meghiya went to the Auspicious One, and after going and worshipping the Auspicious One, he sat down on one side. While sat on one side venerable Meghiya said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;Here, reverend Sir, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up my bowl and robe, I entered Jantug&agrave;ma for alms. Having walked for alms in Jantug&agrave;ma, while returning from the alms-round after the meal, I went to the bank of the river Kimik&agrave;l&agrave;, and after going to the bank of the river Kimik&agrave;l&agrave;, while wandering around and strolling around on a walk, I saw a pleasing and delightful mango grove. Having seen (it), this occured to me: `This is surely a pleasing and delightful mango grove. For a son of a good family who desires to strive this is surely enough for striving. If the Auspicious One would allow me, I could come to this mango grove to strive.' If the Auspicious One would allow me, reverend Sir, I could go to that mango grove to strive.&ucirc;</P>
<P>When that was said, the Auspicious One said this to venerable Meghiya: &szlig;You should wait for as long as I am alone, Meghiya, until some other monk arrives.&ucirc;</P>
<P>For a second time venerable Meghiya said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;There is nothing further for the Auspicious One to do, reverend Sir, there is nothing to add to what has been done. But for me, reverend Sir, there is (something) further to do, there is (something) to add to what has been done. If the Auspicious One would allow me, reverend Sir, I could go to that mango grove to strive.&ucirc;</P>
<P>For a second time the Auspicious One said this to venerable Meghiya: &szlig;You should wait for as long as I am alone, Meghiya, until some other monk arrives.&ucirc;</P>
<P>For a third time venerable Meghiya said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;There is nothing further for the Auspicious One to do, reverend Sir, there is nothing to add to what has been done. But for me, reverend Sir, there is (something) further to do, there is (something) to add to what has been done. If the Auspicious One would allow me, reverend Sir, I could go to that mango grove to strive.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;When you are talking about striving, Maghiya, what can we say? Now is the time for whatever you are thinking, Meghiya.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then venerable Meghiya, after rising from his seat, worshipping and circumambulating the Auspicious One, went to that mango grove, and after going and entering that mango grove, he sat down to dwell for the day at the root of a certain tree. Then to venerable Meghiya, as he was dwelling in that mango grove, for the most part only three bad, unwholesome thoughts occured, that is to say: the thought of sensual pleasure, the thought of ill-will, the thought of harming.</P>
<P>Then it occured to venerable Meghiya: &szlig;Surely it is wonderful, friend, surely it is marvellous, friend, that I who, out of faith, have gone forth from the home to homelessness, should be ensnared by these three bad, unwholesome thoughts, that is to say: by the thought of sensual pleasure, by the thought of ill-will, by the thought of harming.</P>
<P>Then venerable Meghiya, having risen from seclusion in the evening time, went to the Auspicious One, and after going and worshipping the Auspicious One, he sat down on one side. While sat on one side venerable Meghiya said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;Here, reverend Sir, as I was dwelling in that mango grove, for the most part only three bad, unwholesome thoughts occured, that is to say: the thought of sensual pleasure, the thought of ill-will, the thought of harming. Then, reverend Sir, it occured to me: `Surely it is wonderful, friend, surely it is marvellous, friend that I who, out of faith, have gone forth from the home to homelessness, should be ensnared by these three bad, unwholesome thoughts, that is to say: by the thought of sensual pleasure, by the thought of ill-will, by the thought of harming.' &ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature, Meghiya, there are five things that lead to maturity. What five?</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Here, Meghiya, a monk has a good friend,<BR>
a good companion, a good comrade.<BR>
For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature, Meghiya,<BR>
this is the first thing that leads to maturity.</P>
<P>Furthermore, Meghiya, a monk is virtuous,<BR>
he lives restrained with the P&agrave;timokkha restraint, and is endowed with (suitable) conduct and resort,<BR>
seeing what is fearful in the slightest faults, <BR>
he trains in the training rules he has undertaken.<BR>
For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature, Meghiya,<BR>
this is the second thing that leads to maturity.</P>
<P>Furthermore, Meghiya, a monk has talk about what is very austere,<BR>
that is suitable for opening up the mind, and that leads to absolute disenchantment, dispassion, cessation,<BR>
peace, deep knowledge, complete Awakening and Emancipation,<BR>
such as: talk on wanting little, talk on being satisfied, talk on complete seclusion,<BR>
talk on disassociation, talk on arousing energy, talk on virtue, talk on concentration,<BR>
talk on wisdom, talk on freedom, talk on knowing and seeing freedom.<BR>
Such talk as this he gains as he desires, he gains without difficulty, gains without trouble.<BR>
For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature, Meghiya,<BR>
this is the third thing that leads to maturity.</P>
<P>Furthermore, Meghiya, a monk dwells with energy aroused<BR>
for the giving up of unwholesome things,<BR>
for the taking up of wholesome things,<BR>
steadfast, of firm endeavour, one who has not thrown off the burden in regard to wholesome things.<BR>
For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature, Meghiya,<BR>
this is the fourth thing that leads to maturity.</P>
<P>Furthermore, Meghiya, a monk is wise, <BR>
he is endowed with wisdom that leads to (seeing) rise and disappearance,<BR>
with noble penetration, that leads to the complete destruction of suffering.<BR>
For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature, Meghiya,<BR>
this is the fifth thing that leads to maturity.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>For he whose freedom of mind is not fully mature, Meghiya, these five things leads to maturity. To this monk who has a good friend, a good companion, a good comrade, Meghiya, it is to be expected that he will be virtuous, that he will live restrained with the P&agrave;timokkha restraint, and will be endowed with (suitable) conduct and resort, seeing what is fearful in the slightest fault, and will train in the training rules he has undertaken. &szlig;To this monk who has a good friend, a good companion, a good comrade, Meghiya, it is to be expected that he will have talk that is very austere, that is suitable for opening up the mind, and that leads to absolute disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, peace, deep knowledge, complete Awakening and nibb&agrave;na, such as: talk on wanting little, talk on being satisfied, talk on complete seclusion, talk on disassociation, talk on stirring up energy, talk on virtue, talk on concentration, talk on wisdom, talk on freedom, talk on knowing and seeing freedom. Such talk as this he gains as he desires, he gains without difficulty, gains without trouble. </P>
<P>&szlig;To this monk who has a good friend, a good companion, a good comrade, Meghiya, it is to be expected that he will be a monk with energy aroused for the giving up of unwholesome things, for the taking up of wholesome things, steadfast, of firm endeavour, one who has not thrown off the burden in regard to wholesome things. To this monk who has a good friend, a good companion, a good comrade, Meghiya, it is to be expected that he will be a monk who is wise, endowed with wisdom that leads to (seeing) rise and disappearance, with noble penetration, that leads to the complete destruction of suffering. Then, Meghiya, with a monk who is established in these five things, four further things ought be be developed:</P>
<P>The (meditation on the) unattractive should be developed for the giving up of passion, <BR>
friendliness (meditation) should be developed for the giving up of ill-will,<BR>
mindfulness of breathing should be developed for the cutting off of thought,<BR>
the perception of impermanence should be developed for the complete uprooting of the conceit `I am'.</P>
<P>To one who has the perception of impermanence, Meghiya, the perception of non-self is established, one who perceives non-self reaches the complete uprooting of the conceit `I am', in this very life (reaches) Emancipation.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;(There are) low thoughts, fine thoughts,</FONT> <BR>
<FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080">Accompanying the mind elations,<BR>
Not having understood these thoughts of the mind,<BR>
The unsteady mind runs here and there.</P>
<P>Having understood these thoughts of the mind, <BR>
He who is ardent, mindful, restrains them.<BR>
(Also) what has not arisen in the mind elations -<BR>
An Awakened one has given these up completely.&ucirc;</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="four2"></A>2: The Discourse about Agitation</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</B><P>Thus I heard:</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>at one time the Auspicious One was dwelling near Kusin&agrave;r&agrave;, in the Mallas' S&agrave;l Wood at Upavattana. Then at that time many monks were dwelling in a little forest hut not far from the Auspicious One, agitated, arrogant, fickle, garrulous, of loose speech, unmindful, not knowing, uncomposed, with minds very unsteady, and with faculties uncontrolled.</P>
<P>The Auspicious One saw those many monks dwelling in a little forest hut not far away, agitated, arrogant, fickle, garrulous, of loose speech, unmindful, not knowing, uncomposed, with minds very unsteady, and with faculties uncontrolled.</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Through unprotected body,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through attainment of wrong view,<BR>
Through being overcome by sloth and torpor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one comes under the power of M&agrave;ra.</P>
<P>Therefore one should be of protected mind,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one who moves around in right thought,<BR>
Devoted to right view,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having come to know rise and fall.<BR>
The monk who overcomes sloth and torpor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will give up all bad destinies.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="four3"></A>3: The Discourse about the Cowherd</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</B><P>Thus I heard:</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>at one time the Auspicious One was walking on walking tour in Kosala, together with a great Community of monks. Then the Auspicious One, having gone down from the road, went to the root of a certain tree, and after going, he sat down on the prepared seat. </P>
<P>Then a certain cowherd went to the Auspicious One, and after going and worshipping the Auspicious One, he sat down on one side. While that cowherd was sitting on one side the Auspicious One instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered with a Dhamma talk. Then that cowherd, having been instructed, roused, enthused, and cheered by the Auspicious One with a Dhamma talk, said to the Auspicious One: &szlig;Please consent to me, reverend Sir, (giving) a meal on the morrow to the Auspicious One, together with the Community of monks.&ucirc;</P>
<P>The Auspicious One consented by maintaining silence. Then that cowherd, having understood the Auspicious One's consent, after rising from his seat, worshipping and circumambulating the Auspicious One, went away.</P>
<P>Then with the passing of that night, that cowherd, in his own residence, having had an abundance of rich milk-rice and fresh ghee made ready, and announced the time to the Auspicious One, (saying): &szlig;It is time, reverend Sir, the meal is ready.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, together with the Community of monks, went to the residence of that cowherd, and after going, he sat down on the prepared seat.</P>
<P>Then that cowherd with his own hand, served and satisfied the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head with an abundance of rich milk-rice and fresh ghee. Then that cowherd, when the Auspicious One had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, having taken a low seat, sat down on one side. While sat on one side the Auspicious One, after instructing, rousing, enthusing, and cheering that cowherd with a Dhamma talk, having risen from the seat, went away. Then not long after the Auspicious One had gone, while between the boundaries (of the villages), a certain man deprived that cowherd of life.</P>
<P>Then many monks went to the Auspicious One, and after going and worshipping the Auspicious One, sat down one one side. While sat on one side those monks said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;That cowherd, reverend Sir, who today with his own hand served and satisfied the Community of monks with the Buddha at its head, with rich milk-rice and fresh ghee, that cowherd it seems, reverend Sir, while between the boundaries (of the villages), was deprived of life by a certain man.</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Whatever an enemy might do to an enemy,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or a foe to a foe,<BR>
A wrongly directed mind&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may do (more) bad to him than that.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="four4"></A>4: The Discourse about Moonlight</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</B><P>Thus I heard:</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>at one time the Auspicious One was dwelling near R&agrave;jagaha, at the Squirrel's Feeding Place in Bamboo Wood. Then at that time venerable S&agrave;riputta and venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na were living at the Pigeon Vale. Then at that time venerable S&agrave;riputta, on a moonlight night, with his hair freshly shaved off, was sitting in the open air, having attained a certain concentration. </P>
<P>Then at that time two yakkha friends were going from the Northern region to the Southern region, with some business or other. Those yakkhas saw venerable S&agrave;riputta, on (that) moonlight night, with his hair freshly shaved off, sat in the open air. And after seeing (him), one of those yakkhas said this to the second yakkha: &szlig;It occurs to me, friend, to give a blow on this ascetic's head.&ucirc;</P>
<P>When that was said, the yakkha said this to that yakkha: &szlig;Enough, friend, don't strike the ascetic. Eminent is the ascetic, friend, of great power, of great majesty.&ucirc;</P>
<P>For a second time one of those yakkhas said this to the second yakkha: &szlig;It occurs to me, friend, to give a blow on this ascetic's head.&ucirc;</P>
<P>For a second time the yakkha said this to that yakkha: &szlig;Enough, friend, don't strike the ascetic. Eminent is the ascetic, friend, of great power, of great majesty.&ucirc;</P>
<P>For a third time one of those yakkhas said this to the second yakkha: &szlig;It occurs to me, friend, to give a blow on this ascetic's head.&ucirc;</P>
<P>For a third time the yakkha said this to that yakkha: &szlig;Enough, friend, don't strike the ascetic. Eminent is the ascetic, friend, of great power, of great majesty.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then the yakkha taking no notice of that (other) yakkha, gave a blow on the elder venerable S&agrave;riputta's head: it was such a great blow that with that blow a seven, or seven and a half cubit N&agrave;ga (elephant) might have been felled, or a great mountain top might have been burst open. Then that yakkha (calling out): &szlig;I'm burning, I'm burning&ucirc;  right there (and then) fell into the Great Hell.</P>
<P>Venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na saw with his divine-eye, which is purified, and surpasses that of men, that yakkha giving a blow on venerable S&agrave;riputta's head. And after seeing (it), he went to venerable S&agrave;riputt&agrave;, and after going, he said this to venerable S&agrave;riputta: &szlig;Can you bear up, venerable friend? Can you carry on? Do you have any pain?&ucirc; &szlig;I can bear up, friend Moggall&agrave;na; I can carry on, friend Moggall&agrave;na, but I have a little pain on my head.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Wonderful, friend S&agrave;riputta, marvellous, friend S&agrave;riputta, such is the venerable S&agrave;riputta's great power and great majesty. Here, friend S&agrave;riputta, a certain yakkha gave a blow on your head: it was such a great blow, that with that blow a seven, or seven and a half cubit N&agrave;ga (elephant) might have been felled, or a great mountain top might have been burst open. But then venerable S&agrave;riputta said this: `I can bear up, friend Moggall&agrave;na; I can carry on, friend Moggall&agrave;na, but I have a little pain on my head.' &ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Wonderful, friend Moggall&agrave;na, marvellous, friend Moggall&agrave;na, such is the venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na's great power and great majesty, in as much as he can even see a yakkha, whereas we at present do not even see a mud-demon!&ucirc;</P>
<P>The Auspicious One heard with his divine ear-element, which is purified, and surpasses that of men, the fitting talk and conversation of these two Great N&agrave;gas.</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, having understood the significance of it on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;For he whose mind is like a rock,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;steady, and not wavering,<BR>
Unexcited by what is exciting,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not agitated by what is agitating,<BR>
For he whose mind is developed thus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from where will pain come upon him?&ucirc;</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="four5"></A>5: The Discourse about the N&agrave;ga (Elephant)</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</B><P>Thus I heard:</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>at one time the Auspicious One was dwelling near Kosamb&atilde;, in Ghosita's Monastery. Then at that time the Auspicious One was living beset by monks, and nuns, and male lay followers, and female lay followers, and kings, and king's ministers, and sectarians, and sectarians' disciples, he lived beset, pained, and uncomfortably.</P>
<P>Then it occured to the Auspicious One: &szlig;At present I am living beset by monks, and nuns, and male lay followers, and female lay followers, and kings, and king's ministers, and sectarians, and sectarians' disciples, I am living beset, pained, and uncomfortably. Well now, I could dwell solitary, secluded from the group.&ucirc; </P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, entered Kosamb&atilde; for alms. After walking for alms in Kosamb&atilde;, when he had returned from the alms-round after the meal, after putting the dwelling place in order by himself, picking up his robe and bowl, without having addressed his attendants, without having taken leave of the Community of monks, solitary, without a companion, went away on a walk towards P&agrave;rileyyaka. While walking gradually on walking tour he arrived at P&agrave;rileyyaka.</P>
<P>There the Auspicious One dwelt near P&agrave;rileyyaka, in the Protected Jungle, at the root of the auspicious S&agrave;l-tree. Now also a certain N&agrave;ga elephant was living beset by male elephants, by female elephants, by young elephants, by baby elephants. He ate grass that had the tips broken off, while they ate what he had broken down from the branches. He drank water that had been disturbed, and when he arose from his bathing place female elephants proceded to jostle him with their bodies, he lived beset, pained, and uncomfortably.</P>
<P>Then it occurred to that N&agrave;ga elephant: At present I am living beset by male elephants, by female elephants, by young elephants, by baby elephants. I eat grass that has the tips broken off, while they eat what I have broken down from the branches. I drink water that has been disturbed, and when I arise from my bathing place female elephants procede to jostle me with their bodies, I am living beset, pained, and uncomfortably. Well now, I could dwell solitary, secluded from the group.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then that N&agrave;ga elephant, having gone away from the herd, went to P&agrave;rileyyaka, the Protected Jungle, the root of the auspicious S&agrave;l-tree, and to the Auspicious One. There, in that place where the Auspicious One dwelt, that N&agrave;ga elephant cleared that place of grass, and with his trunk provided the Auspicious One with drinking water and washing water.</P>
<P>Then when the Auspicious One had gone into hiding, into seclusion, this reflection arose in his mind: &szlig;Formerly, I was living beset by monks, and nuns, and male lay followers, and female lay followers, and kings, and king's ministers, and sectarians, and sectarians' disciples, I was living beset, unhappy, and uncomfortably. However at present I am living unbeset by monks, and nuns, and male lay followers, and female lay followers, and kings, and king's ministers, and sectarians, and sectarians' disciples, I am living unbeset, happily, and comfortably.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Also to that N&agrave;ga elephant this reflection arose in his mind: &szlig;Formerly I was living beset by male elephants, by female elephants, by young elephants, by baby elephants. I ate grass that had the tips broken off, while they ate what I had broken down from the branches. I drank water that has been disturbed, and when I arose from my bathing place female elephants proceded to jostle me with their bodies, I was living beset, pained, uncomfortably. However at present I am living unbeset by male elephants, by female elephants, by young elephants, by baby elephants. I eat the unbroken tips of grass, while they do not eat what I have broken down from the branches. I drink water that has not been disturbed, and when I arise from my bathing place female elephants do not proceed to jostle me with their bodies, I am living unbeset, happily, and comfortably.&ucirc;</P>
<P><A NAME="four5ud"></A>Then the Auspicious One, having understood his own seclusion, and knowing the reflection that had arisen in that N&agrave;ga elephant's mind, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;This pole-toothed N&agrave;ga elephant's mind agrees <BR>
with the (Buddha) N&agrave;ga's mind:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that (a N&agrave;ga) delights in being solitary in the wood.&ucirc;</P>

<P>at one time the Auspicious One was dwelling near S&agrave;vatth&atilde;, at An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika's monastery in Jeta's Wood. Then at that time the Auspicious One was venerated, respected, revered, honoured, esteemed, and in receipt of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal requisites to help when sick; also the Community of monks were venerated, respected, revered, honoured, esteemed, and in receipt of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal requisites to help when sick.</P>
<P>But wanderers from other sects were not venerated, not respected, not revered, not honoured, not esteemed, nor were they in receipt of robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal requisites to help when sick. Then those wanderers from other sects being unable to bear the veneration of the Auspicious One and the Community of monks, went to the female wanderer Sundar&atilde; (`Beautiful'), and after going, they said this to the female wanderer Sundar&atilde;: &szlig;Sister, what would you venture to do for your kinsmens' welfare?&ucirc; </P>
<P>&szlig;What can I do, Masters, what am I unable to do? I have given up my life for my kinsmens' welfare.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Then, sister, you must frequently go to Jeta's Wood.&ucirc; </P>
<P>&szlig;Yes, Masters&ucirc;, said the female wanderer Sundar&atilde;, and after replying to those wanderers from other sects, she frequently went to Jeta's Wood. When those wanderers from other sects knew: &szlig;The female wanderer has been seen by many people frequently going to Jeta's Wood&ucirc;, then having deprived her of life, and buried her into a trench-pit right there in Jeta's Wood, they went to the Kosalan King Pasenadi, and after going, they said this to the Kosalan King Pasenadi: &szlig; Great King, we no longer see the female wanderer Sundar&atilde;.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;But where do you suspect (she is)?&ucirc; &szlig;In Jeta's Wood, Great King.&ucirc; &szlig;Then you must search Jeta's Wood.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then those wanderers from other sects after searching Jeta's Wood, lifting (the body) up from the trench-pit where it had been buried, putting it on a bier, and entering S&agrave;vatth&atilde;, going from road to road, from cross-roads to cross-roads, made people find fault, (saying): &szlig;See, Masters, what the Sakyan ascetics have done, shameless are these Sakyan ascetics, lacking in virtue, of bad character, speakers of what is false, not living the spiritual life. But they will claim that they live by Dhamma, live in peace, live spiritually, speak the truth, are virtuous, and are of good character. They have no asceticism, they have no spirituality, their asceticism has perished, their spirituality has perished. Where is their asceticism? Where is their spirituality? They have gone away from asceticism, they have gone away from sprituality. For what man, having done what a man can do, would deprive a woman of life?&ucirc;</P>
<P>That at that time, the people in S&agrave;vatth&atilde;, after seeing the monks, scolded, abused, annoyed, and troubled them with vulgar and rough words, (saying): &szlig;Shameless are these Sakyan ascetics, lacking in virtue, of bad character, speakers of what is false, not living the spiritual life. But they will claim that they live by Dhamma, live in peace, live spiritually, speak the truth, are virtuous, and are of good character. They have no asceticism, they have no spirituality, their asceticism has perished, their spirituality has perished. Where is their asceticism? Where is their spirituality? They have gone away from asceticism, they have gone away from sprituality. For what man, having done what a man can do, would deprive a woman of life?&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then many monks, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up their bowls and robes, entered S&agrave;vatth&atilde; for alms, and after walking for alms in S&agrave;vatth&atilde;, while returning from the alms-round after the meal, went to the Auspicious One, and after going and worshipping the Auspicious One, they sat down on one side. While sat on one side those monks said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;At present, reverend Sir, the people in S&agrave;vatth&atilde;, after seeing the monks, scold, abuse, annoy, and trouble them with vulgar and rough words, (saying): `Shameless are these Sakyan ascetics, lacking in virtue, of bad character, speakers of what is false, not living the spiritual life. But they will claim that they live by Dhamma, live in peace, live spiritually, speak the truth, are virtuous, and are of good character. They have no asceticism, they have no spirituality, their asceticism has perished, their spirituality has perished. Where is their asceticism? Where is their spirituality? They have gone away from asceticism, they have gone away from sprituality. For what man, having done what a man can do, would deprive a woman of life?' &ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;This noise will not last long, monks, it will last for only seven days, and with the passing of seven days it will vanish. So, monks, when those people, after seeing the monks, scold, abuse, annoy, and trouble them with vulgar and rough words, you should reprove them with this verse:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P><A NAME="four8v"></A>`He who speaks what is untrue goes to the nether regions,<BR>
Also he who says `I did not do' what he has done,<BR>
Both of those men who have performed base deeds<BR>
Are the same when they have passed away, in the other world.' &ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Then those monks, having mastered that verse in the presence of the Auspicious One, when those people, after seeing the monks, scolded, abused, annoyed, and troubled them with vulgar and rough words, reproved them with this verse:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;He who speaks what is untrue goes to the nether regions,<BR>
Also he who says `I did not do' what he has done,<BR>
Both of those men who have performed base deeds<BR>
Are the same when they have passed away to the other world.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Then this occurred to those people: &szlig;These Sakyan ascetics are not the doers, this wasn't done by them, these Sakyan ascetics are asserting (the truth).&ucirc; That noise did not last long, it only lasted for seven days, and with the passing of seven days it vanished.</P>
<P>Then many monks went to the Auspicious One, and after going and worshipping the Auspicious One, they sat down on one side. While sat on one side those monks said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;It is wonderful, reverend Sir, it is marvellous, reverend Sir, how well spoken that was, reverend Sir, by the Auspicious One: `This noise will not last long, monks, it will last for only seven days, and with the passing of seven days it will vanish.' That noise, reverend Sir, has vanished.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Unrestrained the people pierce (others) with words,<BR>
Like (they pierce) an elephant with arrows in a battle,<BR>
(But) having heard that rough speech broadcast around,<BR>
A monk should bear it with an uncorrupt mind.&ucirc;</P>

<DIR>

</B><P>Thus I heard:</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>at one time the Auspicious One was dwelling near R&agrave;jagaha, at the Squirrel's Feeding Place in Bamboo Wood. Then when venerable Upasena Va&iuml;gantaputta had gone into hiding, into seclusion, this reflection arose in his mind: &szlig;There are certainly gains for me, it is certainly a good gain for me, that my teacher is the Auspicious One, the Worthy One, the Perfect Sambuddha, and that I have gone forth from the home to homelessness in such a well explained Dhamma and Discipline, and that my companions in the spiritual life are virtuous, of good character, and that I have fulfilled the virtuous (precepts), and that I am composed, and that my mind is one pointed, and that I am a Worthy One, pollutant-free, and that I am of great power, of great majesty. My life has been fortunate, and my death (will be) fortunate.&ucirc;</P>
<P><A NAME="four9ud"></A>Then the Auspicious One, knowing the reflection that had arisen in venerable Upasena Va&iuml;gantaputta's mind, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance: </P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;He whom life does not torment,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who does not grieve at the end in death,<BR>
If that firm one is one who has seen the state (of peace),&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the midst of grief he does not grieve.</P>
<P>For the monk who has cut off the craving for continuity, whose mind is at peace,<BR>
Having totally destroyed the round of births,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for him there is no continuation in existence.&ucirc;</P></DIR>

<P>The Auspicious One saw that venerable S&agrave;riputta was sitting not far away, after folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, and was reflecting on his own peacefulness.</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</P><DIR>
