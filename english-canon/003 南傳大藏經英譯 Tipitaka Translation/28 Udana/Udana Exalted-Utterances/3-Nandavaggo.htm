<P>at one time the Auspicious One was dwelling near S&agrave;vatth&atilde;, at An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika's monastery in Jeta's Wood.

<P>The Auspicious One saw that monk sitting not far away, who after folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, and was bearing painful, sharp, harsh, and severe feelings, that had arisen as a result of former (unwholesome) deeds, <A NAME="three1ud"></A>mindfully, with clear knowledge, without being troubled.</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</P><DIR>

</B><P>Thus I heard:</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>at one time the Auspicious One was dwelling near S&agrave;vatth&atilde;, at An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika's monastery in Jeta's Wood. Then at that time venerable Nanda, the Auspicious One's brother, his mother's sister's son, confessed this to many monks: &szlig;I have no great delight, venerable friends, living the spiritual life, I am not able to endure the spiritual life,<A NAME="Text_3"></A> having disavowed the training, I will return to what is inferior.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then a certain monk went to the Auspicious One, and after going and worshipping the Auspicious One, he sat down on one side. While sat on one side that monk said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;Venerable Nanda, reverend Sir, the Auspicious One's brother, his mother's sister's son, confesses this to many monks: `I have no great delight, venerable friends, living the spiritual life, I am not able to endure the spiritual life, having disavowed the training, I will return to what is inferior.' &ucirc;</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One addressed a certain monk, (saying): &szlig;Please go, monk, and with my word address the monk Nanda, (saying): `The Teacher, venerable friend Nanda, calls you.' &ucirc; &szlig;Yes, reverend Sir,&ucirc; said that monk, and after replying to the Auspicious One, he went to venerable Nanda, and after going, he said this to venerable Nanda: &szlig;The Teacher, venerable friend Nanda, calls you.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Yes, venerable friend,&ucirc; said venerable Nanda, and after replying to that monk, he went to the Auspicious One, after going and worshipping the Auspicious One, he sat down on one side. </P>
<P>While sat on one side, the Auspicious One said this to venerable Nanda: &szlig;Is it true, as it seems, Nanda, that you confessed this to many monks, (saying): &szlig;I have no great delight, venerable friends, living the spiritual life, I am not able to endure the spiritual life, having disavowed the training, I will return to what is inferior.' &ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Yes, reverend Sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;But why do you, Nanda, have no great delight living the spiritual life, are not able to endure the spiritual life, and having disavowed the training, will return to what is inferior?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;As I was leaving from home, reverend Sir, a Sakyan girl, the most beautiful woman in the country, with her hair half-combed, having looked round, said this to me: `Master, may you quickly return.' Remembering that, reverend Sir, I have no great delight living the spiritual life, I am not able to endure the spiritual life, and having disavowed the training, I will return to what is inferior.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, having taken venerable Nanda by the arm, just as a strong man might stretch out a bent arm, or bend in an outstretched arm, in the same way did he disappear from Jeta's Wood, and reappear amongst the T&agrave;vati&uuml;sa devas. Then at that time five hundred celestial dove-footed nymphs had come to attend to Sakka, the lord of the devas. Then the Auspicious One addressed venerable Nanda, (saying): &szlig;Do you see, Nanda, these five hundred celestial dove-footed nymphs?&ucirc; </P>
<P>&szlig;Yes, reverend Sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;What do you think about this, Nanda, who has the most perfect form, is the most fair to behold, is the most pleasing, the Sakyan girl, the most beautiful woman in the country, or these five hundred celestial dove-footed nymphs?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Like a disfigured monkey, reverend Sir, with its ears and nose cut off, so is the Sakyan girl, reverend Sir, the most beautiful woman in the country, compared with these five hundred celestial nymphs she does not count, she is not even a fraction, she is not even half a fraction, she is not even to be compared! These five hundred celestial nymphs certainly have the more perfect form, are the more fair to behold, are the more pleasing.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Take delight, Nanda! Take delight, Nanda! I am your surety for gaining five hundred celestial dove-footed nymphs!&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;If, reverend Sir, the Auspicious One is my surety for gaining five hundred celestial dove-footed nymphs, I will take great delight, reverend Sir, in (living) the spiritual life under the Auspicious One.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, having taken venerable Nanda by the arm, just as a strong man might stretch out a bent arm, or bend in an outstretched arm, in the same way did they disappear from amongst the T&agrave;vati&uuml;sa devas, and reappear in Jeta's Wood. </P>
<P>The monks heard: &szlig;Venerable Nanda, it seems, the Auspicious One's brother, his mother's sister's son, is living the spiritual life for the sake of celestial nymphs, the Auspicious One, it seems, it his surety for gaining five hundred celestial dove-footed nymphs!&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then venerable Nanda's monk friends talked to venerable Nanda with words about a hireling, with words about a lackey, (saying): &szlig;It seems venerable Nanda is a hireling, it seems venerable Nanda is a lackey, he is living the spiritual life for the sake of celestial nymphs, the Auspicious One, it seems, is his surety for gaining five hundred celestial dove-footed nymphs!&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then venerable Nanda, at his monk-friends' words about a hireling, words about a lackey, was distressed, ashamed, and disgusted, and while dwelling solitary, secluded, heedful, ardent, and resolute, after no long time (attained) that good for which sons of good family rightly go forth from the home to homelessness, that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life, and dwelt having known, having experienced, and having attained (nibb&agrave;na) himself in this very life:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Destroyed is birth<BR>
accomplished is the spiritual life<BR>
done is what ought to be done<BR>
there is no more of this mundane state&ucirc; - this he knew.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>And venerable Nanda became another of the Worthy Ones. Then a certain devat&agrave;, when the night had passed, having lit up the whole of Jeta's Wood with his surpassing beauty, went to the Auspicious One, and after going and worshipping the Auspicious One, he stood on one side. While standing on one side that devat&agrave; said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;Venerable Nanda, reverend Sir, the Auspicious One's brother, his mother's sister's son, through the destruction of the pollutants, without pollutants, freed in mind, freed through wisdom, he dwells having known, having experienced, and having attained (nibb&agrave;na) himself in this very life.&ucirc;</P>
<P>And this knowledge arose to the Auspicious One: &szlig;Nanda, through the destruction of the pollutants, without pollutants, freed in mind, freed through wisdom, dwells having known, having experienced, and having attained (nibb&agrave;na) himself in this very life.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then venerable Nanda, when that night had passed, went to the Auspicious One, and after going and worshipping the Auspicious One, he sat down on one side. While sat on one side venerable Nanda said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;That, reverend Sir, for which the Auspicious One was my surety - for gaining five hundred celestial dove-footed nymphs - I free the Auspicious One, reverend Sir, from that promise.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Nanda, having encompassed your mind fully with my mind, and understood: `Nanda, through the destruction of the pollutants, without pollutants, freed in mind, freed through wisdom, dwells having known, having experienced, and having attained (nibb&agrave;na) himself in this very life.'</P>
<P>Also a devat&agrave; announced that matter to me, (saying): `Venerable Nanda, reverend Sir, the Auspicious One's brother, his mother's sister's son, through the destruction of the pollutants, without pollutants, freed in mind, freed through wisdom, dwells having known, having experienced, and having attained (nibb&agrave;na) himself in this very life.' When, Nanda, your mind was freed from the pollutants without attachment, then I was freed from that promise.&ucirc; </P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;For the one who has got out of the quagmire,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who has crushed the thorn of sense desire,<BR>
Who has arrived at the destruction of delusion,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that monk does not shake in regard to pleasure and pain.&ucirc;</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="three3"></A>3: The Discourse about Yasoja</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</B><P>Thus I heard:</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>at one time the Auspicious One was dwelling near S&agrave;vatth&atilde;, at An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika's monastery in Jeta's Wood. Then at that time five hundred monks with Yasoja at their head had arrived in S&agrave;vatth&atilde;, to see the Auspicious One. Then those visiting monks while exchanging greetings with the resident monks, having the dwelling places assigned, putting the bowls and robes in order, made a loud noise, a great noise. </P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One addressed venerable &acirc;nanda, (saying): &szlig;Who are these (making) a loud noise, a great noise? One would think it is fishermen with their haul of fish!&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;These, reverend Sir, are five hundred monks with Yasoja at their head, who have arrived at S&agrave;vatth&atilde; to see the Auspicious One. These visiting monks while exchanging greetings with the resident monks, having the dwelling places assigned, putting the bowls and robes in order, (make) a loud noise, a great noise.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Now then, &acirc;nanda, with my word address those monks, (saying): `The Teacher calls the venerable ones.' &ucirc; &szlig;Yes, reverend Sir,&ucirc; said venerable &acirc;nanda, and after replying to the Auspicious One, he went to those monks, and after going, he said this to those monks: &szlig;The Teacher calls the venerable ones.&ucirc; &szlig;Yes, friend,&ucirc; said those monks, and after replying to venerable &acirc;nanda, they went to the Auspicious One, and after going and worshipping the Auspicious One, they sat down on one side. </P>
<P>While sat on one side the Auspicious One said this to those bhikkhus: &szlig;Why, monks, are you (making) a loud noise, a great noise, so one would think it is fishermen with their haul of fish?&ucirc; </P>
<P>After that was said, Yasoja said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;These, reverend Sir, are five hundred monks who have arrived at S&agrave;vatth&atilde; to see the Auspicious One. These visiting monks while exchanging greetings with the resident monks, having the dwelling places assigned, putting the bowls and robes in order, (make) a loud noise, a great noise.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Please go, monks, I am dismissing you. You should not live in my presence.&ucirc;</P>
<P><A NAME="Text_16"></A>&szlig;Yes, reverend Sir,&ucirc; said those monks, and after replying to the Auspicious One, rising from their seats, worshipping and circumambulating the Auspicious One, putting their dwelling places in order, picking up their robes and bowls, they went on walking tour towards Vajji. While walking gradually through Vajji on walking tour they went to the river Vaggumud&agrave;, and after going and making leaf-huts on the bank of the river Vaggumud&agrave;, they entered upon the Rains Retreat. Then venerable Yasoja, having entered upon the Rains Retreat, addressed those monks (saying): &szlig;We were dismissed, friends, by the Auspicious One, who desires our welfare, who seeks our benefit, who is compassionate, out of compassion (for us). Well now, venerable friends, we must live in such a way that the Auspicious One will be pleased with our living.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Yes, friend,&ucirc; those monks replied to venerable Yasoja. Then those monks while dwelling secluded, heedful, ardent, and resolute, within the Rains Retreat all realized the three deep understandings.</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, having dwelt at S&agrave;vatth&atilde; for as long as he wished, went on walking tour towards Ves&agrave;l&atilde;, </FONT>&nbsp; <FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#000080">and while walking gradually on walking tour he arrived at Ves&agrave;l&atilde;. There the Auspicious One dwelt near Ves&agrave;l&atilde;, in the Gabled Hall in the Great Wood. Then the Auspicious One, having applied his mind, and with his mind fully encompassed the minds of the monks on the bank of the Vaggumud&agrave;, addressed venerable &acirc;nanda, (saying): &szlig;It is as though something light has arisen for me, &acirc;nanda, in this direction. It is as though something splendid has arisen for me, &acirc;nanda, in this direction. To go to that direction where the monks on the bank of the Vaggumud&agrave; dwell and to apply my mind is not disagreeable. </P>
<P>Please send, &acirc;nanda, a messenger into the presence of the monks on the bank of the Vaggumud&agrave;, (to say): `The Teacher, venerable friends, calls you, the Teacher desires to see the venerable ones.' &ucirc; &szlig;Yes, reverend Sir,&ucirc; said venerable &acirc;nanda, and after replying to the Auspicious One, he went to a certain monk, and after going, he said this to that monk: &szlig;Come, venerable friend, you should go to the monks on the bank of the Vaggumud&agrave;, and after going, please say this to the monks on the bank of the Vaggumud&agrave;: `The Teacher, venerable friends, calls you, the Teacher desires to see the venerable ones.' &ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Yes, friend,&ucirc; said that monk, and after replying to venerable &acirc;nanda, <A NAME="balava"></A>just as a strong man might stretch out a bent arm, or bend in an outstretched arm, in the same way did he disappear from the Gabled Hall in Great Wood, and reappear in front of those monks on the bank of the river Vaggumud&agrave;. Then that monk said this to the monks on the bank of the Vaggumud&agrave;: &szlig;The Teacher, venerable friends, calls you, the Teacher desires to see the venerable ones.&ucirc; </P>
<P>&szlig;Yes, friend,&ucirc; said those monks, and after replying to that monk, setting their dwelling places in order, and picking up their bowls and robes, just as a strong man might stretch out a bent arm, or bend in an outstretched arm, in the same way did they disappear from the bank of the river Vaggumud&agrave;, and reappear in front of the Auspicious One in the Gabled Hall in Great Wood.</P>
<P>Then at that time the Auspicious One was sitting in imperturbable concentration. Then it occured to those monks: &szlig;Now in what state is the Auspicious One dwelling at the present time?&ucirc; Then it occured to those monks: &szlig;The Auspicious One is dwelling in a state of imperturbability at the present time,&ucirc; and they all sat in imperturbable concentration.</P>
<P>Then venerable &acirc;nanda, when the night had passed, when the first watch of the night had gone, after rising from his seat, arranging his robe on one shoulder, and raising his hands in respectful salutation, said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;The night has passed, reverend Sir, the first watch of the night has gone, for a long time (these) visiting monks have been sitting, let the Auspicious One exchange greetings, reverend Sir, with the visiting monks.&ucirc; When that was said, the Auspicious One was silent.</P>
<P>For a second time venerable &acirc;nanda, when the night had passed, when the middle watch of the night had gone, after rising from his seat, arranging his robe on one shoulder, and raising his hands in respectful salutation, said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;The night has passed, reverend Sir, the middle watch of the night has gone, for a long time (these) visiting monks have been sitting, let the Auspicious One exchange greetings, reverend Sir, with the visiting monks.&ucirc; For a second time the Auspicious One was silent.</P>
<P>For a third time venerable &acirc;nanda, when the night had passed, when the last watch of the night had gone, when dawn had risen, when the night had a joyful appearance, after rising from his seat, arranging his robe on one shoulder, and raising his hands in respectful salutation, said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;The night has passed, reverend Sir, the last watch of the night has gone, dawn has risen, the night has a joyful appearance, for a long time (these) visiting monks have been sitting, let the Auspicious One exchange greetings, reverend Sir, with the visiting monks.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, after rising from that concentration, addressed venerable &acirc;nanda, (saying): &szlig;If you knew, &acirc;nanda, you would not say even this much about them. I and these five hundred monks, &acirc;nanda, have all been sat in imperturbable concentration.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;For the one who is victorious over the thorn of sense desire,<BR>
Scolding, slaying, and (other) bonds,<BR>

While sat on one side those monks said this to the Auspicious One: &szlig;Venerable Pilindivaccha, reverend Sir, talks to monks with words of contempt.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One addressed a certain monk, (saying): &szlig;Please go, monk, and with my word address the monk Pilindivaccha, (saying): `The Teacher, friend Pilindivaccha, calls you.' &ucirc; &szlig;Yes, reverend Sir,&ucirc; said that monk, and after replying to the Auspicious One, he went to venerable Pilindivaccha, and after going, he said this to venerable Pilindivaccha: &szlig;The Teacher, venerable friend, calls you.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Yes, friend,&ucirc; said venerable Pilindivaccha, and after replying to that monk, he went to the Auspicious One, after going and worshipping the Auspicious One, he sat down on one side.

<P>&szlig;Yes, reverend Sir.&ucirc; </P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, after applying his mind to venerable Pilindivaccha's previous lives, addressed the monks, (saying): &szlig;You should not be offended, monks, at the monk Vaccha, it is not with hatred on the inside, monks, that Vaccha talks to the monks with words of contempt. For the monk Vaccha, monks, for five hundred lives has been reborn in a br&agrave;hma&otilde;a family without interruption, for a long time he has been one who has talked to (others) with words of contempt, because of this Vaccha talks to the monks with words of contempt.&ucirc;</P>

<P>at one time the Auspicious One was dwelling near R&agrave;jagaha, at the Squirrel's Feeding Place in Bamboo Wood. Then at that time venerable Mah&agrave;kassapa was dwelling in the Pepper Cave, and was sitting in one cross-legged posture for seven days, having attained a certain concentration. Then venerable Mah&agrave;kassapa, with the passing of those seven days arose from that concentration. Then it occured to venerable Mah&agrave;kassapa after arising from that concentration: &szlig;Well now, I should enter R&agrave;jagaha for alms.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then at that time five hundred devat&agrave;s were ready and eager to offer almsfood to venerable Mah&agrave;kassapa. But venerable Mah&agrave;kassapa, after refusing those five hundred devat&agrave;s, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, entered R&agrave;jagaha for alms.</P>
<P>Then at that time the lord of the devas Sakka, having a desire to give almsfood to venerable Mah&agrave;kassapa, having created the appearance of a weaver (for himself), was weaving thread while the Asura maiden Suj&agrave; was filling the shuttle.</P>
<P>Then venerable Mah&agrave;kassapa, while walking systematically for alms in R&agrave;jagaha, went to the residence of the lord of the devas Sakka. The lord of the devas Sakka saw venerable Mah&agrave;kassapa coming while still far away. After seeing (him), leaving the house, going to meet (him), taking the bowl from his hand, entering the house, taking up the rice from the pot, and filling the bowl, he gave it to venerable Mah&agrave;kassapa, and that almsfood had many sauces, many curries, many sauces and tasty curries.</P>
<P>Then this occured to venerable Mah&agrave;kassapa: &szlig;Now who is this being, who has such power and majesty?&ucirc; Then it occured to venerable Mah&agrave;kassapa: &szlig;This is the lord of the devas Sakka.&ucirc; Having understood it was so, he said this to the lord of the devas Sakka: &szlig;This is your doing, Kosiya, you must not do such a thing again.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;We also have a need for merit, reverend Kassapa, we also have a duty to make merit.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then the lord of the devas Sakka after worshipping and circumambulating venerable Mah&agrave;kassapa, after going up into the sky, while in the air, in the firmament, three times uttered an exalted utterance:</P><DIR>

Then at that time, amongst many monks, after returning from the alms-round after the meal, assembling together, and sitting in the Kareri Round Hall, this conversation arose: &szlig;An alms-gathering monk, venerable friends, while walking for alms gets the opportunity from time to time to see appealing forms with the eye; gets the opportunity from time to time to hear appealing sounds with the ear; gets the opportunity from time to time to smell appealing smells with the nose; gets the opportunity from time to time to taste appealing flavours with the tongue; gets the opportunity from time to time to touch appealing tangibles with the body. An alms-gathering monk, venerable friends, walking for alms is venerated, respected, revered, honoured, and esteemed.</P>
<P>Now, venerable friends, we too should be alms-gatherers, and we also will get the opportunity from time to time to see appealing forms with the eye; and we also will get the opportunity from time to time to hear appealing sounds with the ear; and we also will get the opportunity from time to time to smell appealing smells with the nose; and we also will get the opportunity from time to time to taste appealing flavours with the tongue; and we also will get the opportunity from time to time to touch appealing tangibles with the body; and we also will walk for alms being venerated, respected, revered, honoured, and esteemed.&ucirc; Now this conversation that arose amongst those monks was left unfinished.</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, having risen from seclusion in the evening time, went to the Kareri Round Hall, and after going, he sat down on the prepared seat. Having sat down the Auspicious One addressed the monks, (saying): &szlig;What was the talk about, monks, that those who are sitting here at present (were having), and what was the conversation that you left unfinished?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Here, reverend Sir, after returning from the alms-round after the meal, assembling together, and sitting in the Kareri Round Hall, this conversation arose: `An alms-gathering monk, venerable friends, while walking for alms gets the opportunity from time to time to see appealing forms with the eye; gets the opportunity from time to time to hear appealing sounds with the ear; gets the opportunity from time to time to smell appealing smells with the nose; gets the opportunity from time to time to taste appealing flavours with the tongue; gets the opportunity from time to time to touch appealing tangibles with the body.

This was the conversation, reverend Sir, that was left unfinished, then the Auspicious One arrived.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;This is certainly not suitable, monks, for you sons of good family who have gone forth from the home to homelessness, that you should talk such talk. When you have assembled together, monks, there are two things that ought to be done: talk about the Dhamma, or maintain noble silence.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;The devas envy the alms-gathering monk,<BR>
Self-supporting, not nourishing another,<BR>
Such a one -<BR>
But not if [he is] dependent on becoming famous.&ucirc;</P>

<P>at one time the Auspicious One was dwelling near S&agrave;vatth&atilde;, at An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika's monastery in Jeta's Wood. Then at that time, amongst many monks, after returning from the alms-round after the meal, assembling together, and sitting in the Round Hall, and this conversation arose: &szlig;Now who, venerable friends, knows a craft? Who has trained in what craft? Which craft is the greatest of the crafts?&ucirc; Then some said this: &szlig;Elephant-craft is the greatest of the crafts,&ucirc; some said this: &szlig;Horse-craft is the greatest of the crafts,&ucirc; some said this: &szlig;Chariot-craft is the greatest of the crafts,&ucirc; some said this: &szlig;Bow-craft is the greatest of the crafts,&ucirc; some said this: &szlig;Sword-craft is the greatest of the crafts,&ucirc; some said this: &szlig;Finger-calculation-craft is the greatest of the crafts,&ucirc; some said this: &szlig;Abacus-craft is the greatest of the crafts,&ucirc; some said this: &szlig;Accountancy-craft is the greatest of the crafts,&ucirc; some said this: &szlig;Writing-craft is the greatest of the crafts,&ucirc; some said this: &szlig;Poetry-craft is the greatest of the crafts,&ucirc; some said this: &szlig;Natural philosophy-craft is the greatest of the crafts,&ucirc; some said this: &szlig;Political science-craft is the greatest of the crafts.&ucirc; Now this conversation that arose amongst those monks was left unfinished.</P>

<P>&szlig;Here, reverend Sir, after returning from the alms-round after the meal, assembling together, and sitting in the Round Hall, this conversation arose: &szlig;Now who, venerable friends, knows a craft?

<P>&szlig;This is certainly not suitable, monks, for you sons of good family who through faith have gone forth from the home to homelessness, that you should talk such talk.

<P>Then the Auspicious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;One who lives without craft, light, desiring (others') welfare,<BR>
With restrained faculties, completely free in every way,<BR>
Who wanders homeless, unselfish, not yearning,<BR>
Having given up conceit, solitary - he is a monk.&ucirc;</P>

<DIR>

</B><P>Thus I heard:</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>at one time the Auspicious One was dwelling near Uruvel&agrave;, on the bank of the river Nera¤jara, at the root of the Awakening tree, in the first (period) after attaining Awakening. Then at that time the Auspicious One was sitting in one cross-legged posture for seven days experiencing the happiness of freedom. Then with the passing of those seven days the Auspicious One, after rising from that concentration, looked around the world with his Buddha-eye.</P>
<P>The Auspicious One looking around the world with his Buddha-eye saw beings tormented with many torments, and burning with many fevers, born from passion, and born from hatred, and born from delusion.</P>
<P>Then the Auspicious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</P><DIR>

<P>&szlig;This world, overcome by contact, is tormented,</P><DIR>

<P>It speaks of a disease as the self,<BR>
For with whatever it conceives<A NAME="Text_49"></A><BR>
Hereafter it becomes otherwise.</P></DIR>

<P>Continually becoming other, the world is shackled by continuity, overcome by continuity, </P><DIR>

<P>It greatly rejoices in continuity,<BR>
What it rejoices in, that is fearful,<BR>
What is fears, that is suffering.</P></DIR>

<P>This spiritual life is lived for the complete giving up of continuity.<BR>
For whatever the ascetics or br&agrave;hma&otilde;as<BR>
say about freedom from continuity being through (further) continuity,<BR>
all of them are not free from continuity, I say.<BR>
Or whatever the ascetics or br&agrave;hma&otilde;as<BR>
say about the escape from continuity being through discontinuity,<BR>
all of them have not escaped from continuity, I say.</P>
<P>Conditioned by cleaving this suffering originates,<BR>
through the destruction of all attachment there is no origination of suffering.<BR>
See this world overcome by many kinds of ignorance<BR>
beings, who delight in beings, are not free from continuity.<BR>
Whatever continuities (in existence) there are, everywhere, in every respect,<A NAME="three10v"></A><BR>
all those continuities are impermanent, suffering, changeable things.</P><DIR>

<P>Seeing it like this, as it really is, with right wisdom,<BR>
Craving for continuity is given up,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he does not rejoice in discontinuity.</P></DIR>

<P>From the comlete destruction of craving there is fading away without remainder, cessation, and Emancipation. <BR>
For that monk who is emancipated,</P><DIR>

<P>Without attachment, there is no continuity in existence.<BR>
He has vanquished M&agrave;ra, is victorious in battle,<BR>
He is such a one who has overcome all continuations (in existence).&ucirc;</P>
