<h3><A name="2">Jatila Sutta (Ud VI.2)</A> -- Ascetics <A HREF="#top">go to top</A></h3>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in <A NAME="sav6.2">Savatthi</A> at the Eastern Monastery, the palace of <A NAME="migaramom6.2">Migara's mother</A>. Now at that time the Blessed One, having emerged from his seclusion in the late afternoon, was sitting outside the doorway. Then <A NAME="pasenadi6.2">King Pasenadi Kosala</A> went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. Then seven coiled-hair ascetics, seven Jain ascetics, seven naked ascetics, seven one-cloth ascetics, and seven wanderers -- their nails grown long, their body-hair grown long -- walked past not far from the Blessed One. King Pasenadi Kosala saw the seven coiled-hair ascetics, seven Jain ascetics, seven naked ascetics, seven one-cloth ascetics, and seven wanderers -- their nails grown long, their body-hair grown long -- walking past not far from the Blessed One. On seeing them, he arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, knelt down with his right knee on the ground, saluted the ascetics with his hands before his heart, and announced his name to them three times: "I am the king, venerable sirs, Pasenadi Kosala. I am the king, venerable sirs, Pasenadi Kosala. I am the king, venerable sirs, Pasenadi Kosala." Then not long after the ascetics had passed, he returned to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, "Of those in the world who are arahants or on the path to arahantship, are these among them?"
<p>
"Your majesty, as a layman enjoying sensual pleasures; living crowded with wives and children; using <A NAME="kasi6.2">Kasi</A> fabrics and sandalwood; wearing garlands, scents, and creams; handling gold and silver, it is hard for you to know whether these are arahants or on the path to arahantship.
<p>
"It is through living together that a person's virtue may be known, and then only after a long period, not a short period; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who is discerning, not by one who is not discerning.
<p>
"It is through dealing with a person that his purity may be known, and then only after a long period, not a short period; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who is discerning, not by one who is not discerning.
<p>
"It is through adversity that a person's endurance may be known, and then only after a long period, not a short period; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who is discerning, not by one who is not discerning.
<p>
"It is through discussion that a person's discernment may be known, and then only after a long period, not a short period; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who is discerning, not by one who is not discerning."
<p>
"How amazing, lord! How awesome! How well that was put by the Blessed One! 'Your majesty, as a layman enjoying sensual pleasures; living crowded with wives and children; using Kasi fabrics and sandalwood; wearing garlands, scents, and creams; handling gold and silver, it is hard for you to know whether these are arahants or on the path to arahantship.
<p>
"'It is through living together that a person's virtue may be known, and then only after a long period, not a short period; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who is discerning, not by one who is not discerning.
<p>
"'It is through dealing with a person that his purity may be known, and then only after a long period, not a short period; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who is discerning, not by one who is not discerning.
<p>
"'It is through adversity that a person's endurance may be known, and then only after a long period, not a short period; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who is discerning, not by one who is not discerning.
<p>
"'It is through discussion that a person's discernment may be known, and then only after a long period, not a short period; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who is discerning, not by one who is not discerning.'
<p>
"These men, lord, are my spies, my scouts, returning after going out through the countryside. They go out first, and then I go. Now, when they have scrubbed off the dirt and mud, are well-bathed and well-perfumed, have trimmed their hair and beards, and have put on white clothes, they will go about endowed and provided with the five cords of sensuality."
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
One should not make an effort everywhere.<br>
One should not be another's hireling.<br>
One should not live dependent on another.<br>
One should not make the Dhamma a trade.

<h3><A name="3">Ahu Sutta (Ud VI.3)</A> -- It Was <A HREF="#top">go to top</A></h3>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="sav6.3">Savatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana6.3">Anathapindika's</A> monastery. Now at that time the Blessed One sat reflecting on the various evil, unskillful qualities that had been abandoned [in him] and on the various skillful qualities that had gone to the culmination of their development. Then as he realized the various evil, unskillful qualities that had been abandoned [in him] and the various skillful qualities that had gone to the culmination of their development, he on that occasion exclaimed:
<BLOCKQUOTE>

Before, it wasn't, then it was.<br>
It wasn't, it won't be,<br>

<h3><A name="4">Tittha Sutta (Ud VI.4)</A> -- Various Sectarians (1) <A HREF="#top">go to top</A></h3>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="sav6.4">Savatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana6.4">Anathapindika's</A> monastery. Now at that time there were many priests, contemplatives, and wanderers of various sects living around Savatthi with differing views, differing opinions, differing beliefs, dependent for support on their differing views. Some of the priests and contemplatives held this view, this doctrine: "The cosmos is eternal. Only this is true; anything otherwise is worthless."
<p>
Some of the priests and contemplatives held this view, this doctrine: "The cosmos is not eternal"..."The cosmos is finite"..."The cosmos is infinite"..."The soul and the body are the same"..."The soul is one thing and the body another"..."After death a Tathagata exists"..."After death a Tathagata does not exist"..."After death a Tathagata both does and does not exist"..."After death a Tathagata neither does nor does not exist. Only this is true; anything otherwise is worthless."
<p>
And they lived arguing, quarreling, and disputing, wounding one another with weapons of the mouth, saying, "The Dhamma is like this, it's not like that. The Dhamma's not like that, it's like this."
<p>
Then in the early morning, a large number of monks, having put on their robes and carrying their bowls and outer robes, went into Savatthi for alms. Having gone for alms in Savatthi, after the meal, returning from their alms round, they went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they said to the Blessed One: "Lord, there are many priests, contemplatives, and wanderers of various sects living around Savatthi with differing views, differing opinions, differing beliefs, dependent for support on their differing views...and they live arguing, quarreling, and disputing, wounding one another with weapons of the mouth, saying, 'The Dhamma is like this, it's not like that. The Dhamma's not like that, it's like this.'"
<p>
"Monks, the wanderers of other sects are blind and eyeless. They don't know what is beneficial and what is harmful. They don't know what is the Dhamma and what is non-Dhamma. Not knowing what is beneficial and what is harmful, not knowing what is Dhamma and what is non-Dhamma, they live arguing, quarreling, and disputing, wounding one another with weapons of the mouth, saying, 'The Dhamma is like this, it's not like that. The Dhamma's not like that, it's like this.'
<p>
"<A NAME="parable6.4">Once, in</A> this same Savatthi, there was a certain king who said to a certain man, 'Gather together all the people in Savatthi who have been blind from birth.'"
<p>
"'As you say, your majesty,' the man replied and, rounding up all the people in Savatthi who had been blind from birth, he went to the king and on arrival said, 'Your majesty, the people in Savatthi who have been blind from birth have been gathered together.'
<p>
"'Very well then, show the blind people an elephant.'
<p>
"'As you say, your majesty,' the man replied and he showed the blind people an elephant. To some of the blind people he showed the head of the elephant, saying, 'This, blind people, is what an elephant is like.' To some of them he showed an ear of the elephant, saying, 'This, blind people, is what an elephant is like.' To some of them he showed a tusk...the trunk...the body...a foot...the hindquarters...the tail...the tuft at the end of the tail, saying, 'This, blind people, is what an elephant is like.'
<p>
"Then, having shown the blind people the elephant, the man went to the king and on arrival said, 'Your majesty, the blind people have seen the elephant. May your majesty do what you think it is now time to do.'
<p>
"Then the king went to the blind people and on arrival asked them, 'Blind people, have you seen the elephant?'
<p>
"'Yes, your majesty. We have seen the elephant.'
<p>
"'Now tell me, blind people, what the elephant is like.'
<p>
"The blind people who had been shown the head of the elephant replied, 'The elephant, your majesty, is just like a water jar.'
<p>
"Those who had been shown the ear of the elephant replied, 'The elephant, your majesty, is just like a winnowing basket.'
<p>
"Those who had been shown the tusk of the elephant replied, 'The elephant, your majesty, is just like an iron rod.'
<p>
"Those who had been shown the trunk of the elephant replied, 'The elephant, your majesty, is just like the pole of a plow.'
<p>
"Those who had been shown the body of the elephant replied, 'The elephant, your majesty, is just like a granary.'
<p>
"Those who had been shown the foot of the elephant replied, 'The elephant, your majesty, is just like a post.'
<p>
"Those who had been shown the hindquarters of the elephant replied, 'The elephant, your majesty, is just like a mortar.'
<p>
"Those who had been shown the tail of the elephant replied, 'The elephant, your majesty, is just like a pestle.'
<p>
"Those who had been shown the tuft at the end of the tail of the elephant replied, 'The elephant, your majesty, is just like a broom.'
<p>
"Saying, 'The elephant is like this, it's not like that. The elephant's not like that, it's like this,' they struck one another with their fists. That gratified the king.
<p>
"In the same way, monks, the wanderers of other sects are blind and eyeless. They don't know what is beneficial and what is harmful. They don't know what is the Dhamma and what is non-Dhamma. Not knowing what is beneficial and what is harmful, not knowing what is Dhamma and what is non-Dhamma, they live arguing, quarreling, and disputing, wounding one another with weapons of the mouth, saying, 'The Dhamma is like this, it's not like that. The Dhamma's not like that, it's like this.'"
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in <A NAME="rajagaha6.8">Rajagaha</A> at the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary. Now at that time two factions in Rajagaha were in love with a certain courtesan, their minds enthralled. Arguing, quarreling, and disputing, they attacked one another with fists, attacked one another with clods of dirt, attacked one another with sticks, attacked one another with knives, so that they fell into death or death-like pain.
<p>
Then in the early morning, a large number of monks, having put on their robes and carrying their bowls and outer robes, went into <A NAME="sav6.8">Savatthi</A> for alms.

<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
What's been attained, what's to be attained,<br>
are both defiled by one who trains<br>

Those for whom precepts &amp; practices<br>

for whom celibacy is the essence of service:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this is one extreme.<br>
Those who say, "There's no harm in sensual desires":<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this is the second extreme.<br>
Both of these extremes cause the growth of cemeteries,<br>

<A NAME="2extremes">Not directly</A> knowing these two extremes,<br>
