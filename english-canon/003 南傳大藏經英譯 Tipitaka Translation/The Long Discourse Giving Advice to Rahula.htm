<DIR>

</B><P>This is what I heard:</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>at one time the Auspicious One was dwelling near S&agrave;vatthi at An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika's grounds in Jeta's Wood. Then the Auspicious One, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, was entering S&agrave;vatthi for alms. Also venerable R&agrave;hula, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, followed along close behind the Auspicious One. Then the Auspicious One, looking back, addressed venerable R&agrave;hula, saying:</P>
<P>&szlig;Whatever form there is, R&agrave;hula, past, future, or present, inside or outside, gross or subtle, base or excellent, whether far or near, (in regard to) all form: &szlig;This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self,&ucirc; like this it ought to be seen as it really is, with right wisdom.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Only form, Auspicious One? Only form, Fortunate One?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Form, R&agrave;hula - and feelings, R&agrave;hula - and perceptions, R&agrave;hula - and (mental) processes, R&agrave;hula - and consciousness, R&agrave;hula.&ucirc;</P>
<B><P>1b: Receiving further advice</P>
</B><P>Then venerable R&agrave;hula thought: &szlig;Who today, when the Auspicious One has advised him with (such) advice to his face, could enter a village for alms?&ucirc; Therefore having turned back he sat down at the root of a certain tree. After folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, he established mindfulness at the front.</P>
<P>Venerable S&agrave;riputta saw that venerable R&agrave;hula was sitting down at the root of a certain tree, and had folded his legs crosswise, set his body straight, and established mindfulness at the front, and having seen him, he addressed venerable R&agrave;hula, saying:</P>
<P>&szlig;Develop the meditation, R&agrave;hula, that is mindfulness with breathing. Mindfulness with breathing, R&agrave;hula, when it has been developed and made much of yields great fruit and brings great advantages.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then venerable R&agrave;hula rising from seclusion in the evening time approached the Auspicious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Auspicious One, he sat down on one side. While sitting on one side, venerable R&agrave;hula said this to the Auspicious One:</P>
<P>&szlig;How, reverend Sir, does mindfulness with breathing when it has been developed and made much of yield great fruit, bring great advantages?&ucirc;</P>

</B></FONT><P><A NAME="N1"></A><A HREF="#T1">1</A><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"> Here the meditation on the elements is worked out in detail. Commentating on the meditation as given in brief in Mah&agrave;satipa&ntilde;&ntilde;h&agrave;nasutta&uuml; (D. 22), Visuddhimagga (11. 30) says: &szlig;Just as a cow-butcher while fattening a cow, bringing it to the slaughter-house, binding it up and making it stand there; then slaying it and seeing it slain and dead, still doesn't lose the idea: `this is a cow' so long as he has not torn it apart and dismembered it. But after dismembering it, while sitting there, he loses the idea of `cow', and the idea of `meat' occurs, and he doesn't think: `I am selling a cow, this is cow they are carrying off', rather he thinks `I am selling meat, this is meat they are carrying off'. So too, a monk...does not lose the idea `this is a being, this is a person, this is an individual', so long as he does not review this body...and classify what is (otherwise) dense into the elements. But after reviewing the elements he loses the idea `this is a being (etc.)' and on account of the elements he settles his mind.&ucirc; </FONT><A HREF="#T1">Back to text</A></P>
<P><A NAME="N2"></A><A HREF="#T2">2</A><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"> Sometimes this meditation is given in regard to 4 elements only (e.g. M 28). But here the air element (</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">&agrave;k&agrave;sadh&agrave;tu</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">) is also included. Elsewhere these 5 plus consciousness (</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">vi¤¤&agrave;&otilde;a</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">) are combined (e.g. M 140). </P>
<P>The renderings that have been adopted here are largely determined by the need for coherence in regard to the two meditations on the elements that are taught in this discourse. It should be remembered though that the first four elements also represent qualities which Visuddhimagga (11. 39) defines like this: &szlig;the characteristic mark of the earth element is firmness (</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">thaddha</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">)...of water is bonding (</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">&agrave;bandhana</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">)...of fire is maturing (</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">parip&agrave;cana</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">)...and of wind is supporting (</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">vitthambana</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">)&ucirc;. </FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">&acirc;k&agrave;sa</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"> here rendered as `air' can also be given as `space'. </P>

Fortunately `meditation' has a broad range of meanings in English, sufficient to adequately cover the usage in the P&agrave;&euml;i but it is as well to bear in mind the more literal meaning in the original.</P>

The present translation is an attempt to maintain the same ambiguity in the English. If we took the liberty to translate the word twice we could give it as: &szlig;develop the meditation that is to be peaceful just as the earth is...&ucirc; With this advice on meditation cf. the similar instruction given in Kakac&aring;pamasutta&uuml; M. 21. </P>

The translation here sounds rather literal, but it's hard to avoid, as all the words in question are in common use without the affix -</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">gata&uuml;</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">, and we must presume that it's use is intended to add meaning to the words and not simply be synomynous with them. </P>
<P><A NAME="N5"></A></FONT><A HREF="#T5">5</A><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"> The first four meditations given in this section constitute what are collectively known as the `spiritual moods' (</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">brahmavih&agrave;ra</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">), or the `measureless states' (</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">appama¤¤a</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">). The teaching given here is also confirmed in a discourse by Ven S&agrave;riputta (D. 33), where he says: &szlig;It is impossible, friend, it cannot happen, that when the freedom of mind (</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">cetovimutti</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">) that is friendliness has been developed...that ill-will can take hold of the mind - that surely will not be, for this is the escape from ill-will, namely, the freedom of mind that is friendliness&ucirc;. The discourse continues in the same way in regard to compassion &amp; violence, and gladness &amp; discontent. There, however, equanimity (</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">upekkh&agrave;</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">) is said to overcome passion, not resentment as here. It is possible that this reflects a change in the meaning of the word </FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">upekkh&agrave;</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman">. In the Buddhist tradition there is unamnity, it seems, on the meaning of upekkh&agrave; as equanimity, literally: `on-looking', from prefix </FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">upa</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"> `on' + </FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol"></FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"> </FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">ikkha</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"> `look'. However, </FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman" COLOR="#800000">upa</FONT><FONT FACE="Sangayana,Times New Roman"> also has the meaning of `over', and in this sense we then get the meaning `over-looking', or as we might say, `forgiveness', which seems to be a better antonyn to resentment, and more coherent with the other three moods. </P>
