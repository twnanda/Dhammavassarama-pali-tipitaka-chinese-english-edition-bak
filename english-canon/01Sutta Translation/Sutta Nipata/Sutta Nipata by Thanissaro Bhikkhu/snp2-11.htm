<small>From <i>The Discourse Collection: Selected Texts from the Sutta Nipata (WH 82)</i>, translated by John D. Ireland (Kandy: Buddhist Publication Society, 1983).</small>
<hr>
"Renouncing the five pleasures of sense that entrance and delight the mind, and in faith departing from home, become one who makes an end of suffering!
<p>
"Associate with good friends and choose a remote lodging, secluded, with little noise. Be moderate in eating. Robes, alms-food, remedies and a dwelling, -- do not have craving for these things; do not be one who returns to the world. [<A HREF="#n1" NAME="1">1</a>] Practice restraint according to the Discipline, [<A HREF="#n2" NAME="2">2</a>] and control the five sense-faculties.
<p>
"Practice mindfulness of the body and continually develop dispassion (towards it). Avoid the sign of the beautiful connected with passion; by meditating on the foul [<A HREF="#n3" NAME="3">3</a>] cultivate a mind that is concentrated and collected.
<p>
"Meditate on the Signless [<A HREF="#n4" NAME="4">4</a>] and get rid of the tendency to conceit. By thoroughly understanding and destroying conceit [<A HREF="#n5" NAME="5">5</a>] you will live in the (highest) peace."
<p>
In this manner the Lord repeatedly exhorted the Venerable Rahula.

<b><A NAME="n3">3</a>.</b> The "foul," or <i>asubha-kammatthana</i>, refers to the practice of contemplating a corpse in various stages of decay and the contemplation on the thirty-two parts of the body, as a means of developing detachment from body and dispassion in regard to its beautiful (or, "the sign of the beautiful," subha-nimitta).

<p>
<b><A NAME="n4">4</a>.</b> The Signless (<i>animitta</i>) is one of the three Deliverances (<i>vimokkha</i>) by which beings are liberated from the world. The other two are Desirelessness (<i>appanihita</i>) and Emptiness (<i>sunnata</i>). The Signless is connected with the idea of impermanence of all conditioned things (cf. Visuddhi Magga, XXI 67f).
