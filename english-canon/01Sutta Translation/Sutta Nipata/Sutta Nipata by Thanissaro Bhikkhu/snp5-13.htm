Udaya:
<blockquote>
To the one in jhana<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seated dustless,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; passionless,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his task done,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; effluent-free,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gone to the beyond<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of all phenomena,<br>
I've come with a question.<br>
Tell me the gnosis of emancipation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the breaking open<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of ignorance.
</blockquote>
The Buddha:
<blockquote>
The abandoning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; both of sensual desires,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; of unhappiness,<br>
the dispelling of sloth,<br>
the warding off of anxieties,<br>
equanimity-&amp;-mindfulness purified,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with inspection of mental qualities<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; swift in the forefront:<br>
That I call the gnosis of emancipation, [<A HREF="#n1" NAME="1">1</a>]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the breaking open<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of ignorance. [<A HREF="#n2" NAME="2">2</a>]
</blockquote>
Udaya:
<blockquote>
With what<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the world fettered?<br>
With what<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is it examined?<br>
Through the abandoning of what<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is there said to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbinding?
</blockquote>
The Buddha:
<blockquote>
With delight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the world's fettered.<br>
With directed thought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it's examined.<br>
Through the abandoning of craving<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is there said to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbinding.
</blockquote>
Udaya:
<blockquote>
Living mindful in what way<br>
does one bring consciousness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to a halt?<br>
We've come questioning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the Blessed One.<br>
Let us hear your words.
</blockquote>
The Buddha:
<blockquote>
Not relishing feeling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inside or out:<br>
One living mindful in this way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brings consciousness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to a halt. [<A HREF="#n3" NAME="3">3</a>]

<b><A NAME="n2">2</a>.</b> A.III.33 contains a discussion of this verse. The Buddha tells Ven. Sariputta that one should train oneself such that "with regard to this conscious body, there will be no 'I'-making or 'mine'-making or underlying tendency to conceit, such that with regard to all external themes [topics of concentration] there will be no 'I'-making or 'mine'-making or underlying tendency to conceit, and that we will enter &amp; remain in the release of awareness &amp; release of discernment in which there is no 'I'-making or 'mine'-making or underlying tendency to conceit." When one has trained in this way, he says, one is called a person who has cut through craving, unraveled the fetter, who has, through the right penetration of conceit, put an end to suffering &amp; stress. He then states that it was in connection to this state that he uttered this verse.
