This is to be done by one skilled in aims<br>
who wants to break through to the state of peace:<br>
Be capable, upright, &amp; straightforward,<br>
easy to instruct, gentle, &amp; not conceited,<br>
content &amp; easy to support,<br>
with few duties, living lightly,<br>
with peaceful faculties, masterful,<br>
modest, &amp; no greed for supporters.
<p>
Do not do the slightest thing<br>
that the wise would later censure.
<p>
Think: Happy, at rest,<br>
may all beings be happy at heart.<br>
Whatever beings there may be,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weak or strong, without exception,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long, large,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; middling, short,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; subtle, blatant,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seen &amp; unseen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; near &amp; far,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; born &amp; seeking birth:<br>
May all beings be happy at heart.
<p>
Let no one deceive another<br>
or despise anyone anywhere,<br>
or through anger or irritation<br>
wish for another to suffer.
<p>
<A NAME="mother">As a mother</A> would risk her life<br>
to protect her child, her only child,<br>
even so should one cultivate a limitless heart<br>
with regard to all beings.<br>
With good will for the entire cosmos,<br>
cultivate a limitless heart:<br>
Above, below, &amp; all around,<br>
unobstructed, without hostility or hate.<br>
Whether standing, walking,<br>
sitting, or lying down,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as long as one is alert,<br>
one should be resolved on this mindfulness.<br>
This is called a sublime abiding<br>
here &amp; now.
<p>
Not taken with views,<br>
but virtuous &amp; consummate in vision,<br>
having subdued desire for sensual pleasures,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one never again<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will lie in the womb.
