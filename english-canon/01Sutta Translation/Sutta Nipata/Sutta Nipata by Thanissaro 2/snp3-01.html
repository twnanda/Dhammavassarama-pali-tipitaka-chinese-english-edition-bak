<hr>
<blockquote>
I will describe the Going Forth,<br>
how he, the One-with-Vision, went forth,<br>
how he reasoned and chose the Going Forth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<A NAME="household">Household</A> life is crowded,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a realm of dust,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while going forth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the open air."<br>
Seeing this, he went forth.
<p>
On going forth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he avoided evil deeds in body.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abandoning verbal misconduct,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he purified his livelihood.<br>
Then he, the Buddha, went to <A NAME="rajagaha">Rajagaha</A>,<br>
the mountain fortress of the <A NAME="magadhans">Magadhans</A>,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and wandered for alms,<br>
endowed with all the foremost marks.<br>
<A NAME="bimbisara">King Bimbisara</A>, standing in his palace, saw him,<br>
and on seeing him, consummate in marks,<br>
said: "Look at this one, sirs.<br>
How handsome, stately, pure!<br>
How consummate his demeanor!<br>
Mindful, his eyes downcast,<br>
looking only a plow-length before him,<br>
as one who's not from a lowly lineage:<br>
Send the royal messengers at once<br>
to see where this monk will go."
<p>
<A NAME="whereto">They</A> -- the messengers dispatched -- <br>
followed behind him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where will this monk go?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where will his dwelling place be?"<br>
As he went from house to house -- <br>
well-restrained, his sense-doors guarded,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mindful, alert -- <br>
his bowl filled quickly.<br>
Then he, the sage, completing his alms round,<br>
left the city, headed for <A NAME="pandava">Mount Pandava</A>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's where his dwelling will be."<br>
Seeing him go to his dwelling place,<br>
three messengers sat down,<br>
while one returned to tell the king.<br>
"That monk, your majesty,<br>
on the flank of Pandava,<br>
sits like a tiger, a bull,<br>
<A NAME="lion">a lion</A> in a mountain cleft."
<p>
Hearing the messenger's words,<br>
the noble warrior king<br>
straight away went by royal coach,<br>
out to Mount Pandava.<br>
Going as far as the coach would go,<br>
he got down, went up on foot,<br>
and on arrival sat down.<br>
Sitting there,<br>
he exchanged courteous greetings,<br>
then said:<br>
"You are young, youthful,<br>
in the first stage of youth,<br>
endowed with the stature &amp; coloring<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of a noble-warrior.<br>
You would look glorious<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the vanguard of an army,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arrayed with an elephant squadron.<br>
I offer you wealth : enjoy it.<br>
I ask your birth : inform me."
<p>
"Straight ahead, your majesty,<br>
by the foothills of the <A NAME="himalayas">Himalayas</A>,<br>
is a country consummate<br>
in energy &amp; wealth,<br>
inhabited by <A NAME="kosalans">Kosalans</A>:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solar by clan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sakyans by birth.<br>
From that lineage I have gone forth,<br>
but not in search of sensual pleasures.<br>
Seeing the danger in sensual pleasures<br>
-- and renunciation as rest -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I go to strive.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's where my heart delights."
