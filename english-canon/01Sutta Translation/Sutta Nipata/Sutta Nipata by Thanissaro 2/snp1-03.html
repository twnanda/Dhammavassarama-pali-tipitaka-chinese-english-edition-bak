<h3>Sutta Nipata I.3</h3>
<h1>Khaggavisana Sutta</h1>
<h1>A Rhinoceros Horn</h1>
<small>Translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu.</small><br>

<small><B>Translator's note:</B> 
The refrain in this sutta is a subject of controversy. The text literally says, "Wander alone like a 'sword-horn,' which is the Pali term for rhinoceros. The commentary, however, insists that this term refers not to the animal but to its horn, for the Indian rhinoceros, unlike the African, has only one horn. Still, some scholars have noted that while the Indian rhinoceros is a solitary animal, rhinoceros horns don't wander, and that in other verses in the Pali canon, the phrase "wander alone like..." takes a person or an animal, not an animal part, for its object. Thus, for example, in Dhp 329 (repeated below), one is told to "wander alone like a king renouncing his kingdom, like the elephant in the Matanga woods, his herd." It's possible that the rhinoceros was chosen here as an example of solitary wandering both because of its habits and because of its unusual single horn. However, in a translation, it's necessary to choose one reading over the other. Thus, because wandering "like a rhinoceros" sounds more natural than wandering "like a horn," I have chosen the former rendering. Keep in mind, though, that the singularity of the rhinoceros' horn reinforces the image.
</small><p>
<small>As noted under <A HREF="snp-1-01-tb0.html">I.1</A>, there is evidence suggesting that the verses here were originally separate poems, composed on separate occasions, and that they have been gathered together because of their common refrain.

with mind unsmeared, not lazy in action,<br>
firm in effort, with steadfastness &amp; strength arisen,<br>
wander alone <br>
like a rhinoceros.
