<i>Punnaka:</i>
<blockquote>
To the one unperturbed,<br>
who has seen the root [of all things],<br>
I have come with a question.<br>
Because of what<br>
have many human seers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- noble warriors, brahmans -- <br>
offered sacrifices to devas<br>
here in the world?<br>
I ask you, O Blessed One.<br>
Please tell me.
</blockquote>
<i>The Buddha:</i>
<blockquote>
Those many human seers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- noble warriors, brahmans -- <br>
who have offered sacrifices to devas<br>
here in the world, Punnaka,<br>
hoping for more of this state of being,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; offered their sacrifices<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because of aging.
</blockquote>
<i>Punnaka:</i>
<blockquote>
Those many human seers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- noble warriors, brahmans -- <br>
who have offered sacrifices to devas<br>
here in the world:<br>
Have they, O Blessed One,<br>
heeding the path of sacrifice,<br>
crossed over birth &amp; aging?<br>
I ask you, O Blessed One.<br>
Please tell me.
</blockquote>
<i>The Buddha:</i>
<blockquote>
They hoped for, liked,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; longed for,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so sacrificed -- <br>
they longed for sensuality,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dependent on gain.<br>
I tell you:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those who take on the yoke<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of sacrifice,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; impassioned with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the passion for becoming,<br>
have not crossed over birth &amp; aging.
</blockquote>
<i>Punnaka:</i>
<blockquote>
If those who take on the yoke of sacrifice<br>
haven't crossed over the flood, dear sir,<br>
then who in the world<br>
of beings divine &amp; human<br>
has crossed over birth &amp; aging?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ask you, O Blessed One.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please tell me.
</blockquote>
<i>The Buddha:</i>
<blockquote>
He who has fathomed<br>
the far &amp; near in the world,<br>
for whom there is nothing<br>
perturbing in the world -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his vices evaporated,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; undesiring, untroubled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at peace -- <br>
he, I tell you, has crossed over birth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; aging.

<h3>Note</h3>
<p>
AN III.32 and <A HREF="../../anguttara/an04-041.html">AN IV.41</A> contain discussions of the last verse in this poem.
<p>
In AN III.32, Ven. Ananda asks the Buddha, "Could it be that a monk could attain a concentration of such a sort such that, with regard to this conscious body, he would have no 'I'-making or 'mine'-making or obsession of conceit, such that with regard to all external themes [topics of concentration] he would have no 'I'-making or 'mine'-making or obsession of conceit, and that he would enter &amp; remain in the awareness-release &amp; discernment-release in which there is no 'I'-making or 'mine'-making or obsession of conceit?"
<p>
The Buddha answers that it is possible, and that such a concentration can be attained when one is percipient in this way: "This is peace, this is exquisite -- the resolution of all mental processes; the relinquishment of all acquisitions; the ending of craving; dispassion; cessation; Unbinding." He then adds that it was in connection to this state of mind that he uttered the last verse in this poem.
<p>
In <A HREF="../../anguttara/an04-041.html">AN IV.41</A>, the Buddha identifies four ways of developing concentration: "There is the development of concentration that, when developed &amp; pursued, leads to a pleasant abiding in the here &amp; now. There is the development of concentration that, when developed &amp; pursued, leads to the attainment of knowledge &amp; vision. There is the development of concentration that, when developed &amp; pursued, leads to mindfulness &amp; alertness. There is the development of concentration that, when developed &amp; pursued, leads to the ending of the effluents." (For details, see <A HREF="../../anguttara/an04-041.html">AN IV.41</A>) The Buddha then adds that he uttered the last verse of this poem in connection with these four ways of developing concentration.
