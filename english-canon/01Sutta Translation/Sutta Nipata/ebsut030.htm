    <h3><a name="1">1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction</a></h3>
    <p>The Sutta-nipata or &quot;Discourse-collection,&quot; from
    which this selection has been compiled, contains some of the
    oldest and most profound discourses of the
    Buddha.&nbsp;&nbsp; The complete text has been translated at
    least three times into English, the most recent being by E.M.
    Hare under the title &quot;Woven Cadences&quot; (Oxford
    University Press, London, 1945).&nbsp;&nbsp; The Pali
    original consists mainly of verse interspersed with some
    prose passages and Hare has followed this arrangement by
    translating it into English blank verse.&nbsp;&nbsp; However,
    in the selection appearing below the aim has been to keep as
    near as possible to the original, and no attempt has been
    made to versify it.</p>
    <p>The first discourse (<a href="#2">2</a>) shows the
    distinction between the mode of conduct of the bhikkhu and
    the layman, both regarded as virtuous or good
    (sadhu).&nbsp;&nbsp; For, as it is said elsewhere:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>These two ways of life are not the same:<br>
        That of a householder supporting a wife<br>
        And one without worldly attachments...</p>
        <p>As a peacock never approaches the swiftness<br>
        of a swan, so a householder cannot imitate a<br>
        bhikkhu, a hermit meditating in the forest.</p>
        <p>-- Snp. vv. 220-221</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The lay-follower is given the five precepts of abstaining
    from killing, stealing and so forth, and then the eight
    precepts are observed on special occasions (uposatha,
    &quot;observance days&quot;).&nbsp; &nbsp; Also perhaps it is
    appropriate to commence with Dhammika's praising the Buddha,
    for these two, moral discipline and faith in the Buddha, are
    the basic requisites for making further progress on the
    Buddhist path.</p>
    <p>The next two discourses (<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#4">4</a>)
    deal with wrong and right conduct, pointing out the results
    both courses lead to.</p>
    <p>One of the essentials for the practice of the Buddha's
    teaching is having &quot;good friends&quot; and the avoidance
    of those who hinder one's progress (<a href="#5">5</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The best friend is &quot;He from whom one learns the
    Dhamma&quot; (<a href="#5">6</a>) and as such the Buddha is
    known as the &quot;Good Friend&quot; to all beings.</p>
    <p>The next two (<a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>) give
    the practical training and the direction one should tend
    towards.</p>
    <p>Continuous effort is needed to practice the Dhamma (<a
    href="#9">9</a>) and to inspire one there is no better
    example than the Buddha's own struggle (<a href="#10">10</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Then there are two contemplations on the transience of life
    and the futility of sorrowing over the natural course of
    events in this world (<a href="#11">11</a>, <a href="#12">12</a>).</p>
    <p>Two important discourses follow dealing with the
    misconception that purity can come from outside without
    putting forth any effort (<a href="#13">13</a>) and with
    wrongly holding to views and opinions leading to contention
    and suffering (<a href="#14">14</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp; These two,
    together with the rest of what follows, are regarded as some
    of the oldest discourses of the Sutta-nipata and contain much
    that is difficult to understand.</p>
    <p>In the Parayana-vagga, the last chapter of the
    Sutta-nipata, sixteen brahmanas -- &quot;famous throughout
    the world, meditators, delighting in meditation, and wise
    ...&quot; (v. 1009) -- come to the Buddha and ask Him various
    questions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Five of them are included here (<a
    href="#15">15</a>, <a href="#16">16</a>, <a href="#17">17</a>,
    <a href="#19">19</a>, <a href="#20">20</a>).</p>
    <p>No. <a href="#18">18</a> may be compared with the
    Sakkapanha Suttanta (Digha-nikaya 21, translated as No. 10 in
    the Wheel Series), which contains a closely parallel series
    of questions and answers.</p>
    <p>No. <a href="#21">21</a> consists of the concluding verses
    of a fairly long discourse and indicates the disparity
    existing between the realization of the &quot;Ariya,&quot;
    the Buddhas and their disciples, and the way of thinking
    usual to the ordinary people of this world.</p>
    <p>A note ought to be included on the term
    &quot;Dhamma,&quot; an important and frequent word in
    Buddhist literature and which has, in most cases, been left
    untranslated below for the reason that there is no equivalent
    word in English to cover all its various shades of
    meaning.&nbsp;&nbsp; It could be rendered by Law (cosmic and
    moral), Norm, Teaching, Doctrine, Scripture, Truth, Nature,
    practice, method, conduct, causality, etc., for these are all
    meanings of the term 'Dhamma'.&nbsp;&nbsp; But they all tend
    to fall short of a true definition.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dhamma is
    the heart of the Buddha's teaching and without it Buddhism
    would be something quite dead, and yet it is not the
    exclusive possession of the historical religion.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In addition, it has another set of meanings and is
    practically always used in this sense in the plural, as
    mental (and sensory) objects, ideas, things, phenomena,
    elements, forces, states, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this latter
    sense however it has not been left untranslated below.</p>
    <p>In conclusion I wish to acknowledge the valuable
    assistance given by the Ven. Nyanaponika Mahathera in
    correcting several errors in the translation of this short
    anthology and in supplying much advice and commentarial
    literature used in formulating the notes.</p>

    <h3><a name="2">2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dhammika</a></h3>
    <p>Thus have I heard.&nbsp;&nbsp; At one time the Lord was
    staying near Savatthi in the Jeta Grove at Anathapindaka's
    monastery.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the lay-follower Dhammika with
    five hundred other lay-followers approached the
    Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having drawn near and having saluted the
    Lord respectfully he sat down at one side.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Sitting there the lay-follower Dhammika addressed the Lord as
    follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;I ask Gotama [1]&nbsp;&nbsp;of extensive wisdom
        this:&nbsp;&nbsp; How acting is a disciple virtuous --
        both the disciple who has gone from home to the homeless
        state and the followers who are
        householders?&nbsp;&nbsp;For you clearly understand the
        behavior [2]&nbsp;&nbsp;of the world with the devas and
        the final release.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is none equal to you
        who are skilled in seeing what is profound.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        You are an illustrious Awakened One (Buddha).&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Having investigated all knowledge and being compassionate
        towards beings you have announced the Dhamma, a revealer
        of what is hidden, of comprehensive vision, stainless,
        you illuminate all the worlds.</p>
        <p>&quot;This Dhamma, subtle and pleasing and taught so
        clearly by you, Lord, it is this we all wish to
        hear.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having been questioned, foremost
        Awakened One, tell us (the answer).&nbsp;&nbsp; All these
        bhikkhus and also the layfollowers who have come to hear
        the truth, let them listen to the Dhamma awakened to
        (anubuddham) by the Stainless One as the devas listen to
        the well-spoken words of Vasava.&quot; [3]</p>
        <p>(The Lord:)&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Listen to me, bhikkhus,
        I will teach you the ascetic practice (dhamma dhutam),
        the mode of living suitable for those who have gone
        forth.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you all bear it in
        mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; One who is intent upon what is good and
        who is thoughtful should practice it.</p>
        <p>&quot;A bhikkhu should not wander about at the wrong
        time but should walk the village for food at the right
        time, as one who goes about at the wrong time is (liable
        to be) obsessed by attachment, therefore Awakened Ones do
        not walk (for alms) at the wrong time.
        [4]&nbsp;&nbsp;Sights, sounds, tastes, scents and bodily
        contacts overwhelm (the minds of) beings.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Being rid of desire for these sense objects, at the right
        time, one may enter (the village) for the morning
        meal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having duly obtained food, going back
        alone and sitting down in a secluded place, being
        inwardly thoughtful and not letting the mind go out to
        external objects, a bhikkhu should develop self-control.</p>
        <p>&quot;If he should speak with a lay-disciple, with
        someone else or with another bhikkhu, he should speak on
        the subtle Dhamma, not slandering others nor
        gossiping.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some set themselves up as
        disputants in opposition to others; those of little
        wisdom we do not praise; attachments bind them and they
        are carried away by their emotions. [5]</p>
        <p>&quot;Having heard the Dhamma taught by the Sugata
        [6]&nbsp;&nbsp;and considered it, a disciple of Him of
        excellent wisdom should wisely make use of food, a
        dwelling, a bed, a seat and water for washing the
        robe.&nbsp;&nbsp; But a bhikkhu should not be soiled by
        (clinging to) these things, as a lotus is not wetted by a
        drop of water.</p>
        <p>&quot;Now I will tell you the layman's
        duty.&nbsp;&nbsp; Following it a lay-disciple would be
        virtuous; for it is not possible for one occupied with
        the household life to realize the complete bhikkhu
        practice (dhamma).</p>
        <p>&quot;He should not kill a living being, nor cause it
        to be killed, nor should he incite another to
        kill.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not injure any being, either strong
        or weak, in the world.</p>
        <p>&quot;A disciple should avoid taking anything from
        anywhere knowing it (to belong to another).&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He should not steal nor incite another to
        steal.&nbsp;&nbsp; He should completely avoid theft.</p>
        <p>&quot;A wise man should avoid unchastity as (he would
        avoid falling into) a pit of glowing
        charcoal.&nbsp;&nbsp; If unable to lead a celibate life,
        he should not go to another's wife.</p>
        <p>&quot;Having entered a royal court or a company of
        people he should not speak lies.&nbsp;&nbsp; He should
        not speak lies (himself) nor incite others to do
        so.&nbsp;&nbsp; He should completely avoid falsehood.</p>
        <p>&quot;A layman who has chosen to practice this Dhamma
        should not indulge in the drinking of
        intoxicants.&nbsp;&nbsp; He should not drink them nor
        encourage others to do so; realizing that it leads to
        madness. Through intoxication foolish people perform evil
        deeds and cause other heedless people to do
        likewise.&nbsp;&nbsp; He should avoid intoxication, this
        occasion for demerit, which stupefies the mind, and is
        the pleasure of foolish people.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>&quot;Do not kill a living being;<br>
            do not take what is not given;<br>
            do not speak a lie;<br>
            do not drink intoxicants;<br>
            abstain from sexual intercourse;<br>
            do not eat food at night, at the wrong time;<br>
            do not wear flower-garlands nor use perfumes;<br>
            use the ground as a bed or sleep on a mat.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>&quot;This is called the eight-factored observance
        made known by the known by the Awakened One who has
        reached the end of suffering.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>With a gladdened mind observe the observance day
    (uposatha), complete with its eight factors, on the
    fourteenth, fifteenth and eighth days of the (lunar)
    fortnight and also the special holiday of the half
    month.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning, with a pure heart and a
    joyful mind, a wise man, after observing the uposatha, should
    distribute suitable food and drink to the community of
    bhikkhus.&nbsp;&nbsp; He should support his mother and father
    as his duty and engage in lawful trading.&nbsp;&nbsp; A
    layman who carries this out diligently goes to the devas
    called &quot;Self-radiant.&quot; [7]</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; Gotama is the Buddha's clan or family
        name. [2]&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the commentary, the
        Pali term &quot;gati&quot; translated here as
        &quot;behavior&quot; means either &quot;trend of
        character&quot; or &quot;the destination of beings after
        death.&quot;</p>
        <p>[3]&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Vasava&quot; is one of the

        should listen very attentively.</p>
        <p>[4]&nbsp;&nbsp; The right time for going into the
        village to collect alms-food is in the
        forenoon.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a bhikkhu went about
        indiscriminately, &quot;at the wrong time,&quot; he might
        see things or have experiences that would endanger his
        life of purity and cause him to revert to the lay life.</p>

    <h3><a name="3">3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wrong Conduct</a></h3>
    <p>&quot;The practice of Dhamma, [1]&nbsp;&nbsp;the practice
    of continence, [2]&nbsp;&nbsp;mastery of this is said to be
    best if a person has gone forth from home to the homeless
    life.&nbsp;&nbsp; But if he is garrulous and, like a brute,
    delights in hurting others, his life is evil and his impurity
    increases.</p>
    <p>&quot;A quarrelsome bhikkhu shrouded by delusion, does not
    comprehend the Dhamma taught by the Awakened One when it is
    revealed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Annoying those practiced in meditation,
    being led by ignorance, he is not aware that his defiled path
    leads to Niraya-hell.&nbsp;&nbsp; Falling headlong, passing
    from womb to womb, from darkness to (greater) darkness, such
    a bhikkhu undergoes suffering hereafter for certain.</p>
    <p>&quot;As a cesspool filled over a number of years is
    difficult to clean, similarly, whoever is full of impurity is
    difficult to make pure.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whoever you know to be
    such, bhikkhus, bent on worldliness, having wrong desires,
    wrong thoughts, wrong behavior and resort, being completely
    united avoid him, sweep him out like dirt, remove him like
    rubbish.&nbsp;&nbsp; Winnow like chaff the
    non-recluses.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having ejected those of wrong
    desires, of wrong behavior and resort, be pure and mindful,
    dwelling with those who are pure.&nbsp;&nbsp; Being united
    and prudent you will make an end to suffering.&quot;</p>

    <p>&quot;By developing what habit, what conduct, what actions
    may man be correctly established in and arrive at the highest
    goal?</p>
    <p>&quot;He should respect his elders and not be envious of
    them.&nbsp;&nbsp; He should know the right time for seeing
    his teacher. [1]&nbsp;&nbsp;If a talk on Dhamma has started
    he should know the value of the opportunity and should listen
    carefully to the well-spoken words. [2]</p>
    <p>&quot;When the time is right let him go to his teacher's
    presence, unassuming, putting aside stubbornness.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Let him keep in mind and practice (what he has
    learned):&nbsp;&nbsp;the meaning and the text (of the
    Teaching), self-control and (the other virtues of) the Holy
    Life. [3]&nbsp;&nbsp;Delighting in the Dhamma, devoted to the
    Dhamma, established in the Dhamma, skilled in investigating
    the Dhamma, [4]&nbsp;&nbsp;let him not indulge in talk
    harmful to the (practice of) Dhamma.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let him be
    guided by well-spoken truths.</p>
    <p>&quot;Abandoning the uttering of laughter and
    lamentations; giving up anger, fraud, hypocrisy, longing,
    conceit, violence, harshness, moral taints and infatuation;
    let him live without pride, self controlled. Understanding is
    essential (for listening) to a well-spoken word. Learning and
    understanding are essential to meditation, but a man who is
    hasty and heedless does not increase his wisdom and learning.</p>
    <p>&quot;Those who are devoted to the Dhamma made known by
    the Noble Ones (ariya) are unsurpassed in speech, thought and

    is no friend who, anticipating conflict, is always alert in
    looking out for weaknesses. [1]&nbsp;&nbsp;But he on whom one
    can rely, like a child sleeping on its mother's breast, is
    truly a friend who cannot be parted from one by others.</p>
    <p>&quot;One who bears the human burden of responsibility,

    venerated, as the devas venerate Inda, their Lord.
    [1]&nbsp;&nbsp;He, (a teacher) of great learning, thus
    venerated, will explain the Dhamma, being well-disposed
    towards one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having paid attention and considered
    it, a wise man, practicing according to Dhamma, becomes
    learned, intelligent and accomplished by associating himself
    diligently with such a teacher.</p>
    <p>&quot;But by following an inferior and foolish teacher who
    has not gained (fine) understanding of the Dhamma and is
    envious of others, one will approach death without
    comprehending the Dhamma and unrelieved of doubt.</p>
    <p>&quot;If a man going down into a river, swollen and
    swiftly flowing, is carried away by the current -- how can he
    help others across?</p>
    <p>&quot;Even so, he who has not comprehended the Dhamma, has
    not paid attention to the meaning as expounded by the
    learned, being himself without knowledge and unrelieved of
    doubt -- how can he make others understand?</p>
    <p>&quot;But if (the man at the river) knows the method and
    is skilled and wise, by boarding a strong boat equipped with
    oars and a rudder, he can, with its help, set others
    across.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, he who is experienced and has a
    well-trained mind, who is learned and dependable,
    [2]&nbsp;&nbsp;clearly knowing, he can help others to
    understand who are willing to listen and ready to receive.

    <h3><a name="8">8.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Training</a></h3>
    <p>&quot;Violence breeds misery; [1]&nbsp;&nbsp;look at
    people quarreling.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will relate the emotion
    agitating me.</p>
    <p>&quot;Having seen people struggling and contending with
    each other like fish in a small amount of water, fear entered
    me.&nbsp;&nbsp; The world is everywhere insecure, every
    direction is in turmoil; desiring an abode for myself I did
    not find one uninhabited. [2]&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw
    contention as the sole outcome, aversion increased in me; but
    then I saw an arrow [3]&nbsp;&nbsp;here, difficult to see,
    set in the heart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pierced by it, once runs in
    every direction, but having pulled it out one does not run
    nor does one sink. [4]</p>
    <p>&quot;Here follows the (rule of) training: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;Whatever are worldly fetters, may you not be
        bound by them!&nbsp;&nbsp;Completely break down sensual
        desires and practice so as to realize Nibbana for
        yourself!</p>
        <p>&quot;A sage should be truthful, not arrogant, not
        deceitful, not given to slandering others, and should be
        without anger.&nbsp;&nbsp; He should remove the evil of
        attachment and wrongly directed longing; he should
        conquer drowsiness, lassitude and sloth, and not dwell in
        indolence.&nbsp;&nbsp; A man whose mind is set on Nibbana
        should not be arrogant.&nbsp;&nbsp; He should not lapse
        into untruth nor generate love for sense
        objects.&nbsp;&nbsp; He should thoroughly understand (the
        nature of) conceit and abstain from violence.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He should not delight in what is past, nor be fond of
        what is new, nor sorrow for what is disappearing, nor
        crave for the attractive.</p>
        <p>&quot;Greed, I say, is a great flood; it is a
        whirlpool sucking one down, a constant yearning, seeking
        a hold, continually in movement; [5] difficult to cross
        is the morass of sensual desire.&nbsp;&nbsp; A sage does
        not deviate from truth, a brahmana [6]&nbsp;&nbsp;stands
        on firm ground; renouncing all, he is truly called
        'calmed'.</p>
        <p>&quot;Having actually experienced and understood the
        Dhamma he has realized the highest knowledge and is
        independent. [7]&nbsp;&nbsp;He comports himself correctly
        in the world and does not envy anyone here.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He who has left behind sensual pleasures, an attachment
        difficult to leave behind, does not grieve nor have any
        longing; has has cut across the stream and is unfettered.</p>
        <p>&quot;Dry out that which is past, [8]&nbsp;&nbsp;let
        there be nothing for you in the future. [9]&nbsp;&nbsp;If
        you do not grasp at anything in the present you will go
        about at peace.&nbsp;&nbsp; One who, in regard to this
        entire mindbody complex, has no cherishing of it as
        'mine,' and who does not grieve fro what is non-existent
        truly suffers no loss in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; For him
        there is no thought of anything as 'this is mine' or
        'this is another's'; not finding any state of ownership,
        and realizing, 'nothing is mine,' he does not grieve.</p>
        <p>&quot;To be not callous, not greedy, at rest and
        unruffled by circumstances -- that is the profitable
        result I proclaim when asked about one who does not
        waver.&nbsp;&nbsp; For one who does not crave, who has
        understanding, there is no production (of new kamma).
        [10]&nbsp;&nbsp;Refraining from initiating (new kamma) he
        sees security everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp; A sage does not
        speak in terms of being equal, lower or
        higher.&nbsp;&nbsp; Calmed and without selfishness he
        neither grasps nor rejects.&quot;</p>

    <h3><a name="10">10.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Great Struggle</a></h3>
    <p>&quot;When, near the river Neranjara, I exerted myself in
    meditation for attaining to security from bondage,
    [1]&nbsp;&nbsp; there came Namuci [2]&nbsp;&nbsp; speaking
    words of compassion:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;'You are emaciated and ill-looking, you are near
        to death!&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand parts of you belong to
        death and only a fraction of you is alive. Live, good
        Sir!&nbsp;&nbsp;It is better to live.&nbsp;&nbsp; Living
        you may perform meritorious deeds.&nbsp;&nbsp; From
        practicing celibacy and tending the sacrificial fire much
        merit is made, but what is obtained from
        striving?&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to enter the path of
        exertion, it is difficult to do, difficult to
        maintain.'&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Mara spoke these words whilst standing in the presence of
    the Awakened One.&nbsp;&nbsp; To Mara speaking thus, the Lord
    replied:</p>
    <p>&quot;You who are the friend of the negligent, O Evil One,
    for what reason have you come here?&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who
    still have use for merit Mara may consider worthwhile
    addressing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have faith and energy and
    wisdom.&nbsp;&nbsp; Being thus bent on striving why do you
    ask me to live?&nbsp;&nbsp;This wind will wither the currents
    of the rivers, why should not my exertion dry up even the
    blood?&nbsp;&nbsp;When the blood dries up, the bile and
    phlegm wither.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the wasting away of the flesh
    the mind becomes more and more serene and my mindfulness,
    wisdom and concentration are established more
    firmly.&nbsp;&nbsp; In me, who abides enduring such an
    extreme experience, the mind does not long for sensual
    pleasures.&nbsp;&nbsp; See the purity of a being!</p>
    <p>&quot;Sensual desire is your first army, the second is
    called discontent, the third is hunger and thirst, the fourth
    craving, the fifth sluggishness and laziness, the sixth fear,
    the seventh indecision, and the eighth disparagement of
    others and stubbornness:&nbsp;&nbsp;gain, fame, honor,
    prestige wrongly acquired and whoever praises himself and
    despises others -- these, Namuci, are your armies, the Dark
    One's [3]&nbsp;&nbsp; striking forces.&nbsp;&nbsp; A lazy,
    cowardly person cannot overcome them, but by conquering them
    one gains bliss.</p>
    <p>&quot;I wear munja-grass! [4]&nbsp;&nbsp; Shame on life
    here in this world!&nbsp;&nbsp;It is better for me to die in
    battle than to live defeated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some recluses and
    brahmanas are not seen (exerting themselves) here, so
    immersed are they (in worldliness).&nbsp;&nbsp; They are not
    aware of that path by which those of perfect conduct walk.</p>
    <p>&quot;Seeing the surrounding army ready and Mara mounted
    (on his elephant), I am going out to fight so that he may not
    shift me from my position.&nbsp;&nbsp; This army of yours
    which the world together with the devas is unable to subdue,
    that I will destroy with wisdom, like an unbaked clay-bowl
    with a stone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having mastered the mind and firmly
    established mindfulness I shall wander from country to
    country guiding many disciples.&nbsp;&nbsp; And they will be
    diligent and energetic in practicing my teaching, the
    teaching of one without sensual desire, and they will go
    where, having gone, one does not grieve.&quot;</p>
    <p>Mara:&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;For seven years I followed the Lord
    step by step but did not find an opportunity to defeat that
    mindful Awakened One.&nbsp;&nbsp; A crow flew around a stone
    having the colour of fat:&nbsp;&nbsp;'Can we find even here
    something tender?&nbsp;&nbsp;May it be something to eat?'</p>
    <p>&quot;Not finding anything edible the crow left that
    place.&nbsp;&nbsp; As with the crow and the stone, we leave

    who is dead.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those people who were seen and heard
    and called by their names as such and such, only their names
    remain when they have passed away.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those greedy
    for objects of attachment do not abandon sorrow, grief and
    avarice, but sages having got rid of possessions, live
    perceiving security.&nbsp;&nbsp; For a bhikkhu with a
    detached mind, living in a secluded dwelling, it is right,
    they say, that he no longer shows himself in the abodes (of
    existence). [1]</p>
    <p>&quot;A sage who is completely independent does not make
    close friends or enemies.&nbsp;&nbsp; In him sorrow and
    selfishness do not stay, like water on a lotus
    leaf.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a lotus is not wetted by water, so a
    sage is not affected by what is seen or heard, nor by what is
    perceived by the other senses.&nbsp;&nbsp; A wise man is not
    deluded by what is perceived by the senses.&nbsp;&nbsp; He
    does not expect purity by any other way. [2]&nbsp;&nbsp; He
    is neither pleased nor is he repelled (by the six
    sense-objects).&quot;</p>

    <h3><a name="12">12.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Arrow</a></h3>
    <p>&quot;Unindicated and unknown is the length of life of
    those subject to death.&nbsp;&nbsp; Life is difficult and
    brief and bound up with suffering. There is no means by which
    those who are born will not die.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having reached
    old age, there is death.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the natural
    course for a living being.&nbsp;&nbsp; With ripe fruits there
    is the constant danger that they will fall.&nbsp;&nbsp; In
    the same way, for those born and subject to death, there is
    always the fear of dying.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the pots made
    by a potter all end by being broken, so death is (the
    breaking up) of life.</p>
    <p>&quot;The young and old, the foolish and the wise, all are
    stopped short by the power of death, all finally end in
    death.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of those overcome by death and passing to
    another world, a father cannot hold back his son, nor
    relatives a relation.&nbsp;&nbsp; See!&nbsp;&nbsp;While the
    relatives are looking on and weeping, one by one each mortal
    is led away like an ox to slaughter.</p>
    <p>&quot;In this manner the world is afflicted by death and
    decay.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the wise do not grieve, having
    realized the nature of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; You do not know
    the path by which they came or departed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not
    seeing either end you lament in vain.&nbsp;&nbsp; If any
    benefit is gained by lamenting, the wise would do
    it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only a fool would harm himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Yet through weeping and sorrowing the mind does not become
    calm, but still more suffering is produced, the body is
    harmed and one becomes lean and pale, one merely hurts
    oneself.&nbsp;&nbsp; One cannot protect a departed one (<i>peta</i>)
    by that means.&nbsp;&nbsp; To grieve is in vain.</p>
    <p>&quot;By not abandoning sorrow a being simply undergoes
    more suffering. Bewailing the dead he comes under the sway of
    sorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp; See other men faring according to their
    deeds!&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence beings tremble here with fear when
    they come into the power of death.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever they
    imagine, it (turns out) quite different from
    that.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the sort of disappointment that
    exists.&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at the nature of the
    world!&nbsp;&nbsp;If a man lives for an hundred years, or
    even more, finally, he is separated from his circle of
    relatives and gives up his life in the end. Therefore, having
    listened to the Arahant, [1]&nbsp;&nbsp; one should give up
    lamenting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing a dead body, one should know,
    &quot;He will not be met by me again.&quot; As the fire in a
    burning house is extinguished with water, so a wise,
    discriminating, learned and sensible man should quickly drive
    away the sorrow that arises, as the wind (blows off) a piece
    of cotton.&nbsp;&nbsp; He who seeks happiness should withdraw
    the arrow:&nbsp;&nbsp;his own lamentations, longings and
    grief.</p>
    <p>&quot;With the arrow withdrawn, unattached, he would
    attain to peace of mind; and when all sorrow has been
    transcended he is sorrow-free and has realized Nibbana.</p>

    <h3><a name="13">13.&nbsp;&nbsp; On Purity</a></h3>
    <p>&quot;'Here I see one who is pure, entirely free of
    sickness.&nbsp;&nbsp; By seeing him a man may attain to
    purity!'</p>
    <p>&quot;Convinced of that and thinking it 'the highest,' he
    believes it to be knowledge when he contemplates 'the pure
    one.' [1]&nbsp;&nbsp; But if by sights man can gain
    purification or if through such knowledge he could leave
    suffering behind, then, one who still has attachments could
    be purified by another. [2]&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this is
    merely the opinion of those who so assert.</p>
    <p>&quot;The (true) brahmana [3]&nbsp;&nbsp; has said one is
    not purified by another, nor by what is seen, heard or
    perceived (by the other senses), nor, by the performance of
    ritual observances.&nbsp;&nbsp; He (the true brahmana) is not
    defiled by merit or demerit.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having given up what
    he had (previously) grasped at, he no longer engages in
    producing (any kamma).&nbsp;&nbsp; Having left a former
    (object) they attach themselves to another, dominated by
    craving they do not go beyond attachment.&nbsp;&nbsp; They
    reject and seize, like a monkey letting go of a branch to
    take hold of another.</p>
    <p>&quot;A person having undertaken a ritual act goes this
    way and that, fettered by his senses.&nbsp;&nbsp; But one
    with a wide wisdom, having understood and gone into the
    Dhamma with his experience, does not go this way and
    that.&nbsp;&nbsp; For a person indifferent towards all
    conditions, whatever is seen, heard or cognized, he is one
    who sees it as it really is and lives with clarity (of
    mind).&nbsp; &nbsp; With what could he be identified in the
    world?</p>
    <p>&quot;They do not speculate nor pursue (any notion), they
    do not claim perfect purity.&nbsp;&nbsp; Loosening the knot
    (of clinging) with which they are bound, they do not have
    longing anywhere in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; The (true)
    brahmana who has gone beyond limitations, having understood
    and seen there is no longer any assumption for him, he is
    neither disturbed by lust nor agitated by
    revulsion.&nbsp;&nbsp; For him there is nothing upheld as
    'the highest'.&quot;</p>

    <h3><a name="14">14.&nbsp;&nbsp; On Views</a></h3>
    <p>&quot;A person who associates himself with certain views,
    considering them as best and making them supreme in the
    world, he says, because of that, that all other views are
    inferior; therefore he is not free from contention (with
    others).&nbsp;&nbsp; In what is seen, heard, cognized and in
    ritual observances performed, he sees a profit for
    himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just by laying hold of that view he
    regards every other view as worthless. Those skilled (in
    judgement) [1]&nbsp;&nbsp; say that (a view becomes) a bond
    if, relying on it, one regards everything else as
    inferior.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore a bhikkhu should not depend
    on what is seen, heard or cognized, nor upon ritual
    observances.&nbsp;&nbsp; He should not present himself as
    equal to, nor imagine himself to be inferior, nor better
    than, another.&nbsp;&nbsp; Abandoning (the views) he had
    (previously) held and not taking up (another), he does not
    seek a support even in knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp; Among those who
    dispute he is certainly not one to take sides.&nbsp;&nbsp; He
    does not [have]&nbsp;&nbsp; recourse to a view at
    all.&nbsp;&nbsp; In whom there is no inclination to either
    extreme, for becoming or non-becoming, here or in another
    existence, for him there does not exist a fixed viewpoint on
    investigating the doctrines assumed (by others).&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Concerning the seen, the heard and the cognized he does not
    form the least notion.&nbsp;&nbsp; That brahmana
    [2]&nbsp;&nbsp; who does not grasp at a view, with what could
    he be identified in the world?</p>
    <p>&quot;They do not speculate nor pursue (any notion);
    doctrines are not accepted by them.&nbsp;&nbsp; A (true)

    source of suffering.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mettagu, I will tell it to

    sufferings evident in the world have arisen from worldly
    attachments. Whoever ignorantly creates an attachment, that
    stupid person comes upon suffering again and
    again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore a man of understanding should
    not create attachment, seeing it is the source of
    suffering.&quot;</p>

    living mindfully one may pass beyond the entanglements of the
    world.&quot;</p>
    <p><i>The Lord</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whatever you clearly
    comprehend, Mettagu, above, below, across and in between, get
    rid of delight in it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rid yourself of habitual
    attitudes [3]&nbsp;&nbsp; and (life affirming) consciousness.
    [4]&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not continue in existence.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Living thus, mindful and vigilant, a bhikkhu who has forsaken
    selfish attachments may, by understanding, abandon suffering,
    birth and old age, sorrow and grief, even here in this
    life.&quot;</p>
    <p><i>Mettagu</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I rejoice in the words of
    the great sage.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well explained, O Gotama, is the
    state of non-attachment. [5]&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord has surely
    abandoned suffering as this Dhamma has been realized by him.
    They will certainly abandon suffering who are constantly
    admonished by you, O Sage.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having understood, I

    admonish me also.&quot;</p>

    to sensual (-realm) existence, he has certainly crossed this
    flood.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having crossed beyond he is untainted and
    freed from doubt.&nbsp;&nbsp; One who has discarded this
    clinging (leading) to renewal of existence is a man who has

    things arise?&nbsp;&nbsp;Come tell me this.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;From being too endeared (to objects and persons)
    arise contentions and disputes, lamentations and sorrows
    along with avarice, selfishness and conceit, arrogance and
    slander.&nbsp;&nbsp; Contentions and disputes are linked with
    selfishness, and slander is born of contention.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;What are the sources of becoming endeared in the
    world?&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the sources of whatever passions
    prevail in the world, of longings and fulfillments that are
    man's goal (in life)?&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Desires are the source of becoming endeared (to
    objects and persons) in the world, also of whatever passions
    prevail.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the sources of longings and
    fulfillments that are man's goal (in life).&quot; [1]</p>
    <p>&quot;Now what is the source of desire in the
    world?&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the cause of judgements
    [2]&nbsp;&nbsp; that arise; of anger, untruth, doubts and
    whatever other (similar) states that have been spoken of by
    the Recluse (i.e., the Buddha)?&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;It is pleasant, it is unpleasant, so people speak in
    the world; and based upon that arises desire.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Having seen the appearing and disappearing of material things
    a man makes his judgements in the world. [3]&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Anger, untruth and doubts, these states arise merely because
    of the existence of this duality. [4]&nbsp;&nbsp; Let a
    doubter train himself by way of insight to understand these
    states as taught by the Recluse.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;What is the source of thinking things as pleasant or
    unpleasant?&nbsp;&nbsp;When what is absent are these states
    not present?&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the meaning of appearing and
    disappearing?&nbsp;&nbsp;Explain the source of it to
    me.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;The pleasant and the unpleasant have their source in
    sense-impression.&nbsp;&nbsp; When this sense-impression is
    absent, these states are not present.&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea of
    appearing and disappearing is produced from this, I
    say.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;What is the source of
    sense-impression?&nbsp;&nbsp;From what arises so much
    grasping?&nbsp;&nbsp;By the absence of what is there no
    selfish attachment?&nbsp;&nbsp;By the disappearance of what
    is sense-impression not experienced?&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Sense-impression is dependent upon the mental and
    the material. Grasping has its source in wanting
    (something).&nbsp;&nbsp; What not being present there is no
    selfish attachment.&nbsp;&nbsp; By the disappearance of
    material objects sense-impression is not experienced.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;For whom does materiality disappear?&nbsp;&nbsp;How
    do pleasure and discomfort cease to be?&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me
    how it ceases so that I may be satisfied in my mind that I
    have understood it.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;His perception is not the ordinary kind, nor is his
    perception abnormal; [5]&nbsp;&nbsp; he is not without
    perception nor is his perception (of materiality) suspended.
    [6]&nbsp;&nbsp; -- to such an one immateriality ceases.
    [7]&nbsp;&nbsp; Perception is indeed the source of the world
    of multiplicity.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;What we asked, you have explained.&nbsp;&nbsp; We
    now ask another question.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell us the answer to
    it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not some of the learned declare
    purification of the spirit [8]&nbsp; &nbsp; as the highest
    state to be attained?&nbsp;&nbsp;And do not others speak of
    something else as the highest?&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Some of the learned do declare purification of the
    spirit as the highest.&nbsp;&nbsp; But contrary to them some
    teach a doctrine of annihilation. -- those clever ones
    declare this to be (final liberation) without basis of life's
    fuel remaining.&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing that these (theorists)
    rely on (mere opinions for their statements) a sage
    investigates that upon which they rely.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having
    understood and being free (from theories) he will not dispute
    with anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp; The wise do not enter into any
    existence.&quot;</p>
    <p>-- vv.&nbsp;&nbsp; 862-877</p>
    <p>Notes: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; Man's longings, hopes and aspirations
        and their satisfaction are his refuge giving him an aim
        in life.</p>
        <p>[2]&nbsp;&nbsp; Judgements or evaluations of things
        motivated by craving for them or by opinions of them as
        being desirable or otherwise.</p>
        <p>[3]&nbsp;&nbsp; The &quot;appearing&quot; of the
        pleasant and the &quot;disappearing&quot; of the
        unpleasant is judged to be &quot;good.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The &quot;appearance&quot; of the unpleasant and the
        &quot;disappearance&quot; of the pleasant is judged to be
        &quot;bad.&quot;</p>
        <p>[4]&nbsp;&nbsp; I.e., of the pleasant and the
        unpleasant.</p>
        <p>[5]&nbsp;&nbsp; He is neither insane nor mentally
        disturbed (Comy).</p>
        <p>[6]&nbsp;&nbsp; He has not attained the state of
        cessation of perception [of perception]&nbsp;&nbsp; and
        feeling (<i>sanna-vedayita nirodha</i>) nor the
        immaterial absorptions (<i>arupajjhana</i>) (Comy). In
        the former perception completely ceases, but in the
        latter there is still the perception of an immaterial
        object.</p>
        <p>[7]&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the commentary what
        remains after these four negations is the state of one
        who has reached the highest of the fine-material
        absorptions (<i>rupajjhana</i>) and is in the process of
        attaining the first immaterial absorption.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        This answers the question &quot;for whom does (the
        perception of) materiality disappear?&quot; And as
        &quot;pleasure and discomfort&quot; have previously been
        stated to &quot;have their source in
        sense-impression,&quot; in other words, the Perception of
        material objects, the second question is answered too.</p>
        <p>[8]&nbsp;&nbsp; The term &quot;spirit&quot; (<i>yakkha</i>)
        is equivalent here to &quot;being&quot; or
        &quot;man.&quot;</p>
        <p>[9]&nbsp;&nbsp; An alternative rendering of this
        sentence could be:&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Do not some of the
        learned declare (the immaterial attainments) as the
        highest state, as man's purification?&quot;</p>

    have I asked Sakka [1]&nbsp;&nbsp; but the Seeing One has not
    answered me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have heard a divine sage replies

    one is not seen by the King of Death?&quot;</p>
    <p><i>The Lord</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Look upon the world as
    empty, [2]&nbsp;&nbsp; Mogharaja, ever mindful; uprooting the

        Buddha is also sometimes called Sakyamuni, &quot;the sage
        of the Sakyas.&quot;</p>
        <p>[2]&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Samyutta-nikaya (vol. iv, p.
        54) the Venerable Ananda asks:&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How is
        the world empty, venerable sir?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the
        Lord replies:&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Because, Ananda, it is
        empty of a self or what belongs to a self, therefore it
        is said, 'the world is empty.'&quot;</p>
        <p>The &quot;world,&quot; here and elsewhere, is not to
        be understood in the way we usually think of it, but is
        defined as the five aggregates (khandha) of material
        form, feeling, perception, activities and consciousness,
        or as the eye and visible objects, the ear and sounds,
        etc., that is to say, the whole of our subjective and

    <h3><a name="21">21.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Noble One's Teaching</a></h3>
    <p>&quot;See how the world together with the devas has
    self-conceit for what is not-self.&nbsp;&nbsp; Enclosed by
    mind-and-body it imagines, 'This is real.' Whatever they
    imagine it to be, it is quite different from
    that.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is unreal, of a false nature and
    perishable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nibbana, not false in nature, that
    the Noble Ones [2]&nbsp;&nbsp; know as true.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Indeed, by the penetration of the true, they are completely
    stilled and realize final deliverance.</p>
    <p>&quot;Forms, sounds, tastes, scents, bodily contacts and
    ideas which are agreeable, pleasant and charming, all these,
    while they last, are deemed to be happiness by the world with
    its devas.&nbsp;&nbsp; But when they cease that is agreed by
    all to be unsatisfactory.&nbsp;&nbsp; By the Noble Ones, the
    cessation of the existing body [1]&nbsp;&nbsp; is seen as
    happiness.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the reverse of the outlook of
    the whole world.</p>
    <p>&quot;What others call happiness, that the Noble Ones
    declare to be suffering.&nbsp;&nbsp; What others call
    suffering, that the Noble Ones have found to be
    happiness.&nbsp;&nbsp; See how difficult it is to understand
    the Dhamma!&nbsp;&nbsp;Herein those without insight have
    completely gone astray.&nbsp;&nbsp; For those under the veil
    (of ignorance) it is obscured, for those who cannot see it is
    utter darkness.&nbsp;&nbsp; But for the good and the wise it
    is as obvious as the light for those who can see.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Even though close to it, the witless who do not know the
    Dhamma, do not comprehend it.</p>
    <p>&quot;By those overcome by attachment to existence, those
    who drift with the stream of existence, those in the realm of
    Mara, this Dhamma is not properly understood.&nbsp;&nbsp; Who
    other than the Noble Ones, are fit to fully understand that
    state, by perfect knowledge of which they realize final
    deliverance, free from defilements? [2]</p>
