  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus have I heard:&nbsp;&nbsp; the Sammaditthi Sutta.</P>
  <P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, all such questions spoken by the Elder as " 'One of 
  right view, one of right view' is said, friends.&nbsp;&nbsp; In what way is a 
  noble disciple one of right view &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?"&nbsp;&nbsp; or 
  "And what, friends, is the unwholesome 
  &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?"&nbsp;&nbsp; -- these are questions showing a 
  desire to expound.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, since those who know, those who do not 
  know, those outside the Dispensation, those within it, those who speak by 
  hearsay, etc., and those who speak by personal knowledge, say "one of right 
  view," therefore, taking it as an expression (common) to the many, he touched 
  upon it twice, saying "One of right view, one of right view" is said, friends 
  (<I>sammaditthi sammaditthi ti avuso vuccati</I>).&nbsp;&nbsp; The intention 
  here is this:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Others say 'one of right view,' and still others 
  say 'one of right view.' Since that is said, in what way, friends, is a noble 
  disciple one of right view in respect of meaning and 
  characteristic?"&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, one of right view is one possessing a 
  lucid and praiseworthy view (<I>sobhanaya pasatthaya ca ditthiya 
  samannagato</I>).&nbsp;&nbsp; But when this word "right view" is used to 
  signify a state (rather than a person endowed with that state), it then means 
  a lucid and praiseworthy view.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#1" name=r1>[1]</A></P>
  <P>This right view is twofold:&nbsp;&nbsp; mundane (<I>lokiya</I>) and 
  supramundane (<I>lokuttara</I>).&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, the knowledge of kamma as 
  one's own and knowledge which is in conformity with the (Four Noble) Truths 
  are mundane right view; or, in brief, (mundane right view is) all 
  understanding that is accompanied by the taints.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#2" name=r2>[2]</A> 
  Understanding connected with the noble paths and fruits is supramundane right 
  view.<A href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#3" 
  name=r3>[3]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; The person possessing right view is of three 
  kinds:&nbsp;&nbsp; the worldling (<I>puthujjana</I>), the disciple in higher 
  training (<I>sekha</I>), and the one beyond training 
  (<I>asekha</I>).&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, the worldling is of two 
  kinds:&nbsp;&nbsp; one outside the Dispensation and one within the 
  Dispensation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, one outside the Dispensation who believes in 
  kamma is one of right view on account of the view of kamma as one's own, but 
  not on account of that which is in conformity with the truths, because he 
  holds to the view of self.&nbsp;&nbsp; One within the Dispensation is of right 
  view on account of both.&nbsp;&nbsp; The disciple in higher training is one of 
  right view on account of fixed right view,<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#4" 
  name=r4>[4]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; the one beyond training on account of (the right 
  view) that is beyond training.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#5" name=r5>[5]</A></P>
  <P>But here "one of right view" is intended as one possessing supramundane 
  wholesome right view, which is fixed in destiny and emancipating.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Hence he said:&nbsp;&nbsp; whose view is straight, who has perfect confidence 
  in the Dhamma, and has arrived at this true Dhamma (<I>ujugata'ssa ditthi 
  dhamme aveccappasadena samannagato agato imam saddhammam</I>).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Because of its going straight without deviating to either extreme, or because 
  of its going straight by removing all crookedness such as bodily crookedness, 
  etc., supramundane right view is "straight."&nbsp;&nbsp; One possessing that 
  view also possesses perfect confidence, unshakable confidence, in the ninefold 
  supramundane Dhamma.<A href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#6" 
  name=r6>[6]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; And by becoming disentangled from all the thickets 
  of (wrong) views, by abandoning all the defilements, by departing from the 
  round of rebirths, by bringing the practice to its consummation, he is said to 
  have come by the noble path to this "true Dhamma" proclaimed by the 
  Enlightened One, that is, Nibbana, the plunge into the Deathless.</P>
  <H3><FONT color=#800080>The Wholesome and the Unwholesome</FONT></H3>
  <P>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Understands the unwholesome (<I>akusalan ca 
  pajanati</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; he understands the unwholesome called the ten 
  courses of unwholesome kamma (action), penetrating this by way of function 
  with the understanding that has Nibbana as its object as "This is 
  suffering."&nbsp;&nbsp; (Understands) the root of the unwholesome 
  (<I>akusalamulan ca pajanati</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; And he understands the 
  unwholesome root which has become the root condition of that (unwholesome), 
  penetrating this, in the same way, as "This is the origin of 
  suffering."&nbsp;&nbsp; The same method applies here also in regard to "the 
  wholesome" and "the root of the wholesome."&nbsp;&nbsp; And, as it is here, so 
  in all the following sections, the understanding of the subject should be 
  understood by way of function.</P>
  <P>In that way (<I>ettavata pi</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; by this much; by this 
  understanding of the unwholesome, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is one of right view 
  (<I>sammaditthi hoti</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; he possesses supramundane right view of 
  the kind aforesaid.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose view is straight 
  &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and has arrived at this true 
  Dhamma:&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point the summary version of the teaching has been 
  expounded.&nbsp;&nbsp; And this (part of) the teaching itself was brief; but 
  for those bhikkhus it should be understood that the penetration (of the 
  meaning) through right attention occurred in detail.</P>
  <P>But in the second section (Section 4) it should be understood that the 
  teaching too, as well as the penetration through attention, is stated in 
  detail.</P>
  <P>Herein, the bhikkhus [at the council at the Great Monastery held to 
  rehearse the Pitakas]&nbsp;&nbsp; said:&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the brief exposition 
  the two lower paths are discussed, in the detailed exposition the two higher 
  paths," taking into account the passage at the end of the sections setting 
  forth the detailed exposition that begins "he entirely abandons the underlying 
  tendency to lust."&nbsp;&nbsp; But the Elder (presiding over the council) 
  said:&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the brief exposition the four paths are expounded as a 
  group, and also in the detailed exposition."<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#7" name=r7>[7]</A></P>
  <P>This query into the brief and detailed expositions which has been cleared 
  up here should be understood in all the following sections in the way stated 
  here.&nbsp;&nbsp; From here on we shall only comment on terms that are new or 
  obscure.</P>
  <P><FONT color=#000080><STRONG>The Unwholesome Courses of 
  Action</STRONG></FONT></P>
  <P>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, firstly, in the detailed exposition of the first 
  section:&nbsp;&nbsp; as regards the passage beginning killing living beings is 
  unwholesome (<I>panatipato kho avuso akusalam</I>), "unwholesome" should be 
  understood by way of the occurrence of unwholesomeness, or as what is opposed 
  to the wholesome, which is to be dealt with below (Section 6).&nbsp;&nbsp; As 
  to characteristic, it is blameworthy and has painful result, or it is 
  defiled.&nbsp;&nbsp; This, in the first place, is the comment upon the general 
  terms here.</P>
  <P>But as regards the particular terms, the phrase killing living beings means 
  the slaughter of a living being, the destruction of a living 
  being.&nbsp;&nbsp; And here a living being (<I>pana</I>) is, according to 
  ordinary usage, a being (<I>satta</I>); in the ultimate sense it is the life 
  faculty.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Killing living beings" is the volition to kill on the 
  part of one who is aware, in respect of a living being, that it is a living 
  being, and which (volition), manifesting itself through one or the other of 
  the doors of body and speech, initiates activity resulting in the cutting off 
  of the life faculty.</P>
  <P>In relation to beings such as animals, etc., which lack moral qualities 
  (<I>guna</I>), it is less blameworthy in respect of small living beings and 
  more blameworthy in respect of beings with large bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Why?&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the magnitude of the effort involved.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  And when the effort involved is equal, because of the magnitude of the object 
  (the being killed).&nbsp;&nbsp; In relation to beings such as humans, etc., 
  who possess moral qualities, it is less blameworthy in respect of beings with 
  few good qualities and more blameworthy in respect of beings with great 
  qualities.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the size of the body and moral qualities are 
  equal, however, it is less blameworthy when the defilements and activity are 
  mild, and more blameworthy when they are strong:&nbsp;&nbsp; so it should be 
  understood.</P>
  <P>There are five constituents for this (act of killing a living 
  being):&nbsp;&nbsp; a living being, awareness that it is a living being, the 
  mind to kill, activity, and the death (of the being) thereby.</P>
  <P>There are six means:&nbsp;&nbsp; one's own person, command, a missile, a 
  fixed contrivance, a magical spell, supernormal power.</P>
  <P>To explore this matter in detail, however, would involve too much 
  diffuseness.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore we shall not explore it in detail, or any 
  other subject similar in kind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who wish to go into the 
  matter may do so by looking it up in the Samantapasadika, the Vinaya 
  Commentary.<A href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#8" 
  name=r8>[8]</A></P>
  <P>Taking what is not given (<I>adinnadana</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; the carrying off 
  of others' goods, stealing, robbery, is what is meant.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, 
  "what is not given" is another's possession, which the other may use as he 
  likes without incurring penalty or blame.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Taking what is not 
  given" is the volition to steal on the part of one who is aware, in respect of 
  another's possession, that it is another's possession, and which (volition) 
  initiates activity resulting in the taking of that thing.</P>
  <P>That (taking of what is not given) is less blameworthy when the other's 
  property is of low value, and more blameworthy when it is of high 
  value.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the high value of the object 
  (stolen).&nbsp;&nbsp; When the value of the objects is equal, the act is more 
  blameworthy when the object belongs to one of outstanding qualities, and less 
  blameworthy when the object belongs to one who, in comparison, is inferior 
  with respect to moral qualities.</P>
  <P>There are five constituents of this act:&nbsp;&nbsp; another's possession, 
  awareness that it is another's possession, the mind to steal, the activity, 
  and the carrying off (of the object) thereby.</P>
  <P>There are six means:&nbsp;&nbsp; one's own person, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; (as for 
  killing). And these (acts of stealing) may be classed, according to the way in 
  which they occur, by way of the following:&nbsp;&nbsp; taking by theft, by 
  force, by concealment, by stratagem, by fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp; This here is in 
  brief; the details, however, are given in the Samantapasadika.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#9" name=r9>[9]</A></P>
  <P>Misconduct in sensual pleasures (<I>kamesu micchacara</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  here, "in sensual pleasures" (<I>kamesu</I>) means in regard to sexual 
  intercourse.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Misconduct" is entirely reprehensible vile 
  conduct.&nbsp;&nbsp; As to characteristic, sexual misconduct is the volition 
  to transgress bounds occurring through the body door by way of unrighteous 
  intent.</P>
  <P>Herein, out of bounds for men, firstly, are the twenty kinds of women, that 
  is, the ten beginning with those protected by the mother, namely, "protected 
  by the mother, protected by the father, protected by the mother and father, 
  protected by the brother, protected by the sister, protected by relatives, 
  protected by the clan, protected by the law, under protection, entailing a 
  penalty"; and the ten beginning with those purchased with money, namely, "one 
  purchased with money, one who lives (with a man) by her own desire, one who 
  lives (with a man) on account of wealth, one who lives (with a man) on account 
  of cloth, one who is given (in marriage with the ceremony of) dipping the hand 
  in water, one who has been (taken to wife and) relieved of her burden-carrying 
  head-pad, one who is a slave and a wife, one who is a servant and a wife, one 
  who is carried off in a raid, one engaged at so much a time."<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#10" name=r10>[10]</A></P>
  <P>Then, as concerns women, for the twelve kinds of women consisting of the 
  two, namely, under protection and entailing a penalty, and the ten beginning 
  with those purchased with money, other men are out of bounds.</P>
  <P>This sexual misconduct is less blameworthy when (the person) out of bounds 
  is without good qualities such as virtue, etc., and more blameworthy when (the 
  person) possesses good qualities such as virtue, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 
  four constituents of this act:&nbsp;&nbsp; an object which is out of bounds, 
  the mind to engage in that, the effort to engage, and consent to the union of 
  sexual organs.<A href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#11" 
  name=r11>[11]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; The means is single:&nbsp;&nbsp; one's own 
  person.</P>
  <P>False speech (<I>musavada</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; "false" (<I>musa</I>) is the 
  verbal effort or bodily effort for destroying welfare (made) by one bent on 
  deceiving.&nbsp;&nbsp; "False speech" is the volition initiating the verbal 
  effort or bodily effort of deceiving another on the part of one intent on 
  deceiving.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to another method, "false" means an unreal, 
  untrue case, "speech" the communication of that as being real, 
  true.&nbsp;&nbsp; As to characteristic, "false speech" is the volition of one 
  desiring to communicate to another an untrue case as being true, which 
  (volition) initiates such an act of communication.</P>
  <P>This is less blameworthy when the welfare destroyed is slight, and more 
  blameworthy when the welfare destroyed is great.&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, when it 
  occurs on the part of householders who, not wishing to give away some 
  belonging of theirs, say "I do not have it," it is less blameworthy; when one 
  who is a witness speaks (falsely) for the purpose of destroying another's 
  welfare, it is more blameworthy.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of those gone forth, 
  when it occurs by their saying as a joke, after they have obtained just a 
  little oil or ghee, in the manner of the Puranas, "Today the oil is flowing in 
  the village just like a river," then it is less blameworthy; but for those who 
  speak (as a witness) saying that they have seen what they have not seen it is 
  more blameworthy.</P>
  <P>There are four constituents of this act:&nbsp;&nbsp; an untrue case, the 
  mind to deceive, the appropriate effort, the communicating of that meaning to 
  another.&nbsp;&nbsp; The means is single:&nbsp;&nbsp; one's own person 
  only.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is to be regarded as the performing of the action of 
  deceiving another by means of the body or by means of something attached to 
  the body or by means of speech.&nbsp;&nbsp; If, through that action, the other 
  understands that meaning, one is bound by the kamma of false speech at the 
  very moment of the volition initiating the action.</P>
  <P>Malicious speech, etc.:&nbsp;&nbsp; The kind of speech that creates in the 
  heart of the person to whom it is spoken affection for oneself and voidness 
  (of affection) for another is malicious speech (<I>pisuna vaca</I>). The kind 
  of speech by which one makes both oneself and another harsh, the kind of 
  speech which is also itself harsh, being pleasant neither to the ear nor to 
  the heart -- that is harsh speech (<I>pharusa vaca</I>).&nbsp;&nbsp; That by 
  which one gossips idly, without meaning, is gossip 
  (<I>samphappalapa</I>).&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, the volition that is the root cause 
  of these gains the name "malicious speech," etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; And that only is 
  intended here.</P>
  <P>Therein, malicious speech is the volition of one with a defiled mind, which 
  (volition) initiates an effort by body or by speech either to cause division 
  among others or to endear oneself (to another).&nbsp;&nbsp; It is less 
  blameworthy when the person divided has few good qualities, and more 
  blameworthy when such a one has great qualities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its constituents 
  are four:&nbsp;&nbsp; another person to be divided, the intention to divide, 
  (thinking) "Thus these will be separated and split" or the desire to endear 
  oneself, (thinking) "Thus I shall become loved and intimate," the appropriate 
  effort, the communicating of that meaning to that person.</P>
  <P>Harsh speech is the entirely harsh volition initiating an effort by body or 
  by speech to wound another's vital feelings.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an example 
  given for the purpose of making it clear:&nbsp;&nbsp; A village boy, it is 
  said, went to the forest without heeding his mother's words.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Unable to make him turn back, she scolded him angrily, saying:&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  "May a wild buffalo chase you!"&nbsp;&nbsp; Then a buffalo appeared before him 
  right there in the forest.&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy made an asseveration of truth, 
  saying:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let it not be as my mother said but as she 
  thought!"&nbsp;&nbsp; The buffalo stood as though tied there.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Thus, although the means (employed) was that of wounding the vital feelings, 
  because of the gentleness of her mind it was not harsh speech.&nbsp;&nbsp; For 
  sometimes parents even say to their children, "May robbers chop you to 
  pieces!"&nbsp;&nbsp; yet they do not even wish a lotus leaf to fall upon 
  them.&nbsp;&nbsp; And teachers and preceptors sometimes say to their pupils, 
  "What is the use of these shameless and heedless brats?&nbsp;&nbsp; Drive them 
  out!"&nbsp;&nbsp; yet they wish for their success in learning and 
  attainment.</P>
  <P>Just as, through gentleness of mind, speech is not harsh, so through 
  gentleness of speech, speech does not become unharsh; for the words "Let him 
  sleep in peace" spoken by one wishing to kill are not unharsh 
  speech.&nbsp;&nbsp; But harsh speech is such on account of harshness of mind 
  only.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is less blameworthy when the person to whom it is spoken 
  has few good qualities, and more blameworthy when such a one has great 
  qualities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its constituents are three:&nbsp;&nbsp; another to be 
  abused, an angry mind, the abusing.</P>
  <P>Gossip is the unwholesome volition initiating an effort by body or by 
  speech to communicate what is purposeless.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is less blameworthy 
  when indulged in mildly, and more blameworthy when indulged in 
  strongly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its constituents are two:&nbsp;&nbsp; the being intent 
  on purposeless stories such as the Bharata war or the abduction of Sita, etc., 
  and the telling of such stories.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#12" name=r12>[12]</A></P>
  <P>Covetousness (<I>abhijjha</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; It covets, thus it is 
  covetousness; "having become directed towards others' goods, it occurs through 
  inclination towards them" is the meaning.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has the 
  characteristic of coveting others' goods thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, that this were 
  mine!"&nbsp;&nbsp; It is less blameworthy and more blameworthy as in the case 
  of taking what is not given.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its constituents are two:&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  another's goods, and the inclination for them to be one's own.&nbsp;&nbsp; For 
  even though greed has arisen based on another's goods, it is not classed as a 
  (completed) course of kamma so long as one does not incline to them as one's 
  own (with the thought), "Oh, that this were mine!"</P>
  <P>Ill will (<I>byapada</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; It injures welfare and happiness, 
  thus it is ill will (<I>hitasukham byapadayati ti byapado</I>).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Its characteristic is the mental defect (of wishing for) the destruction of 
  others.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is less blameworthy and more blameworthy as in the case 
  of harsh speech.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its constituents are two:&nbsp;&nbsp; another 
  being, and the wish for that being's destruction.&nbsp;&nbsp; For even though 
  anger has arisen based on another being, there is no breach of a course of 
  kamma so long as one does not wish, "Oh, that this being might be cut off and 
  destroyed!"</P>
  <P>Wrong view (<I>micchaditthi</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; It sees wrongly due to the 
  absence of a correct grasp of things, thus it is wrong view.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its 
  characteristic is the mistaken view that "there is no (result from) giving," 
  etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is less blameworthy and more blameworthy as in the case of 
  gossip.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, it is less blameworthy when not fixed in 
  destiny, and more blameworthy when fixed.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#13" 
  name=r13>[13]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; Its constituents are two:&nbsp;&nbsp; a mistaken 
  manner of grasping the basis (for the view), and the appearance of that 
  (basis) in accordance with the manner in which it has been grasped.</P>
  <P>Now the exposition of these ten courses of unwholesome kamma should be 
  understood in five ways:&nbsp;&nbsp; as to mental state (<I>dhammato</I>), as 
  to category (<I>kotthasato</I>), as to object (<I>arammanato</I>), as to 
  feeling (<I>vedanato</I>), and as to root (<I>mulato</I>).</P>
  <P>Herein, as to mental state:&nbsp;&nbsp; The first seven among these are 
  volitional states only.&nbsp;&nbsp; The three beginning with covetousness are 
  associated with volition.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#14" name=r14>[14]</A></P>
  <P>As to category:&nbsp;&nbsp; The eight consisting of the first seven and 
  wrong view are courses of kamma only, not roots.&nbsp;&nbsp; Covetousness and 
  ill will are courses of kamma and also roots; for covetousness, having arrived 
  at the (state of) a root, is the unwholesome root greed, and ill will is the 
  unwholesome root hate.</P>
  <P>As to object:&nbsp;&nbsp; Killing living beings, because it has the life 
  faculty as object, has a formation as object.&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking what is not 
  given has beings as object or formations as object.&nbsp;&nbsp; Misconduct in 
  sensual pleasures has formations as object by way of tangible object; but some 
  say it also has beings as object.&nbsp;&nbsp; False speech has beings or 
  formations as object; likewise malicious speech.&nbsp;&nbsp; Harsh speech has 
  only beings as object.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gossip has either beings or formations as 
  object by way of the seen, heard, sensed and cognized; likewise covetousness. 
  Ill will has only beings as object.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wrong view has formations as 
  object by way of the states belonging to the three planes (of being).</P>
  <P>As to feeling:&nbsp;&nbsp; Killing living beings has painful feeling; for 
  although kings, seeing a robber, say laughingly, "Go and execute him," their 
  volition consummating the action is associated only with pain.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Taking what is not given has three feelings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Misconduct (in 
  sensual pleasures) has two feelings, pleasant and neutral, but in the mind 
  which consummates the action there is no neutral feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp; False 
  speech has three feelings; likewise malicious speech.&nbsp;&nbsp; Harsh speech 
  has painful feeling only.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gossip has three feelings.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Covetousness has two feelings, pleasant and neutral; likewise wrong 
  view.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ill will has painful feeling only.</P>
  <P>As to root:&nbsp;&nbsp; Killing living beings has two roots, by way of hate 
  and delusion; taking what is not given, by way of hate and delusion or by way 
  of greed and delusion; misconduct, by way of greed and delusion; false speech, 
  by way of hate and delusion or by way of greed and delusion; likewise for 
  malicious speech and gossip; harsh speech, by way of hate and 
  delusion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Covetousness has one root, by way of delusion; likewise 
  ill will.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wrong view has two roots, by way of greed and 
  delusion.</P>
  <P><FONT color=#000080><STRONG>The Unwholesome Roots</STRONG></FONT></P>
  <P>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Greed is a root of the unwholesome, etc.:&nbsp;&nbsp; It is 
  greedy, thus it is greed (<I>lubbhati ti lobho</I>); it offends against (it 
  hates), thus it is hate (<I>dussati ti doso</I>); it deludes, thus it is 
  delusion (<I>muyhati ti moho</I>).&nbsp;&nbsp; Among these, greed is itself 
  unwholesome in the sense that it is blameworthy and has painful results; and 
  it is a root of these unwholesome (deeds) beginning with killing living 
  beings, for some in the sense that it is an associated originative cause, for 
  some in the sense that it is a decisive support condition.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it 
  is an unwholesome root.&nbsp;&nbsp; This too is said:&nbsp;&nbsp; "One who is 
  lustful, friends, overwhelmed and with mind obsessed by lust, kills a living 
  being" (A.3:71/i,216; text slightly different).&nbsp;&nbsp; The same method 
  applies to the state of being unwholesome roots in the cases of hate and 
  delusion.</P>
  <P><FONT color=#000080><STRONG>The Wholesome Courses of 
  Action</STRONG></FONT></P>
  <P>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstention from killing living beings is wholesome 
  (<I>panatipata veramani</I>), etc.:&nbsp;&nbsp; Here "killing living beings," 
  etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; have the same meaning as aforesaid.&nbsp;&nbsp; It crushes 
  the hostile, thus it is abstention (<I>veram manati ti veramani</I>); the 
  meaning is that it abandons the hostile.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or:&nbsp;&nbsp; with that 
  as the instrument one abstains (<I>viramati</I>), the syllable <I>ve</I> being 
  substituted for the syllable vi.&nbsp;&nbsp; This here is, in the first place, 
  the commentary on the phrasing.</P>
  <P>But as to the meaning, abstention is refraining (<I>virati</I>) associated 
  with wholesome consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is stated thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  "For one refraining from killing living beings, that which is on that occasion 
  the leaving off, the refraining" (Vibh.&nbsp;&nbsp; 285), that is the 
  refraining associated with wholesome consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp; As to kind, it 
  is threefold:&nbsp;&nbsp; refraining in the presence of opportunity, 
  refraining because of an undertaking, and refraining because of eradication 
  (of defilements).</P>
  <P>Herein, refraining in the presence of an opportunity 
  (<I>sampattavirati</I>) is to be understood as the refraining which occurs in 
  those who have not undertaken any training rule but who do not transgress when 
  an opportunity for doing so presents itself because they reflect upon their 
  birth, age, learning, etc., like the lay follower Cakkana in the island of Sri 
  Lanka.</P>
  <P>When he was a boy, it is said, his mother developed an illness, and the 
  doctor said, "Fresh hare's flesh is needed."&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Cakkana's 
  brother sent him, saying, "Go, dear, and hunt in the field."&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
  went there.&nbsp;&nbsp; On that occasion a hare had come to eat the young 
  corn.&nbsp;&nbsp; On seeing him it bolted swiftly, but it got entangled in a 
  creeper and squealed "kiri, kiri."&nbsp;&nbsp; Guided by the sound, Cakkana 
  went and caught it, thinking, "I will make medicine for my 
  mother."&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he thought again, "This is not proper for me, that I 
  should deprive another of life for the sake of my mother's life."&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  So he released it, saying "Go and enjoy the grass and the water with the other 
  hares in the forest."&nbsp;&nbsp; When his brother asked him, "Did you get a 
  hare, dear?"&nbsp;&nbsp; he told him what had happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; His 
  brother scolded him.&nbsp;&nbsp; He went to his mother and determined upon an 
  asseveration of truth:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since I was born I am not aware that I 
  have ever intentionally deprived a living being of life."&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Straightaway his mother became well.</P>
  <P>Refraining because of an undertaking (<I>samadanavirati</I>) is to be 
  understood as the refraining which occurs in those who do not transgress in a 
  particular case because they have undertaken training rules, giving up even 
  their own lives in the undertaking of the training rules and in what is 
  superior to that, like the lay follower who dwelt at Uttaravaddhamana 
  Mountain.</P>
  <P>It is said that after undertaking the training rules from the Elder Pingala 
  Buddharakkhita who lived in the Ambariya Monastery, he was plowing a 
  field.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then his ox got lost.&nbsp;&nbsp; Searching for it, he 
  climbed up Uttaravaddhamana Mountain.&nbsp;&nbsp; There a large serpent seized 
  him.&nbsp;&nbsp; He thought, "Let me cut off his head with this sharp 
  axe."&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he thought again, "This is not proper for me, that I 
  should break a training rule that I have undertaken in the presence of my 
  honored teacher."&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinking up to the third time, "I will give up 
  my life but not the training rule," he threw the sharp hand axe that was slung 
  on his shoulder into the forest.&nbsp;&nbsp; Straightaway the creature 
  released him and went away.</P>
  <P>Refraining because of eradication (of defilements) 
  (<I>samucchedavirati</I>) is to be understood as the refraining associated 
  with the noble path.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the arising of this even the thought, 
  "I will kill a living being," does not occur to the noble persons.</P>
  <P>This refraining is called "wholesome" (<I>kusala</I>) because of the 
  occurrence of wholesomeness (<I>kosalla</I>); or because of shedding the vile 
  (<I>kucchitassa salanato</I>).&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, evil conduct is commonly 
  called "weeds" (<I>kusa</I>) and it mows this down (<I>lunati</I>), thus it is 
  called "wholesome."</P>
  <P>As in the case of the unwholesome, so for these courses of wholesome kamma 
  the exposition should be understood in five ways:&nbsp;&nbsp; as to mental 
  state, as to category, as to object, as to feeling, and as to root.</P>
  <P>Herein, as to mental state:&nbsp;&nbsp; The first seven among these can be 
  both volitions and abstinences; the last three are associated with volition 
  only.</P>
  <P>As to category:&nbsp;&nbsp; The first seven are courses of kamma only, not 
  roots. The last three are courses of kamma and also roots.&nbsp;&nbsp; For 
  non-covetousness, having arrived at the (state of) a root, is the wholesome 
  root non-greed; non-ill will is the wholesome root non-hate; and right view is 
  the wholesome root non-delusion.</P>
  <P>As to object:&nbsp;&nbsp; The objects of these are the same as the objects 
  of killing living beings, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; For abstention is spoken of in 
  relation to something which can be transgressed.&nbsp;&nbsp; But just as the 
  noble path, which has Nibbana as object, abandons the defilements, so too 
  should these courses of kamma, which have the life faculty, etc., as object, 
  be understood to abandon the kinds of evil conduct beginning with killing 
  living beings.</P>
  <P>As to feeling:&nbsp;&nbsp; All have pleasant feeling or neutral 
  feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp; For there is no painful feeling which arrives at the 
  wholesome.</P>
  <P>As to root:&nbsp;&nbsp; The first seven courses of kamma have three roots 
  by way of non-greed, non-hate, and non-delusion in one who abstains by means 
  of consciousness associated with knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp; They have two roots in 
  one who abstains by means of consciousness dissociated from knowledge.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#15" name=r15>[15]</A> 
  Non-covetousness has two roots in one who abstains by means of consciousness 
  associated with knowledge, one root (in one who abstains) by means of 
  consciousness dissociated from knowledge. Non-greed, however, is not by itself 
  its own root.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same method applies in the case of non-ill 
  will.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right view always has two roots, by way of non-greed and 
  non-hate.&nbsp;&nbsp; <A href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#16" 
  name=r16>[16]</A></P>
  <P><FONT color=#000080><STRONG>The Wholesome Roots</STRONG></FONT></P>
  <P>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-greed is a root of the wholesome (<I>alobho 
  kusalamulam</I>), etc.:&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-greed is not greed; this is a term for 
  the state that is opposed to greed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same method applies in the 
  case of non-hate and non-delusion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Among these, non-greed is 
  itself wholesome; and it is a root of these wholesome (courses of kamma) 
  beginning with abstention from killing living beings, for some in the sense 
  that it is an associated originative cause and for some in the sense that it 
  is a decisive support condition.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it is a wholesome 
  root.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same method applies to the state of being wholesome 
  roots in the cases of non-hate and non-delusion.</P>
  <P><FONT color=#000080><STRONG>Conclusion on the Unwholesome and the 
  Wholesome</STRONG></FONT></P>
  <P>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, summing up the meaning of all that has been set forth 
  in brief and in detail, he states the concluding section beginning with the 
  words when a noble disciple.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, has thus understood the 
  wholesome (<I>evam akusalam pajanati</I>) means:&nbsp;&nbsp; has thus 
  understood the unwholesome by way of the ten courses of unwholesome kamma as 
  described.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same method applies in the case of the root of the 
  unwholesome, etc.</P>
  <P>Up to this point, by a single method, emancipation as far as Arahantship 
  has been expounded for one who has the Four Noble Truths as his meditation 
  subject.&nbsp;&nbsp; How?&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, the ten courses of unwholesome 
  kamma with the exception of covetousness, and the (ten) courses of wholesome 
  kamma, are the truth of suffering.&nbsp;&nbsp; These two states -- 
  covetousness and the greed which is a root of the unwholesome -- are, 
  literally speaking, the truth of the origin.&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking 
  figuratively, however, all the courses of kamma are the truth of suffering, 
  and all the wholesome and unwholesome roots are the truth of the origin.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#17" 
  name=r17>[17]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; The non-occurrence of both is the truth of 
  cessation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The noble path fully understanding suffering, 
  abandoning its origin, and understanding its cessation is the truth of the 
  path.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus two truths are stated in their own nature and two are 
  to be understood by way of the guideline of conversion.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#18" name=r18>[18]</A></P>
  <P>He entirely abandons the underlying tendency to lust (<I>so sabbaso 
  raganusayam pahaya</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; Understanding thus the unwholesome, etc., 
  he abandons in all ways the underlying tendency to lust.&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
  abolishes the underlying tendency to aversion (<I>patighanusayam 
  pativinodetva</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; and he removes in all ways too the underlying 
  tendency to aversion, is what is meant.&nbsp;&nbsp; Up to this point the path 
  of non-return is stated.<A href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#2" 
  name=r19>[19]&nbsp;</A>&nbsp; He extirpates the underlying tendency to the 
  view and conceit "I am" (<I>asmi ti ditthimananusayam 
  samuhanitva</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; he extricates the underlying tendency to the 
  view and conceit which occurs in the mode of grasping the five aggregates as a 
  group (with the notion) "I am," due to failure to distinguish any state among 
  them.</P>
  <P>Therein, by the phrase the underlying tendency to the view and conceit "I 
  am" (<I>ditthimananusayam</I>) what is meant is the underlying tendency to 
  conceit which is similar to a view (<I>ditthisadisam 
  mananusayam</I>).&nbsp;&nbsp; For this underlying tendency to conceit is 
  similar to a view because it occurs (with the notion) "I am"; therefore it is 
  stated thus.&nbsp;&nbsp; And one who wishes to understand this conceit "I am" 
  in detail should look up the Khemaka Sutta in the Khandhiyavagga 
  (S.22:89/iii,126ff.).</P>
  <P>By abandoning ignorance (<I>avijjam pahaya</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; having 
  abandoned ignorance, the root of the round (of existence).&nbsp;&nbsp; And 
  arousing true knowledge (<I>vijjam uppadetva</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; having aroused 
  the true knowledge of the path of Arahantship which completely extricates that 
  ignorance.&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point the path of Arahantship is stated.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#20" 
  name=r20>[20]&nbsp;</A>&nbsp; He here and now makes an end of suffering 
  (<I>ditth'eva dhamme dukkhass'antakaro hoti</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; in this very 
  existence he becomes one who cuts off the suffering of the round.</P>
  <P>In that way too (<I>ettavatapi kho avuso</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; he marks off 
  (this first part of) the teaching; by way of the attention and penetration 
  stated in this exposition of the courses of kamma, is what is meant. The rest 
  is as aforesaid.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus he concludes the exposition by means of the 
  path of non-return and the path of Arahantship.</P>

  <P>9.&nbsp;&nbsp; Saying, "Good, friend," 
  &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (etc.) 
  &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp; and has arrived at this true 
  Dhamma":&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, having heard the Venerable Sariputta's exposition 
  of the four truths under the heading of the wholesome and the unwholesome, the 
  bhikkhus delighted in his words with the statement, "Good, friend," and 
  rejoiced with the mind that aroused that statement; what is meant is that they 
  agreed by word and approved by mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, because the Elder was 
  competent to give an exposition on the four truths in diverse ways -- as (the 
  Blessed One) said:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bhikkhus, Sariputta is able to propound, to 
  teach, the Four Noble Truths in detail" (M.141/iii, 248); or because he had 
  said "in that way too," being desirous of giving a further exposition, the 
  bhikkhus, being desirous of hearing the teaching of the four truths by another 
  method, asked him a further question.&nbsp;&nbsp; By asking "But, friend, 
  might there be another way?&nbsp;&nbsp; Would there be another 
  case?"&nbsp;&nbsp; they asked another question additional to that question 
  asked and answered (already) by the Venerable Sariputta himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Or what is meant is that they asked a question subsequent to the previous 
  one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, answering them, the Elder said, "There might be, 
  friends," and so on.</P>
  <P>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, this is the elucidation of the terms that are not 
  clear.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nutriment (<I>ahara</I>) is a condition 
  (<I>paccaya</I>).&nbsp;&nbsp; For a condition nourishes its own fruit, 
  therefore it is called nutriment.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#21" name=r21>[21]</A></P>
  <P>11.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of beings that already have come to be (<I>bhutanam va 
  sattanam</I>), etc.:&nbsp;&nbsp; Here come to be (<I>bhuta</I>) means come to 
  birth, reborn; seeking a new existence (<I>sambhavesinam</I>) means those who 
  seek, search for, existence, birth, production.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therein, among the 
  four kinds of generation,<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#22" 
  name=r22>[22]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; beings born from eggs and from the womb are said 
  to be "seeking a new existence" as long as they have not broken out of the 
  eggshell or the placenta.&nbsp;&nbsp; When they have broken out of the 
  eggshell or the placenta and emerged outside, they are said to have "come to 
  be."&nbsp;&nbsp; The moisture-born and the spontaneously born are said to be 
  "seeking a new existence" at the first moment of consciousness; from the 
  second moment of consciousness onwards they are said to have "come to be."</P>
  <P>Or alternatively, "come to be" is born, reproduced; this is a term for 
  those who have destroyed the cankers (<I>Arahants</I>), who are reckoned 
  thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; "They have come to be only, but they will not come to be 
  again."&nbsp;&nbsp; "Seeking a new existence" means they seek a new existence; 
  this is a term for worldlings and disciples in higher training who seek a new 
  existence in the future too, because they have not abandoned the fetter of 
  being.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus by these two terms he includes all beings in all 
  ways.</P>
  <P>For the maintenance (<I>thitiya</I>); for the purpose of maintaining. For 
  the support (<I>anuggahaya</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; for the purpose of supporting, 
  for the purpose of helping.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is merely a difference of words, 
  but the meaning of the two terms is one only.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or alternatively, 
  "for the maintenance" is for the non-interruption of this or that being by 
  means of the serial connection of arisen states.&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the support" 
  is for the arising of unarisen (states).&nbsp;&nbsp; And both these 
  expressions should be regarded as applicable in both cases thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  "For the maintenance and support of those that have come to be, and for the 
  maintenance and support of those seeking a new existence."</P>
  <P><FONT color=#000080><STRONG>The Four Kinds of Nutriment</STRONG></FONT></P>
  <P>Physical food as nutriment (lit.&nbsp;&nbsp; "food made into a ball") 
  (<I>kabalinkaro aharo</I>) is nutriment that can be swallowed after making it 
  into a ball; this is a term for the nutritive essence which has as its basis 
  boiled rice, junket, etc.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#23" 
  name=r23>[23]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; Gross or subtle (<I>olariko va sukhumo 
  va</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; it is gross because of the grossness of the basis, and 
  subtle because of the subtlety of the basis.&nbsp;&nbsp; But because physical 
  nutriment is included in subtle materiality, by way of its individual essence 
  it is subtle only.<A href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#24" 
  name=r24>[24]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; And also that grossness and subtlety should be 
  understood relatively in respect of the basis.</P>
  <P>The nutriment of peacocks is subtle compared with the nutriment of 
  crocodiles.&nbsp;&nbsp; Crocodiles, they say, swallow stones, and these 
  dissolve on reaching their stomachs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Peacocks eat such animals as 
  snakes, scorpions, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the nutriment of hyenas is subtle 
  compared with the nutriment of peacocks.&nbsp;&nbsp; These, they say, eat 
  horns and bones thrown away three years before, and these become soft as yams 
  as soon as they are moistened with their saliva.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, the 
  nutriment of elephants is subtle compared with the nutriment of 
  hyenas.&nbsp;&nbsp; For these eat the branches of various trees, 
  etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; The nutriment of the gayal buffalo, the antelope, the deer, 
  etc., is subtler than the nutriment of elephants.&nbsp;&nbsp; These, they say, 
  eat the sapless leaves of various kinds of trees, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
  nutriment of cows is subtler than their nutriment; they eat fresh and dried 
  grass.&nbsp;&nbsp; The nutriment of hares is subtler than their nutriment; 
  that of birds is subtler than that of hares; that of barbarians is subtler 
  than that of birds; that of village headmen is subtler than that of 
  barbarians; that of kings and kings' ministers is subtler than village 
  headmens'; that of a Wheel-turning Monarch is subtler than their 
  nutriment.&nbsp;&nbsp; The earth deities' nutriment is subtler than that of a 
  Wheel-turning Monarch.&nbsp;&nbsp; The nutriment of the deities of the Four 
  Great Kings is subtler than that of the earth deities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus 
  nutriment should be elaborated up to that of the deities who wield power over 
  others' creations.<A href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#25" 
  name=r25>[25]</A> But saying, "Their nutriment is subtle," the end is 
  reached.</P>
  <P>And here, in a basis that is gross, the nutritive essence is limited and 
  weak; in one that is subtle, it is strong.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus one who has drunk 
  even a full bowl of gruel is soon hungry again and desirous of eating 
  anything; but after drinking even a small amount of ghee, he will not want to 
  eat for the whole day.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therein, it is the basis that dispels 
  fatigue, but it is unable to preserve; but the nutritive essence preserves, 
  though it cannot dispel fatigue.&nbsp;&nbsp; But when the two are combined 
  they both dispel fatigue and preserve.</P>
  <P>Contact as the second (<I>phasso dutiyo</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; The sixfold 
  contact beginning with eye-contact should be understood as the second of these 
  four kinds of nutriment.&nbsp;&nbsp; And this is the method of the teaching 
  itself; therefore it should not be inquired into here, saying "For this reason 
  it is the second, or the third."&nbsp;&nbsp; Mental volition 
  (<I>manosancetana</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; volition (<I>cetana</I>) itself is stated. 
  Consciousness (<I>vinnanam</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; any kind of consciousness 
  whatever.</P>
  <P>It may be asked here:&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the meaning of condition is the 
  meaning of nutriment, then, when other conditions also exist for beings, why 
  are only these four stated?"&nbsp;&nbsp; It should be said in 
  reply:&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is because they are the special conditions for personal 
  continuity."&nbsp;&nbsp; For physical nutriment is the special condition for 
  the material body of beings that eat physical nutriment; as regards the group 
  of mental constituents, contact is (the special condition) for feeling, mental 
  volition for consciousness, and consciousness for 
  mentality-materiality.&nbsp;&nbsp; As it is said:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just as, 
  bhikkhus, this body has nutriment for its maintenance, is maintained in 
  dependence on nutriment, and without nutriment is not maintained" 
  (S.46:2/v,64); and likewise:&nbsp;&nbsp; "With contact as condition, feeling; 
  &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with formations as condition, 
  consciousness; &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with consciousness as 
  condition, mentality-materiality" (S.12:1/ii,1, etc.).</P>
  <P>What is this nutriment, and what does it nourish?&nbsp;&nbsp; Physical 
  nutriment nourishes the materiality with nutritive essence as eighth;<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#26" 
  name=r26>[26]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; contact as nutriment nourishes the three 
  feelings; mental volition as nutriment nourishes the three kinds of being; 
  consciousness as nutriment nourishes the mentality-materiality of 
  rebirth-linking.</P>
  <P>How?&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as it is placed in the mouth, physical food as 
  nutriment brings into being the eight kinds of materiality 
  (aforesaid).&nbsp;&nbsp; Then each lump of cooked rice ground by the teeth, on 
  being swallowed, brings into being unit after unit of the eight kinds of 
  materiality.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it nourishes the materiality with nutritive 
  essence as eighth.</P>
  <P>But with contact as nutriment, when contact productive of pleasant feeling 
  arises it nourishes pleasant feeling; contact productive of painful feeling 
  nourishes painful feeling; contact productive of neither-painful-nor-pleasant 
  feeling nourishes neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus in 
  all ways contact as nutriment nourishes the three kinds of feeling.</P>
  <P>In the case of mental volition as nutriment, kamma leading to sense-sphere 
  being nourishes sense-sphere being; kamma leading to fine-material and 
  immaterial being nourishes its respective kind of being.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus in 
  all ways mental volition as nutriment nourishes the three kinds of being.</P>
  <P>But with consciousness as nutriment, it is said that it nourishes, by way 
  of conascence condition, etc., the three (immaterial) aggregates associated 
  with itself at the moment of rebirth-linking and the thirty kinds of 
  materiality that arise by way of triple continuity.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus 
  consciousness nourishes the mentality-materiality of rebirth-linking.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#27" name=r27>[27]</A></P>
  <P>And here, by the words "mental volition as nutriment nourishes the three 
  kinds of being," only the wholesome and unwholesome volition accompanied by 
  taints is meant; by the words "consciousness nourishes the 
  mentality-materiality of rebirth-linking," only rebirth-linking consciousness 
  is meant.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, these are to be understood indiscriminately as 
  nutriments as well because they nourish the states that are associated with 
  them and originated by them.</P>
  <P><FONT color=#000080><STRONG>The Four Functions</STRONG></FONT></P>
  <P>As regards these four kinds of nutriment, physical food as nutriment 
  accomplishes the function of nutriment by sustaining, contact by contacting 
  (touching), mental volition by accumulating, consciousness by cognizing.</P>
  <P>How?&nbsp;&nbsp; Physical food as nutriment, by sustaining, is for the 
  maintenance of beings by maintaining the body.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this body, 
  though generated by kamma, is sustained by physical food and stands for ten 
  years or a hundred years up to the end of the life-span.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like 
  what?&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a child which, though given birth by the mother, is 
  nurtured by the milk, etc., given to him to drink by the wet-nurse and thus 
  lives long.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, as a house is supported by a prop.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  This too has been said (untraced):&nbsp;&nbsp; "Great king, just as, when a 
  house is collapsing, they prop it up with other timber, and that house, being 
  propped up by other timber, does not collapse, so too this body is supported 
  by nutriment, persists in dependence upon nutriment."</P>
  <P>Thus physical food as nutriment accomplishes the function of nutriment by 
  sustaining.&nbsp;&nbsp; Accomplishing it thus, physical food as nutriment 
  becomes a condition for two material continuities, namely, for that originated 
  by nutriment and that kammically acquired.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#29" 
  name=r28>[28]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a condition for the kamma-born materiality 
  by becoming its preserver.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a condition for that originated 
  by nutriment by becoming its producer.</P>
  <P>Then contact, by contacting the object which is the basis for pleasure, 
  etc., is "for the maintenance of beings" by causing the occurrence of pleasant 
  feeling, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mental volition, accumulating by way of wholesome 
  and unwholesome kamma, is "for the maintenance of beings" because it provides 
  the root of existence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consciousness, by cognizing, is "for the 
  maintenance of beings" by causing the occurrence of mentality-materiality.</P>
  <P><FONT color=#000080><STRONG>The Four Dangers</STRONG></FONT></P>
  <P>Now, while these are accomplishing their function of nutriment by 
  sustaining, etc., four dangers are to be seen:&nbsp;&nbsp; the danger of 
  desire in the case of physical food as nutriment; the danger of approach in 
  the case of contact; (the danger) of accumulating in the case of mental 
  volition; and (the danger) of launching [into a new existence here or there by 
  way of taking rebirth-linking]&nbsp;&nbsp; in the case of consciousness.</P>
  <P>What are the reasons (for this)?&nbsp;&nbsp; Because, having aroused desire 
  for physical food, beings face cold, etc., to undertake such work as checking, 
  accounting, etc., and incur not a little suffering.&nbsp;&nbsp; And some who 
  have gone forth in this dispensation seek nutriment through such improper 
  means as the practice of medicine, etc., and they are to be censured here and 
  now, and hereafter they become "recluse ghosts" in the manner described thus 
  in the Lakkhana Samyutta:&nbsp;&nbsp; "And his outer robe was burning, 
  blazing," etc.<A href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#29" 
  name=r29>[29]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, desire itself is to be 
  understood as the danger in physical food as nutriment.</P>
  <P>Those who approach contact, who find gratification in contact, commit 
  crimes in respect of others' guarded and protected belongings, such as their 
  wives, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the owners of the goods catch them with their 
  belongings, they cut them into pieces or throw them onto a rubbish heap, or 
  hand them over to the king; and then the king has various tortures inflicted 
  upon them.&nbsp;&nbsp; And with the breakup of the body, after death, a bad 
  destination is to be expected for them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus this entire danger -- 
  that pertaining to the here and now and that pertaining to the afterlife -- 
  has come about rooted in contact.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, approach is to 
  be understood as the danger in the case of the nutriment contact.</P>
  <P>The entire danger in the three realms of existence has come about by the 
  accumulation of wholesome and unwholesome kamma and is rooted in that 
  (accumulation).&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, accumulation is to be understood 
  as the danger in the nutriment mental volition.</P>
  <P>And in whatever place rebirth-linking consciousness launches (the new 
  existence), in that same place it is reborn by seizing the rebirth-linking 
  mentality-materiality.&nbsp;&nbsp; When it is produced, all dangers are 
  produced, for they are all rooted in it.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, 
  launching is to be understood as the danger in the nutriment 
consciousness.</P>
  <P><FONT color=#000080><STRONG>The Four Similes</STRONG></FONT></P>
  <P>In regard to these nutriments with their dangers, for the sake of 
  eliminating desire for the nutriment physical food, the Fully Enlightened One 
  taught the simile of son's flesh in the passage beginning thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  "Suppose, bhikkhus, a couple, a man and his wife, 
  &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp; For the sake of eliminating desire 
  for the nutriment contact, he taught the simile of the flayed cow in the 
  passage beginning thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a flayed cow 
  &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp; For the sake of eliminating desire 
  for the nutriment mental volition, he taught the simile of the charcoal pit in 
  the passage beginning thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a 
  charcoal pit &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp; And for the sake of 
  eliminating desire for the nutriment consciousness, he taught the simile of 
  the man struck with three hundred spears in the passage beginning 
  thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a thief, a crook 
  &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;"<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#30" name=r30>[30]</A></P>
  <P>Therein, taking the essential meaning, there follows a brief interpretation 
  of the meaning.&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple, it is said, a man and his wife, took 
  their son and set out on a desert trail a hundred yojanas long,<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#31" 
  name=r31>[31]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; with only limited provisions.&nbsp;&nbsp; When 
  they had gone fifty yojanas their provisions ran out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhausted by 
  hunger and thirst, they sat down in some scanty shade.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the 
  man said to his wife:&nbsp;&nbsp; "My dear, for fifty yojanas on all sides 
  there is neither a village nor a town.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, though a man can 
  do many kinds of work, such as plowing, guarding cattle, etc., it is not 
  possible for me to do that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, kill me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eat half of 
  my flesh, and having made the other half into provisions for the journey, 
  cross out of the desert together with our son."</P>
  <P>The wife said:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear husband, though a woman can do many kinds 
  of work, such as spinning thread, etc., it is not possible for me to do 
  that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, kill me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eat half of my flesh, and having 
  made the other half into provisions for the journey, cross out of the desert 
  together with our son."</P>
  <P>Then the man said:&nbsp;&nbsp; "My dear, the death of the mother would mean 
  the death of two, for a young boy cannot live without his mother.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  But if we both live, then we can beget another child again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Come 
  now, let us kill our child, take his flesh, and cross out of this desert."</P>
  <P>Then the mother said to the son:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear, go to your 
  father."&nbsp;&nbsp; He went, but the father said:&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the sake 
  of supporting this child I incurred much suffering through such work as 
  plowing, guarding cattle, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot kill the boy.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  You kill your son."&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he said:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear, go to your 
  mother."&nbsp;&nbsp; But the mother said:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Longing for a son I 
  incurred much suffering by observing the cow-observance, the dog-observance, 
  praying to the gods, etc., not to speak of bearing him in my womb.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#32" 
  name=r32>[32]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not possible for me to kill 
  him."&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she said:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear, go to your father."</P>
  <P>The boy died from going back and forth between the father and the 
  mother.&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing him dead, they wept, and having taken the flesh as 
  described above, they departed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because that flesh of their son 
  was repulsive to them for nine reasons, it was not eaten for enjoyment nor for 
  intoxication nor for making (the body) strong and beautiful, but only for the 
  purpose of crossing out of the desert.</P>
  <P>For what nine reasons was it repulsive?&nbsp;&nbsp; Because it was the 
  flesh of their own offspring, the flesh of a relative, the flesh of a son, the 
  flesh of a dear son, the flesh of a youngster, raw flesh, not beef, unsalted, 
  unspiced.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore the bhikkhu who sees the nutriment physical 
  food thus, as similar to son's flesh, eliminates the desire for it.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#33" name=r33>[33]</A></P>
  <P>This, in the first place, is the interpretation of the meaning of the 
  simile of son's flesh.</P>
  <P>Then, as regards the simile of the flayed cow:&nbsp;&nbsp; If a cow were 
  stripped of its skin from the neck to the hooves and then set free, whatever 
  it would rest upon would become a basis of pain for it, since it would be 
  bitten by the small creatures living there.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#34" 
  name=r34>[34]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; So too, whatever physical basis or object 
  contact stands upon as its support becomes a basis for the felt pain 
  originating from that basis or object.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#35" 
  name=r35>[35]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore a bhikkhu who sees the nutriment 
  contact thus, as similar to a flayed cow, eliminates the desire for 
  it.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the interpretation of the meaning of the simile of the 
  flayed cow.</P>
  <P>Then, as regards the simile of the charcoal pit:<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#36" 
  name=r36>[36]&nbsp;</A>&nbsp; The three realms of being are like a charcoal 
  pit in the sense of a great burning heat (lit., a great fever).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Like the two men who grab hold (of a weaker man) by both his arms and drag him 
  towards it, is mental volition in the sense that it drags one towards the 
  realms of being.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore a bhikkhu who sees the nutriment mental 
  volition thus, as similar to a charcoal pit, eliminates the desire for 
  it.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the interpretation of the meaning of the simile of the 
  charcoal pit.</P>
  <P>Then, as regards the simile of the man struck with three hundred spears:<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#37" 
  name=r37>[37]&nbsp;</A>&nbsp; The hundred spears that strike the man in the 
  morning make a hundred wound openings in his body, and without remaining 
  inside they pierce through and fall on the other side; and so with the other 
  two hundred spears as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus his whole body is cut again and 
  again by the spears which come without piercing him in a place where another 
  has already struck.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no measuring the pain arisen in him 
  from even one of the wound openings, not to speak of three hundred wound 
  openings.</P>
  <P>Therein, the time of the generation of the rebirth-linking consciousness is 
  like the time of being struck by a spear.&nbsp;&nbsp; The production of the 
  aggregates is like the production of the wound openings.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
  arising of the various kinds of suffering rooted in the round (of existence) 
  once the aggregates have been born is like the arising of suffering on account 
  of the wound openings.</P>
  <P>Another method of interpretation (is as follows):&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
  rebirth-linking consciousness is like the thief.&nbsp;&nbsp; His 
  mentality-materiality conditioned by consciousness is like the wound openings 
  created by the striking of the spears.&nbsp;&nbsp; The arising of the various 
  kinds of suffering by way of the thirty-two types of torture and the 
  eighty-nine types of diseases in regard to consciousness conditioned by 
  mentality-materiality -- this should be regarded as like the arising of severe 
  pain for that man conditioned by the wound openings.</P>
  <P>Therefore a bhikkhu who sees the nutriment consciousness thus, as similar 
  to one struck by three hundred spears, eliminates the desire for 
  it.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the interpretation of the meaning of the simile of the 
  man struck by three hundred spears.</P>
  <P><FONT color=#000080><STRONG>Full Understanding</STRONG></FONT></P>
  <P>Thus by eliminating desire in regard to these nutriments, he also fully 
  understands these four nutriments.&nbsp;&nbsp; When these have been fully 
  understood, the entire basis (for them) has also been fully 
  understood.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this has been said by the Blessed One 
  (S.12:63/ii,99-100):</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Bhikkhus, when the nutriment physical food has been fully understood, 
    lust for the five cords of sensual pleasure has been fully 
    understood.&nbsp;&nbsp; When lust for the five cords of sensual pleasure has 
    been fully understood, there exists no more any fetter bound by which the 
    noble disciple might come back to this world.</P>
    <P>Bhikkhus, when the nutriment contact has been fully understood, the three

    <P>Bhikkhus, when the nutriment consciousness has been fully understood, 
    mentality-materiality has been fully understood.&nbsp;&nbsp; When

  <P><FONT color=#000080><STRONG>The Arising and Cessation of 
  Nutriment</STRONG></FONT></P>
  <P>With the arising of craving there is the arising of nutriment 
  (<I>tanhasamudaya aharasamudayo</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the 
  meaning:&nbsp;&nbsp; "With the arising of craving in the previous (existence) 
  the arising of the nutriments occurs at rebirth-linking (in this 
  existence)."&nbsp;&nbsp; How?&nbsp;&nbsp; Because at the moment of 
  rebirth-linking there is the nutritive essence produced among the thirty types 
  of materiality that have arisen by way of triple continuity.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#38" 
  name=r38>[38]&nbsp;</A>&nbsp; This is the kammically acquired physical food as 
  nutriment produced by craving as its condition.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the contact 
  and volition associated with the rebirth-linking consciousness, and that mind 
  or consciousness itself -- these are the kammically acquired nutriments of 
  contact, mental volition and consciousness produced by craving as their 
  condition.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, in the first place, the arising of the nutriments 
  at rebirth-linking should be understood as occurring with the arising of 
  craving in the previous existence.</P>
  <P>But because the nutriments that are kammically acquired and those that are 
  not kammically acquired have been discussed here combined, (the principle of) 
  the arising of nutriment with the arising of craving should be understood to 
  apply also to those that are not kammically acquired.&nbsp;&nbsp; For there is 
  nutritive essence in the kinds of materiality that are aroused by the eight 
  types of consciousness accompanied by greed;<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#39" 
  name=r39>[39]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; this is the nutriment physical food that is not 
  kammically acquired yet is produced by conascent craving as its 
  condition.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the contact and volition associated with the 
  consciousness accompanied by greed, and that mind or consciousness itself -- 
  these are the nutriments of contact, mental volition and consciousness that 
  are not kammically acquired yet are produced by craving as their 
condition.</P>
  <P>With the cessation of craving there is cessation of nutriment 
  (<I>tanhanirodha aharanirodho</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; By this there is set forth the 
  cessation of nutriment by the cessation of the craving that had become the 
  condition for both nutriment that is kammically acquired and that which is not 
  kammically acquired.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest (should be understood) by the method 
  stated, but there is this difference.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here the four truths are 
  stated directly, and as here, so in all the following sections.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Therefore one who is unconfused in mind can deduce the truths throughout in 
  what follows.<A href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#40" 
  name=r40>[40]</A></P>
  <P>12.&nbsp;&nbsp; And in all the following sections the delimiting phrase In 
  that way too, friends (<I>ettavata pi kho avuso</I>) should be construed 
  according to the principle that has been expounded.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, in the 
  first place, this is the interpretation of it (in the present 
  context).&nbsp;&nbsp; "In that way too":&nbsp;&nbsp; what is meant 
  is:&nbsp;&nbsp; "the attention and penetration stated by way of the teaching 
  concerning nutriment."&nbsp;&nbsp; The same method throughout.</P>
  <H3><FONT color=#800080>The Four Noble Truths</FONT></H3>
  <P>14.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, delighting and rejoicing in the Elder's words, after 
  saying as before "Good, friend," the bhikkhus asked a further question, and 
  the Elder answered them by another exposition.&nbsp;&nbsp; This method is 
  found in all the following sections.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, from here onwards, 
  we shall explain the meaning only of the particular exposition he states in 
  reply, without touching upon such words (as are already explained).</P>
  <P>15.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the brief exposition of this teaching, in the phrase 
  (he) understands suffering (<I>dukkham pajanati</I>), "suffering" is the truth 
  of suffering.&nbsp;&nbsp; But regarding the detailed exposition, whatever 
  needs to be said has all been said already in the Visuddhimagga in the 
  Description of the Truths (XVI,13-104).</P>
  <H3><FONT color=#800080>Aging and Death</FONT></H3>
  <P>21.&nbsp;&nbsp; From here onwards the teaching is given by way of dependent 
  arising (<I>paticca samuppada</I>).</P>
  <P>22.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therein, in the section on aging and death, firstly as to 
  the term their (<I>tesam tesam</I>) -- this should be understood as a 
  collective designation in brief for the many kinds of beings.&nbsp;&nbsp; For 
  if one were to state (the aging of individuals such as) the aging of 
  Devadatta, the aging of Somadatta, etc., one would never come to an end of 
  beings.&nbsp;&nbsp; But there is no being not included by this term "their."<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#41" 
  name=r41>[41]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore it was said above:&nbsp;&nbsp; "This 
  should be understood as a collective designation in brief for the many kinds 
  of beings."</P>
  <P>In the various (<I>tamhi tamhi</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a collective 
  designation for the many (different) orders by way of destiny and 
  birth.&nbsp;&nbsp; Orders of beings (<I>sattanikaye</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; an 
  indication of the nature of what is designated by the collective 
  designation.</P>
  <P>Aging, old age (<I>jara jiranata</I>), etc.:&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards these, 
  "aging" is the description of the nature; "old age" is the description of the 
  aspect; "brokenness," etc., are descriptions of the function with respect to 
  the passage of time; and the last two terms are descriptions of the normal 
  (process).&nbsp;&nbsp; For this is indicated as to nature by this term aging 
  (<I>jara</I>); hence this is a description of its nature.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is 
  indicated as to aspect by this term old age (<I>jiranata</I>); hence this is a 
  description of its aspect.&nbsp;&nbsp; Brokenness 
  (<I>khandicca</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; by this it is indicated as to the function of 
  causing the broken state of teeth and nails on account of the passage of 
  time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Grayness (<I>palicca</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; by this it is 
  indicated as to the function of causing the head hairs and body hairs to turn 
  gray.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wrinkling (<I>valittacata</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; by this it is 
  indicated as to the wrinkled state of the skin after the withering of the 
  flesh.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence the three terms beginning with brokenness are 
  descriptions of function with respect to the passage of time.&nbsp;&nbsp; By 
  these evident aging is shown, which becomes evident by the showing of these 
  alterations.&nbsp;&nbsp; For just as the course taken by water or wind or fire 
  is evident from the damaged and broken state, or the burnt state, of the grass 
  and trees, etc., and yet the course that has been taken is not the water, 
  etc., itself, so too the course taken by aging is evident through brokenness 
  of teeth, etc., and it is apprehended by opening the eyes, but the brokenness, 
  etc., themselves are not aging, nor is aging cognizable by the eye.</P>
  <P>Decline of life, weakness of faculties (<I>ayuno samhani indriyanam 
  paripako</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; By these terms it is indicated by means of the 
  normal (process) known as the exhaustion of the life-span and the weakening of 
  the eye faculty, etc., that has become manifest with the passage of 
  time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence these last two are to be understood as descriptions of 
  its normal (process).</P>
  <P>Therein, because the life-span of one who has reached aging is dwindling, 
  aging is called "decline of life" as a metaphor (for the cause stated in 
  terms) of its effect.&nbsp;&nbsp; And because the eye faculty, 
  etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; -- which at the time of youth were quite clear and could 
  easily grasp even subtle objects -- become deficient, obscure, unable to grasp 
  even gross objects when one has reached old age, therefore it is called 
  "weakness of faculties" also as a metaphor (for the cause stated in terms) of 
  its effect.</P>
  <P>This aging, thus described, is all of two kinds, evident and 
  concealed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therein, the aging of material phenomena, shown by 
  brokenness, etc., is called evident aging (<I>pakatajara</I>).&nbsp;&nbsp; But 
  in the case of immaterial phenomena, because their alteration in such a way is 
  not visible, their aging is called concealed aging 
  (<I>paticchannajara</I>).&nbsp;&nbsp; Therein, the brokenness that is seen is 
  simply color (<I>vanna</I>) because of the ease of comprehending such things 
  as the teeth, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having seen this with the eye and reflected on 
  it with the mind door, one knows aging thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; "These teeth have 
  been afflicted by aging," just as one knows the existence of water below when 
  one has noticed the heads of cows, etc., bound to the place where the water is 
  located.</P>
  <P>Again, aging is twofold thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; as continuous and as 
  discrete.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therein, continuous aging (<I>avicijara</I>) is the 
  aging of such things as gems, gold, silver, coral, the sun and moon, etc.; it 
  is so called because of the difficulty of perceiving in such things distinct 
  changes in color, etc., at regular intervals, as we can in the case of living 
  beings passing through the decade of childhood, etc., and in the case of 
  vegetation (lit.&nbsp;&nbsp; non-breathing things) such as flowers, fruits, 
  buds, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; The meaning is:&nbsp;&nbsp; aging that progresses 
  without interval.&nbsp;&nbsp; Discrete aging (<I>savicijara</I>) is the aging 
  of the things other than those, i.e.&nbsp;&nbsp; of the aforesaid things 
  (living beings and vegetation); it is so called because it is easy to perceive 
  in them distinct changes in color, etc., at regular intervals.&nbsp;&nbsp; So 
  it should be understood.</P>
  <P>Following this (in the definition of death) the term their (<I>tesam 
  tesam</I>) should be understood by the method stated above (in the definition 
  of aging).&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, in the expression passing, passing away, etc., 
  passing (<I>cuti</I>) is said by way of what has the nature to pass away; this 
  is a collective designation (applying) to one-, four-, and five-aggregate 
  (existence).&nbsp;&nbsp; Passing away (<I>cavanata</I>) is the indication of 
  the characteristic by a word expressing the abstract state.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Dissolution (<I>bheda</I>) is an indication of the occurrence of the breaking 
  up of the aggregates (at the time) of passing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Disappearance 
  (<I>antaradhana</I>) is an indication of the absence of any manner of 
  persistence of the aggregates (at the time) of passing, as they are broken 
  like a broken pot.</P>
  <P>Dying (<I>maccu marana</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; death which is called 
  dying.&nbsp;&nbsp; By this he rejects the idea of death as complete 
  annihilation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Completion of time (<I>kalakiriya</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  time is the destroyer, and this (completion of time) is its 
  activity.&nbsp;&nbsp; By this he explains death in conventional 
  terminology.</P>
  <P>Now, to explain death in (terms valid in) the ultimate sense, he next says 
  the dissolution of the aggregates (<I>khandhanam bhedo</I>), etc.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#42" 
  name=r42>[42]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; For in the ultimate sense it is only the 
  aggregates that break up; it is not any so called being that dies.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  But when the aggregates are breaking up convention says "a being is dying," 
  and when they have broken up convention says "(he is) dead."</P>
  <P>Here the dissolution of the aggregates is said by way of four- [and 
  five-]&nbsp;&nbsp; constituent being; the laying down of the body 
  (<I>kalevarassa nikkhepo</I>) by way of one-constituent being.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#43" 
  name=r43>[43]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; Or alternatively, the dissolution of the 
  aggregates is said by way of four-constituent being; the laying down of the 
  body should be understood by way of the other two (i.e.&nbsp;&nbsp; one- and 
  five-constituent being).&nbsp;&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the existence 
  of the body, that is, the material body, in those two realms of 
  being.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or else, because in the realm of the Four Great Kings, 
  etc., the aggregates simply break up and they do not lay anything down, the 
  dissolution of the aggregates is said with reference to them.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#44" 
  name=r44>[44]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; The laying down of the body occurs among human 
  beings, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; And here, because it is the cause for the laying down 
  of the body, death is called the laying down of the body.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus the 
  meaning should be understood.</P>
  <P>So this aging and this death are what is called aging and death (<I>iti 
  ayan ca jara idan ca maranam idam vuccat'avuso jaramaranam</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  this is spoken of as "aging and death" by combining the two into one.</P>
  <H3><FONT color=#800080>Birth</FONT></H3>
  <P>26.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the section on birth, in regard to the phrase birth, 
  &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their coming to birth, etc., birth 
  (<I>jati</I>) is in the sense of being born; this is stated with reference to 
  those (conceived) with incomplete sense bases.&nbsp;&nbsp; Coming to birth 
  (<I>sanjati</I>) is in the sense of the act of coming to birth; this is stated 
  with reference to those (conceived) with already complete sense 
  bases.&nbsp;&nbsp; Precipitation (or descent, <I>okkanti</I>) is in the sense 
  of being precipitated (descending).&nbsp;&nbsp; This is stated with reference 
  to those born from the egg and from the womb, for they take rebirth-linking as 
  though descending and entering the egg shell or the placenta.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Generation (<I>abhinibbatti</I>) is in the sense of being 
  generated.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is stated with reference to those born from 
  moisture or those of spontaneous birth, for these are generated as soon as 
  they become manifest.</P>
  <P>Now comes the exposition in (terms valid in) the ultimate sense. 
  Manifestation (<I>patubhava</I>) is the arising.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the aggregates 
  (<I>khandhanam</I>) is to be understood as (the arising) of one aggregate in 
  the one-constituent realm of being, of four aggregates in four-constituent 
  realms, and of five aggregates in five-constituent realms.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Obtaining (<I>patilabha</I>) is the manifestation in continuity.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  The bases (<I>ayatananam</I>) should be understood as comprising the sense 
  bases arising (at conception) in this or that realm.&nbsp;&nbsp; For when the 
  sense bases become manifest, then they are said to be obtained.</P>
  <P>This is called birth (<I>ayam vuccat'avuso jati</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; by this 
  phrase he comes to the conclusion on birth taught in both conventional terms 
  and in the ultimate sense.</P>
  <P>With the arising of being (<I>bhavasamudaya</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; but here one 
  should understand kammically active being as the condition for 
  birth.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest by the method stated.</P>
  <H3><FONT color=#800080>Being</FONT></H3>
  <P>30.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the section on being, sense-sphere being 
  (<I>kamabhava</I>) is kammically active being and resultant being.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Therein, kammically active being (<I>kammabhava</I>) is kamma itself that 
  leads to sense-sphere being.&nbsp;&nbsp; For that is called "being" as a 
  designation of the cause in terms of its effect, because it is the cause for 
  resultant being, as when it is said:&nbsp;&nbsp; "The arising of Buddhas is 
  bliss" and "The accumulation of evil is painful" (Dhp.&nbsp;&nbsp; 194, 
  117).&nbsp;&nbsp; Resultant being (<I>upapattibhava</I>) is the group of 
  kammically acquired aggregates produced by that kamma.&nbsp;&nbsp; For that is 
  called "being" because it exists there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus this kamma and this 
  result are both spoken of conjointly as "sense-sphere being."&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
  same method applies to fine-material being and immaterial being 
  (<I>ruparupabhava</I>).</P>
  <P>With the arising of clinging (<I>upadanasamudaya</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; But here 
  clinging is a condition for wholesome kammically active being only by way of 
  decisive support; it is a condition for unwholesome kammically active being by 
  way of both decisive support and conascence.<A

  by way of decisive support. The rest by the method stated.</P>
  <H3><FONT color=#800080>Clinging</FONT></H3>
  <P>34.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the section on clinging, in regard to the phrase 
  "clinging to sense pleasures," etc., clinging to sense pleasures 
  (<I>kamupadana</I>) is analyzed thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; by this one clings to the 
  object of sensual pleasure, or this itself clings to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or 
  alternatively:&nbsp;&nbsp; that is a sensual pleasure and it is clinging, thus 
  it is clinging to sensual pleasure.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is firm grasping 
  (<I>dalhagahana</I>) that is called clinging.&nbsp;&nbsp; For here the prefix 
  <I>upa</I> has the sense of firmness.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a designation for 
  the lust for the five cords of sensual pleasure.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the brief 
  account here.&nbsp;&nbsp; The detailed account should be understood by the 
  method stated thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Therein, what is clinging to sensual 
  pleasures?&nbsp;&nbsp; The sensual desire in regard to sensual pleasures," 
  etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Dhs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 1214).</P>
  <P>So too, that is a view and clinging, thus it is clinging to views 
  (<I>ditthupadana</I>).&nbsp;&nbsp; Or alternatively:&nbsp;&nbsp; it clings to 
  a view, or by this they cling to a view.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the subsequent view 
  clings to the previous view and thereby they cling to the view.&nbsp;&nbsp; As 
  it is said:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Self and the world are eternal; only this is true, 
  anything else is false," etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; (M.102/ii, 233).&nbsp;&nbsp; This is 
  a designation for the whole field of (wrong) views except clinging to rituals 
  and observances and clinging to a doctrine of self. <A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#46" 
  name=r46>[46]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the brief account here.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
  detailed account should be understood by the method stated thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  "Therein, what is clinging to views?&nbsp;&nbsp; There is nothing given," etc. 
  (Dhs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 1215).</P>
  <P>So too, by this they cling to rituals and observances, or this itself 
  clings to them, or that is a ritual and observance and clinging, thus it is 
  clinging to rituals and observances (<I>silabbatupadana</I>). For when one 
  adheres to the idea that the cow ritual or cow observance brings purification, 
  that itself is a clinging.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#47" 
  name=r47>[47]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the brief account here.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
  detailed account should be understood by the method stated thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  "Therein, what is clinging to rituals and observances?&nbsp;&nbsp; (The idea) 
  of recluses and brahmins outside here (i.e.&nbsp;&nbsp; outside the Buddha's 
  dispensation) that purity (is achieved) by rules," etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  (Dhs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 1216).</P>
  <P>Now they assert in terms of this, thus it is a doctrine.&nbsp;&nbsp; By 
  this they cling, thus it is clinging.&nbsp;&nbsp; What do they 
  assert?&nbsp;&nbsp; Or what do they cling to?&nbsp;&nbsp; Self.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  The clinging to a doctrine about a self is the clinging to a doctrine of self 
  (<I>attavadupadana</I>).&nbsp;&nbsp; Or alternatively:&nbsp;&nbsp; by this a 
  mere doctrine of self is clung to as self, thus it is clinging to a doctrine 
  of self.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a designation for personality view with its 
  twenty cases.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the brief account here.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
  detailed account should be understood by the method stated thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  "Therein, what is clinging to a doctrine of self?&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, the 
  uninstructed worldling who has no regard for noble ones," etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  (Dhs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 1217).</P>
  <P>With the arising of craving (<I>tanhasamudaya</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; here, 
  craving is a condition for clinging to sensual pleasures either by way of 
  decisive support or by way of proximity, contiguity, absence, disappearance 
  and repetition.<A href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#48" 
  name=r48>[48]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; But for the rest (it is a condition) by way of 
  conascence, etc., too.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest by the method stated.</P>
  <H3><FONT color=#800080>Craving</FONT></H3>
  <P>38.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the section on craving, craving for forms 
  &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; craving for mind-objects (<I>rupatanha 
  &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dhammatanha</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; these 
  are names for the kinds of craving which occur in the course of a javana 
  cognitive process (<I>javanavithi</I>) in the eye door, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like 
  a name derived from the father, such as Setthiputta ("merchant's son") or 
  Brahmanaputta ("brahmin's son"), their names are derived from the object, 
  which is similar to the father [as being the cause (<I>hetu</I>) of it only, 
  not as is the case with "eye-contact," which is like a name derived from the 
  mother in that (the eye like the mother in relation to her son) is a cause by 
  its nature as a physical support (<I>nissayabhava</I>)].</P>
  <P>And here, craving for forms is craving that has forms as its object, 
  craving in regard to forms.&nbsp;&nbsp; When this occurs by finding 
  gratification in visible forms through its nature as sensual lust, it is 
  craving for sensual pleasure (<I>kamatanha</I>).&nbsp;&nbsp; When it occurs by 
  finding gratification in visible forms, thinking "Form is permanent, lasting, 
  eternal," through its nature as lust accompanied by the eternalist view, then 
  it is craving for being (<I>bhavatanha</I>).&nbsp;&nbsp; When it occurs by 
  finding gratification in visible form, thinking "Form is annihilated, 
  destroyed, and does not exist after death," through its nature as lust 
  accompanied by the annihilationist view, then it is craving for non-being 
  (<I>vibhavatanha</I>).&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it is threefold.&nbsp;&nbsp; And as 
  craving for form, so too craving for sound, etc., (are each threefold 
  too).&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus there are eighteen modes of craving.&nbsp;&nbsp; These 
  eighteen in respect of internal visible form, etc., and in respect of external 
  visible form, etc., come to thirty-six.&nbsp;&nbsp; So thirty-six in the past, 
  thirty-six in the future, and thirty-six at present make up a hundred and 
  eight.</P>
  <P>Or there are eighteen based on internal form, etc., thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; "On 
  account of the internal there is (the notion) 'I am,' there is (the notion) 'I 
  am such and such,' " and so on; and there are eighteen based on external form, 
  etc., thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; "On account of the external there is (the notion) 'I 
  am,' there is (the notion) 'I am such and such,' " and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus 
  there are thirty-six.&nbsp;&nbsp; So thirty-six in the past, thirty-six in the 
  future, and thirty-six at present make up thus the hundred and eight modes of 
  craving (<I>tanhavicaritani</I>; see A.&nbsp;&nbsp; 4:199/ii, 212).</P>
  <P>Again, when a classification is made, they reduce to only six classes of 
  craving -- in terms of their objects, forms and the rest -- and to only three 
  types of craving -- craving for sensual pleasure and the rest.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Thus:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Craving should be known by the wise<BR>Through description and when 
    described<BR>In detail; it (should be known) again<BR>Through classification 
    of the detail.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>With the arising of feeling there is the arising of craving 
  (<I>vedanasamudaya tanhasamudayo</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; But here the word "feeling" 
  is intended as resultant feeling.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#49" 
  name=r49>[49]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; How is that the condition for craving in respect 
  of the six sense doors?&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of its ability to produce 
  gratification.&nbsp;&nbsp; For it is through the gratification in pleasant 
  feeling that beings become enamored of that feeling, and after arousing 
  craving for feeling and being seized by lust for feeling, they long only for a 
  desirable visible form in the eye door.&nbsp;&nbsp; And on getting it, they 
  find gratification in it, and they honor painters, etc., who provide such 
  objects.&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, they long only for a desirable sound, etc., in 
  the ear door, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; And on getting it, they find gratification in 
  it, and they honor musicians, perfume makers, cooks, spinners and the teachers 
  of the various crafts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like what?&nbsp;&nbsp; Like those who, 
  being enamored of a child, out of love for the child honor the wet-nurse and 
  give her suitable ghee, milk, etc., to eat and drink.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest by 
  the method stated.</P>
  <H3><FONT color=#800080>Feeling</FONT></H3>
  <P>42.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the section on feeling, classes of feeling 
  (<I>vedanakaya</I>) means groups of feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp; Feeling born of 
  eye-contact &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feeling born of 
  mind-contact (<I>cakkhusamphassaja vedana 
  &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manosamphassaja 
  vedana</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; because of what has come down in the Vibhanga 
  thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is feeling born of eye-contact that is wholesome, 
  that is unwholesome, that is indeterminate" (Vibh.&nbsp;&nbsp; 15), the 
  wholesome, unwholesome and indeterminate feelings that occur in the eye door, 
  etc., are named after the physical base, which is similar to a mother, just as 
  some are named after their mother, such as "Sariputta (Lady Sari's son)," 
  "Mantaniputta (Lady Mantani's son)," etc.</P>
  <P>But the word meaning here is this:&nbsp;&nbsp; feeling born of eye-contact 
  (<I>cakkhusamphassaja vedana</I>) is feeling that is born with eye-contact as 
  the cause.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same method throughout.&nbsp;&nbsp; This, in the 
  first place, is the all-inclusive explanation.&nbsp;&nbsp; But by way of 
  resultant, in the eye-door there are two eye-consciousnesses, two mind 
  elements, three mind-consciousness elements; feeling should be understood as 
  what is associated with these.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#50" 
  name=r50>[50]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; This method also applies in the ear door, 
  etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the mind door, (feeling) is associated only with the 
  mind-consciousness elements.</P>
  <P>With the arising of contact (<I>phassasamudaya</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; But here 
  the arising in the five doors of the feelings that have the five physical 
  bases (as their support) occurs with the arising of the conascent 
  eye-contact.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the rest, eye-contact, etc., are conditions by 
  way of decisive support.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the mind door, the arising of feelings 
  (on the occasion) of registration and of the doorless feelings (on the 
  occasions) of rebirth-linking, life-continuum and death occurs with the 
  arising of the conascent mind-contact.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#51" 
  name=r51>[51]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest by the method stated.</P>
  <H3><FONT color=#800080>Contact</FONT></H3>
  <P>46.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the section on contact, eye-contact 
  (<I>cakkhusamphassa</I>) is contact in the eye.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same method 
  throughout.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eye-contact &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  body-contact (<I>cakkhusamphasso &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  kayasamphasso</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; up to this point ten kinds of contact have 
  been stated, namely, the wholesome- and unwholesome-resultants having the five 
  physical bases (as their support).&nbsp;&nbsp; Mind-contact 
  (<I>manosamphassa</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; by this (he indicates) the remaining 
  twenty-two kinds of contact associated with the mundane resultant (types of 
  consciousness).<A href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#52" 
  name=r52>[52]</A></P>
  <P>With the arising of the sixfold base 
  (<I>salayatanasamudaya</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; The arising of this sixfold contact 
  should be understood to occur by way of the arising of the six bases beginning 
  with the eye-base.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest by the method stated.</P>
  <H3><FONT color=#800080>The Sixfold Base</FONT></H3>
  <P>50.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the section on the sixfold base, as regards the eye-base 
  (<I>cakkhayatana</I>), etc., whatever should be said has all been said already 
  in the Visuddhimagga in the Description of the Aggregates and in the 
  Description of the Bases (XIV, 37-52; XV, 1-16).</P>
  <P>With the arising of mentality-materiality 
  (<I>namarupasamudaya</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; But here the arising of the sixfold 
  base should be understood to occur from the arising of mentality-materiality 
  according to the method stated in the Visuddhimagga in the Description of 
  Dependent Arising, as to which mentality, which materiality, and which 
  mentality-materiality are a condition for which base (XVII, 206-219).</P>
  <H3><FONT color=#800080>Mentality-Materiality</FONT></H3>
  <P>54.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the section on mentality-materiality, mentality 
  (<I>nama</I>) has the characteristic of bending (<I>namana</I>); materiality 
  (<I>rupa</I>) has the characteristic of being molested (<I>ruppana</I>).<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#53" 
  name=r53>[53]&nbsp;</A>&nbsp; In the detailed section, however, feeling 
  (<I>vedana</I>) is to be understood as the feeling aggregate, perception 
  (<I>sanna</I>) as the perception aggregate, and volition, contact and 
  attention (<I>cetana phasso manasikaro</I>) as the formations 
  aggregate.&nbsp;&nbsp; While it is certainly the case that other states are 
  included in the formations aggregate, still these three are found in all 
  classes of consciousness, even the weakest.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why the 
  formations aggregate is here pointed out only by means of these three.</P>
  <P>The four great elements (<I>cattari mahabhutani</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; this is a 
  designation for the four -- earth, water, fire and air.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason 
  why these are called "great elements," and other determinations concerning 
  them, are all stated in the Visuddhimagga in the Description of the 
  Materiality Aggregate.<A href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#55" 
  name=r54>[54]</A></P>
  <P>Derived from the four great elements (<I>catunnan ca mahabhutanam 
  upadaya</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; derived from (<I>upadaya</I>) = having clung to 
  (<I>upadayitva</I>); "having grasped" is the meaning.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some also 
  say "depending upon" (<I>nissaya</I>).&nbsp;&nbsp; And here the reading is 
  completed by adding the word "existing" (<I>vattamanam</I>).&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
  Pali uses the genitive (in the term for the elements) in the sense of a 
  group.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence the meaning here should be understood 
  thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; the materiality that exists derived from the group of the 
  four great elements.</P>
  <P>Thus materiality taken altogether is to be understood as consisting of all 
  the following:&nbsp;&nbsp; the four great elements beginning with the earth 
  element, and the materiality that exists derived from the four great elements, 
  stated in the canonical Abhidhamma to be of twenty-three kinds by analysis 
  into the eye-base, etc.<A href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#55" 
  name=r55>[55]</A></P>
  <P>With the arising of consciousness (<I>vinnanasamudaya</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; But 
  here the arising of mentality-materiality should be understood to occur with 
  the arising of consciousness according to the method stated in the 
  Visuddhimagga in the Description of Dependent Arising, as to which 
  consciousness is a condition for which mentality, for which materiality, and 
  for which mentality-materiality (XVII, 186-202).&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest by the 
  method stated.</P>
  <H3><FONT color=#800080>Consciousness</FONT></H3>
  <P>58.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the section on consciousness, eye-consciousness 
  (<I>cakkhuvinnana</I>) is consciousness in the eye or consciousness born from 
  the eye.&nbsp;&nbsp; So also with ear-, nose-, tongue- and 
  body-consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp; But with the other one, i.e.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  mind-consciousness (<I>manovinnana</I>), mind itself is 
  consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a designation for the resultant 
  consciousness of the three (mundane) planes of existence except for the two 
  groups of fivefold consciousness.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#56" name=r56>[56]</A></P>
  <P>With the arising of formations (<I>sankharasamudaya</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; But 
  here the arising of consciousness should be understood to occur with the 
  arising of formations according to the method stated in the Visuddhimagga, as 
  to which formation is a condition for which consciousness (XVII, 175-185).</P>
  <H3><FONT color=#800080>Formations</FONT></H3>
  <P>62.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the section on formations, a formation (<I>sankhara</I>) 
  has the characteristic of forming (<I>abhisankharanalakkhana</I>).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  But in the detailed section, the bodily formation (<I>kayasankhara</I>) is a 
  formation that proceeds from the body.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a designation for 
  the twenty kinds of bodily volition -- the eight sense-sphere wholesome and 
  twelve unwholesome -- that occur by way of activation in the bodily door.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#57" 
  name=r57>[57]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; The verbal formation (<I>vacisankhara</I>) is a 
  formation that proceeds from speech.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a designation for the 
  (same) twenty kinds of verbal volition that occur by way of breaking into 
  speech in the door of speech.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mental formation 
  (<I>cittasankhara</I>) is a formation that proceeds from the mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  This is a designation for the twenty-nine kinds of mental volition -- the 
  mundane wholesome and unwholesome -- that occur in one sitting alone in 
  thought, and which do not cause activation of the bodily and verbal doors.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#58" name=r58>[58]</A></P>
  <P>With the arising of ignorance (<I>avijjasamudaya</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; But here 
  ignorance should be understood as a condition for the wholesome by way of 
  decisive support and for the unwholesome by way of conascence as 
  well.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest by the method stated.</P>
  <H3><FONT color=#800080>Ignorance</FONT></H3>
  <P>66.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the section on ignorance, not knowing about suffering 
  (<I>dukkhe annanam</I>) means not knowing about the truth of 
  suffering.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a designation for delusion 
  (<I>moha</I>).&nbsp;&nbsp; The same method with respect to "not knowing about 
  the origin of suffering," and so on.</P>
  <P>Herein, not knowing about suffering should be understood in four ways: as 
  to containment (<I>antogadhato</I>), as to physical basis (<I>vatthuto</I>), 
  as to object (<I>arammanato</I>), and as to concealment 
  (<I>paticchadanato</I>).&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, because of being included in the 
  truth of suffering, it ("not knowing" or ignorance) is contained in suffering; 
  and the truth of suffering is its physical basis by being its support 
  condition; and (the truth of suffering) is its object by being its object 
  condition; and it conceals the truth of suffering by preventing the 
  penetration of its real characteristic and by not allowing knowledge to occur 
  in regard to it.</P>
  <P>Not knowing about the origin (of suffering) should be understood in three 
  ways:&nbsp;&nbsp; as to physical basis, as to object, and as to concealment. 
  And not knowing about cessation and the way (to cessation) should be 
  understood in one way only:&nbsp;&nbsp; as to concealment.&nbsp;&nbsp; For 
  non-knowledge only conceals cessation and the way by preventing the 
  penetration of their real characteristics and by not allowing knowledge to 
  occur in regard to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it is not contained in them because 
  it is not included in this pair of truths.&nbsp;&nbsp; And these two truths 
  are not its physical basis because they are not conascent.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor are 
  they its object because of its non-occurrence on account of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  For the last pair of truths are difficult to see because of their profundity, 
  and non-knowledge, which is blind, does not occur there.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the 
  first (pair of truths) is profound in the sense of opposition because of the 
  difficulty in seeing the characteristic of their intrinsic nature; it occurs 
  there by way of obsession by the perversions.</P>
  <P>Furthermore:&nbsp;&nbsp; About suffering (<I>dukkhe</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; to 
  this extent ignorance is indicated as to inclusion, as to physical basis, as 
  to object, and as to function.&nbsp;&nbsp; About the origin of suffering 
  (<I>dukkhasamudaye</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; to this extent, as to basis, as to 
  object, and as to function.&nbsp;&nbsp; About the cessation of suffering 
  (<I>dukkhanirodhe</I>) and about the way leading to the cessation of suffering 
  (<I>dukkhanirodhagaminiya patipadaya</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; to this extent, as to 
  function.&nbsp;&nbsp; But without distinction, (in each instance) ignorance is 
  described in terms of its intrinsic nature by the phrase "not knowing."</P>
  <P>With the arising of the taints (<I>asavasamudaya</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; But here 
  the taint of sensual desire and the taint of being are conditions for 
  ignorance by way of conascence, etc.; the taint of ignorance, only by way of 
  decisive support.&nbsp;&nbsp; And here the ignorance that had arisen 
  previously should be understood as the taint of ignorance.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is 
  a decisive support condition for the ignorance that arises 
  subsequently.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest by the method stated.</P>
  <H3><FONT color=#800080>The Taints</FONT></H3>
  <P>70.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the section on the taints, with the arising of ignorance 
  (<I>avijjasamudaya</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp; Here ignorance is a condition for the 
  taint of sensual desire and the taint of being by way of decisive support, 
  etc.; (it is a condition) for the taint of ignorance only by way of decisive 
  support.&nbsp;&nbsp; And here the ignorance that arises subsequently should be 
  understood as the taint of ignorance.&nbsp;&nbsp; The previously arisen 
  ignorance itself becomes a decisive support condition for the subsequently 
  arisen taint of ignorance.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest by the aforesaid method.</P>
  <P>This section is stated by way of showing the condition for the ignorance 
  which heads the factors of dependent arising.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stated thus, the 
  undiscoverability (<I>anamataggata</I>) of any beginning of samsara is 
  established.&nbsp;&nbsp; How?&nbsp;&nbsp; Because with the arising of the 
  taints there is the arising of ignorance, and with the arising of ignorance 
  there is the arising of the taints.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus the taints are a 
  condition for ignorance, and ignorance is a condition for the 
  taints.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having shown this, (it follows that) no first point of 
  ignorance is manifest, and because none is manifest the undiscoverability of 
  any beginning of samsara is proven.<A

  <H3><FONT color=#800080>Conclusion</FONT></H3>
  <P>Thus in all this sutta sixteen sections have been stated:&nbsp;&nbsp; the 
  section on the courses of kamma, the section on nutriment, the section on 
  suffering, and the sections on aging and death, birth, being, clinging, 
  craving, feeling, contact, the sixfold base, mentality-materiality, 
  consciousness, formations, ignorance and the taints.</P>
  <P>As to these, in each individual section there is a twofold analysis -- in 
  brief and in detail -- amounting to thirty-two cases.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus in this 
  sutta, in these thirty-two cases, the Four (Noble) Truths are 
  expounded.&nbsp;&nbsp; Among these, in the sixteen cases stated in detail, 
  Arahantship is expounded.</P>
  <P>But according to the opinion of the Elder, the four truths and the four 
  paths are expounded in the thirty-two cases.<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#60" 
  name=r60>[60]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus in the entire Word of the Buddha comprised

  <P><A name=1>1</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The term sammaditthi is ordinarily used to 
  mean simply a state, the path factor of right view.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, however, 
  the Pali expression is used as a masculine noun to mean, in the first 
  instance, a person possessing right view; hence it has been rendered "one of 
  right view."&nbsp;&nbsp; The commentator contrasts this unusual usage of the 
  term with the more common usage where sammaditthi signifies a state 
  (<I>dhamma</I>), that is, the path factor rather than the individual endowed 
  with that state. [<A

  <P><A name=2>2</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The knowledge of kamma as one's own 
  (<I>kammassakatanana</I>) is often expressed in the Suttas thus:&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  "I am the owner of my kamma, the heir of my kamma, I spring from my kamma, I 
  am bound to my kamma, I have kamma as my refuge.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever kamma I 
  perform, good or bad, of that I am the heir."&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, it is 
  knowledge of the moral efficacy of action, of the fact that one's willed deeds 
  fashion one's destiny.&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowledge in conformity with the truths 
  (<I>saccanulomikanana</I>) is conceptual knowledge of the Four Noble Truths, 
  accompanied by understanding and acceptance of them. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r2">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=3>3</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The understanding or wisdom (<I>panna</I>) 
  connected with the paths and fruits is supramundane because its object is the 
  supramundane dhamma, Nibbana, and because it leads to the overcoming of the 
  world. [<A href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r3">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=4>4</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; A disciple in higher training (<I>sekha</I>) 
  is one at any of the three lower levels of sanctity -- a stream-enterer, 
  once-returner, or non-returner -- or one who has reached their respective 
  paths.&nbsp;&nbsp; His right view is said to be fixed in destiny 
  (<I>niyata</I>) because it necessarily leads to final liberation. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r4">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=5>5</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The "one beyond training" (<I>asekha</I>) is 
  the Arahant, so called because he has completed the threefold training in 
  virtue, concentration and wisdom. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r5">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=6>6</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ninefold supramundane Dhamma:&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  the four paths, the four fruitions, and Nibbana. [<A

  <P><A name=7>7</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The interpretation of "the bhikkhus" and "the 
  Elder" is offered by Sub.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cy., which also presents an alternative 
  interpretation, based on the commentary to the Vatthupama Sutta (M.7) 
  according to which the bhikkhus are the pupils of the Elder Mahasangharakkhita 
  and "the Elder" is the Elder Mahasangharakkhita. [<A

  <P><A name=10>10</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The meaning of several of these terms, 
  obscure in the original Pali, has been elaborated with the aid of the 
  Sub.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cy. [<A

  <P><A name=11>11</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consent (<I>adhivasana</I>) is included to 
  cover the case where one of the partners is initially an unwilling victim of 
  another's assault, but during the course of union consents to the act and 
  thereby becomes a participant. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r11">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=12>12</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are references to the two great 
  classics of Hindu India, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r12">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=13>13</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wrong views of fixed destiny (<I>niyata 
  micchaditthi</I>) are views which deny the moral efficacy of action or which 
  tend to undermine the foundations of morality.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the most common 
  examples, see D.2/i, 52-56, and M.76/i, 515-18. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r13">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=14>14</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The chief factor in the first seven courses 
  of kamma is volition; the other three courses are identical with the mental 
  factors of greed, hatred and wrong view, which are associated with volition in 
  the states of consciousness in which they arise. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r14">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=15>15</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This refers to the Abhidhamma classification 
  of consciousness, according to which wholesome sense-sphere consciousness is 
  of eight types, four associated with knowledge, four dissociated from 
  knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp; The abstinences, according to the Abhidhamma, occur in 
  sense-sphere consciousness only one at a time on occasions when one 
  deliberately abstains from some wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; In supramundane 
  consciousness all three abstinences -- right speech, right action and right 
  livelihood -- occur together simultaneously. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r15">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=16>16</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right view is synonymous with the mental 
  factor of wisdom (<I>panna</I>) or non-delusion (<I>amoha</I>); it is always 
  accompanied by the other two wholesome roots, though the latter do not 
  necessarily occur in conjunction with right view. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r16">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=17>17</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Literally, or in the strict sense 
  (<I>nippariyayena</I>), only covetousness and greed, being synonyms of craving 
  (<I>tanha</I>), count as the origin of suffering.&nbsp;&nbsp; But in a looser 
  or figurative manner of exposition (<I>pariyayena</I>) all the roots are the 
  truth of the origin, since as roots of kamma they help to sustain the round of 
  rebirth and suffering. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r17">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=18>18</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The guideline of conversion 
  (<I>avattahara</I>) is one of the methods of deduction in the exegetical 
  guide, the Nettippakarana.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to this guideline, an 
  expositor of a sutta is to extract from a particular text a standard doctrinal 
  concept belonging to a dichotomy, and then taking this concept as a basis, he 
  is to show that the other member of the dichotomy is also implied by the 
  passage under consideration, and therefore "turns up" when the first member is 
  mentioned. [<A 
href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r18">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=19>19</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The path of non-return (<I>anagamimagga</I>) 
  is stated because this path eradicates all sensual lust and aversion. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r19">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=20>20</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The path of Arahantship is implied by the 
  eradication of conceit and ignorance and by the arousing of true knowledge. 
  [<A href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r21">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=21>21</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The verb <I>aharati</I> normally means "to 
  bring," but here it is rendered as "nourish" to underscore its connection with 
  <I>ahara</I>, nutriment. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r21">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=22>22</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the four <I>yoni</I> or modes of 
  generation, see M.12/i, 73. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r22">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=23>23</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the Abhidhamma, the nutriment 
  proper is the material phenomenon called nutritive essence (<I>oja</I>), while 
  the solid food ingested is the mere "basis" (<I>vatthu</I>) of the nutritive 
  essence. [<A href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r23">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=24>24</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The point is that while in conventional 
  terms food substances are distinguished as gross or subtle, this distinction 
  is made in terms of the physical base only.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Abhidhamma 
  classifies nutritive essence as subtle materiality (<I>sukhumarupa</I>); it 
  contrasts with gross materiality (<I>olarikarupa</I>), which includes only the 
  five sense organs and their objects. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r24">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=25>25</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the highest realm among the 
  sense-sphere heavens.&nbsp;&nbsp; Above this come the Brahma realms, where 
  physical nutriment is non-existent. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r25">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=26>26</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the simplest kind of material group 
  (<I>rupakalapa</I>) recognized by the Abhidhamma theory of matter.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  It consists of the four primary elements, along with color, smell, taste, and 
  nutritive essence.&nbsp;&nbsp; All the more complex material groups also 
  contain these eight phenomena as their foundation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Material groups 
  in a living organism require an input of nutriment in order to endure in 
  continuity. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r26">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=27>27</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Conascence condition 
  (<I>sahajatapaccaya</I>) is the condition whereby the conditioning state 
  contributes to the arising or maintenance of another state, the conditionally 
  arisen state, when the latter arises simultaneously with itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Consciousness is a conascence condition for the three other mental aggregates 
  -- feeling, perception and mental formations -- both at rebirth and during the 
  course of life.&nbsp;&nbsp; At rebirth it is also a conascence condition for 
  the "triple continuity," i.e.&nbsp;&nbsp; the three material decads of 
  body-sensitivity, sexual determination and the heart-base.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of 
  these consists of the above-mentioned eight material units along with physical 
  life and, as the tenth factor, the material phenomenon after which it is 
  named. [<A href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r27">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=28>28</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kammically acquired materiality 
  (<I>upadinnarupa</I>) is matter that is born of kamma.&nbsp;&nbsp; It includes 
  the physical sense faculties, the life faculty, masculinity, femininity, and 
  the coexisting material phenomena in the same group.&nbsp;&nbsp; Though such 
  types of matter are produced by kamma rather than by nutriment, they require 
  nutriment to sustain them in continuity. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r28">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=29>29</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lakkhana Samyutta (S.19/ii, 254-62) 
  describes the torments experienced by beings in the realm of the petas or 
  "afflicted spirits." [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r29">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=30>30</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; These similes are taken from the Puttamamsa 
  Sutta, the Discourse on Son's Flesh (S.12:63/ii, 97-100).&nbsp;&nbsp; See 
  Nyanaponika Thera, The Four Nutriments of Life (BPS Wheel No.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  104/105, 1967), pp.&nbsp;&nbsp; 19-40, for the sutta along with its 
  commentary. [<A

  <P><A name=31>31</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; A <I>yojana</I> is about seven miles. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r31">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=32>32</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cow-observance and the dog-observance 
  are forms of self-mortification which ascetics of the Buddha's time practiced 
  in the hope of purification; see M.57/i, 387.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently, women 
  also observed them for short periods in the hope they would make them fertile. 
  [<A href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r32">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=33>33</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The commentary to the Puttamamsa Sutta 
  develops this analogy in greater detail than the present commentary. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r33">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=34>34</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The sutta elaborates as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  If the cow stands, the creatures in the air attack it; if it leans against a 
  wall, the creatures in the wall attack it; if it lies down, the creatures in 
  the ground attack it; if it enters a pool of water, the creatures in the water 
  attack it. [<A 
href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r34">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=35>35</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Contact arises from the coming together of 
  an object, a physical basis or sense faculty (<I>vatthu</I>), and the 
  corresponding type of consciousness. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r35">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=36>36</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The simile as given in the sutta is 
  this:&nbsp;&nbsp; Two strong men grab hold of a weaker man by both arms and 
  drag him towards a blazing charcoal pit.&nbsp;&nbsp; He wriggles and struggles 
  to get free because he knows that if he is thrown into the pit, he will meet 
  death or deadly pain. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r36">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=37>37</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The king's men arrest a thief and bring him 
  before the king.&nbsp;&nbsp; The king orders him struck with a hundred spears 
  in the morning, another hundred at noon, and a third hundred in the 
  evening.&nbsp;&nbsp; The man survives but experiences deadly pain. [<A

  <P><A name=39>39</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The eight types of consciousness accompanied 
  by greed are distinguished by the presence or absence of wrong view, by their 
  accompanying feeling which may be pleasant or neutral, and by whether they are 
  spontaneous or prompted. [<A

  <P><A name=40>40</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The principle of the Four Noble Truths can 
  be discerned in the format of the exposition:&nbsp;&nbsp; a particular item X, 
  the arising of X, the cessation of X, and the way to the cessation of X. [<A

  <P><A name=41>41</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Pali the repetition <I>tesam tesam</I>, 
  lit.&nbsp;&nbsp; "of them, of them," is understood to imply complete 
  inclusiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same applies to <I>tamhi tamhi</I>, "in that, 
  in that," just below. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r42">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=42>42</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereas the previous definitions were framed 
  in conventional terminology, those valid in the ultimate sense 
  (<I>paramatthato</I>) define their subject solely in terms of "ultimate 
  realities" such as aggregates and sense bases. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r42">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=43>43</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The various realms of existence are analyzed 
  as threefold on the basis of the number of aggregates existing 
  there.&nbsp;&nbsp; One-constituent being is the non-percipient realm 
  (<I>asannibhumi</I>), which includes only the aggregate of material 
  form.&nbsp;&nbsp; Four-constituent being is the four immaterial realms, which 
  contain the four mental aggregates but not the aggregate of material 
  form.&nbsp;&nbsp; Five-constituent being comprises all other realms, in which 
  all five aggregates are present. [<A

  <P><A name=44>44</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that in the sense-sphere heavens, 
  at death the beings simply dissipate into thin air, without leaving behind any 
  corpse. [<A href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r44">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=45>45</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Decisive support condition 
  (<I>upanissayapaccaya</I>) and conascence condition (<I>sahajatapaccaya</I>) 
  are the two chief conditions among the twenty-four conditions of the Patthana 
  or Abhidhammic system of conditional relations.&nbsp;&nbsp; Decisive support 
  holds between a conditioning state and a conditioned state that it helps to 
  arise across an interval of time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Conascence condition holds 
  between a conditioning state and a conditioned state that arise 
  simultaneously.&nbsp;&nbsp; See also note 27 above. [<A

  <P><A name=46>46</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Clinging to rituals and observances and 
  clinging to a doctrine of self are both types of wrong view, but as they are 
  enumerated as individual kinds of clinging in their own right, they are not 
  included under clinging to views. [<A

  <P><A name=48>48</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are conditional relations that hold 
  between successive mind-moments in the javana phase of a single cognitive 
  process (<I>cittavithi</I>). [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r48">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=49>49</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Resultant feeling alone is intended here 
  because this is an exposition of the round of existence, and in the formula of 
  dependent arising the factors from consciousness through feeling are 
  classified as the resultant phase of the round. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r49">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=50>50</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The two eye-consciousness elements are the 
  wholesome-resultant and the unwholesome-resultant; the two resultant mind 
  elements are the wholesome-resultant and the unwholesome-resultant receiving 
  consciousness (<I>sampaticchanacitta</I>); the three resultant 
  mind-consciousness elements are three types of investigating consciousness 
  (<I>santiranacitta</I>). [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r50">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=51>51</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The registration consciousness 
  (<I>tadarammanacitta</I>) is a resultant type of consciousness that occurs 
  through any of the sense doors.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its function is to register the 
  datum that had been the object of the preceding javana series.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
  rebirth, life-continuum (<I>bhavanga</I>) and death consciousnesses are 
  resultants that are considered to be "doorless" (<I>advarika</I>) because they 
  occur at an inner subliminal level, not through the intercourse of sense 
  organs and sense objects. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r51">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=52>52</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This refers to the Abhidhamma classification 
  of thirty-two types of resultant consciousness, of which twenty-two remain 
  besides the ten types of sense-consciousness, five resultants of the 
  unwholesome and five of the wholesome.&nbsp;&nbsp; The details are not 
  necessary here. [<A

  <P><A name=53>53</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; These two definitions involve word plays 
  difficult to reproduce in English.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ven. Nanamoli has a note 
  suggesting, half flippantly, "minding" for namana and "mattering" for ruppana.

  <P><A name=54>54</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact the Visuddhimagga discusses the four 
  great elements not in its chapter on the Description of the Aggregates 
  (Ch.&nbsp;&nbsp; XIV), but in the chapter on the meditation subject called the 
  definition of the elements (Ch.&nbsp;&nbsp; XI). [<A

  <P><A name=55>55</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some instances of derived materiality 
  are:&nbsp;&nbsp; the five sense faculties, color, sound, smell, taste, the 
  life faculty, sexual determination, nutritive essence, space, etc. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r55">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=56>56</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The three planes of existence were 
  enumerated in Section 30.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only resultant consciousness is taken 
  into account here because this is an exposition of the round. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r56">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=57>57</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The figures for the types of consciousness 
  again come from the Abhidhamma.&nbsp;&nbsp; These types of consciousness can 
  come to expression either through the door of bodily action or the door of 
  speech, or they can remain within and not gain outer expression. [<A 
  href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r57">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=58>58</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The nine types of volition which do not come 
  to expression by body or speech are the five volitions of the five 
  fine-material-sphere jhanas and the four of the four immaterial-sphere jhanas. 
  [<A href="file:///E:/theravada/NANAMOLI/r_view02.htm#r58">^</A>]</P>
  <P><A name=59>59</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Elsewhere the Buddha says:&nbsp;&nbsp; "A 
  first point of ignorance cannot be discovered, of which it can be 
  said:&nbsp;&nbsp; Before that there was no ignorance and it came to be after 
  that" (A.10:61/v,113).&nbsp;&nbsp; In that sutta the Buddha cites the five 
  hindrances as the condition for ignorance, but as these in turn presuppose 
  ignorance, the vicious cycle is again established. [<A
