<A name="221"></A><B>221.</B>
One should give up anger, renounce pride, and overcome all fetters. Suffering never befalls him who clings not to mind and body and is detached.
<p>
<A name="222"></A><B>222.</B>
He who checks rising anger as a charioteer checks a rolling chariot, him I call a true charioteer. Others only hold the reins.
<p>
<A name="223"></A><B>223.</B>
Overcome the angry by non-anger; overcome the wicked by goodness; overcome the miser by generosity; overcome the liar by truth.
<p>
<A name="224"></A><B>224.</B>
Speak the truth; yield not to anger; when asked, give even if you only have a little. By these three means can one reach the presence of the gods.
<p>
<A name="225"></A><B>225.</B>
Those sages who are inoffensive and ever restrained in body, go to the Deathless State, where, having gone, they grieve no more.
<p>
<A name="226"></A><B>226.</B>
Those who are ever vigilant, who discipline themselves day and night, and are ever intent upon Nibbana -- their defilements fade away.
<p>
<A name="227"></A><B>227.</B>
O Atula! Indeed, this is an ancient practice, not one only of today: they blame those who remain silent, they blame those speak much, they blame those who speak in moderation. There is none in the world who is not blamed.
<p>
<A name="228"></A><B>228.</B>
There never was, there never will be, nor is there now, a person who is wholly blamed or wholly praised.
<p>
<A name="229"></A><B>229.</B>
But the man whom the wise praise, after observing him day after day, is one of flawless character, wise, and endowed with knowledge and virtue.
<p>
<A name="230"></A><B>230.</B>
Who can blame such a one, as worthy as a coin of refined gold? Even the gods praise him; by Brahma, too, is he praised.
<p>
<A name="231"></A><B>231.</B>
Let a man guard himself against irritability in bodily action; let him be controlled in deed. Abandoning bodily misconduct, let him practice good conduct in deed.
<p>
<A name="232"></A><B>232.</B>
Let a man guard himself against irritability in speech; let him be controlled in speech. Abandoning verbal misconduct, let him practice good conduct in speech.
<p>
<A name="233"></A><B>233.</B>
Let a man guard himself against irritability in thought; let him be controlled in mind. Abandoning mental misconduct, let him practice good conduct in thought.
<p>
<A name="234"></A><B>234.</B>
The wise are controlled in bodily action, controlled in speech and controlled in thought. They are truly well-controlled.
