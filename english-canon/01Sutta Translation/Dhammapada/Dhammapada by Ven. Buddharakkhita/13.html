Follow not the vulgar way; live not in heedlessness; hold not false views; linger not long in worldly existence.
<p>
<A name="168"></A><B>168.</B>
Arise! Do not be heedless! Lead a righteous life. The righteous live happily both in this world and the next.
<p>
<A name="169"></A><B>169.</B>
Lead a righteous life; lead not a base life. The righteous live happily both in this world and the next.
<p>
<A name="170"></A><B>170.</B>
One who looks upon the world as a bubble and a mirage, him the King of Death sees not.
<p>
<A name="171"></A><B>171.</B>
Come! Behold this world, which is like a decorated royal chariot. Here fools flounder, but the wise have no attachment to it.
<p>
<A name="172"></A><B>172.</B>
He who having been heedless is heedless no more, illuminates this world like the moon freed from clouds.
<p>
<A name="173"></A><B>173.</B>
He, who by good deeds covers the evil he has done, illuminates this world like the moon freed from clouds.
<p>
<A name="174"></A><B>174.</B>
Blind is the world; here only a few possess insight. Only a few, like birds escaping from the net, go to realms of bliss.
<p>
<A name="175"></A><B>175.</B>
Swans fly on the path of the sun; men pass through the air by psychic powers; the wise are led away from the world after vanquishing Mara and his host.
<p>
<A name="176"></A><B>176.</B>
For a liar who has violated the one law (of truthfulness) who holds in scorn the hereafter, there is no evil that he cannot do.
<p>
<A name="177"></A><B>177.</B>
Truly, misers fare not to heavenly realms; nor, indeed, do fools praise generosity. But the wise man rejoices in giving, and by that alone does he become happy hereafter.
<p>
<A name="178"></A><B>178.</B>
Better than sole sovereignty over the earth, better than going to heaven, better even than lordship over all the worlds is the supramundane Fruition of Stream Entrance.
