<A name="44"></A><B>44.</B> Who shall overcome this earth, this realm of Yama and this sphere of men and gods? Who shall bring to perfection the well-taught path of wisdom as an expert garland-maker would his floral design?
<p>
<A name="45"></A><B>45.</B> A striver-on-the path shall overcome this earth, this realm of Yama and this sphere of men and gods. The striver-on-the-path shall bring to perfection the well-taught path of wisdom, as an expert garland-maker would his floral design.

<p>
<A name="46"></A><B>46.</B> Realizing that this body is like froth, penetrating its mirage-like nature, and plucking out Mara's flower-tipped arrows of sensuality, go beyond sight of the King of Death!
<p>
<A name="47"></A><B>47.</B> As a mighty flood sweeps away the sleeping village, so death carries away the person of distracted mind who only plucks the flowers (of pleasure).
<p>
<A name="48"></A><B>48.</B> The Destroyer brings under his sway the person of distracted mind who, insatiate in sense desires, only plucks the flowers (of pleasure).
<p>
<A name="49"></A><B>49.</B> As a bee gathers honey from the flower without injuring its color or fragrance, even so the sage goes on his alms-round in the village.
[<A HREF="notes.html#8">8</A>]
<p>
<A name="50"></A><B>50.</B> Let none find fault with others; let none see the omissions and commissions of others. But let one see one's own acts, done and undone.
<p>
<A name="51"></A><B>51.</B> Like a beautiful flower full of color but without fragrance, even so, fruitless are the fair words of one who does not practice them.
<p>
<A name="52"></A><B>52.</B> Like a beautiful flower full of color and also fragrant, even so, fruitful are the fair words of one who practices them.
<p>
<A name="53"></A><B>53.</B> As from a great heap of flowers many garlands can be made, even so should many good deeds be done by one born a mortal.
<p>
<A name="54"></A><B>54.</B> Not the sweet smell of flowers, not even the fragrance of sandal, <i>tagara,</i> or jasmine blows against the wind. But the fragrance of the virtuous blows against the wind. Truly the virtuous man pervades all directions with the fragrance of his virtue.
[<A HREF="notes.html#9">9</A>]
<p>
<A name="55"></A><B>55.</B> Of all the fragrances -- sandal, <i>tagara,</i> blue lotus and jasmine -- the fragrance of virtue is the sweetest.
<p>
<A name="56"></A><B>56.</B> Faint is the fragrance of <i>tagara</i> and sandal, but excellent is the fragrance of the virtuous, wafting even amongst the gods.
<p>
<A name="57"></A><B>57.</B> Mara never finds the path of the truly virtuous, who abide in heedfulness and are freed by perfect knowledge.
<p>
<A name="58"></A><B>58.</B> Upon a heap of rubbish in the road-side ditch blooms a lotus, fragrant and pleasing.
<p>
<A name="59"></A><B>59.</B> Even so, on the rubbish heap of blinded mortals the disciple of the Supremely Enlightened One shines resplendent in wisdom.
