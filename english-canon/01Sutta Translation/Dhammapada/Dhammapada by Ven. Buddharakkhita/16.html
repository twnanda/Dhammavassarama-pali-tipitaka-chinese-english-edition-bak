<A name="209"></A><B>209.</B>
Giving himself to things to be shunned and not exerting where exertion is needed, a seeker after pleasures, having given up his true welfare, envies those intent upon theirs.
<p>
<A name="210"></A><B>210.</B>
Seek no intimacy with the beloved and also not with the unloved, for not to see the beloved and to see the unloved, both are painful.
<p>
<A name="211"></A><B>211.</B>
Therefore hold nothing dear, for separation from the dear is painful. There are no bonds for those who have nothing beloved or unloved.
<p>
<A name="212"></A><B>212.</B>
From endearment springs grief, from endearment springs fear. From him who is wholly free from endearment there is no grief, whence then fear?
<p>
<A name="213"></A><B>213.</B>
From affection springs grief, from affection springs fear. From him who is wholly free from affection there is no grief, whence then fear?
<p>
<A name="214"></A><B>214.</B>
From attachment springs grief, from attachment springs fear. From him who is wholly free from attachment there is no grief, whence then fear?
<p>
<A name="215"></A><B>215.</B>
From lust springs grief, from lust springs fear. From him who is wholly free from craving there is no grief; whence then fear?
<p>
<A name="216"></A><B>216.</B>
From craving springs grief, from craving springs fear. From him who is wholly free from craving there is no grief; whence then fear?
<p>
<A name="217"></A><B>217.</B>
People hold dear him who embodies virtue and insight, who is principled, has realized the truth, and who himself does what he ought to be doing.
<p>
<A name="218"></A><B>218.</B>
One who is intent upon the Ineffable (Nibbana), dwells with mind inspired (by supramundane wisdom), and is no more bound by sense pleasures -- such a man is called "One Bound Upstream."
[<A HREF="notes.html#18">18</A>]
<p>
<A name="219"></A><B>219.</B>
When, after a long absence, a man safely returns from afar, his relatives, friends and well-wishers welcome him home on arrival.
<p>
<A name="220"></A><B>220.</B>
As kinsmen welcome a dear one on arrival, even so his own good deeds will welcome the doer of good who has gone from this world to the next.
