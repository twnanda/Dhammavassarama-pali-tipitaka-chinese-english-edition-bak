If one holds oneself dear, one should diligently watch oneself. Let the wise man keep vigil during any of the three watches of the night.
<p>
<A name="158"></A><B>158.</B>
One should first establish oneself in what is proper; then only should one instruct others. Thus the wise man will not be reproached.
<p>
<A name="159"></A><B>159.</B>
One should do what one teaches others to do; if one would train others, one should be well controlled oneself. Difficult, indeed, is self-control.
<p>
<A name="160"></A><B>160.</B>
One truly is the protector of oneself; who else could the protector be? With oneself fully controlled, one gains a mastery that is hard to gain.
<p>

The evil a witless man does by himself, born of himself and produced by himself, grinds him as a diamond grinds a hard gem.
<p>
<A name="162"></A><B>162.</B>
Just as a single creeper strangles the tree on which it grows, even so, a man who is exceedingly depraved harms himself as only an enemy might wish.
<p>
<A name="163"></A><B>163.</B>
Easy to do are things that are bad and harmful to oneself. But exceedingly difficult to do are things that are good and beneficial.
<p>
<A name="164"></A><B>164.</B>
Whoever, on account of perverted views, scorns the Teaching of the Perfected Ones, the Noble and Righteous Ones -- that fool, like the bamboo, produces fruits only for self destruction.
[<A HREF="notes.html#14">14</A>]
<p>
<A name="165"></A><B>165.</B>
By oneself is evil done; by oneself is one defiled. By oneself is evil left undone; by oneself is one made pure. Purity and impurity depended on oneself; no one can purify another.
<p>
<A name="166"></A><B>166.</B>
Let one not neglect one's own welfare for the sake of another, however great. Clearly understanding one's own welfare, let one be intent upon the good.
