    The Story of a <a NAME="Certain">Certain Person</a></b></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (60) of this book, with reference to a certain young man and King Pasenadi
    of Kosala.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day King Pasenadi, while going out in the city,
    happened to see a beautiful young woman standing at the window of her house and he
    instantly fell in love with her. So the king tried to find ways and means of getting her.
    Finding that she was a married woman, he sent for her husband and made him serve at the
    palace. Later, the husband was sent on an impossible errand by the king. The young man was
    to go to a place, a yojana (twelve miles) away from Savatthi, bring back some<b> </b><em>Kumuda</em>
    lotus flowers and some red earth called <em>'arunavati' </em>from the land of the dragons
    (nagas) and arrive back at Savatthi the same evening, in time for the king's bath. The
    king's intention was to kill the husband if he failed to arrive back in time, and to take
    the wife for himself.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hurriedly taking a food packet from his wife, the young
    man set out on his errand. On the way, he shared his food with a traveller. He also threw
    some rice into the water and said loudly, &quot;O guardian spirits and dragons inhabiting
    this river! King Pasenadi has commanded me to get some Kumuda lotus flowers and arunavati
    red earth for him. I have today shared my food with a traveller; I have also fed the fish
    in the river; I now share with you the benefits of the good deeds I have done today.
    Please get the Kumuda lotus and arunavati red earth for me.&quot; The king of the dragons,
    hearing him, took the appearance of an old man and brought the lotus and the red earth. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On that evening, King Pasenadi, fearing that the young
    husband might arrive back in time, had the city-gates closed early. The young man, finding
    the city-gates closed, placed the red earth on the city-wall and stuck the flowers on the
    earth. Then he declared loudly,</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;O citizens! Be my witnesses! I have today
    accomplished my errand in time as instructed by the king. King Pasenadi, without any
    justification, plans to kill me.&quot; After that, the young man left for the Jetavana
    monastery to take shelter and find solace in the peaceful atmosphere of the monastery.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Meanwhile, King Pasenadi, obsessed with sexual desire,
    could not sleep, and kept thinking out how he would get rid of the husband in the morning
    and take his wife. At about midnight, he heard some eerie sounds; actually, these were the
    doleful voices of four persons suffering in <em>Lohakumbhi Niraya</em> . Hearing those
    weird voices, the king was terrified. Early in the morning, he went to the Buddha, as
    advised by Queen Mallika. When the Buddha was told about the four voices the king heard in
    the night, he explained to the king that those were the voices of four beings, who were
    the sons of rich men during the time of Kassapa Buddha, and that now they were suffering
    in Lohakumbhi Niraya because they had committed sexual misconduct with other people's
    wives. Then, the king came to realize the depravity of the deed and the severity of the
    punishment. So, he decided then and there that he would no longer covet another man's
    wife. &quot;After all, it was on account of my intense desire for another man's wife that
    I was tormented and could not sleep the whole of last night,&quot; he reflected. Then King
    Pasenadi said to the Buddha, &quot;Venerable Sir, now I know how long the night is for one
    who cannot sleep.&quot; The young man who was close at hand also said, &quot;Venerable
    Sir, because I had travelled the full distance of a yojana yesterday, I, too, know how
    long the journey of a yojana is to one who is weary.&quot;</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (61) of this book, with reference to a resident pupil of Thera Mahakassapa.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Thera Mahakassapa was residing near Rajagaha, he had
    two young bhikkhus staying with him. One of them was respectful, obedient and dutiful to
    the thera, but the other one was not. When the old thera chided the latter for his
    slackness in his duties, he was very much offended. On one occasion, he went to the house
    of a lay-disciple of the thera, and lied to them that the thera was ill. Thus, he got some
    choice food from them for the thera; but he ate the food on the way. When admonished by
    the thera for this he was extremely angry. The next day, when the thera was out on his
    alms-round, the young foolish bhikkhu stayed behind, broke the pots and pans and set fire
    to the monastery.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When a bhikkhu from Rajagaha told the Buddha about this,
    the Buddha said that it would have been much better for Thera Mahakassapa to live alone
    than to live with a foolish companion.</font></p>

    Story of <a NAME="Ananda">Ananda</a>, the Rich Man</b></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (62) of this book, with reference to a miserly rich man, named Ananda. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There was once a very wealthy man named Ananda in
    Savatthi. Although he possessed eighty crores, he was very reluctant to give anything in
    charity. To his son, Mulasiri, he used to say, &quot;Don't think the wealth we have now is
    very much. Do not give away anything from what you have, for you must make it grow.
    Otherwise your wealth will dwindle away.&quot; This rich man had five pots of gold buried
    in his house and he died without revealing their location to his son.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ananda, the rich man, was reborn in a village of beggars,
    not far from Savatthi. From the time his mother was pregnant, the income of the beggars
    decreased; the villagers thought there must be a wicked and unlucky one amongst them. By
    dividing themselves up into groups and by the process of elimination, they came to the
    conclusion that the pregnant beggar woman must be the unfortunate one. Thus, she was
    driven out of the village. When her son was born, the son proved to be extremely ugly and
    repulsive. If she went out begging by herself, she would get as before, but if she went
    out with her son she would get nothing. So, when the boy could go out by himself, his
    mother placed a plate in his hand and left him. As he wandered about in Savatthi, he
    remembered his old house and his past existence. So he went into the house. When the sons
    of his son Mulasiri saw him, they were frightened by his ugly looks and began to cry. The
    servants then beat him and threw him out of the house.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha who was on his alms-round saw the incident and
    asked the Venerable Ananda to fetch Mulasiri. When Mulasiri came, the Buddha told him that
    the young beggar was his own father in his previous existence. But Mulasiri could not
    believe it. So, the Buddha directed the beggar boy to show where he had buried his five
    pots of gold. Then only, Mulasiri accepted the truth and from that time he became a
    devoted lay-disciple of the Buddha. </font></p>

    and he managed to snatch a small sum of money from one of the lay-disciples. After the
    discourse they went back and cooked their meal at the house of the second thief, the one
    who managed to get some money. The wife of the second thief taunted the first thief,
    &quot;You are so wise, you don't even have anything to cook at your house.&quot; Hearing
    this remark, the first thief thought to himself, &quot;This one is so foolish that she

    Fruition. When the crowd had dispersed, he followed the Buddha to the monastery as he
    wished to tell the Buddha about his attainment of Sotapatti Fruition. Sakka, king of the
    devas, wishing to test the leper's faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Samgha,
    appeared to him and said, &quot;You are only a poor man, living on what you get by
    begging, with no one to fall back on. I can give you immense wealth if you deny the
    Buddha, the Dhamma and the Samgha and say that you have no use for them.&quot; To this,
    Suppabuddha replied. &quot;I am certainly not a poor man, with no one to rely on. I am a
    rich man; I possess the seven attributes which the ariyas possess; I have faith (saddha),
    morality (sila), sense of shame to do evil (hiri), sense of fear to do evil (ottappa),

    it would not be easy even for a hundred or a thousand Sakkas to coax Suppabuddha away from
    the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Samgha. Soon after this, Suppabuddha arrived at the
    monastery and reported to the Buddha about his attainment of Sotapatti Fruition. On his
    way back from the Jetavana monastery, Suppabuddha was gored to death by an infuriated cow,
    who, in fact, was an ogress assuming the form of a cow. This ogress was none other than

    the world with his supernormal power, perceived that a farmer, cultivating near that
    field, would attain Sotapatti Fruition on that very day. So, the Buddha went there,
    accompinied by the Venerable Ananda. The farmer on seeing the Buddha paid obeisance to him
    and continued to plough the field. The Buddha seeing the packet of money said to the
    Venerable Ananda, &quot;Ananda, look at that very poisonous snake,&quot; and Ananda
    replied, &quot;Venerable Sir, yes, it is, indeed, a very poisonous snake!&quot; Then, both

    was a snake and found the packet of money. He took the picket and hid it in a place. The
    owners of the property coming after the thieves came to the field, and tracing the
    footprints of the farmer, found the packet of money. They beat the farmer and took him to
    the king, who ordered his men to kill the farmer. On being taken to the cemetery, where he
    was to be killed, the farmer kept on repeating, &quot;Ananda, look at that very poisonous
    snake. Venerable Sir, I see the snake; it is, indeed, a very poisonous snake!&quot; When
    the king's men heard the above dialogue between the Buddha and the Venerable Ananda being
    repeated all the way, they were puzzled and took him to the king. The king surmised that
    the farmer was calling upon the Buddha as a witness; he was therefore taken to the
    presence of the Buddha. After hearing from the Buddha everything that had happened in the
    morning, the king remarked, &quot;If he had not been able to call upon the Buddha as a
    witness of his innocence, this man would have been killed.&quot; To him, the Buddha

    he saw the Buddha, with a halo of light-rays radiating from him, coming into town for
    alms-food accompanied by many bhikkhus. Seeing the Buddha in his resplendent glory, the
    florist Sumana felt a strong desire to offer his flowers to the Buddha. Then and there, he
    decided that even if the king were to drive him out of the country or to kill him, he
    would not offer the flowers to the king for that day. Thus, he threw up the flowers to the
    sides, to the back and over and above the head of the Buddha. The flowers remained hanging
    in the air; those over the head formed a canopy of flowers and those at the back and the
    sides formed walls of flowers. These flowers followed the Buddha in this position as he
    moved on, and stopped when the Buddha stopped. As the Buddha proceeded, surrounded by
    walls of flowers, and a canopy of flowers, with the six-coloured rays radiating from his
    body, followed by a large entourage, thousands of people inside and outside of Rajagaha
    came out of their houses to pay obeisance to the Buddha. As for Sumana, his entire body
    was suffused with delightful satisfaction (Piti).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The wife of the florist Sumana then went to the king and
    said that she had nothing to do with her husband failing to supply the king with flowers
    for that day. The king, being a Sotapanna himself, felt quite happy about the flowers. He
    came out to see the wonderful sight and paid obeisance to the Buddha. The king also took
    the opportunity to offer alms-food to the Buddha and his disciples. After the meal, the
    Buddha returned in the Jetavana monastery and the king followed him for some distance. On
    arrival back at the palace King Bimbisara sent for Sumana and offered him a reward of
    eight elephants, eight horses, eight male slaves, eight female slaves, eight maidens and
    eight thousand in cash.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the Jetavana monastery, the Venerable Ananda asked the
    Buddha what benefits Sumana would gain by his good deed done on that day. The Buddha
    answered that Sumana, having given to the Buddha without any consideration for his life,
    would not be born in any of the four lower worlds (Apaya) for the next one hundred
    thousand worlds and that eventually he would become a paccekabuddha. After that, as the
    Buddha entered the Perfumed Hall (<b>Gandhakuti</b>) the flowers dropped off of their own
    accord.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman">That night, at the end of the usual

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once there was a young daughter of a rich man in Savatthi.
    Because she was so beautiful, with looks so tender and sweet, like a blue lotus flower,
    she was called &quot;Uppalavanna&quot;, the blue lotus. The fame of her beauty spread far
    and wide and there were many suitors: princes, rich men and many others. But she decided
    that it would be better for her to become a bhikkhuni, a female member of the Buddhist
    Order. One day, after lighting a lamp, she kept her mind fixed on the flame and meditating
    on the fire kasina (object of concentration) she soon achieved Magga Insight and finally
    attained arahatship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some time later, she moved to the 'Dark Forest'
    (Andhavana) and lived in solitude. While Theri Uppalavanna was out on her alms-round,
    Nanda, the son of her uncle, came to her monastery and hid himself underneath her couch.
    Nanda had fallen in love with Uppalavanna before she became a bhikkhuni; his intention
    obviously was to take her by force. When Uppalavanna returned she saw Nanda and said,
    &quot;You fool! Do no harm, do not molest.&quot; But he would not be stopped. After
    satisfying himself, he left her. As soon as he stepped on the ground, the earth opened
    wide and he was swallowed up.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (70) of this book, with reference to Thera Jambuka.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Jambuka was the son of a rich man in Savatthi. Due to his
    past evil deeds he was born with very peculiar habits. As a child, he wanted to sleep on
    the floor with no proper bed, and to take his own excreta for food instead of rice. When
    he grew older, his parents sent him to the Ajivakas, the naked ascetics. When those
    ascetics found out about his peculiar food habits they drove him away. At nights he ate
    human excreta and in the day time stood still on one leg and kept his mouth open. He used
    to say that he kept his mouth open because he only lived on air and that he stood on one
    leg because it would otherwise be too heavy for the earth to bear him. &quot;I never sit
    down, I never go to sleep,&quot; he boasted and on account of this, he was known as
    Jambuka, a 'jackal'.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many people believed him and some would come to him with
    offerings of choice food. Then Jambuka would refuse and say, &quot;I do not take any food
    except air.&quot; When pressed, he would take just a little of the food with the tip of a
    blade of grass and say, &quot;Now go, this little will give you enough merit.&quot; In
    this way, Jambuka lived for fifty-five years, naked and taking only excreta.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day, the Buddha saw in his vision that Jambuka was due
    to attain arahatship within a short time. So, in the evening, the Buddha went to where
    Jambuka was staying and asked for some place to spend the night. Jambuka pointed out to
    him a mountain-cave not far from the stone slab on which he himself was staying. During
    the first, second and third watches of the night, the Catumaharajika devas, Sakka and
    Mahabrahma came to pay homage to the Buddha in turn. On all the three occasions, the
    forest was lit up and Jambuka saw the light three times. In the morning, he walked over to
    the Buddha and enquired about the lights.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When told about the devas, Sakka and Mahabrahma coming to
    pay homage to the Buddha, Jambuka was very much impressed, and said to the Buddha,
    &quot;You must, indeed, be a wonderfully great person for the devas, Sakka and Mahabrahma
    to come and pay homage to you. As for me, even though I have I practised austerely for
    fifty-five years, living only on air and standing only on one leg, none of the devas, nor
    Sakka, nor Mahabrahma has ever came to me&quot; To him, the Buddha replied, &quot;O
    Jambuka! You have been deceiving other people, but you cannot deceive me. I know that for
    fifty-five years you have been eating excreta and sleeping on the ground.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Furthermore, the Buddha explained to him how in one of his
    past existences during the time of Kassapa Buddha, Jambuka had prevented a thera from
    going with him to the house of a lay-disciple where alms-food was being offered and how he
    had also thrown away the food that was sent along with him for that thera. It was for
    those evil deeds that Jambuka had to be eating excreta and sleeping on the ground. Hearing
    that account, Jambuka was horrified and terror-strickeen, and repented for having done
    evil and for having deceived other people. He went down on his knees and the Buddha gave
    him a piece of cloth to put on. The Buddha then proceeded to deliver a discourse; at the
    end of the discourse Jambuka attained arahatship and joined the Buddhist Order on the
    spot.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Soon after this, Jambuka's pupils from Anga and Magadha
    arrived and they were surprised to see their teacher with the Buddha. Theta Jambuka then
    explained to his pupils that he had joined the Buddhist Order and that he was now only a
    disciple of the Buddha. To them, the Buddha said that although their teacher had lived
    austerely by taking food very sparingly, it was not worth even one-sixteenth part of his
    present practice and achievement. </font></p>

    Lakkhana that he smiled because he saw a peta-ghost with the head of a human being and the
    body of a snake. The Buddha then said that he himself had seen that very peta-ghost on the
    day he attained Buddhahood. The Buddha also explained that, a very long time ago, there
    was a paccekabuddha, who was respected by many. People going to his monastery had to
    traverse a field. The owner of the field, fearing that his field would be damaged by too
    many people going to and from the monastery, set fire to it. Consequently, the
    paccekabuddha had to move to some other place. The disciples of the paccekabuddha, being
    very angry with the land-owner, beat him and killed him. On his death he was reborn in

    consequences (kamma) as a peta-ghost.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In conclusion, the Buddha said, &quot;An evil deed does

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Chief Disciple Maha Moggallana saw this enormous
    peta-ghost while going on an alms-round with Thera Lakkhana. In this connection, the
    Buddha explained that Satthikutapeta, in one of his previous existences, was very skilful
    in throwing stones at things. One day, he asked permissions from his teacher to try out
    his skill. His teacher told him not to hit a cow, or a human being as he would have to pay
    compensation to the owner or to the relative, but to find a target which was ownerless or
    guardianless. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On seeing the paccekabuddha, the idiots lacking in
    intelligence, thought the paccekabuddha, having no relative or guardian, would be an ideal
    target. So he threw a stone at the paccekabuddha who was on an alms-round. The stone
    entered from one ear and came out of the other. The paccekabuddha expired when he reached
    the monastery. The stone-thrower was killed by the disciples of the paccekabuddha and he
    was reborn in Avici Niraya. Afterwards, he was reborn as a peta-ghost and had since been

    the discourse given by him, Citta attained Sotapatti Fruition. Later, Citta built a
    monastery in his mango grove. There, he looked to the needs of all bhikkhus who came to
    the monastery and Bhikkhu Sudhamma was installed as the resident bhikkhu.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day, the two Chief Disciples of the Buddha, the
    Venerable Sariputta and the Venerable Mahaa Moggallana, came to the monastery and after
    listening to the discourse given by the Venerable Sariputta, Citta attained Anagami
    Fruition. Then, he invited the two Chief Disciples to his house for alms-food the next
    day. He also invited Thera Sudhamma, but Thera Sudhamma refused in anger and said,
    &quot;You invite me only after the other two.&quot; Citta repeated his invitation, but it
    was turned down. Nevertheless, Thera Sudhamma went to the house of Citta early on the
    following day. But when invited to enter the house, Thera Sudhamma refused and said that
    he would not sit down as he was going on his alms-round. But when he saw the things that
    were to be offered to the two Chief Disciples, he envied them so much that he could not
    restrain his anger. He abused Citta and said, &quot;I don't want to stay in your monastery

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From there, he went to the Buddha and reported everything

    mistake.&quot; Sudhamma did as he was told by the Buddha, but Citta would not be appeased;
    so he returned to the Buddha for the second time. The Buddha, knowing that the pride of

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (75) of this book, with reference to Tissa, a samanera, who dwelt in a
    forest monastery.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Tissa was the son of a rich man from Savatthi. His father
    used to offer alms-food to the Chief Disciple Sariputta in their house and so Tissa even
    as a child had met the Chief Disciple on many occasions. At the age of seven he became a
    novice (samanera) under the Chief Disciple Sariputta. While he was staying at the Jetavana
    monastery, many of his friends and relatives came to see him, bringing presents and
    offerings. The samanera found these visits to be very tiresome; so after taking a subject
    of meditation from the Buddha, he left for a forest monastery. Whenever a villager offered
    him anything, Tissa would just say 'May you be happy, may you be liberated from the ills
    of life,' (&quot;Sukhita hotha, dukkha muccatha&quot;), and would go on his own way. While
    he stayed at the forest monastery, he ardently and diligently practised meditation, and at
    the end of three months he attained arahatship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the vassa, the Venerable Sariputta accompanied by
    the Venerable Maha Moggallana and other senior disciples paid a visit to Samanera Tissa,
    with the permission of the Buddha. All the villagers came out to welcome the Venerable
    Sariputta and his company of four thousand bhikkhus. They also requested the Venerable
    Sariputta to favour them with a discourse, but the Chief Disciple declined; instead, he
    directed his pupil Tissa to deliver a discourse to the villagers. The villagers, however,
    said that their teacher Tissa could only say &quot;May you be happy, may you be liberated
    from the ills of life,&quot; and asked the Chief Disciple to assign another bhikkhu in his
    place. But the Venerable Sariputta insisted that Tissa should deliver a discourse on the
    dhamma, and said to Tissa, &quot;Tissa, talk to them about the dhamma and show them how to
    gain happiness and how to be liberated from the ills of life.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, in obedience to his teacher, Samanera Tissa went up
    the platform to deliver his discourse. He explained to the audience the meaning of the
    aggregates (khandhas), sense bases and sense objects (ayatanas), elements of the
    perpetuation of the Teaching (Bodhipakkhiya Dhamma), the Path leading to arahatship and
    Nibbana, etc. Finally he concluded, &quot;And thus, those who attain arahatship are
    liberated from all the ills of life and have Perfect Peace; all the rest will still wander
    about in the round of rebirths (samsara).&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Venerable Sariputta praised Tissa for having expounded
    the dhamma so well. Dawn was approaching when he finished his exposition, and all the
    villagers were very much impressed. Some of them were surprised that Samanera Tissa knew
    the dhamma so well, but they were also dissatisfied with him because formerly he had
    talked so little about the dhamma to them; the others were happy and contented to find the
    samanera to be so learned and felt that they were very lucky to have him amongst them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha, with his supernormal power, saw from the
    Jetavana monastery these two groups of villagers and appeared before them. His intention
    in coming to the village was to clear up the misunderstanding amongst the first group of
    villagers. The Buddha arrived while the villagers were preparing alms-food for the
    bhikkhus. So, they had the opportunity to offer alms-food to the Buddha as well. After the
    meal, the Buddha addressed the villagers, &quot;O lay disciples, all of you are so lucky
    to have Samanera Tissa amongst you. It is on account of his presence here that I myself,
    my Chief Disciples, senior disciples and many other bhikkhus now pay you a visit.&quot;
    These words made them realize how fortunate they were to have Samanera Tissa with them and
    they were satisfied. The Buddha then delivered a discourse to the villagers and the
    bhikkhus, and consequently, many of them attained Sotapatti Fruition.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the discourse, the Buddha returned to the Jetavana
    monastery. In the evening, the bhikkhus said in praise of Tissa to the Buddha,
    &quot;Venerable Sir, Samanera Tissa had performed a very difficult task; he was so well
    provided with gifts and offerings of all kinds here in Savatthi, yet he gave up all these
    to go and live austerely in a forest monastery.&quot; To them the Buddha replied,
    &quot;Bhikkhus, a hhikkhu, whether in town or in village, should not live for the sake of
    gifts and offerings, if a bhikkhu renounces all good prospects or worldly gain and
    diligently practises the dhamma in solitude, he is sure to attain arahatship.&quot;</font></p>
