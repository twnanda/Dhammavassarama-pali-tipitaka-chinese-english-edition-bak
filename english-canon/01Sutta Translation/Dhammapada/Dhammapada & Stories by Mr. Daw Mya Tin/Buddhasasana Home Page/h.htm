    The Story of a <a NAME="youngbhikkhu">Young Bhikkhu</a></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (167) of this book, with reference to a young bhikkhu.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, a young bhikkhu accompanied an older bhikkhu to the
    house of Visakha. After taking rice gruel, the elder bhikkhu left for another place,
    leaving the young bhikkhu behind at the house of Visakha. The granddaughter of Visakha was
    filtering some water for the young bhikkhu, and when she saw her own reflection in the big
    water pot she smiled. Seeing her thus smiling, the young bhikkhu looked at her and he also
    smiled. When she saw the young bhikkhu looking at her and smiling at her, she lost her
    temper, and cried out angrily, <font>&quot;You, a shaven head! Why are you smiling at me
    ?&quot; </font>The young bhikkhu reported, &quot;You are a shaven head yourself; your
    mother and your father are also shaven heads!&quot; Thus, they quarrelled, and the young
    girl went weeping to her grandmother. Visakha came and said to the young bhikkhu,
    &quot;Please do not get angry with my grand daughter. But, a bhikkhu does have his hair
    shaved, his finger nails and toe nails cut, and putting on a robe which is made up of cut
    pieces, he goes on alms-round with a bowl which is rimless. What this young girl said was,
    in a way, quite right, is it not?&quot; The young bhikkhu replied. &quot;It is true but
    why should she abuse me on that account ?&quot; At this point, the elder bhikkhu returned;
    but both Visakha and the old bhikkhu failed to appease the young bhikkhu and the young
    girl.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Soon after this, the Buddha arrived and learned about the
    quarrel. The Buddha knew that time was ripe for the young bhikkhu to attain Sotapatti
    Fruition. Then, in order to make the young bhikkhu more responsive to his words, he
    seemingly sided with him and said to Visakha, <i>&quot;Visakha, what reason is there for
    your grand daughter to address my son as a shaven head just because he has his head
    shaven? After all, he had his head shaven to enter my Order, didn't he?&quot;</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hearing these words, the young bhikkhu went down on his
    knees, paid obeisance to the Buddha, and said, &quot;Venerable Sir! You alone understans
    me; neither my teacher nor the great donor of the monastery understands me.&quot; The
    Buddha knew that the bhikkhu was then in a receptive mood and so he said, <i>&quot;To
    smile with sensual desire is ignoble; it is not right and proper to have ignoble
    thoughts.&quot;</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:</font></p>

    The Story of <a name="kingsuddodana">King Suddhodana</a> </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Nigrodharama monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verses (168) and (169) of this book, with reference to King Suddhodana, father of
    Gotama Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the Buddha revisited Kapilavatthu for the first time
    he stayed at the Nigrodharama monastery. There, he expounded the Dhamma to his relatives.
    King Suddhodana thought that Gotama Buddha, who was his own son, would go to no other
    place, but would surely come to his palace for alms-food the next day; but he did not
    specifically invite the Buddha to come for alms-food. However, the next day, he prepared
    alms-food for twenty thousand bhikkhus. On that morning the Buddha went on his alms-round
    with a retinue of bhikkhus, as was the custom of all the Buddhas.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Yasodhara, wife of Prince Siddhattha before he renounced
    the world, saw the Buddha going on an alms-round, from the palace window. She informed her
    father-in-law, King Suddhodana, and the King went in great haste to the Buddha. The king
    told the Buddha that for a member of the royal Khattiya family, to go round begging for
    food from door to door was a disgrace. Whereupon the Buddha replied that it was the custom
    of all the Buddhas to go round for alms-food from house to house, and therefore it was
    right and proper for him to keep up the tradition.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On one occasion, five hundred bhikkhus, after taking a
    subject of meditation from the Buddha, went into the forest to practise meditation. But
    they made very little progress; so they returned to the Buddha to ask for a more suitable
    subject of meditation. On their way to the Buddha, seeing a mirage they meditated on it.
    As soon as they entered the compound of the monastery, a storm broke out; as big drops of
    rain fell, bubbles were formed on the ground and soon disappeared. Seeing those bubbles,
    the bhikkhus reflected &quot;This body of ours is perishable like the bubbles&quot;, and
    perceived the impermanent nature of the aggregates (khandhas).</font></p>

    suppressing a rebellion at the frontier. King Bimbisara was so pleased with him that for
    seven days, Abhaya was given the glory and honour of a ruler, together with a dancing girl
    to entertain him. On the last day, while the dancer was entertaining the prince and his
    company in the garden, she had a severe stroke; she collapsed and died on the spot. The
    prince was shocked and very much distressed. Sorrowfully, he went to the Buddha to find
    solace. To him the Buddha said,<i> &quot;O prince, the tears you have shed all through the

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (172) of this book, with reference to Thera Sammajjana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thera Sammajjana spent most of his time sweeping the
    precincts of the monastery. At that time, Thera Revata was also staying at the monastery;
    unlike Sammajjana, Thera Revata spent most of his time in meditation or deep mental
    absorption. Seeing Thera Revata's behaviour, Thera Sammajjana thought the other thera was
    just idling away his time. Thus, one day Sammajjana went to Thera Revata and said to him,
    &quot;You are being very lazy, living on the food offered out of faith and generosity;
    don't you think you should sometimes sweep the floors or the compound or some other
    place?&quot; To him, Thera Revata replied, &quot;Friend, a bhikkhu should not spend all
    his times sweeping. He should sweep early in the morning, then go out on the alms-round.
    After the meal, contemplating his body he should try to perceive the true nature of the
    aggregates, or else, recite the texts until nightfall. Then he can do the sweeping again
    if he so wishes.&quot; Thera Sammajjana strictly followed the advice given by Thera Revata
    and soon attained arahatship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Other bhikkhus noticed some rubbish piling up in the
    compound and they asked Sammajjana why he was not sweeping as much as he used to, and he
    replied, &quot;When I was not mindful, I was all the time sweeping; but now I am no longer
    unmindful.&quot; When the bhikkhus heard his reply they were sceptical; so they went to
    the Buddha and said, &quot;Venerable Sir! Thera Sammajjana falsely claims himself to be an
    arahat; he is telling lies.&quot; To them the Buddha said, <i>&quot;Sammajjana has indeed

    The Story of Thera <a NAME="theraangulimala">Angulimala</a> </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (173) of this book, with reference to Thera Angulimala. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Angulimala was the son of the Head Priest in the court of
    King Pasenadi of Kosala. His original name was Ahimsaka. When he was of age, he was sent
    to Taxila, a renowned university town. Ahimsaka was intelligent and was also obedient to
    his teacher. So he was liked by the teacher and his wife; as a result, other pupils were
    jealous of him. So they went to the teacher and falsely reported that Ahimsaka was having
    an affair with the teacher's wife. At first, the teacher did not believe them, but after
    being told a number of times he believed them; and so he vowed to have revenge on the boy.
    To kill the boy would reflect badly on him; so he thought of a plan which was worse than
    murder. He told Ahimsaka to kill one thousand men or women and in return he promised to
    give the boy priceless knowledge. The boy wanted to have this knowledge, but was very
    reluctant to take life. However, he agreed to do as he was told.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, he kept on killing people, and not to lose count, he
    threaded a finger each of everyone he killed and wore them like a garland round his neck.
    In this way, he was known as Angulimala, and became the terror of the countryside. The
    king himself heard about the exploits of Angulimala, and he made preparations to capture
    him. When Mantani, the mother of Angulimala, heard about the king's intention, out of love
    for her son, she went into the forest in a desperate bid to save her son. By this time,
    the chain round the neck of Angulimala had nine hundred and ninety-nine fingers in it,
    just one finger short of one thousand.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Early in the morning on that day, the Buddha saw
    Angulimala in his vision, and reflected that if he did not intervene, Angulimala who was
    on the look out for the last person to make up the one thousand would see his mother and
    might kill her. In that case, Angulimala would have to suffer in niraya endlessly. So out
    of compassion, the Buddha left for the forest where Angulimala was.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Angulimala, after many sleepless days and nights, was very
    tired and near exhaustion. At the same time, he was very anxious to kill the last person
    to make up his full quota of one thousand and so complete his task. He made up his mind to
    kill the first person he met. Suddenly, as he looked out he saw the Buddha and ran after
    him with his knife raised. But the Buddha could not be reached while he himself was
    completely exhausted. Then, looking at the Buddha, he cried out, &quot;O bhikkhu, stop!
    stop !&quot; and the Buddha replied, <i>&quot;I have stopped, only you have not
    stopped.&quot;</i> Angulimala did not get the significance of the words of the Buddha, so
    he asked, &quot;O Bhikkhu! Why do you say that you have stopped and I have not
    stopped?&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha then said to him,<i> &quot;I say that I have
    stopped, because I have given up killing all beings, I have given up ill-treating all
    beings, and because I have established myself in universal love, patience, and knowledge
    through reflection. But, you have not given up killing or ill-treating others and you are
    not yet established in universal love and patience. Hence, you are the one who has not
    stopped.&quot;</i> On hearing these words from the mouth of the Buddha, Angulimala
    reflected, &quot;These are the words of a wise man. This bhikkhu is so very wise and so
    very brave ; he must be the ruler of the bhikkhus. Indeed, he must be the Buddha himself!
    He must have come here specially to make me see the light.&quot; So thinking, he threw
    away his weapon and asked the Buddha to admit him to the Order of the bhikkhus. Then and
    there, the Buddha made him a bhikkhu.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Angulimala's mother looked for her son everywhere in the
    forest shouting out his name, but failing to find him she returned home. When the king and
    his men came to capture Angulimala, they found him at the monastery of the Buddha. Finding
    that Angulimala had given up his evil ways and had become a bhikkhu, the king and his men
    went home. During his stay at the monastery, Angulimala ardently and diligently practised
    meditation, and within a short time he attained arahatship .</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then, one day, while he was on an alms-round, he came to a
    place where some people were quarrelling among themselves. As they were throwing stones at
    one another, some stray stones hit Thera Angulimala on the head and he was seriously
    injured. Yet, he managed to come back to the Buddha, and the Buddha said to him,<i>
    &quot;My son Angulimala! You have done away with evil. Have patience. You are paying in
    this existence for the deeds you have done. These deeds would have made you suffer for
    innumerable years in niraya.&quot; </i>Soon afterwards, Angulimala passed away peacefully;
    he had realized parinibbana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Other bhikkhus asked the Buddha where Angulimala was
    reborn, and when the Buddha replied <i>&quot;My son has realized parinibbana&quot;</i>,
    they could hardly believe it. So they asked him whether it was possible that a man who had
    killed so many people could have realized parinibbana. To this question, the Buddha
    replied, <i>&quot;Bhikkhus! Angulimala had done much evil because he did not have good
    friends. But later, he found good friends and through their help and good advice he had
    been steadfast and mindful in his practice of the dhamma. Therefore, his evil deeds have
    been overwhelmed by good (i e., Arahatta Magga).</i></font></p>

    The Story of the <a NAME="weavergirl">Weaver-Girl</a> </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the monastery near Aggavala shrine in
    the country of Alavi, the Buddha uttered Verse (174) of this book, with reference to a
    young maiden, who was a weaver. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the conclusion of an alms-giving ceremony in Alavi, the
    Buddha gave a discourse on the impermanence of the aggregates (khandhas). The main points
    the Buddha stressed on that day may be expressed as follows:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<i>&quot;My life is impermanent; for me, death only
    is permanent. I must certainly die; my life ends in death. Life is not permanent; death is
    permanent.&quot; </i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha also exhorted the audience to be always mindful
    and to strive to perceive the true nature of the aggregate He also said,<i>&quot;As one
    who is armed with a stick or a spear is prepared to meet an enemy (e.g.. a poisonous
    snake), so also, one who is ever mindful of death will face death mindfully. He would then
    leave this world for a good destination (sugati).&quot;</i> Many people did not take the
    above exhortation seriously, but a young girl of sixteen who was a weaver clearly
    understood the message. After giving the discourse, the Buddha returned to the Jetavana
    monastery.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After a lapse of three years, when the Buddha surveyed the
    world, he saw the young weaver in his vision, and knew that time was ripe for the girl to
    attain Sotapatti Fruition. So the Buddha came to the country of Alavi to expound the
    dhamma for the second time. When the girl heard that the Buddha had come again with five
    hundred bhikkhus, she wanted to go and listen to the discourse which would be given by the
    Buddha. However, her father had also asked her to wind some thread spools which he needed
    urgently, so she promptly wound some spools and took them to her father. On the way to her
    father, she stopped for a moment at the outer fringe of the audience, who had come to
    listen to the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Meanwhile, the Buddha knew that the young weaver would
    come to listen to his discourse; he also knew that the girl would die when she got to the
    weaving shed. Therefore, it was very important that she should listen to the Dhamma on her
    way to the weaving shed and not on her return. So, when the young weaver appeared on the
    fringe of the audience, the Buddha looked at her. When she saw him looking at her, she
    dropped her basket and respectfully approached the Buddha. Then, he put four questions to
    her and she answered all of them. The questions and answers are as given below.</font></p>

    uttered Verse (176) of this book, with reference to Cincamanavika.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the Buddha went on teaching the Dhamma, more and more
    people came flocking to him, and the ascetics of other faiths found their following to be
    dwindling. So they made a plan that would harm the reputation of the Buddha. They called
    the very beautiful Cincamanavika, a devoted pupil of theirs, to them and said to her, <font>&quot;If
    you have our interests in your heart, please help us and put Samana Gotama to shame.&quot;
    </font>Cincamanavika agreed to comply.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">That same evening, she took some flowers and went in the
    direction of the Jetavana monastery. When people asked her where she was going, she
    replied, &quot;What is the use of you knowing where I am going?&quot; Then she would go to
    the place of other ascetics near the Jetavana monastery and would come back early in the
    morning to make it appear as if she had spent the night at the Jetavana monastery. When
    asked, she would reply, &quot;I spent the night with Samana Gotama at the Perfumed Chamber
    of the Jetavana monastery.&quot; After three or four months had passed, she wrapped up her
    stomach with some cloth to make her look pregnant. Then, after eight or nine months, she
    wrapped up her stomach with a round piece of thin wooden plank; she also beat up her palms
    and feet to make them swollen, and pretended to be feeling tired and worn out. Thus, she
    assumed a perfect picture of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy. Then, in the
    evening, she went to the Jetavana monastery to confront the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha was then expounding the Dhamma to a
    congregation of bhikkhus and laymen. Seeing him teaching on the platform, she accused the
    Buddha thus: &quot;O you big Samana! You only preach to others. I am now pregnant by you,
    yet you do nothing for my confinement. You only know how to enjoy your self!&quot; The
    Buddha stopped preaching for a while and said to her, <i>&quot;Sister, only you and I know
    whether you are speaking the truth or not,&quot; </i>and Cincamanavika replied, &quot;Yes,
    you are right, how can others know what only you and I know?&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At that instant, Sakka, king of the devas, became aware of
    the trouble being brewed at the Jetavana monastery, so he sent four of his devas in the
    form of young rats. The four rats got under the clothes of Cincamanavika and bit off the
    strings that fastened the wooden plank round her stomach. As the strings broke, the wooden
    plank dropped, cutting off the front part of her feet. Thus, the deception of
    Cincamanavika was uncovered, and many from the crowd cried out in anger, &quot;Oh you
    wicked woman! A liar and a cheat! How dare you accuse our noble Teacher!&quot; Some of
    them spat on her and drove her out. She ran as fast as she could, and when she had gone
    some distance the earth cracked and fissured and she was swallowed up.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next day, while the bhikkhus were talking about
    Cincamanavika, the Buddha came to them and said. <i>&quot;Bhikkhu;, one who is not afraid
    to tell lies, and who does not care what happens in the future existence, will not
    hesitate to do any evil.&quot;</i></font></p>

    The Story of the <a NAME="theunrivalled">Unrivalled</a> Alms-Giving </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (177) of this book, with reference to the unrivalled alms-giving of King
    Pasenadi of Kosala.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, the king offered alms to the Buddha and other
    bhikkhus on a grand scale. His subjects, in competition with him, organized another
    alms-giving ceremony on a grander scale than that of the king. Thus, the king and his
    subjects kept on competing in giving alms. Finally, Queen Mallika thought of a plan; to
    implement this plan, she asked the king to have a grand pavilion built. Next, she asked
    for five hundred white umbrellas and five hundred tame elephants; those five hundred
    elephants were to hold the five hundred white umbrellas over the five hundred bhikkhus. In
    the middle of the pavilion, they kept ten boats which were filled with perfumes and
    incense. There were also two hundred and fifty princesses, who kept fanning the five
    hundred bhikkhus. Since the subjects of the king had no princesses, nor white umbrellas,
    nor elephants, they could no longer compete with the king. When all preparations were
    made, alms-food was offered. After the meal, the king made an offering of all the things
    in the pavilion, which were worth fourteen crores. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the time, two ministers of the king were present. Of
    those two, the minister named Junha was very pleased and praised the king for having
    offered alms so generously to the Buddha and his bhikkhus. He also reflected that such
    offerings could only be made by a king. He was very glad because the king would share the
    merit of his good deeds with all beings. In short, the minister Junha rejoiced with the
    king in his unrivalled charity. The minister Kala, on the other hand, thought that the
    king was only squandering, by giving away fourteen crores in a single day, and that the
    bhikkhus would just go back to the monastery and sleep.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the meal, the Buddha looked over at the audience and
    knew how Kala the minister was feeling. Then, he thought that if he were to deliver a
    lengthy discourse of appreciation, Kala would get more dissatisfied, and in consequence
    would have to suffer more in his next existence. So, out of compassion for Kala, the
    Buddha delivered only a short discourse and returned to the Jetavana monastery. The king
    had expected a lengthy discourse of appreciation, and so he was very sad because the
    Buddha had been so brief. The king wondered if he had failed to do something which should
    have been done, and so he went to the monastery.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On seeing the king, the Buddha said,<i> &quot;Great King!
    You should rejoice that you have succeeded in making the offering of the unrivalled
    charity (asadisadana). Such an opportunity comes very rarely; it comes only once during
    the appearance of each Buddha. But your minister Kala had felt that it was a waste, and
    was not at all appreciative. So, if I had given a lengthy discourse, he would get more and
    more dissatisfied and uncomfortable, and in consequence, he would suffer much more in the
    present existence as well as in the next. That was why I preached so briefly</i>&quot;. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the Buddha added,<i><font> &quot;Great King! Fools do
    not rejoice in the charities given by others and go to the lower worlds. The wise rejoice
    in other people's charities. and through appreciation, they share in the merit gained by
    others and go to the abode of the devas&quot;</font></i>.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kala, son of Anathapindika, always kept away whenever the
    Buddha and his company of bhikkhus came to their house. Anathapindika was afraid that if
    his son kept on behaving in this way, he would be reborn in one of the lower worlds
    (apayas). So, he enticed his son with the promise of money. He promised to give one
    hundred if the youth consented to go to the monastery and keep sabbath for one day. So,
    the youth went to the monastery and returned home early the next day, without listening to
    any religious discourses. His father offered him rice gruel, but instead of taking his
    food, he first demanded to have the money.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next day, the father said to his son, <font>&quot;My
    son, if you learn a stanza of the Text from the Buddha I will give you one thousand on
    your return.&quot;</font> So, Kala went to the monastery again, and told the Buddha that
    he wanted to learn something. The Buddha gave him a short stanza to learn by heart; at the
    same time he willed that the youth would not be able to memorize it. Thus, the youth had
    to repeat a single stanza many times, but because he had to repeat it so many times, in
    the end, he came to perceive the full meaning of the Dhamma and attained Sotapatti
    Fruition.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Early on the next morning, he followed the Buddha and the
    bhikkhus to his own house. But on that day, he was silently wishing, <font>&quot; I wish
    my father would not give me the one thousand in the presence of the Buddha. I do not wish
    the Buddha to know that I kept the sabbath just for the sake of money.&quot; </font>His
    father offered rice gruel to the Buddha and the bhikkhus, and also to him. Then, his
    father brought one thousand, and told Kala to take the money but surprisingly he refused.
    His father pressed him to take it, but he still refused. Then, Anathapindika said to the
    Buddha,<font> &quot;Venerable Sir, my son is quite changed; he now behaves in a very
    pleasant manner.&quot;</font> Then he related to the Buddha how he had enticed the youth
    with money to go to the monastery and keep sabbath and to learn some religious texts. To
    him the Buddha replied, <i>&quot;Anathapindika! Today, your son has attained Sotapatti
    Fruition, which is much better than the riches of the Universal Monarch or that of the
    devas or that of the brahmas.&quot;</i></font></p>

    book while residing near the Bodhi tree, with reference to the three daughters of Mara. He
    repeated these verses to the brahmin Magandiya while journeying through the Kuru country.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Magandiya the Brahmin and his wife lived in the kingdom of
    the Kurus with their daughter Magandiya who was exceedingly beautiful. She was so
    beautiful that her father rudely turned down all her suitors. One day, early in the
    morning, when the Buddha surveyed the world, he found that time was ripe for the brahmin
    Magandiya and his wife to attain Anagami Fruition. So, taking his bowl and the robes, the
    Buddha set out for the place where the brahmin usually went to offer fire sacrifice.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The brahmin, seeing the Buddha, promptly decided that the
    Buddha was the very person who was worthy of his daughter. He pleaded with the Buddha to
    wait there and hurriedly went off to fetch his wife and daughter. The Buddha left his
    footprint and went to another place, close at hand. When the brahmin and his family came,
    they found only the footprint. Seeing the footprint, the wife of the brahmin remarked that
    it was the footprint of one who was free from sensual desires. Then, the brahmin saw the
    Buddha and he offered his daughter in marriage to him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha did not accept nor did he refuse the offer, but
    first, he related to the brahmin how the daughters of Mara tempted him soon after his
    attainment of Buddhahood. To the beautiful Tanha, Arati and Raga, the daughters of Mara,
    the Buddha had said, <i>&quot;It is no use tempting one who is free from craving, clinging
    and passion, for he cannot be lured by any temptation whatsoever.&quot;</i></font></p>

    After this, the Buddha went to the Tavatimsa deva world; his mother who had been reborn in
    the Tusita deva world as a deva known as Santusita also came to the Tavatimsa deva world.
    There the Buddha expounded the Abhidhamma to the devas and the brahmas throughout the
    three months of the vassa. As a result, Santusita deva attained Sotapatti Fruition; so did
    numerous other devas and brahmas.</font></p>

    with him and covered the whole course by the end of the vassa. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Towards the end of the vassa, Thera Maha Moggalana went to

    to the human world on the full moon day at the end of the vassa to the place where Thera
    Sariputta was spending the vassa. </font></p>

    by a large following of devas on one side and a large following of brahmas on the other. A

    Buddha. He made it known that whoever could answer her questions could claim her for a
    wife. Twice every month, Erakapatta made her dance in the open and sing out her questions.
    Many suitors came to answer her questions hoping to claim her, but no one could give the
    correct answer.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day, the Buddha saw a youth named Uttara in his
    vision. He also knew that the youth would attain Sotapatti Fruition in connection with the
    questions put by the daughter of Erakapatta the naga. By then the youth was already on his
    way to see Erakapatta's daughter. The Buddha stopped him and taught him how to answer the
    questions. While he was being taught, Uttara attained Sotapatti Fruition. Now that Uttara
    had attained Sotapatti Fruition, he had no desire for the naga princess. However, Uttara
    still went to answer the questions for the benefit of numerous other beings.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first four questions were:</font> <ol>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Who is a ruler? </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Is one who is overwhelmed by the mist of moral defilements
        to be called a ruler? </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">What ruler is free from moral defilements? </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">What sort of person is to be called a fool? </font></li>
    </ol>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The answers to the above questions were: </font><ol>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">He who controls the six senses is a ruler. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">One who is overwhelmed by the mist of moral defilements is
        not to be called a ruler; he who is free from craving is called a ruler. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">The ruler who is free from craving is free from moral
        defilements. </font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">A person who hankers after sensual pleasures is called a
        fool. </font></li>
    </ol>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having had the correct answers to the above, the naga
    princess sang out questions regarding the floods (oghas) of sensual desire, of renewed
    existence, of false doctrine and of ignorance, and how they could be overcome. Uttara
    answered these questions as taught by the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Erakapatta heard these answers he knew that a Buddha
    had appeared in this world. So he asked Uttara to take him to the Buddha. On seeing the
    Buddha, Erakapatta related to the Buddha how he had been a bhikkhu during the time of
    Kassapa Buddha, how he had accidentally caused a grass blade to be broken off while
    travelling in a boat, and how he had worried over that little offence for having failed to
    do the act of exoneration as prescribed, and finally how he was reborn as a naga. After
    hearing him, the Buddha told him how difficult it was to be born in the human world, and
    to be born during the appearance of the Buddhas or during the time of their Teaching.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, there was a young bhikkhu at the Jetavana monastery.
    One day his teacher sent him to another monastery to study. While he was away, his father
    became seriously ill and died without seeing him. But his father left for him one hundred
    kahapanas with his brother, the boy's uncle. On his return, his uncle told him about his
    father's death and about the one hundred kahapanas left to him. At first, he said that he
    had no need of the money. Later, he thought that it might be better to return to lay-life,
    and as a result, he got dissatisfied with the life of a bhikkhu. Gradually, he began to
    lose interest in his life and was also losing weight. When other bhikkhus knew about this,
    they took him to the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha asked him whether it was true that he was
    feeling unhappy with his life as a bhikkhu and whether he had any capital to start the
    life of a layman. He answered that it was true and that be had one hundred kahapanas to
    start his life with. Then the Buddha explained to him that he would need to get food,
    clothing, household utensils, two oxen, ploughs, pickaxes, knives, etc., so that his one
    hundred in cash would hardly meet the expenses. The Buddha then told him that for human
    beings there could never be enough, not even for Universal Monarchs who could call for a
    shower of coins or gems or any amount of wealth and treasures at any moment. Further, the
    Buddha related the story of Mandatu, the Universal Monarch, who enjoyed the glory of the
    devas both in the Catumaharajika and Tavatimsa realms for a long time. After spending a
    long time in Tavatimsa, one day, Mandatu wished that he were the sole ruler of Tavatimsa,
    instead of sharing it with Sakka. But this time, his wish could not be fulfilled and

    The Story of <a NAME="aggidatta">Aggidatta </a></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verses (188) to (192) of this book, with reference to Aggidatta, a brahmin.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Aggidatta was the head priest during the time of King
    Mahakosala, father of King Pasenadi. After the death of King Mahakosala, Aggidatta gave
    away his property in charity, and after that he left his home and became a non-Buddhist
    ascetic. He lived with his ten thousand followers in a place near the border of the three
    kingdoms of Anga, Magadha and Kuru, not far from a mound of sand where a powerful naga was
    staying. To his followers and the people of these three kingdoms, Aggidatta used to
    exhort: &quot;Pay homage to forests, mountains, parks and gardens, and trees; by doing so,
    you will be liberated from all ills of life.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day, the Buddha saw Aggidatta and his followers in his
    vision and realized that the time was ripe for them to attain arahatship. So the Buddha
    sent Thera Maha Moggalana to Aggidatta and his followers and told him that he himself
    would follow afterwards. Thera Maha Moggalana went to the place of Aggidatta and his
    followers and asked them to give him shelter for one night. They first turned down his
    request, but finally they agreed to let him stop at the mound of sand, the home of the
    naga. The naga was very antagonistic to Thera Maha Moggalana, and there followed a duel
    between the naga and the thera; on both sides, there was a display of power by emitting
    smoke and flames. However, in the end, the naga was subdued. He coiled himself round the
    mound of sand, and raised his head spreading it out like an umbrella over Thera Maha
    Moggalana, thus showing respect for him. Early in the morning, Aggidatta and the other
    ascetics came to the mound of sand to find out whether Thera Maha Moggalana was still
    alive; they had expected to see him dead. When they found the naga tamed, and meekly
    holding his head like an umbrella over Thera Maha Moggalana, they were very much
    astounded.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just then, he Buddha arrived and Thera Maha Moggalana got
    up from his seat on the mound and paid obeisance to the Buddha. Thera Maha Moggalana then
    proclaimed to the audience of ascetics, &quot;This is my Teacher, the supreme Buddha, and
    I am but a humble pupil of this great Teacher!&quot; Hearing him, the ascetics who had
    been very much impressed even by the power of Thera Maha Moggalana were awed by the
    greater power of the Buddha. The Buddha then asked Aggidatta what he taught his followers
    and the residents of the neighbourhood. Aggidatta replied that he had taught them to pay
    homage to mountains, forests, parks and gardens, and trees, and that by doing so, they
    would be liberated from all ills of life. The Buddha's reply to Aggidatta was, <i>&quot;Aggidatta,
    people go to mountains, forests, gardens and parks, and trees for refuge when they are
    threatened with danger, but these things cannot offer them any protection. Only those who
    take refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Samgha are liberated from the round of

    him. When he arrived, the brahmin made obeisance to the shrine but not to the Buddha. To
    him the Buddha said, <i>&quot;Brahmin, by paying respect to the shrine you are doing a
    meritorious deed.&quot;</i>That made the brahmin happy. After thus putting him in a
    favourable frame of mind, the Buddha, by his supernormal power, brought forth the golden
    stupa of Kassapa Buddha and let it remain visible in the sky. The Buddha then explained to
    the brahmin and the other bhikkhus that there were four classes of persons worthy of a
    stupa. They are: the Buddhas (Tathagatas) who are homage-worthy and perfectly
    self-enlightened, the Paccekabuddhas, the Ariya disciples, and the Universal Monarchs. He
    also told them about the three types of stupas erected in honour of these four classes of
    persons. The stupas where corporeal relics are enshrined are known as <i>Sariradhatu

    known as <i>Uddissa cetiya</i>; and the stupas where personal effects like robes, bowls,
    etc. of those revered personages are enshrined are known as <i>Paribhoga cetiya</i>. The
