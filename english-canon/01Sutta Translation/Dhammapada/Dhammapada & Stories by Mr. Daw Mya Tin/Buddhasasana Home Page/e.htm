    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (76) of this hook, with reference to Thera Radha, who was at one time a poor
    old Brahmin.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Radha was a poor brahmin who stayed in the monastery doing
    small services for the bhikkhus. For his services he was provided with food and clothing
    and other needs, but was not encouraged to join the Order, although he had a strong desire
    to become a bhikkhu.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day, early in the morning, when the Buddha surveyed
    the world with his supernormal power, he saw the poor old brahmin in his vision and knew
    that he was due for arahatship. So the Buddha went to the old man, and learned from him
    that the bhikkhus of the monastery did not want him to join the Order. The Buddha
    therefore called all the bhikkhus to him and asked them, <i>&quot;Is there any bhikkhu
    here who recollects any good turn done to him by this old man?&quot; </i>To this question,
    the Venerable Sariputta replied, &quot;Venerable Sir, I do recollect an instance when this
    old man offered me a spoonful of rice.&quot; &quot;<i>If that be so,&quot; </i>the Buddha
    said, <i>&quot;shouldn't you help your benefactor get liberated from the ills of
    life?&quot; </i>Then the Venerable Sariputta agreed to make the old man a bhikkhu and he
    was duly admitted to the Order. The Venerable Sariputta guided the old bhikkhu and the old
    bhikkhu strictly followed his guidance. Within a few days, the old bhikkhu attained arahat
    ship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the Buddha next came to see the bhikkhus, they
    reported to him how strictly the old bhikkhu followed the guidance of the Venerable
    Sariputta. To them, the Buddha replied that a bhikkhu should be amenable to guidance like
    Radha ,and should not resent when rebuked for any fault or failing.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Bhikkhus Assaji and Punabbasuka and their five hundred

    planting flowering plants and fruit trees for gain, thus violating the rules of
    Fundamental Precepts for bhikkhus.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha hearing about these bhikkhus sent his two Chief
    Disciples Sariputta and Maha Moggallana, to stop them from committing further misconduct.
    To his two Chief Disciples the Buddha said,<i> &quot;Tell those bhikkhus not to destroy
    the faith and generosity of the lay disciples by misconduct and if anyone should disobey,

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Channa was the attendant who accompanied Prince Siddhattha
    when he renounced the world and left the palace on horseback. When the prince attained
    Buddhahood, Channa also became a bhikkhu. As a bhikkhu, he was very arrogant and
    overbearing because of his close connection to the Buddha. Channa used to say, &quot;I
    came along with my Master when he left the palace for the forest. At that time, I was the
    only companion of my Master and there was no one else. But now, Sariputta and Moggallana
    are saying, 'we are the Chief Disciples,' and are strutting about the place.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the Buddha sent for him and admonished him for his
    behaviour, he kept silent but continued to abuse and taunt the two Chief Disciples. Thus
    the Buddha sent for him and admonished him three times; still, he did not change. And
    again, the Buddha sent for Channa and said, <i>&quot;Channa, these two noble bhikkhus are
    good friends to you; you should associate with them and be on good terms with them.&quot;</i></font></p>

    given by the Buddha, Channa did as he pleased and continued to scold and abuse the
    bhikkhus. The Buddha, knowing this, said that Channa would not change during the Buddha's
    lifetime but after his demise (<i>parinibbana</i>) Channa would surely change. On the eve
    of his<i> parinibbana</i>, the Buddha called Thera Ananda to his bedside and instructed
    him to impose the Brahma-punishment (<i>Brahmadanda</i>) to Channa; i.e., for the bhikkhus
    to simply ignore him and to have nothing to do with him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After the parinibbana of the Buddha, Channa, learning
    about the punishment from Thera Ananda, felt a deep and bitter remorse for having done
    wrong and he fainted three times. Then, he owned up his guilt to the bhikkhus and asked
    for pardon. From that moment, he changed his ways and outlook. He also obeyed their
    instructions in his meditation practice and soon attained arahatship.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (79) of this book, with reference to Thera Mahakappina.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mahakappina was king of Kukkutavati. He had a queen named
    Anoja; he also had one thousand ministers to help him rule the country. One day, the king
    accompanied by those one thousand ministers, was out in the park. There, they met some
    merchants from Savatthi. On learning about the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Samgha from
    these merchants the king and his ministers immediately set out for Savatthi.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On that day, when the Buddha surveyed the world with his
    supernormal power, he saw in his vision, Mahakappina and his ministers coming towards
    Savatthi. He also knew that they were due for arahatship. The Buddha went to a place one
    hundred and twenty yojanas away from Savatthi to meet them. There, he waited for them
    under a banyan tree on the bank of the river Candabhaga. King Mahakappina and his
    ministers came to the place where the Buddha was waiting for them. When they saw the
    Buddha, with six-coloured rays radiating from his body, they approached the Buddha and
    paid homage to him. The Buddha then delivered a discourse to them. After listening to the
    discourse the king and all his ministers attained <i>Sotapatti </i>Fruition, and they
    asked the Buddha to permit them to join the Order. The Buddha, reflecting on their past
    and finding that they had made offerings of yellow robes in a past existence, said to
    them, &quot;<i>Ehi bhikkhu</i>&quot;, and they all became <i>bhikkhus</i>.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Meanwhile, Queen Anoja, learning about the king's
    departure for Savatthi, sent for the wives of the one thousand ministers, and together
    with them followed the king's trail. They too came to the place where the Buddha was and
    seeing the Buddha with a halo of six colours, paid homage to him. All this time, the
    Buddha by exercising his supernormal power had made the king and his ministers invisible
    so that their wives did not see them. 'The queen therefore enquired where the king and his
    ministers were. The Buddha told the queen and her party to wait for a while and that the
    king would soon come with his ministers. The Buddha then delivered another discourse; at
    the end of this discourse the king and his ministers attained<i> arahatship</i>; the queen
    and the wives of the ministers attained <i>Sotapatti </i>Fruition. At that instant, the
    queen and her party saw the newly admitted<i> bhikkhus</i> and recognized them as their
    former husbands. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ladies also asked permission from the Buddha to enter
    the Order of <i>Bhikkhunis</i>; so they were directed to go ahead to Savatthi. There they
    entered the Order and very soon they also attained <i>arahatship</i>. The Buddha then
    returned to the Jetavana monastery accompanied by one thousand bhikkhus. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the Jetavana monastery, Thera Mahakappina while resting
    during the night or during the day would often say, &quot;Oh, what happiness!&quot; (<i>Aho
    Sukham</i>). The bhikkhus, hearing him saying this so many times a day told the Buddha
    about it. To them the Buddha replied, <i>&quot;My son Kappina having had the taste of the
    Dhamma lives happily with a serene mind; he is saying these words of exultation repeatedly
    with reference to Nibbana.&quot;</i></font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (80) of this book, with reference to Samanera Pandita.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Pandita was a young son of a rich man of Savatthi. He
    became a samanera at the age of seven. On the eighth day after becoming a samanera, as he
    was following Thera Sariputta on an alms-round, he saw some farmers channeling water into
    their fields and asked the thera, &quot;Can water which has no consciousness be guided to
    wherever one wishes ?&quot; The thera replied, &quot;Yes, it can be guided to wherever one
    wishes.&quot; As they continued on their way, the samanera next saw some fletchers heating
    their arrows with fire and straightening them. Further on, he came across some carpenters
    cutting, sawing and planing timber to make it into things like cart-wheels. Then he
    pondered, &quot;If water which is without consciousness can be guided to wherever one
    desires, if a crooked bamboo which is without consciousness can be straightened, and if
    timber which is without consciousness can be made into useful things, why should I, having
    consciousness, be unable to tame my mind and practise Tranquillity and Insight
    Meditation?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then and there he asked permission from the thera and
    returned to his own room in the monastery. There he ardently and diligently practised
    meditation, contemplating the body. Sakka and the devas also helped him in his meditation
    by keeping the monastery and its precincts very quiet and still. Before Meal time Samanera
    Pandita attained Anagami Fruition.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At that time Thera Sariputta was bringing food to the
    samanera. The Buddha saw with his supernormal power that Samanera Pandita had attained
    Anagami Fruition and also that if he continued to practise meditation he would soon attain
    arahatship. So the Buddha decided to stop Sariputta from entering the room, where the
    samanera was. The Buddha went to the door and kept Sariputta engaged by putting some
    questions to him. While the conversation was taking place, the samanera attained
    arahatship. Thus, the samanera attained arahatship on the eighth day after becoming a
    novice.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this connection, the Buddha said to the bhikkhus of the
    monastery, <i>&quot;When one is earnestly practising the Dhamma, even Sakka and the devas
    give protection and keep guard; I myself have kept Thera Sariputta engaged at the door so
    that Samanera Pandita should not be disturbed. The samanera, having seen the farmers
    irrigating their fields, the fletchers straightening their arrows, and carpenters making
    cart-wheels and other things, tames his mind and practises the dhamma; he has now become
    an arahat.&quot;</i></font></p>

    jokingly say,<font> &quot;Uncle, how are you? Are you happy, or are you bored with your

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kanamata was a devoted lay disciple of the Buddha. Her
    daughter Kana was married to a man from another village. As Kana had been on a visit to
    her mother for some time, her husband sent a message for her to come home. Her mother told
    her to wait for one more day as she wanted to send along some sweet meals with her for her
    husband. The next day, Kanamata made some sweetmeats, but when four bhikkhus stood at her
    door for alms, she offered some to them. The four bhikkhus told other bhikkhus about the
    sweetmeats from Kanamata's house and they also came to stand at the door of Kanamata, as a
    devotee of the Buddha and his disciples, offered her sweetmeats to the bhikkhus as they
    came in, one after another. The result was that in the end there was none left for Kana
    and she did not go home on that day. The same thing happened on the next two days; her
    mother made some sweetmeats, the bhikkhus stood at her door, she offered her sweetmeats to
    the bhikkhus, there was nothing left for her daughter to take home, and her daughter did
    not go home. On the third day, for the third time, her husband sent her a message, which
    was also an ultimatum stating that if she failed to come home the next day, he would take
    another wife. But on the next day also Kana was unable to go home because her mother
    offered all her sweetmeats to the bhikkhus. Kana's husband then took another wife and Kana
    became very bitter towards the bhikkhus. She used to abuse all bhikkhus so much so that
    the bhikkhus kept away from the house of Kanamata.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha heard about Kana and went to the
    house of Kanamata; there Kanamata offered him some rice gruel. After the meal, the Buddha
    sent for Kana and asked her,<i> &quot;Did my bhikkhus take what was given them or what was
    not given them ?&quot; </i>Kana answered that the bhikkhus had taken only what was given
    them, and then added,<font> &quot;They were not in the wrong; only I was in the
    wrong.&quot; </font>Thus, she owned up her fault and she also paid homage to the Buddha.
    The Buddha then gave a discourse. At the end of the discourse, Kana attained Sotapatti
    Fruition.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">On the way back to the monastery, the Buddha
    met King Pasenadi of Kosala. On being told about Kana and her bitter attitude towards the
    bhikkhus, King Pasenadi asked the Buddha whether he had been able to teach her the Dhamma
    and, make her see the Truth (Dhamma). The Buddha replied, <i>&quot;Yes, I have taught her
    the Dhamma, and I have also made her rich in her next existence.&quot; </i>Then the king
    promised the Buddha that he would make Kana rich even in this existence. The king then
    sent his men with a palanquin to fetch Kana. When she arrived, the king announced to his
    ministers, <font>&quot;Whoever can keep my daughter Kana in comfort may take her.&quot;</font>
    One of the ministers volunteered to adopt Kana as his daughter, gave her all his wealth,
    and said to her,<font COLOR="#008000"> &quot;You may give in charity as much as you
    like.&quot; </font>Every day, Kana made offerings to the bhikkhus at the four city-gates.
    When told about Kana giving generously in charity, the Buddha said, <i>&quot;Bhikkhus, the
    mind of Kana which was foggy and muddled was made clear and calm by my words.&quot;</i></font></p>

    on one occasion, staying at Veranja with five hundred bhikkhus. While they were at
    Veranja, the brahmin failed to look after them. The people of Varanja, who were then
    facing a famine, could offer very little to the bhikkhus when they went on their rounds
    for alms-food. In spite of all these hardships, the bhikkhus were not disheartened; they
    were quite contented with the small amount of shrivelled grain which the horse-traders
    offered them daily. At the end of the vasa, after informing the brahmin from Veranja, the
    Buddha returned to the Jetavana monastery, accompanied by the five hundred bhikkhus. The

    whatever was left over by the bhikkhus, ate greedily like true gluttons and went to sleep

    themselves a thorough nuisance. When the Buddha came in the evening to the congregation of
    bhikkhus, they reported to him about the behaviour of those unruly persons, and said,
    &quot;These people living on the leftovers were quite decent and well-behaved when all of
    us were facing hardship and famine in Veranja. Now that they have enough good food they
    are going about shouting, singing and dancing, and thus make themselves a thorough

    until after the birth of their child. When the child was born, he again requested his wife
    to let him go; again, she pleaded with him to wait until the child could walk. Then
    Dhammika thought to himself, <font>&quot;It will be useless for me to ask my wife for her
    approval to join the Order; I shall work for my own liberation.&quot;</font> Having made a

    left the house, I'd better leave it, too.&quot;</font> With this thought she left the
    house and became a bhikkhuni; eventually, she too attained arahatship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the congregation of the bhikkhus, the Buddha was told

    not wish for wealth and prosperity by doing evil, whether it is for his own sake or for

    pushing a big rock from the peak o fGijjhakuta mountain (Vulture's Peak). The rock struck
    a ledge on the side of the mountain and a splinter struck the big toe of the Buddha. The
    Buddha was taken to the mango-grove monastery of Jivaka. There, Jivaka, the renowned
    physician, attended on the Buddha; he put some medicine on the toe of the Buddha and
    bandaged it. Jivaka then left to see another patient in town, but promised to return and
    remove the bandage in the evening. When Jivaka returned that night, the city-gates were
    already closed and he could not come to see the Buddha that night. He was very upset
    because if the bandage was not removed in time, the whole body would become very hot and
    the Buddha would be very ill.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just about this time, the Buddha asked Thera Ananda to
    remove the bandage from his big toe and found that the wound was completely healed. Jivaka

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha once spent the vassa at Rajagaha with a number
    of bhikkhus. About two weeks before the end of the vassa, the Buddha informed the bhikkhus
    that they would soon be leaving Rajagaha and told them to prepare for departure. Some
    bhikkhus stitched and dyed new robes, some washed the old robes. When some bhikkhus saw
    Mahakassapa washing his robes, they speculated, &quot;There are so many people inside and
    outside Rajagaha who love and respect Thera Mahakassapa and are constantly looking to all
    his needs; is it possible that the thera would leave his lay devotees here and follow the
    Buddha elsewhere?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the end of fifteen days, on the eve of his departure,
    the Buddha thought that there might be some occasions like alms-food offering ceremonies,
    initiation of novices, funerals, etc., and so it would not be proper for all the bhikkhus
    to leave. So he decided that some bhikkhus should remain at the Veluvana monastery and
    that the most suitable person would be Thera Mahakassapa. Consequently, Thera Mahakassapa
    remained in Rajagaha with some junior bhikkhus.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the other bhikkhus said scornfully, &quot;Mahakassapa
    has not accompanied the Buddha, just as we have predicted!&quot; The Buddha heard their
    remark and said to them, &quot;Bhikkhus! Do you wish to say that my son Kassapa is
    attached to his lay disciples of Rajagaha and to the things they offer him? You are very
    much mistaken. My son Kassapa remains here under my instruction; he is not attached to

    monastery, dried up the rice and hoarded it. Thus, there was no need for him to go on an
    alms-round every day; he then remained in jhana concentration for two or three days.
    Arising from jhana concentration he ate the dried rice he had stored up, after soaking it
    in water. Other Bhikkhunis thought ill of the thera on this account, and reported to the

    young bhikkhu, lest a heavy punishment should fall on him and get his head crushed. The
    young bhikkhu then admitted that he had done wrong and respectfully asked for pardon.
    Thera Sariputta pardoned the young bhikkhu and also asked to be forgiven if he also had
    done any wrong.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (96) of this book, with reference to a samanera, a pupil of Thera Tissa from
    Kosambi.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, a seven year old boy was made a samanera at the
    request of his father. Before his head was shaved the boy was given a subject of
    meditation. While he was being shaved, the boy had his mind fixed steadfastly on the
    object of meditation; as a result, he attained arahatship as soon as they finished shaving
    his head.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After some time, Thera Tissa, accompanied by the samanera,
    set out for Savatthi to pay homage to the Buddha. On the way, they spent one night in a
    village monastery. The thera fell asleep, but the young samanera sat up the whole night
    beside the bed of the old thera. Early in the morning, the old thera thought it was time
    to wake up the young samanera. So he roused up the samanera with a palm-leaf fan, and
    accidentally hit the eye of the samanera with the handle of the fan and damaged the eye.
    The samanera covered that eye with one hand and went about doing his duties of getting
    water for the thera to wash his face and clean his mouth, sweeping the floor of the
    monastery, etc. When the young samanera offered water with one hand to the thera, the
    thera chided him, and said that he should offer things with both hands. Only then, did the
    thera learn how the samanera lost his eye. At that instant, he realized that he had
    wronged a truly noble person. Feeling very sorry and humiliated, he made an apology to the
    samanera. But the samanera said that it was not the fault of the thera, nor his own fault,
    but that it was only the result of kamma, and so the thera was not to feel sad about it.
    But the thera could not get over the unfortunate incident.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">Then they continued their journey to Savatthi
    and arrived at the Jetavana monastery where the Buddha was in residence. The thera then
    told the Buddha that the young samanera who came along with him was the most noble person
    he had ever met, and related all that had happened on their way. The Buddha listened to
    him, and replied, <i>&quot;My son, an arahat does not get angry with anyone he is
    restrained in his senses and is perfectly calm and serene.&quot;</i></font></p>

    bhikkhus to attain arahatship. So, he sent for Sariputta, and in the presence of those
    bhikkhus, he asked, <i>&quot;My son Sariputta, do you accept the fact that by meditating
    on the senses one could realize Nibbana ?</i>&quot; Sariputta answered, &quot;Venerable
    Sir, in the matter of the realization of Nibbana by meditating on the senses, it is not
    that I accept it because I have faith in you; it is only those who have not personally
    realized it, that accept the fact from others.&quot; Sariputta's answer was not properly
    understood by the bhikkhus; they thought, &quot;Sariputta has not given up wrong views
    yet; even now, he has no faith in the Buddha.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the Buddha explained to them the true meaning of
    Sariputta's answer.<i> &quot;Bhikkhus, Sariputta's answer is simply this; he accepts the
    fact that Nibbana is realized by means of meditation on the senses, but his acceptance is
    due to his own personal realization and not merely because I have said it or somebody else
    has said it. Sariputta has faith in me; he also has faith in the consequences of good and
    bad deeds.&quot;</i></font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (98) of this book, with reference to Thera Revata of the Acacia (khadira)
    Forest.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Revata was the youngest brother of the Chief Disciple,
    Sariputta. He was the only one of the brothers and sisters of Sariputta who had not left
    home for the homeless life. His parents were very anxious to get him married. Revata was
    only seven years old when his parents arranged a marriage for him to a young girl. At the
    wedding reception, he met an old lady who was one hundred and twenty years old, and he
    realized that all beings are subject to ageing and decay. So, he ran away from the house
    and went straight to a monastery, where there were thirty bhikkhus. Those bhikkhus had
    been requested earlier by Thera Sariputta to make his brother a samanera if he should come
    to them. Accordingly, he was made a samanera and Thera Sariputta was informed about it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Samanera Revata took a subject of meditation from those
    bhikkhus and left for an acacia forest, thirty yojanas away from the monastery. At the end
    of the vassa, the samanera attained arahatship. Thera Sariputta then asked permission from
    the Buddha to visit his brother, but the Buddha replied that he himself would go there. So
    the Buddha accompanied by Thera Sariputta, Thera Sivali and five hundred other bhikkhus
    set out to visit Samanera Revata. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The journey was long, the road was rough and the area was
    uninhabited by people; but the devas looked to all the needs of the Buddha and the
    bhikkhus on the way. At an interval of every yojana, a monastery and food were provided,
    and they travelled at the rate of a yojana a day. Revata, learning about the visit of the
    Buddha, also made arrangements to welcome him. By supernormal power he created a special
    monastery for the Buddha and five hundred monasteries for the other bhikkhus, and made
    them comfortable throughout their stay there.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On their return journey, they travelled at the same rate
    as before, and came to the Pubbarama monastery on the eastern end of Savatthi at the end
    of the month. From there, they went to the house of Visakha, who offered them alms-food.
    After the meal, Visakha asked the Buddha if the place of Revata in the acacia forest was
    pleasant.</font></p>

    delightful satisfaction. The Buddha saw him from his monastery, and with his supernormal
    power, sent rays of light to him, and the bhikkhu received this message, which said, <i>&quot;My
