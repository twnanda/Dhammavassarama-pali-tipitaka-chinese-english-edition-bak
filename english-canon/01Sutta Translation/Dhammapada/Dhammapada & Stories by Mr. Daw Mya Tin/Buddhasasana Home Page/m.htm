    The Story of a <a name="383">Brahmin</a> Who Had Great Faith </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (383) of this book, with reference to a brahmin, who showed extreme devotion
    to some bhikkhus.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, in Savatthi, there lived a brahmin who became
    extremely devoted to the Buddha and his Teaching, after hearing a discourse given by the
    Buddha. Every day, he invited the bhikkhus to his house for alms-food. When the bhikkhus
    arrived at his house, he addressed them as &quot;arahats&quot; and respectfully requested
    them to enter his house. When thus addressed, the puthujjana bhikkhus and the arahats felt
    embarrassed and they decided not to go to the brahmin's house the next day.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the brahmin found that the bhikkhus did not come to
    his house again he felt unhappy. He went to the Buddha and told him about the bhikkhus not
    coming to his house. The Buddha sent for those bhikkhus and asked for explanation. The
    bhikkhus told the Buddha about the brahmin addressing all of them as arahats. The Buddha
    then asked them whether they felt any false pride and undue elation when they were thus
    addressed. The bhikkhus answered in the negative. To them the Buddha said, <font>&quot;Bhikkhus,
    if you don't feel any false pride and undue elation when addressed as arahats, you are not
    guilty of breaking any of the rules of discipline of the bhikkhus. The fact is that the
    brahmin addressed you so because he was extremely devoted to the arahats. So. my sons, you
    should strive hard to get rid of craving and attain arahatship.&quot;</font></font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Venerable Sariputta was often praised by many people
    for his patience and forbearance. His pupils usually said of him thus: &quot;Our teacher
    is a man of great patience and extreme endurance. If he is abused or even beaten by
    others, he does not lose his temper but remains calm and composed.&quot; As this was often
    said of the Venerable Sariputta, a brahmin holding wrong views declared to the admirers of
    Sariputta that he would provoke the Venerable Sariputta into anger. At that moment, the
    Venerable Sariputta, Who was on his alms-round, appeared on the scene; the brahmin went
    after him and hit him hard on his back with his hand. 'The thera did not even look round
    to see who was the person that attacked him, but proceeded on his way as if nothing had
    happened. Seeing the magnanimity and great fortitude of the noble thera, the brahmin was
    very much shaken. He got down on his knees at the feet of the Venerable Sariputta,
    admitted that he had wrongfully hit the thera, and asked for pardon. The brahmin then
    continued, &quot;Venerable Sir, should you forgive me, kindly come to my house for
    alms-food.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the evening, other bhikkhus reported to the Buddha that
    the Venerable Sariputta had gone for alms-food to the house of a brahmin who hid beaten
    him. Further, they observed that the brahmin was sure to get bolder and he would soon be
    assaulting other bhikkhus also. To those bhikkhus, the Buddha replied, &quot;Bhikkhus, a
    true brahmana does not beat another true brahmana; only an ordinary man or an ordinary
    brahmin would beat an arahat in anger and ill will. This ill will should be eradicated by
    Anagami Magga.&quot;</font></p>

    The Story of Thera <a name="391">Mahapajapati Gotami</a></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (391) of this book, with reference to Thenri Mahapajapati Gotami. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mahapajapati Gotami was the stepmother of Gotama Buddha.
    On the death of Queen, seven days after the birth of Prince Siddhattha, Mahapajapati
    Gotami became the chief queen of King Suddhodana. At that time, her own son Nanda was only
    five days old. She let her own son be fed by a wet-nurse, and herself fed Prince
    Siddhattha, the future Buddha. Thus, Mahapajapati Gotami was a great benefactor to Prince
    Siddhattha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Prince Siddhattha returned to Kapilavatthu after the
    attainment of Buddhahood, Mahapajapati Gotami went to see the Buddha and requested that
    women should also be allowed to enter the Buddhist Order as bhikkhunis; but the Buddha
    refused permission. Later, King Suddhodana died after attaining arahatship. Then, while
    the Buddha was sojourning at the Mahavana forest near Vesali, Mahapajapati, accompanied by
    five hundred ladies, came on foot from Kapilavatthu to Vasali. They had already shaven
    their heads and had put on the dyed robes. There, for a second time, Mahapajapati
    requested the Buddha to accept women in the Buddhist Order. The Venerable Ananda also
    interceded on her behalf. So, the Buddha complied, with the proviso that Mahapajapati
    abides by eight special conditions (garudhammas). Mahapajapati undertook to observe the
    garudhammas as required, and the Buddha admitted her into the Order. Thus, Mahapajapati
    was the first to be admitted to the Order of the bhikkhunis. The other women were admitted
    to the Order after her by the bhikkhus as instructed by the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In course of time, it came to the minds of some bhikkhunis
    that Mahapajapati Gotami had not been properly admitted as a bhikkhuni because she did not
    have a preceptor; therefore. Mahapajapati Gotami was not a true bhikkhuni. With this
    thought in their mind, they stopped doing sabbath (uposatha) ceremonies and vassa
    (pavarana) ceremonies with her. They went to the Buddha and posed the problem of
    Mahapajapati Gotami not having been properly admitted to the Order of bhikkhunis as she
    had no preceptor. To them the Buddha replied, <font>&quot;Why do you say so? I myself gave
    the eight garudhammas to Mahapajapati and she had learnt and practised the garudhammas as
    required by me. I myself am her preceptor and it is quite wrong for you to say that she
    has no preceptor. You should harbour no doubt whatsoever about an arahat.&quot;</font></font></p>

    The Story of <a name="392">Thera Sariputta </a></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (392) of this book, with reference to the Venerable Sariputta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Venerable Sariputta was born of brahmin parents of
    Upatissa village; that was why he was named Upatissa. His mother was Sari. His very close
    friend was Kolita, another brahmin youth, son of Moggali. Both the youths were searching
    for the right doctrine, which would lead them to liberation from the round of rebirths,
    and both of them had a great desire to enter a religious Order. First, they went to
    Sancaya, but they were not satisfied with his teaching. Then they wandered all over
    Jambudipa looking for a teacher who would show them the way to the Deathless, but their
    search was fruitless. After some time, they parted company but with the understanding that
    the one who found the true dhamma first should inform the other.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">About that time, the Buddha arrived at Rajagaha with a
    company of bhikkhus, including Thera Assaji, one of the group of the first Five Bhikkhus
    (Pancavaggis). While Thera Assaji was on an alms-round, Upatissa saw the thera and was
    very much impressed by his noble countenance. So Upatissa respectfully approached the
    thera and asked who his teacher was, what doctrine his teacher taught, and also briefly to
    explain the doctrine to him. Thera Assaji then told Upatissa about the arising of the
    Buddha and about his sojourn at the Veluvana monastery in Rajagaha. The thera also quoted
    a short stanza connected with the Four Noble Truths.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The verse runs thus:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">Ye dhamma hetuppa bhava <br>
      tesam hetum tathagato aha <br>
      tesanca yo nirodho <br>
      evam vadi maha samano. </font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It means:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">The Tathagata has declared the cause and also the
      cessation of all phenomena which arise from a cause. This is the doctrine held by the
      Great Samana. </font></em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the verse was only half-way through, Upatissa
    attained Sotapatti Fruition.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As promised, Upatissa went to his friend Kolita to inform
    him that he had found the true dhamma. Then the two friends, accompanied by two hundred
    and fifty followers, went to the Buddha who was then at Rajagaha. When they arrived at the
    Veluvana monastery, they asked permission to enter the Buddhist Order, and both Upatissa
    and Kolita, together with their two hundred and fifty followers, were admitted as
    bhikkhus. Upatissa, son of Sari, and Kolita, son of Moggali, then came to be known as
    Sariputta and Moggallana. Soon after their admission to the Order, the Buddha expounded to
    them a dhamma and the two hundred and fifty bhikkhus attained arahatship; but Moggallana
    and Sariputta attained arahatship only at the end of seven days and fifteen days
    respectively. The reason for the delay in their attainment of arahatship was that they had
    made a wish for Chief Discipleship, which required much more striving to achieve
    perfection.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Venerable Sariputta always remembered that he had been
    able to meet the Buddha and attain the Deathless through the Venerable Assaji. So, he
    always paid obeisance in the direction where his teacher was and he always went to bed
    with his head lying in the same direction. Other bhikkhus who were staying with him at the
    Jetavana monastery misinterpreted his actions and said to the Buddha, &quot;Venerable Sir!
    The Venerable Sariputta still worships the various directions, viz., the East, the South,
    the West, the North, the Nadir and the Zenith, as he has done before as a brahmin youth;
    it seems as if he has not yet given up his old beliefs.&quot; The Buddha sent for the
    Venerable Sariputta and Sariputta explained to the Buddha that he was only paying
    obeisance to his teacher, the Venerable Assaji, and that he was not worshipping the
    various directions. The Buddha was satisfied with the explanation given by the Venerable
    Sariputta and said to the other bhikkhus,<font> &quot;Bhikkhus! The Venerable Sariputta
    was net worshipping the various directions; he was only paying obeisance to his teacher
    and benefactor, through whom he had attained the Deathless. It is quite right and proper
    for him to pay homage to such a teacher.&quot;</font></font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Veluvana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (399) of this book, with reference to the abusive Bharadvaja brothers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once there was a brahmin, whose wife was in the habit of
    blurting out a string of words whenever she sneezed or when something or someone touched
    her unawares. One day, the brahmin invited some of his friends to a meal and suddenly she
    blurted out some words. Since she was a Sotapanna, the words<i> &quot;Namo tassa bhagavato
    arahato sammsambhuddassa&quot;</i> automatically came out of her mouth. These words of
    veneration to the Buddha were very much disliked by her husband, the brahmin. So, in
    anger, he went to the Buddha hoping to put some challenging questions to the Buddha. His
    first question was, &quot;What do we have to kill to be able to live happily and
    peacefully?&quot; and his second question was, &quot;Killing of what dhamma do you approve
    of?&quot; To these questions, the Buddha replied,<font> &quot; O brahmin, to be able to
    live happily and peacefully, one will have to kill ill will (dosa). Killing one's ill will
    is liked and praised by the Buddhas and the arahats.&quot; </font>After hearing the
    Buddha, the brahmin was so impressed and satisfied with the answer that he asked to be
    permitted to enter the Order. Accordingly, he entered the Order and later became an
    arahat.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This brahmin had a brother who was very notorious for his
    abusive words and was known as Akkosaka Bharadvaja, the abusive Bharadvaja. When Akkosaka
    Bharadvaja heard that his brother had joined the Order of the bhikkhus, he was furious. He
    went straight away to the monastery and abused the Buddha. The Buddha in his turn asked,
    &quot;O brahmin, let us suppose you offered some food to some guests and they left the
    house without taking the food. Since the guests did not accept your food, to whom would
    that food belong?&quot; To this question the brahmin answered that the food would be his.
    On receiving that answer, the Buddha said, <font>&quot;In the same way, O brahmin, since I
    do not accept your abuse, the abuse would only go back to you.&quot;</font> Akkosaka
    Bharadvaja instantly realized the sagacity of those words and he felt a great respect for
    the Buddha. He also entered the Order and in due course became an arahat.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After Akkosaka Bharadvaja had entered the Order, his two
    younger brothers also came to see the Buddha with the same intention of abusing the
    Buddha. They too were made to see the light by the Buddha and they also, in their turn,
    entered the Order. Eventually, both of them became arahats.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One evening, at the congregation of the bhikkhus, the
    bhikkhus said to the Buddha, &quot;O how wonderful and how great are the virtues of the
    Buddha! The four brahmin brothers came here to abuse the Buddha; instead of arguing with
    them, he made them see the light, and as a result, the Buddha has become a refuge to
    them.&quot; To them, the Buddha replied,<font> &quot;Bhikkhus! Because I am patient and
    forbearing, and do no wrong to those who do me wrong, I have be come a refuge to

    have ruined us.&quot; Then, she offered alms-food to the other bhikkhus and said to them
    rudely, &quot;You all have used my son as your attendant; now eat your food.&quot; The
    Venerable Sariputta said nothing in reply but he just meekly took his bowl and came back

    in a very peculiar way, turning his head backwards, and rolling his wide open eyes. His
    mother got alarmed and was in tears. The cave-spirit, who possessed the boy, then said
    &quot;Let your teacher, the thera, wash his feet with water and pour that water on the
    head of your son.&quot; The next day when the thera came to her house for alms-food, she
    did as she was advised by the cave-spirit and the boy was left in peace. The cave-spirit
    went back to the cave and waited at the entrance for the return of the thera. When the
    thera returned from his alms-round, the cave-spirit revealed himself and said, &quot;I am
    the spirit guarding this cave. O you physician, do not enter this cave.&quot; The thera
    knew that he had lived a clean life from the day he had become a thera, so he replied that
    he did not remember practising medicine. Then the cave-spirit accused him that in that
    very morning he had cured a young boy possessed by an ogre at the house of the elderly
    woman. But the thera reflected that it was not, in fact, practising medicine and he
    realized that even the cave spirit could find no other fault with him. That gave him a
    delightful satisfaction (<i>piti</i>) with himself, and abandoning <i>piti</i> and
    concentrating hard on Insight Meditation he attained arahatship then and there, while
    still standing at the entrance to the cave.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the thera had now become an arahat, he advised the
    cave-spirit to leave the cave. The thera continued to stay there till the end of the
    vassa, and then he returned to the Buddha. When he told the other bhikkhus about his
    encounter with the cave-spirit, they asked him whether he did not get angry with the
    cave-spirit when he was forbidden to enter the cave. The thera answered in the negative
    but they did not believe him. So they went to the Buddha and said, &quot;Thera Tissa
    claims himself to be an arahat ; he is not speaking the truth.&quot; To them the Buddha
    replied,<font> &quot;Bhikkhus, my son Tissa was speaking the truth when he said he did not
    get angry. He has indeed become an arahat he is no longer attached to anyone; he has no
    occasion to get angry with anyone nor any need to associate with others.&quot;</font> </font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (405) of this book, with reference to a certain bhikkhu.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, a bhikkhu after taking a subject of meditation from
    the Buddha went to a forest to practise meditation. After he had attained arahatship he
    came back to the Buddha to offer his deep and profound gratitude to the Buddha. On his
    way, he passed through a village. Just as he was going through the village, a woman having
    quarrelled with her husband came out of her house and followed the bhikkhus. The husband
    coming after his wife, seeing her behind the bhikkhu, thought that the bhikkhu was taking
    his wife away. So he shouted at the bhikkhu and threatened to beat him. His wife entreated
    him not to beat the bhikkhu, but that made him more furious. As a result, the thera was
    beaten black and blue by the husband. After beating the bhikkhus to his heart's content,
    he took away his wife along with him and the bhikkhu continued on his way.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On arrival at the Jetavana monastery, other bhikkhus saw
    the bruises over the whole body of the bhikkhu and they attended to his bruises. When they
    asked him if he did not get angry with the man who had beaten him so sorely, he answered
    in the negative. So the other bhikkhus went to the Buddha and reported that the bhikkhu
    had falsely claimed to have attained arahatship. To them the Buddha replied, <font>&quot;Bhikkhus!
    Arahats have laid aside the stick and the sword. They do not get angry even if they are
    beaten.&quot; </font>Thus, the Buddha confirmed that the bhikkhu had, indeed, be come an

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (406) of this book, with reference to four samaneras who were arahats.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, the wife of a brahmin sent her husband the brahmin
    to the Jetavana monastery to invite four bhikkhus to an alms-meal at their house. She told
    him to specifically request for senior bhikkhus who were also true brahmanas. But four
    seven year old arahat samaneras, viz., Samkicca, Pandita, Sopaka and Revata were sent
    along with him. When his wife saw the young samaneras she was very much dissatisfied and
    blamed the brahmin for bringing such young samaneras who were even younger than her
    grandson. She was, in fact, furious with her husband, and so she sent him back to the
    monastery to get older bhikkhus. In the meantime she refused to give the young samaneras
    the higher seats reserved for the bhikkhus; they were given lower seats and she did not
    offer them alms-food.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the brahmin arrived at the monastery, he met the
    Venerable Sariputta and invited him to his house. When the Venerable Sariputta arrived at
    the house of the brahmin, he saw the four young arahat samaneras and asked them if they
    had been offered alms-food yet. On learning that the arahat samaneras had not been given
    alms-food yet and also that food had been prepared only for four persons the Venerable
    Sariputta returned to the monastery without accepting alms-food from the house of the
    brahmin. So his wife sent the brahmin back again to the monastery to get another senior
    bhikkhu. This time, the Venerable Maha Moggallana came along with the brahmin, but he also
    returned to the monastery without accepting alms-food when he learned that the young
    samaneras had not been offered alms-food and also that food had been prepared only for
    four persons.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">By this time, the samaneras were feeling hungry. Sakka,
    king of the devas, seeing the state of things took the form of an old brahmin and came to
    the house. The brahmin and his wife paid respect to the old brahmin and offered him a seat
    of honour, but Sakka just sat on the ground and paid respect to the four samaneras. Then
    he revealed that he was Sakka. Seeing that Sakka himself was paying respect to the young
    samaneras, the brahmin couple offered alms-food to all the five. After the meal, Sakka and
    the samaneras manifested their supernormal power by going right up into the sky through
    the roof. Sakka went back to his celestial abode, the samaneras returned to the monastery.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When other bhikkhus asked the samaneras whether they did
    net get angry when the brahmin couple refused to offer alms-food to them, they answered in
    the negative. The bhikkhus not believing them reported to the Buddha that the four young
    samaneras were falsely claiming to be arahats. To them the Buddha said, <font>&quot;Bhikkhus,
    arahats bear no ill will towards those who are hostile to them.&quot;</font></font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thera Mahapanthaka was already an arahat when his younger

    brother and asked him to leave the monastery as he was not worthy of the Order.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was in this connection that, on one occasion, the
    bhikkhus asked the Buddha why Mahapanthaka, even though he was an arahat, turned his
    younger brother Culapanthaka out of the monastery. They also added &quot;Do the arahats
    still lose their temper? Do they still have moral defilements like ill will in them
    ?&quot; To them the Buddha replied,<font> &quot;Bhikkhus! Arahats have no moral

    wretch&quot; and such other things. Other bhikkhus reported about him to the Buddha. The
    Buddha sent for him, and spoke to him on the matter. Then, on reflection the Buddha found
    that for the past five hundred existences, the thera had been born only in the families of
    the brahmins, who regarded themselves as being superior to other people. So the Buddha
    said to the bhikkhus, &quot;Bhikkhus! Thera Vaccha addresses others as 'wretch' only by

    ownerless, the thera picked it up. The brahmin looking out of his window saw the thera
    picking up the piece of clothing and came after the thera, abusing and accusing him.
    &quot;You shaven head! You are stealing my clothing&quot;, he said; the thera promptly
    returned the piece of clothing to the brahmin.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Back at the monastery, the thera related the above
    Incident to other bhikkhus, and they made fun of him and jokingly asked him whether the
    cloth was long or short, coarse or fine. To this question the thera answered,
    &quot;Whether the clothing is long or short, coarse or fine matters not to me; I am not at
    all attached to it.&quot;, Other bhikkhus then reported to the Buddha that the thera was
