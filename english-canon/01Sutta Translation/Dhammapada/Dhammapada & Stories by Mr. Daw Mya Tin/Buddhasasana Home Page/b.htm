    The Story of Thera<a NAME="Meghiya"> Meghiya</a></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing on the Calika Mountain, the Buddha uttered
    Verses (33) and (34) of this book, with reference to Thera Meghiya.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At that time, Thera Meghiya was attending upon the Buddha.
    On one occasion, on his return from alms-round, the thera noticed a pleasant and beautiful
    mango grove, which he thought was an ideal spot for meditation. He asked the Buddha's
    permission to let him go there, but as the Buddha was alone at that time, he was told to
    wait for awhile until the arrival of some other bhikkhus. The thera was in a hurry to go
    and so he repeated his request again and again, until finally the Buddha told him to do as
    he wished.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, Thera Meghiya set out for the mango grove, sat at
    the foot of a tree and practised meditation. He stayed there the whole day, but his mind
    kept wandering and he made no progress. He returned in the evening and reported to the
    Buddha how all the time he was assailed by thoughts associated with the senses, ill will
    and cruelty ( kama vitakka, byapada vitakka and vihimsa vitakka).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, the Buddha told him that as the mind is easily
    excitable and fickle, one should control one's mind.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman">Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (35) of this book, with reference to a certain bhikkhu.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On one occasion, sixty bhikkhus, after obtaining a subject
    of meditation from the Buddha, went to Matika village, at the foot of a mountain. There,
    Matikamata, mother of the village headman, offered them alms-food; she also built a
    monastery for them, so that they could stay in the village during the rainy season. One
    day she asked the group of bhikkhus to teach her the practice of meditation. They taught
    her how to meditate on the thirty-two constituents of the body leading to the awareness of
    the decay and dissolution of the body. Matikamata practised with diligence and attained
    the three Maggas and Phalas together with Analytical Insight and mundane supernormal
    powers, even before the bhikkhus did.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rising from the bliss of the Magga and Phala she looked
    with the Divine Power of Sight (Dibbacakkhu) and saw that the bhikkhus had not attained
    any of the Maggas yet. She also learnt that those bhikkhus had enough potentiality for the
    attainment of arahatship, but that they needed proper food. So, she prepared good, choice
    food for them. With proper food and right effort, the bhikkhus developed right
    concentration and eventually attained arahatship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the end of the rainy season, the bhikkhus returned to
    the Jetavana monastery, where the Buddha was in residence. They reported to the Buddha
    that all of them were in good health and in comfortable circumstances and that they did
    not have to worry about food. They also mentioned about Matikamata who was aware of their
    thoughts and prepared and offered them the very food they wished for.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A certain bhikkhu, hearing them talking about Matikamata,
    decided that he, too, would go to that village. So, taking a subject of meditation from
    the Buddha he arrived at the village monastery. There, he found that everything he wished
    for was sent to him by Matikamata, the lay-devotee. When he wished her to come she
    personally came to the monastery, bringing along choice food with her. After taking the
    food, he asked her if he knew the thoughts of others, but she evaded his question and
    replied, &quot;People who can read the thoughts of others behave in such and such a
    way.&quot; Then, the bhikkhu thought, &quot;Should I, like an ordinary worldling,
    entertain any impure thought, she is sure to find out.&quot; He therefore got scared of
    the lay-devotee and decided to return to the Jetavana monastery. He told the Buddha that
    he could not stay in Matika village because he was afraid that the lay-devotee might
    detect impure thoughts in him. The Buddha then asked him to observe just one thing; that
    is, to control his mind. The Buddha also told the bhikkhu to return to Matika village
    monastery, and not to think of anything else, but the object of his meditation only. The
    bhikkhu went back. The lay-devotee offered him good food as she had done to others before,
    so that he might able to practise meditation without worry. Within a short time, he, too,
    attained arahatship.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman">With reference to this bhikkhu, the Buddha

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (36) of this book, with reference to a young disgruntled bhikkhu who was the
    son of a banker.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, there lived in Savatthi, the son of a banker. This
    young man asked the bhikkhu, who used to come to his house for alms, what he should do to
    be liberated from the ills of life. The bhikkhu instructed him to divide his property into
    three parts; one part to do business with, one part to support the family and one part to
    give in charity. He did as he was told and again asked what else should be done next. So
    he was further instructed; first to take refuge in the Three Gems* and to observe the five
    precepts; secondly, to observe the ten precepts; and thirdly, to renounce the world and
    enter the Buddhist religious Order. The young man complied with all these instructions and
    became a bhikkhu.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a bhikkhu, he was taught the Abhidhamma** by one
    teacher and the Vinaya by another. Being taught in this way, he felt that there was too
    much to be learnt, that the disciplinary rules were too strict and too many, so much so
    that there was not enough freedom even to stretch out one's hands. He thought that it
    might be better to return to the life of a householder. As a result of doubt and
    discontent, he became unhappy and neglected his duties; he also became thin and emaciated.
    When the Buddha came to know about this, he said to the young bhikkhu, &quot;if you can
    only control your mind, you will have nothing more to control; so guard your own
    mind.&quot;</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (37) of this book, with reference to the nephew of Thera Samgharakkhita. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, there lived in Savatthi, a senior bhikkhu by the
    name of Samgharakkhita. When his sister gave birth to a son, she named the child after the
    thera and he came to be known as Samgharakkhita Bhagineyya. The nephew Samgharakkhita, in
    due course, was admitted into the Order. While the young bhikkhu was staying in a village
    monastery he was offered two sets of robes, and he intended to offer one to his uncle, the
    thera.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the end of the vassa he went to his uncle to pay
    respect to him and offered the robe to the thera. But, the uncle declined to accept the
    robe, saying that he had enough. Although he repeated his request, the thera would not
    accept. The young bhikkhu felt disheartened and thought that since his uncle was so
    unwilling to share the requisites with him, it would be better for him to leave the Order
    and live the life of a layman.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From that point, his mind wandered and a train of thoughts
    followed. He thought that after leaving the Order he would sell the robe and buy a
    she-goat; that she-goat would breed quickly and soon he would make enough money to enable
    him to marry; his wife would give birth to a son. He would take his wife and child in a
    small cart to visit his uncle at the monastery. On the way, he would say that he would
    carry the child; she would tell him to drive the cart and not to bother about the child.
    He would insist and grab the child from her; between them the child would drop on the
    cart-track and the wheel would pass over the child. He would get so furious with his wife
    that he would strike her with the goading-stick.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At that time he was fanning the thera with a palmyra fan
    and he absentmindedly struck the head of the thera with the fan. The thera, knowing the
    thoughts of the young bhikkhu, said, &quot;You were unable to beat your wife; why have you
    beaten an old bhikkhu ?&quot; Young Samgharakkhita was very much surprised and embarrassed
    at the words of the old bhikkhu; he also became extremely frightened. So he fled. Young
    bhikkhus and novices of the monastery chased him and finally took him to the presence of
    the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When told about the whole episode, the Buddha said that
    the mind has the ability to think of an object even though it might be far away, and that
    one should strive hard for liberation from the bondage of passion, ill will and ignorance.</font></p>

    The Story of Thera <a NAME="Cittahattha">Cittahattha</a></b></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verses (38) and (39) of this book, with reference to Thera Cittahattha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A man from Savatthi, after looking for his lost ox in the
    forest, felt very hungry and went to a village monastery, where he was given the remains
    of the morning meal. While taking his food, it occurred to him that even though he worked
    hard every day he could not get such good food and that it might be a good idea to become
    a bhikkhu. So he asked the bhikkhus to admit him into the Order. At the monastery, he
    performed the duties of a bhikkhu and as there was plenty of food he soon gained weight.
    After some time, he got weary of going round for alms-food and returned to the life of a
    lay man. A few days later, he felt that life at home was too strenuous and he went back to
    the monastery to be admitted as a bhikkhu for a second time. For a second time, he left
    the Order and returned to home-life. Again, he went back to the monastery for a third time
    and left it. This shuttling process went on for six times, and because he acted only
    according to his whims he was known as Thera Cittahattha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While he was going back and forth between his home and the
    monastery, his wife became pregnant. One day, during his last stay at home, he happened to
    enter the bedroom while his wife was asleep. She was almost naked as the clothes she was
    wearing had partially fallen off. She was also snoring loudly through her nose and mouth
    and saliva was trickling down her mouth. Thus, with her mouth open and her bloated
    stomach, she looked just like a corpse. Seeing her thus, he instantly came to perceive the
    impermanent and unpleasant nature of the body, and he reflected, &quot;I have been a
    bhikkhu for several times and it is only because of this woman that I have not been able
    to remain as a bhikkhu.&quot; Hence, taking the yellow robe with him he left his home for
    the monastery for the seventh time. As he went along he repeated the words
    &quot;impermanence&quot; and &quot;unpleasantness&quot; (anicca and dukkha) and thus
    attained Sotapatti Fruition on the way to the monastery.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On arrival at the monastery he asked the bhikkhus to admit
    him into the Order. They refused and said, &quot;We cannot admit you as a bhikkhu. You
    have been shaving your head so often that your head is like a whetting stone.&quot; Still,
    he entreated them to admit him into the Order just once more and they complied. Within a
    few days, the bhikkhu Cittahattha attained arahatship together with Analytical Insight.
    Other bhikkhus, seeing him staying on for a long time in the monastery, were surprised and
    they asked him the reason why. To this, he replied. &quot;I went home when I still had
    attachment in me, but now that attachment has been cut off&quot; The bhikkhus, not
    believing him, approached the Buddha and reported the matter. To them, the Buddha said,
    &quot;Thera Cittahattha was speaking the truth; he shifted between home and monastery
    before because at that time, his mind was not steadfast and he did not understand the
    Dhamma. But at this moment, Thera Cittahattha is already an arahat; he has discarded both
    good and evil.&quot;</font></p>

    The Story of <a NAME="Five">Five</a> Hundred Bhikkhus</b></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (40) of this book, with reference to five hundred bhikkhus.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Five hundred bhikkhus from Savatthi, after obtaining a
    subject of meditation from the Buddha, travelled for a distance of one hundred yojanas [<em>yozana:
    a measure of length about twelve miles</em>] away from Savatthi and came to a large forest
    grove, a suitable place for meditation practice. The guardian spirits of the trees
    dwelling in that forest thought that if those bhikkhus were staying in the forest, it
    would not be proper for them to live with their families in the trees. So they descended
    from the trees, thinking that the bhikkhus would stop there only for one night. But the
    bhikkhus were still there at the end of a fortnight; then it occurred to them that the
    bhikkhus might be staying there till the end of the vassa. In that case, they and their
    families would have to be living on the ground for a long time. So, they decided to
    frighten away the bhikkhus, by making ghostly sounds and frightful apparitions. They
    showed up with bodies without heads, and with heads without bodies, etc. The bhikkhus were
    very upset and left the place and returned to the Buddha, to whom they related everything.
    On hearing their account, the Buddha told them that this had happened because previously
    they went without any weapon and that they should go back there armed with a suitable
    weapon. So saying, the Buddha taught them the entire Metta Sutta (discourse on
    Loving-Kindness) beginning with the following stanza:</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Times New Roman"><strong><em>Karaniyamattha kusalena <br>
    Yanta santam padam abhisamecca<br>
    Sakko uju ca suhuju ca <br>
    Suvaco c'assa mudu anatimani.</em></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">[The above stanza may be translated as follows: He who is
    skilled in (acquiring) what is good and beneficial, (mundane as well as supra-mundane),
    aspiring to attain Perfect Peace (Nibbana) should act (thus): He should be efficient,
    upright, perfectly upright, compliant, gentle and free from conceit.]</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The bhikkhus were instructed to recite the sutta from the
    time they came to the outskirts of the forest grove and to enter the monastery reciting
    the same. The bhikkhus returned to the forest grove and did as they were told. The
    guardian spirits of the trees receiving loving-kindness from the bhikkhus reciprocated by
    readily welcoming and not harming them. There were no more ghostly sounds and ungainly
    sights. Thus left in peace, the bhikkhus meditated on the body and came to realize its
    fragile and impermanent nature. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha, by his
    supernormal power, learned about the progress of the bhikkhus and sent forth his radiance
    making them feel his presence. To them he said, &quot;Bhikkhus just as you have realized,
    the body is, indeed, impermanent.</font></p>

    Thera Tissa was diligently practising meditation when he was afflicted with a disease.
    Small boils appeared all over his body and these developed into big sores. When these

    his whole body was stinking. For this reason, he was known as Putigattatissa, Tissa the
    thera with stinking body.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the Buddha surveyed the universe with the light of his

    who had been abandoned by his resident pupils on account of his stinking body. At the same
    time, he also knew that Tissa would soon attain arahatship. So, the Buddha proceeded to
    the fire-shed, close to the place where the thera was staying. There, he boiled some
    water, and then going, to where the thera was lying down, took hold of the edge of the
    couch. It was then only that the resident pupils gathered round the thera, and as
    instructed by the Buddha, they carried the thera to the fire-shed, where he was washed and
    bathed. While he was being bathed, his upper and lower robes were washed and dried. After
    the bath, the thera became fresh in body and mind and soon developed one-pointedness of
    concentration. Standing at the head of the couch, the Buddha said to him that this body
    when devoid of life would be as useless as a log and would be laid on the earth.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While on a visit to a village in the kingdom of Kosala,
    the Buddha uttered Verse (42) of this book, with reference to Nanda, the herdsman. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nanda was a herdsman who looked after the cows of
    Anathapindika. Although only a herdsman, he had some means of his own. Occasionally, he
    would go to the house of Anathapindika and there he sometimes met the Buddha and listened
    to his discourses. Nanda requested the Buddha to pay a visit to his house. But the Buddha
    did not go to Nanda's house immediately, saying that it was not yet time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After some time, while travelling with his followers, the
    Buddha went off his route to visit Nanda, knowing that the time was ripe for Nanda to
    receive his teaching properly. Nanda respectfully received the Buddha and his followers;
    he served them milk and milk products and other choice food for seven days. On the last
    day, after hearing the discourse given by the Buddha, Nanda attained Sotapatti Fruition.
    As the Buddha was leaving that day, Nanda carrying the bowl of the Buddha, followed him
    for some distance, paid obeisance and turned back to go home.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At that instant, a hunter who was an old enemy of Nanda,
    shot him down. The bhikkhus who were following the Buddha, saw Nanda lying dead. They
    reported the matter to the Buddha, saying, &quot;Venerable Sir, because you came here,
    Nanda who made great offerings to you and accompanied you on your return was killed as he
    was turning back to go home.&quot; To them, the Buddha replied, &quot;Bhikkhus, whether I
    came here or not, there was no escape from death for him, as a wrongly directed mind can
    do oneself much greater harm than an enemy or a thief can.&quot;</font></p>

    Story of <a NAME="Soreyya">Soreyya</a></b></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (43) of this book, with reference to Soreyya, the son of a rich man of
    Soreyya city.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On one occasion, Soreyya accompanied by a friend and some
    attendants was going out in a luxurious carriage for a bath. At that moment, Thera
    Mahakaccayana was adjusting his robes outside the city, as he was going into the city of
    Soreyya for alms-food. The youth Soreyya, seeing the golden complexion of the thera,
    thought, &quot;How I wish the thera were my wife, or else that the complexion of my wife
    were like that of his.&quot; As the wish arose in him, his sex changed and he became a
    woman. Very much ashamed, he got down from the carriage and ran away, taking the road to
    Taxila. His companions missing him, looked for him, but could not find him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Soreyya, now a woman, offered her signet ring to some
    people going to Taxila, to allow her to go along with them in their carriage. On arrival
    at Taxila, her companions told a young rich man of Taxila about the lady who came along
    with them. The young rich man, finding her to be very beautiful and of a suitable age for
    him, married her. As a result of this marriage two sons were born; there were also two
    sons from the previous marriage of Soreyya as a man.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day, a rich man's son from the city of Soreyya came to
    Taxila with five hundred carts. Lady-Soreyya recognizing him to be an old friend sent for
    him. The man from Soreyya city was surprised that he was invited, because he did not know
    the lady who invited him. He told the lady-Soreyya that he did not know her, and asked her
    whether she knew him. She answered that she knew him and also enquired after the health of
    her family and other people in Soreyya city. The man from Soreyya city next told her about
    the rich man's son who disappeared mysteriously while going out for a bath. Then the
    Lady-Soreyya revealed her identity and related all that had happened, about the wrongful
    thoughts with regard to Thera Mahakaccayana, about the change of sex, and her marriage to
    the young rich man of Taxila. The man from the city of Soreyya then advised the
    lady-Soreyya to ask pardon of the thera. Thera Mahakaccayana was accordingly invited to
    the home of Soreyya and alms-food was offered to him. After the meal, the lady-Soreyya was
    brought to the presence of the thera, and the man from Soreyya told the thera that the
    lady was at one time the son of a rich man from Soreyya city. He then explained to the
    thera how Soreyya was turned into a female on account of his wrongful thoughts towards the
    respected thera. Lady-Soreyya then respectfully asked pardon of Thera Mahakaccayana. The
    thera then said, &quot;Get up, I forgive you.&quot; As soon as these words were spoken,
    the woman was changed back to a man. Soreyya then pondered how within a single existence
    and with a single body he had undergone change of sex and how sons were born to him, etc.
    And feeling very weary and repulsive of all these things, he decided to leave the
    household life and joined the Order under the thera.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After that, he was often asked, &quot;Whom do you love
    more, the two sons you had as a man or the other two you had as a wife?&quot; To them, he
    would answer that his love for those born of the womb was greater. This question was put
    to him so often, he felt very much annoyed and ashamed. So he stayed by himself and with
    diligence, contemplated the decay and dissolution of the body. He soon attained arahatship
    together with the Analytical Insight. When the old question was next put to him he replied
    that he had no affection for any one in particular. Other bhikkhus hearing him thought he
    must be telling a lie. When reported about Soreyya giving a different answer, the Buddha
    said, &quot;My son is not telling lies, he is speaking the truth. His answer now is
    different because he has now realized arahatship and so has no more affection for anyone
    in particular. By his well-directed mind my son has brought about in himself a well-being
    which neither the father nor the mother can bestow on him.&quot;</font></p>
