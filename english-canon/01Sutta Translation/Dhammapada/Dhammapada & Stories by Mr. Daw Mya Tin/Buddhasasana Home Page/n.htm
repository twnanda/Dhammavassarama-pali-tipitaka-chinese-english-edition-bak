    hundred bhikkhus went to a monastery near a small village to spend the vassa. At the end
    of the vassa, Thera Sariputta wanted robes for young bhikkhus and samaneras. So he said to
    the bhikkhus, &quot;If people come to offer robes, send them to me or inform me&quot;; and
    then he left for the Jetavana monastery to pay homage to the Buddha. Other bhikkhus
    misunderstood Thera Sariputta's instructions, and said to the Buddha, &quot;Venerable Sir!
    Thera Sariputta is still attached to material things like robes and other requisites of a
    bhikkhu.&quot; To them the Buddha replied, <font>&quot;Bhikkhus! My son Sariputta has no
    more craving in him. He told you to bring the robes to him, so that the chances to perform
    meritorious deeds may not decrease for lay -disciples, and the chances to accept whatever
    they may properly receive may not be reduced for young bhikkhus and samaneras.&quot;</font></font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (413) of this book, with reference to Thera Candabha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Candabha had, in a previous existence, made offerings of
    sandalwood to a stupa where the relics of Kassapa Buddha were enshrined-For this good
    deed, he was reborn in a brahmin family in Savatthi. He was born with a distinguishing
    mark, viz., a circle of light radiating from around his navel. As this circle of light
    resembled the moon he came to be known as Candabha. Some brahmins, taking advantage of
    this unusual feature, put him on a cart and took him round the town for exhibition and
    only those who paid a hundred or a thousand were allowed to touch him. On one occasion,
    they stopped at a place between the town and the Jetavana monastery. To <i>ariyas</i>
    going to the Jetavana monastery, they said, 'What is the use of your going to the Buddha
    and listening to his discourses? There is no one who is as powerful as Candabha. One who
    touches him will get rich; why don't you come and see ?&quot; The <i>ariyas</i> then said
    to them, &quot;Only our teacher is powerful; he is unrivalled and matchless.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the brahmins took Candabha to the Jetavana monostely
    to compete with the Buddha. But when Candabha was in the presence of the Buddha. the ring
    of light went out by itself. When Candabha was taken out of sight of the Buddha, the ring
    of light returned automatically; it again disappeared when taken back to the presence of
    the Buddha. Candabha then asked the Buddha to give him the mantra (words of incantation)
    that would make the ring of light disappear from around his navel. The Buddha told him
    that the mantra could be given only to a member of his Order. Candabha told the brahmins
    that he was getting a mantra from the Buddha and that after mastering the mantra he would
    be the greatest person in the whole of Jambudipa. So the brahmins waited outside the
    monastery. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Meanwhile, Candabha became a bhikkhu. He was instructed to
    contemplate the body, i.e., to reflect on the repulsiveness and impurity of the thirty-two
    constituents of the body. Within a few days, Candabha attained arahat ship. When the
    brahmins who were waiting outside the monastery came to enquire whether he had acquired
    the mantra, Candabha replied. &quot;You people had better go back now; as for me I am no
    longer in a position to go along with you.&quot; Other bhikkhus, hearing him, went to the
    Buddha and said, &quot;Candabha is falsely claiming that he has become an arahat.&quot; To
    them the Buddha replied, &quot;Candabha speaks the truth; he has eradicated all moral
    intoxicants.&quot;</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing in the Kundadhana forest near the city of
    Kundakoliya, the Buddha uttered Verse (414) of this book, with reference to Thera Sivali.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Princess Suppavasa of Kundakoliya was in pregnancy for
    seven years and then for seven days she was in labour pains. She kept contemplating the
    unique qualities of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Samgha and in the end she sent her
    husband to the Buddha to pay obeisance to him on her behalf and to inform him of her
    condition. When informed of the condition of the princess, the Buddha said, &quot;May
    Suppavasa be free from danger and from sorrow; may she give birth to a healthy noble son
    in safety.&quot; As these words were being spoken, Suppavasa gave birth to her son at her
    house. On that very day, soon after the birth of the child, the Buddha and some bhikkhus
    were invited to the house. Alms-food was offered there and the newly born child offered
    filtered water to the Buddha and the bhikkhus. To celebrate the birth of the child, the
    parents invited the Buddha and the bhikkhus to their house to offer food for seven days.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the child grew up he was admitted to the Order and as
    a bhikkhu he was known as Sivali. He attained arahatship as soon as his head was shaved
    off. Later, he became famous as the bhikkhu who received the largest amount of offerings.
    As a recipient of offerings he was unsurpassed.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On one occasion, the bhikkhus asked the Buddha why Sivali,
    with the qualifications to become an arahat, was confined in his mother's womb for seven
    years. To them the Buddha replied, &quot;Bhikkhus! In a previous existence, Sivali was the
    son of a king who lost his kingdom to another king. In trying to regain their kingdom he
    had besieged the city on the advice of his mother. As a result, the people in the city
    were without food or water for seven days. It was for this evil deed that Sivali was
    imprisoned in his mother's womb for seven years. But now, Sivali has come to the end of
    all dukkha; he has realized Nibbana.&quot; </font></p>

    The Story of Thera <a name="415">Sundarasamudda</a></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (415) of this book, with reference to Thera Sundarasamudda.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sundarasamudda was the son of a rich man from Savatthi.
    After he had entered the Order, he left for Rajagaha, which was forty-five yojanas away
    from Savatthi, to practise meditation. One day, while some festivities were going on in
    Savatthi, the parents of Sundarasamudda missed him very much; they also felt sorry for
    their son who was missing all the enjoyment and they wept. As they were weeping, a
    courtesan came to them and asked what the matter was. On hearing about their son, the
    courtesan said, &quot;If I could make your son leave the Order and return to the life of a
    lay man how would you reward me?&quot; The parents answered that they would make her rich.
    The courtesan then asked for a large sum of money and left for Rajagaha with a number of
    followers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At Rajagaha, she rented a house with seven-tiered
    pinnacles on the route where Thera Sundarasamudda would come on his alms-round. She
    prepared good food and waited for him. On the first few days, she offered alms-food to the
    thera at the door of her house. Later, she invited him to come inside. Meanwhile, she paid
    money to some children to come and play just outside the house about the time the thera
    usually came on his alms-round. This gave her the excuse that it was very dusty and noisy
    on the ground floor; with this excuse she invited the thera to the top floor to have his
    alms-food. The thera consented and went up and as soon as he had entered the room, the
    courtesan closed the door. Then she started seducing the thera. She said to the thera,
    &quot;Venerable Sir! Please be my youthful and energetic husband, and I will be your
    dearly beloved wife. After our long and happy wedded life we can both leave it to enter
    the Order and strive our very best to attain Nibbana.&quot; When he heard these words the
    thera suddenly realized his mistake and got alarmed. Then he said to himself,
    &quot;Indeed, by being negligent and unmindful I have made a great mistake.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At that instant, the Buddha saw from his Perfumed Chamber
    what was happening to Thera Sundarasamudda at Rajagaha. He called the Venerable Ananda and
    said to him, &quot;Ananda! On an upper storey of a pinnacled building in Rajagaha, there
    now goes on a struggle between Sundarasamudda and a courtesan; but in the end the thera
    will be the winner.&quot; After saying this to Ananda, the Buddha sent forth his radiance
    to the thera, made him feel his presence, and said, &quot;My son! Be resolute and get rid
    of love of wealth and sensual pleasures.&quot;</font></p>

    The Story of <a name="416">Thera Jatila </a></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Veluvana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (416) of this book, with reference to Thera Jatila.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Soon after the passing away (Parinibbana) of Kassapa
    Buddha, an arahat thera went round for donations to build a gold stupa where the relics of
    Kassapa Buddha were to be enshrined. The thera came to the house of a goldsmith while he
    and his wife were en gaged in a heated quarrel. The goldsmith shouted at the thera and
    said, &quot;You had better throw your stupa into the water and go away.&quot; His wife
    then said to the goldsmith, &quot;If you are angry with me you should abuse me only; you
    can even beat me if you like; but why do you have to abuse the Buddha and the thera?
    Surely, you have done a grievous wrong !&quot; Hearing her words, the goldsmith realized
    the enormity of the wrong he had done and wanted to make atonement for it. So, he made
    some gold flowers, put them into three gold pots and offered them to be put into the relic
    chamber of the stupa of Kassapa Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In his present existence he was conceived in the womb of a
    rich man's daughter who had had an illicit love affair. When the child was born, she put
    it into a pot and floated it down the stream. A young woman who was bathing in the stream
    saw the child in the pot and took it with her. She adopted him and named him Jatila.
    Later, on the advice of a thera the woman sent Jatila to Taxila where he had his
    education. While at Taxila the thera arranged for him to stay at the house of a merchant
    who was a disciple of his. In due course, Jatila married the daughter of the merchant.
    Soon after the marriage, a large mound of gold appeared in the backyard of the house which
    was newly built for the couple. Three sons were born out of this marriage. After that,
    Jatila joined the Order and attained arahatship within a few days.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On one occasion, as the Buddha went on an alms-round with
    five hundred bhikkhus including Jatila, they came to the house of the sons of Jatila. His
    sons offered alms-food to the Buddha and his disciples for fifteen days. Some time
    afterwards, the bhikkhus asked Jatila whether he was still attached to his mound of gold
    and his sons, and he answered that he had no more attachment to them. The bhikkhus then
    said to the Buddha that Jatila was falsely claiming to have attained arahatship. To them
    the Buddha said, &quot;Bhikkhus! Jatila has got rid of craving and pride; he has indeed
    attained arahatship.&quot;</font></p>

    The Story or <a name="416*">Thera Jotika </a></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Veluvana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (416) of this book, with reference to Thera Jotika.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Jotika was a famous rich man from Rajagaha. He lived in a
    stately mansion with seven tiered pinnacles. There were seven walls around his mansion,
    each of which had an entrance guarded by celestial demons. The fame of his wealth spread
    far and wide, and many people came to see his mansion. On one occasion, King Bimbisara
    came to visit Jotika; he also brought his son Ajatasattu with him. Ajatasattu seeing the
    grandeur of Jotika's mansion vowed that he would not allow Jotika to live in such a
    magnificent mansion when he became king. On the king's departure from his house Jotika
    presented the king with a large priceless ruby. It was the custom of Jotika to give
    presents to all visitors who came to see him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Ajatasattu ascended the throne, after killing his
    father, he came with his soldiers to take the mansion of Jotika by force. But as all the
    gates were well guarded by celestial demons, Ajatasattu and his soldiers had to retreat.
    Ajatasattu fled to the Veluvana monastery and he found Jotika listening to a discourse
    given by the Buddha. Seeing Jotika at the feet of the Buddha, Ajatasattu exclaimed,
    &quot;After making your guards fight me, you are now pretending to be listening to a
    discourse!&quot; Jotika realized that the king had gone to take his place by force and
    that he had been compelled to retreat. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In a past existence, Jotika had made a solemn wish that
    his properly might not be taken away from him against his wish, and this wish had been
    fulfilled. So Jotika said to King Ajatasattu, &quot;O king! My property cannot be taken
    away against my wish.&quot; Saying this, he stretched out his ten fingers and asked the
    king to take off the twenty rings he was wearing on his fingers. The king tried hard to
    take them off but did not succeed. Jotika then asked the king to spread out a piece of
    cloth and as Jotika put his fingers on to the cloth, all his rings easily slipped off.
    After he had given all his rings to King Ajatasattu, Jotika asked the Buddha that he might
    be permitted into the Order. Soon after entering the Order, Jotika attained arahatship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day, when other bhikkhus asked him whether he had any
    more craving left in him for his mansion his wealth and his wife, he answered that he did
    not have any more craving for them. The bhikkhus then went to the Buddha and said,
    &quot;Venerable Sir! Thera Jotika claims to have attained arahatship; he is telling
    lies.&quot; To them the Buddha said, &quot;Bhikkhus! Jotika speaks the truth; he does not
    have any more craving in him. He is now an arahat.&quot;</font></p>

    singing and dancing when he had a chance to listen to a discourse given by the Buddha.
    After listening to the discourse, he entered the Order and attained arahatship soon
    afterwards. One day, while the Buddha and the bhikkhus including Nataputtaka were going on
    an alms-round, they came across the son of another dancer dancing in the street. Seeing
    the young man dancing, the other bhikkhus asked Nataputtaka whether he still liked
    dancing. And Nataputtaka answered, &quot;No, I do not.&quot; The bhikkhus then went to the
    Buddha and told him that Thera Nataputtaka was falsely claiming to have attained
    arahatship. Thereby, the Buddha said, &quot;Bhikkhus! Nataputtaka has gone beyond all
    bonds of attachment; he has become an arahat.&quot;</font></p>

    The Story of <a name="419420">Thera Vangisa </a></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verses (419) and (420) of this book, with reference to Thera Vangisa.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, in Rajagaha, there was a brahmin by the name of
    Vangisa who by simply tapping on the skull of a dead person could tell whether that person
    was reborn in the world of the devas, or of the human beings, or in one of the four lower
    worlds (apayas). The brahmins took Vangisa to many villages and people flocked to him and
    paid him ten, twenty or a hundred to find out from him where their various dead relatives
    were reborn.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On one occasion, Vangisa and his party came to a place not
    far from the Jetavana monastery. Seeing those people who were going to the Buddha, the
    brahmins invited them to come to Vangisa who could tell where their relatives had been
    reborn. But the Buddha's disciples said to them, &quot;Our teacher is one without a rival,
    he only is the Enlightened One.&quot; The brahmins took that statement as a challenge and
    took Vangisa along with them to the Jetavana monastery to compete with the Buddha. The
    Buddha, knowing their intention, instructed the bhikkhus to bring the skulls of a person
    reborn in niraya, of a person reborn in the animal world, of a person reborn in the human
    world, of a person reborn in the deva world and also of an arahat. The five were then
    placed in a row. When Vangisa was shown those skulls he could tell where the owners of the
    first four skulls were reborn but when he came to the skull of the arahat he was at a
    loss. Then the Buddha said, &quot;Vangisa, don't you know? I do know where the owner of
    that skull is.&quot; Vangisa then asked the Buddha to let him have the magical incantation
    (mantra) by which he could thus know; but the Buddha told him that the mantra could be
    given only to a bhikkhu. Vangisa then told the brahmins to wait outside the monastery
    while he was being taught the mantra. Thus,Vangisa became a bhikkhu and as a bhikkhu, he
    was instructed by the Buddha to contemplate the thirty-two constituents of the body.
    Vangisa diligently practised meditation as instructed by the Buddha and attained
    arahatship within a short time.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the brahmins who were waiting outside the monastery
    came to ask Vangisa whether he had acquired the mantra, Vangisa said, &quot;You all had
    better go now; as for me, I should no longer go along with you.&quot; Other bhikkhus
    hearing him thought he was telling lies, so they went to the Buddha and said,
    &quot;Venerable Sir! Vangisa is falsely claiming to have attained arahatship.&quot; To
    them the Buddha 'said, &quot;Bhikkhus! Vangisa really knows the death and rebirth of
    beings.</font></p>

    retorted, &quot;Who would swallow the spittle you have thrown up?&quot; Then she asked
    permission from him to enter the Order and became a bhikkhuni. After becoming a bhikkhuni
    she went to a monastery in a small village in the company of other bhikkhunis to practise
    meditation. Within a short time, she attained arahatship and returned to Rajagaha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Visakha, hearing that Dhammadinna had returned, went to
    see her and asked her some questions. When he asked her about the first three<i> maggas</i>
    she answered him; but when he asked her questions on the<i> arahatta magga </i>and<i>
    phala</i> she said, &quot;O lay-disciple! This matter is out of your depth; if you want,
    you may go and ask the Buddha.&quot; When Visakha asked the Buddha, the Buddha said,
    &quot;Dhammadinna has already answered your question. If you ask me I shall have to give

    elephant holding a white umbrella over his head as a sunshade. However, they could get
    only four hundred and ninety-nine trained elephants and so they had to put in an untrained
    elephant and it was allotted to hold the umbrella over Thera Angulimala. Every one was
    afraid that the untrained elephant might give trouble, but when brought near Thera
    Angulimala it was quite docile.</font></p>
