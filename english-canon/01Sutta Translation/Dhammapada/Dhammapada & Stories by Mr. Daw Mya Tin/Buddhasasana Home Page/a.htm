    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery in Savatthi, the
    Buddha uttered Verse (1) of this book, with reference to Cakkhupala, a blind thera.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On one occasion, Thera Cakkhupala came to pay homage to
    the Buddha at the Jetavana monastery. One night, while pacing up and down in meditation,
    the thera accidentally stepped on some insects. In the morning, some bhikkhus visiting the
    thera found the dead insects. They thought ill of the thera and reported the matter to the
    Buddha. The Buddha asked them whether they had seen the thera killing the insects. When
    they answered in the negative, the Buddha said, &quot;Just as you had not seen him
    killing, so also he had not seen those living insects. Besides, as the thera had already
    attained arahatship he could have no intention of killing and so was quite innocent.&quot;
    On being asked why Cakkhupala was blind although he was an arahat, the Buddha told the
    following story:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Cakkhupala was a physician in one of his past existences.
    Once, he had deliberately made a woman patient blind. That woman had promised him to
    become his slave, together with her children, if her eyes were completely cured. Fearing
    that she and her children would have to become slaves, she lied to the physician. She told
    him that her eyes were getting worse when, in fact, they were perfectly cured. The
    physician knew she was deceiving him, so in revenge, he gave her another ointment, which
    made her totally blind. As a result of this evil deed the physician lost his eyesight many
    times in his later existences. </font></p>

    Story of <b><a NAME="Matthakundali">Matthakundali</a></b></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery in Savatthi, the
    Buddha uttered Verse (2) of this book, with reference to Matthakundali, a young Brahmin
    Matthakundali was a young brahmin, whose father, Adinnapubbaka, was very stingy and never
    gave anything in charity. Even the gold ornaments for his only son were made by himself to
    save payment for workmanship. When his son fell ill, no physician was consulted, until it
    was too late. When he realized that his son was dying, he had the youth carried outside on
    to the verandah, so that people coming to his house would not see his possessions.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On that morning, the Buddha arising early from his deep
    meditation of compassion saw, in his Net of Knowledge, Matthakundali lying on the
    verandah. So when entering Savatthi for alms-food with his disciples, the Buddha stood
    near the door of the brahmin Adinnapubbaka. The Buddha sent forth a ray of light to
    attract the attention of the youth, who was facing the interior of the house. The youth
    saw the Buddha; and as he was very weak he could only profess his faith mentally. But that
    was enough. When he passed away with his heart in devotion to the Buddha he was reborn in
    the Tavatimsa celestial world. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From his celestial abode the young Matthakundali, seeing
    his father mourning over him at the cemetery, appeared to the old man in the likeness of
    his old self. He told his father about his rebirth in the Tavatimsa world and also urged
    him to approach and invite the Buddha to a meal. At the house of Adinnapubbaka the
    question of whether one could or could not be reborn in a celestial world simply by
    mentally professing profound faith in the Buddha, without giving in charity or observing
    the moral precepts, was brought up. So the Buddha willed that Matthakundali should appear
    in person; Matthakundali soon appeared fully decked with celestial ornaments and told them
    about his rebirth in the Tavatimsa world. Then only, the audience became convinced that
    the son of the brahmin Adinnapubbaka by simply devoting his mind to the Buddha had
    attained much glory.</font></p>

    service for him. On the other hand, he failed to perform the duties expected of junior
    bhikkhus; besides, he often quarrelled with the younger bhikkhus. Should anyone rebuke him
    on account of his behaviour he would go complaining to the Buddha, weeping, very much

    Savatthi and an ogress named Kali. The ogress (Kalayakkhini) was in hot pursuit of the
    lady with the baby, when the latter learned that the Buddha was nearby, giving a religious
    discourse at the Jetavana monastery. She fled to him and placed her son at his feet for
    protection. The ogress was stopped at the door by the guardian spirit of the monastery and
    was refused admission. She was later called in and both the lady and the ogress were
    reprimanded by the Buddha. The Buddha told them about their past feuds as rival wives of a
    common husband, as a cat and a hen, and as a doe and a leopardess. They were made to see
    that hatred could only cause more hatred, and that it could only cease through friendship,

    Buddha uttered Verse (6) of this book, with reference to the bhikkhus of Kosambi.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The bhikkhus of Kosambi had formed into two groups. One
    group followed the master of Vinaya and the other followed the teacher of the Dhamma and
    they were often quarrelling among themselves. Even the Buddha could not stop them from
    quarrelling; so he left them and spent the vassa, residence period of the rains, all alone
    in Rakkhita Grove near Palileyyaka forest. There, the elephant Palileyya waited upon the
    Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The lay disciples of Kosambi, on learning the reason for
    the departure of the Buddha, refused to make offerings to the remaining bhikkhus. This
    made them realize their mistake and reconciliation took place among themselves. Still, the
    lay disciples would not treat them as respectfully as before, until they owned up their
    fault to the Buddha. But the Buddha was away and it was in the middle of the vassa; so the
    bhikkhus of Kosambi spent the vassa in misery and hardship.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the end of the vassa, the Venerable Ananda and five
    hundred bhikkhus approached the Buddha and gave the message from Annathapindika and other
    lay disciples imploring him to return. In due course the Buddha returned to the Jetavana
    monastery in Savatthi. The bhikkhus followed him there, fell down at his feet, and owned
    up their fault. The Buddha rebuked them for disobeying him. He told them to remember that
    they must all die some day and therefore, they must stop their quarrels and must not act

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing in the neighbourhood of the town of
    Setabya, the Buddha uttered Verses (7) and (8) of this book, with reference to Mahakala
    and his brother Culakala. Mahakala and Culakala were two merchant brothers from the town
    of Setabya. While travelling about with their merchandise on one occasion, they had a
    chance to listen to a religious discourse given by the Buddha. After hearing the discourse
    Mahakala asked the Buddha for admission to the Order of the bhikkhus. Culakala also joined
    the Order but with the intention of coming out of the Order and to bring out his brother
    along with him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mahakala was serious in his ascetic practice at the
    cemetery (<i>Sosanika dhutinga</i>) and diligently meditated on decay and impermanence. He
    finally gained Insight and attained arahatship. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Later, the Buddha and his disciples, including the
    brothers, happened to be staying in the forest of Simsapa, near Setabya. While staying
    there, the former wives of Culakala invited the Buddha and his disciples to their house.
    Culakala himself went ahead to prepare seating arrangements for the Buddha and his
    disciples. Once there, the former wives of Culakala made him change into lay clothes. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The next day, the wives of Mahakala invited the Buddha and
    his disciples to their house hoping to do the same with Mahakala as the wives of Culakala
    had done to Culakala. After the meal they requested the Buddha to let Mahakala remain to
    &quot;express appreciation&quot; (anumodana). So the Buddha and the other disciples left.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Arriving at the village gate the bhikkhus expressed their
    dissatisfaction and apprehension. They were dissatisfied because Mahakala was permitted to
    stay behind and they were afraid that, like Culakala, his brother, Mahakala, too, would be
    made to leave the Order by his former wives. To this, the Buddha replied that the two
    brothers were not alike. Culakala indulged in sensual pleasures and was lazy and weak; he
    was just like a weak tree. Mahakala, on the other hand, was diligent, steadfast and strong
    in his faith of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Samgha; he was like a mountain of rock.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery in Savatthi, the
    Buddha uttered Verses (9) and (10) of this book, with reference to Devadatta.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once the two Chief Disciples, the Venerable Sariputta and
    the Venerable Maha Moggallana, went from Savatthi to Rajagaha. There, the people of
    Rajagaha invited them, with their one thousand followers, to a morning meal. On that
    occasion someone handed over a piece of cloth, worth one hundred thousand, to the
    organizers of the alms giving ceremony. He instructed them to dispose of it and use the
    proceeds for the ceremony should there be any shortage of funds, or if there were no such
    shortage, to offer it to anyone of the bhikkhus they thought fit. It so happened that
    there was no shortage of anything and the cloth was to be offered to one of the theras.
    Since the two Chief Disciples visited Rajagaha only occasionally, the cloth was offered to
    Devadatta, who was a permanent resident of Rajagaha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Devadatta promptly made the cloth into robes and moved
    about pompously, wearing them. Then, a certain bhikkhu from Rajagaha came to Savatthi to
    pay homage to the Buddha, and told him about Devadatta and the robe, made out of cloth
    worth one hundred thousand. The Buddha them said that it was not the first time that
    Devadatta was wearing robes that he did not deserve. The Buddha then related the following
    story. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Devadatta was an elephant hunter in one of his previous
    existences. At that time, in a certain forest, there lived a large number of elephants.
    One day, the hunter noticed that these elephants knelt down to the paccekabuddhas* on
    seeing them. Having observed that, the hunter stole an upper part of a yellow robe and
    covered his body and hand with it. Then, holding a spear in his hand, he waited for the
    elephants on their usual route. The elephants came, and taking him for a paccekabuddha
    fell down on their knees to pay obeisance. They easily fell a prey to the hunter. Thus,
    one by one, he killed the last elephant in the row each day for many days.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Bodhisatta (the Buddha-to-be) was then the leader of
    the herd. Noticing the dwindling number of his followers he decided to investigate and
    followed his herd at the end of the line. He was alert, and was therefore able to evade
    the spear. He caught hold of the hunter in his trunk and was about to dash him against the
    ground, when he saw the yellow robe. Seeing the yellow robe, he desisted and spared the
    life of the hunter. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The hunter was rebuked for trying to kill under cover of
    the yellow robe and for commuting such an act of depravity. The hunter clearly did not
    deserve to put on the yellow robe. </font></p>

    they approached Sanjaya. the wandering ascetic at Rajagaha, but they were not satisfied
    with his teachings. So they went all over Jarnbudipa and came back to their native place,
    after searching for, but not finding the true dhamma. At this point they came to an
    understanding that one who found the true dhamma should inform the other.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day, Upatissa came across Thera Assaji and learned
    from him the substance of the dhamma. The thera uttered the verse beginning with &quot;Ye
    dhamma hetuppabhava&quot;, meaning, &quot;those phenomena which proceed from a
    cause&quot;. Listening to the verse, Upatissa became established in the Sotapatti Magga
    and Phala. Then, as promised, he went to his friend Kolita, explained to him that he,
    Upatissa, had attained the state of Deathlessness and repeated the verse to his friend.
    Kolita also become established in Sotapatti Fruition at the end of the verse. They both
    remembered their former teacher and so went to Sanjaya and said to him, &quot;We have
    found one who could point out the Path to Deathlesseness; the Buddha has appeared in the
    world; the Dhamma has appeared; the Sangha has appeared... Come, let us go to the
    Teacher.&quot; They had hoped that their former teacher would go along with them to the
    Buddha and by listening to the discourses he, too, would come to realize Magga and Phala.
    But Sanjaya refused. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So Upatissa and Kolita, with two hundred and fifty
    followers, went to the Buddha, at Veluvana. There, they were initiated and admitted into
    the Order as bhikkhus. Upatissa as son of Rupasari became known as Thera Sariputta; Kolita
    as son of Moggali became known as Thera Maha Moggallana. On the seventh day after the
    initiation Maha Moggallana attained Arahatship. Thera Sariputta achieved the same a
    fortnight after initiation. On that day, the Buddha made them his two Chief Disciples
    (Agga-Savaka). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The two Chief Disciples then related to the Buddha how
    they went to the Giragga festival, the meeting with Thera Assaji and their attainment of
    Sotapatti Fruition. They also told the Buddha about their former teacher Sanjaya, who
    refused to accompany them. Sanjaya had said, &quot;Having bean a teacher to so many
    pupils, for me to become his pupil would be like a jar turning into a drinking cup.
    Besides, only few people are wise and the majority are foolish; let the wise go to the
    wise Gotama, the foolish would still come to me. Go your way, my pupils.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, as the Buddha pointed out, Sanjaya's false pride was
    preventing him from seeing truth as truth; he was seeing untruth as truth and would never
    arrive at the real truth.</font></p>

    of the Buddha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once the Buddha was residing at the Veluvana monastery in
    Rajagaha when his father King Suddhodana repeatedly sent messengers to the Buddha
    requesting him to visit the city of Kapilavatthu. Accordingly, the Buddha made the journey
    in the company of twenty thousand arahats. On arrival at Kapilavatthu he related the
    Vessantara Jataka to the assembly of his relatives. On the second day, he entered the
    city, where by reciting the verse beginning with &quot;Uttitthe Nappamajjeyya...&quot;
    (i.e., One should arise and should not be unmindful...) he caused his father to be
    established in Sotapatti Fruition. On arrival at the palace, the Buddha recited another
    verse beginning with &quot;Dhammam care sucaritam...&quot; (i. e., One should practise the
    Dhamma...) and established the king in Sakadagami Fruition.<b>* </b>After the meal he
    narrated the Candakinnari Jataka, with reference to the virtues of Rahula's mother. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the third day, there was the marriage ceremony of
    Prince Nanda, a cousin of the Buddha. The Buddha went there for alms and handed over the
    alms bowl to Prince Nanda. The Buddha then departed without taking back the bowl. So the
    prince, holding the bowl, had to follow the Buddha. The bride, Princess Janapadakalyani,
    seeing the prince following the Buddha rushed forth and cried out to the prince to come
    back soon. At the monastery, the prince was admitted into the Order as a bhikkhu. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Later, the Buddha moved into the monastery built by
    Anathapindika, at Jeta Park in Savatthi. While residing there Nanda was discontented and
    half-hearted and found little pleasure in the life of a bhikkhu. He wanted to return to
    the life of a householder because he kept on remembering the words of Princess
    Janapadakalyani, imploring him to return soon. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Knowing this, the Buddha, by supernormal power, showed
    Nanda, the beautiful female devas of the Tavatimsa world who were far prettier than
    Princess Janapadakalyani. He promised to get them for Nanda, if the latter strove hard in
    the practice of the Dhamma. Other bhikkhus ridiculed Nanda by saying that he was like a
    hireling who practised the Dhamma for the sake of beautiful women, etc. Nanda felt very
    much tormented and ashamed. So, in seclusion, he tried very hard in the practice of the
    Dhamma and eventually attained arahatship. As an arahat his mind was totally released from
    all attachments, and the Buddha was also released from his promise to Nanda. All this had
    been foreseen by the Buddha right from the very beginning. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Other bhikkhus, having known that Nanda was not happy in
    the life of a bhikkhu, again asked him how he was faring. When he answered that he had no
    more attachments to the life of a householder, they thought Nanda was not speaking the
    truth. So they informed the Buddha about the matter, at the same time expressing their
    doubts. The Buddha then explained to them that, previously, the nature of Nanda was like
    that of an ill-roofed house, but now, it had grown to be like a well-roofed one. </font></p>

    Cunda was a pork-butcher for over fifty-five years; all this time he had not done a single

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once there lived in Savatthi, a lay disciple by the name
    of Dhammika, who was virtuous and very fond of giving in charity. He generously offered
    food and other requisites to the bhikkhus regularly and also on special occasions. He was,
    in fact, the leader of five hundred virtuous lay disciples of the Buddha who lived in
    Savatthi. Dhammika had seven sons and seven daughters and all of them, like their father,
    were virtuous and devoted to charity. When Dhammika was very ill and was on his death-bed
    he made a request to the Samgha to come to him and recite the sacred texts by his bedside.
    While the bhikkhus were reciting the Maha satipatthana Sutta, six decorated chariots from
    six celestial worlds arrived to invite him to their respective worlds. Dhammika told them
    to wait for a while for fear of interrupting the recitation of the Sutta. The bhikkhus,
    thinking that they were being asked to stop, stopped and left the place.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A little while later, Dhammika told his children about the
    six decorated chariots waiting for him. Then and there he decided to choose the chariot

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Devadatta was at one time residing with the Buddha in
    Kosambi. While staying there he realized that the Buddha was receiving much respect and
    honour as well as offerings. He envied the Buddha and aspired to head the Order of the
    bhikkhus. One day, while the Buddha was preaching at the Veluvana monastery in Rajagaha,
    he approached the Buddha and on the ground that the Buddha was getting old, he suggested
    that the Order be entrusted to his care. The Buddha rejected his offer and rebuked him,
    saying that he was a swallower of other people's spittle. The Buddha next asked the Samgha
    to carry out an act of proclamation (Pakasaniya kamma*) regarding Devadatta. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Devadatta felt aggrieved and vowed vengeance against the
    Buddha. Three times, he attempted to kill the Buddha: first, by employing some archers;
    secondly, by climbing up the Gijjhakuta hill and rolling down a big piece of rock on to
    the Buddha; and thirdly, by causing the elephant Nalagiri to attack the Buddha. The hired
    assassins returned after being established in Sotapatti Fruition, without harming the
    Buddha. The big piece of rock rolled down by Devadatta hurt the big toe of the Buddha just
    a little, and when the Nalagiri elephant rushed at the Buddha, it was made docile by the
    Buddha. Thus Devadatta failed to kill the Buddha, and he tried another tactic. He tried to
    break up the Order of the bhikkhus by taking away some newly admitted bhikkhus with him to
    Gayasisa; however, most of them were brought back by Thera Sariputta and Thera Maha
    Moggallana. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Later, Devadatta fell ill. He had been ill for nine months
    when he asked his pupils to take him to the Buddha, and subsequently made the trip to the
    Jetavana monastery. Hearing that Devadatta was coming, the Buddha told his disciples that
    Devadatta would never get the opportunity to see him. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Devadatta and his party reached the pond in the
    Jetavana monastery compound the carriers put down the couch on the bank of the pond and
    went to take a bath. Devadatta also rose from his couch and placed both his feet on the
    ground. Immediately, his feet sank into the earth and he was gradually swallowed up,
    Devadatta did not have the opportunity to see the Buddha because of the wicked deeds he
    had done to the Buddha. After his death, he was reborn in Avici Niraya, a place of intense

    delirious and not in her right senses at the time of her death. So, he approached the
    Buddha and reported to him about his daughter, Sumanadevi. Then the Buddha told the noble
    rich man that his daughter was in her right senses and fully self-possessed at the time of
    her passing away. The Buddha also explained that Sumanadevi had addressed her father as
    &quot;younger brother&quot; because her attainment of Magga and Phala was higher than that
    of her father's. She was a Sakadagam whereas her father was only a Sotapanna.

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verses (19) and (20) of this book, with reference to two bhikkhus who were
    friends.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once there were two friends of noble family, two bhikkhus
    from Savatthi. One of then learned the Tipitaka and was very proficient in reciting and
    preaching the sacred texts. He taught five hundred bhikkhus and became the instructor of
    eighteen groups of bhikkhus. The other bhikkhu striving diligently and ardently in the
    course of Insight Meditation attained arahatship together with Analytical Insight. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On one occasion, when the second bhikkhu came to pay
    homage to the Buddha, at the Jetavana monastery, the two bhikkhus met, The master of the
    Tipitaka did not realize that the other had already become an arahat. He looked down on
    the other, thinking that this old bhikkhu knew very little of the sacred texts, not even
    one out of the five Nikayas or one out of the three Pitakas. So he thought of putting
    questions to the other, and thus embarass him. The Buddha knew about his unkind intention
    and he also knew that as a result of giving trouble to such a noble disciple of his, the
    learned bhikkhu would be reborn in a lower world.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, out of compassion, the Buddha visited the two bhikkhus
    to prevent the scholar from questioning the other bhikkhu. The Buddha himself did the
    questioning. He put questions on jhanas and maggas to the master of the Tipitaka; but he
    could not answer them because he had not practised what he had taught. The other bhikkhu,
    having practised the Dhamma and having attained arahatship, could answer all the
    questions. The Buddha praised the one who practised the Dhamma (i.e., a vipassaka), but
    not a single word of praise was spoken for the learned scholar(i.e., a ganthika). </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The resident disciples could not understand why the Buddha
    had words of praise for the old bhikkhu and not for their learned teacher. So, the Buddha
    explained the matter to them. The scholar who knows a great deal but does not practise in
    accordance with the Dhamma is like a cowherd, who looks after the cows for wages, while
    the one who practises in accordance with the Dhamrna is like the owner who enjoys the five
    kinds of produce of the cows.* Thus, the scholar enjoys only the services rendered to him
    by his pupils but not the benefits of Magga-phala. The other bhikkhu, though he knows
    little and recites only a little of the sacred texts, having clearly comprehended the
    essence of the Dhamma and having practised diligently and strenuously, is an
    'anudhammacari'**, who has eradicated passion, ill will and ignorance. His mind being
    totally freed from moral delilements and from all attachments to this world as well as to

    mother and teacher to Samavati. She listened to the discourses of the Buddha and repeated
    them to Samavati and her maids. In course of time, Khujjuttara mastered the Tipitaka.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Samavati and her maids wished very much to see the Buddha
    and pay obeisance to him; but they were afraid the king might be displeased with them. So,
    making holes in the walls of their palace, they looked through them and paid obeisance to
    the Buddha everyday as he was going to the houses of the three rich men, namely, Ghosaka,
    Kukkuta and Pavariya.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At that time, King Udena had also another chief queen by
    the name of Magandiya. She was the daughter of Magandiya, a brahmin. The brahmin seeing
    the Buddha one day thought the Buddha was the only person who was worthy of his very
    beautiful daughter. So, he hurriedly went off to fetch his wife and daughter and offered
    to give his daughter in marriage to the Buddha. Turning down his offer, the Buddha said,
    &quot;Even after seeing Tanha, Arati and Raga, the daughters of Mara, I felt no desire in
    me for sensual pleasures; after all, what is this which is full of urine and filth and
    which I don't like to touch even with my foot.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On hearing those words of the Buddha, both the brahmin and
    his wife attained Anagami Magga and Phala. They entrusted their daughter to the care of
    her uncle and themselves joined the Order. Eventually, they attained arahatship. The
    Buddha knew from the beginning that the brahmin and his wife were destined to attain
    Anagami Fruition that very day, hence his reply to the brahmin in the above manner.
    However, the daughter Magandiya became very bitter and sore and she vowed to take revenge
    if and when an opportunity arose.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Later, her uncle presented Magandiya to King Udena and she
    became one of his chief queens. Magandiya came to learn about the arrival of the Buddha in
    Kosambi and about how Samavati and her maids paid obeisance to him through holes in the
    walls of their living quarters. So, she planned to take her revenge on the Buddha and to
    harm Samavati and her maids who were ardent devotees of the Buddha. Magandiya told the
    king that Samavati and her maids had made holes in the walls of their living quarters and
    that they had outside contacts and were disloyal to the king. King Udena saw the holes in
    the walls, but when the truth was told he did not get angry.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">But Magandiya kept on trying to make the king believe
    Samavati was not loyal to him and was trying to kill him. On one occasion, knowing that
    the king would be visiting Samavati within the next few days and that he would be taking
    along his lute with him, Magandiya inserted a snake into the lute and closed the hole with
    a bunch of flowers. Magandiya followed King Udena to Samavati's quarters after trying to
    stop him on the pretext that she had some presentiment and felt worried about his safety.
    At Samavati's place Magandiya removed the bunch of flowers from the hole of the lute. The
    snake came out hissing and coiled itself on the bed. When the king saw the snake he
    believed Magandiya's words that Samavati was trying to kill him. The king was furious. He
    commanded Samavati to stand and all her ladies to line up behind her. Then he fitted his
    bow with an arrow dipped in poison and shot the arrow. But Samavati and her ladies bore no
    ill wills towards the king and through the power of goodwill (metta), the arrow turned
    back, although an arrow shot by the king usually went even through a rock. Then, the king
    realized the innocence of Samavati and he gave her permission to invite the Buddha and his
    disciples to the palace for alms-food and for delivering discourses.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Magandiya realizing that none of her plans had
    materialized, made a final, infallible plan. She sent a message to her uncle with full
    instructions to go to Samavati's place and burn down the building with all the women
    inside. As the house was burning, Samavati and her maids-of-honour, numbering five
    hundred, kept on meditating. Thus, some of them attained Sakadagami Fruition, and the rest
    attained Anagami Fruition.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the news of the fire spread, the king rushed to the
    scene, but it was too late. He suspected that it was done at the instigation of Magandiya
    but he did not show that he was suspicious. Instead, he said, &quot;While Samavati was
    alive I had been fearful and alert thinking I might be harmed by her; only now, my mind is
    at peace. Who could have done this? It must have been done only by someone who loves me
    very dearly.&quot; Hearing this, Magandiya promptly admitted that it was she who had
    instructed her uncle to do it. Whereupon. the king pretended to be very pleased with her
    and said that he would do her a great favour, and honour all her relatives. So, the
    relatives were sent for and they came gladly. On arrival at the palace, all of them,
    including Magandiya, were seized and burnt in the palace court yard, by the order of the
    king. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the Buddha was told about these two incidents, he

    The Story of <a NAME="Kumbhaghosaka">Kumbhaghosaka</a>, the Banker</b></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Veluvana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (24) of this book, with reference to Kumbhaghosaka, the banker.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At one time, a plague epidemic broke out in the city of
    Rajagaha. In the house of the city banker, the servants died on account of this disease;
    the banker and his wife were also attacked by the same. When they were both down with the
    disease they told their young son Kumbhaghosaka to leave them and flee from the house and
    to return only after a long time. They also told him that at such and such a place they
    had buried a treasure worth forty crores. The son left the city and stayed in a forest for
    twelve years and then came back to the city.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">By that time, he was quite a grown up youth and nobody in
    the city recognized him. He went to the place where the treasure was hidden and found it
    was quite intact. But he reasoned and realized that there was no one who could identify
    him and that if he were to unearth the buried treasure and make use of it people might
    think a young poor man had accidentally come upon buried treasure and they might report it
    to the king. In that case, his property would be confiscated and he himself might be
    manhandled or put in captivity. So he concluded it was not yet time to unearth the
    treasure and that meanwhile he must find work for his living. Dressed in old clothes
    Kumbhaghosaka looked for work. He was given the work of waking up and rousing the people
    to get up early in the morning and of going round announcing that it was time to prepare
    food, time to fetch carts and yoke the bullocks, etc.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One morning, King Bimbisara heard him. The king who was a
    keen judge of voices commented, &quot;This is the voice of a man of great wealth.&quot; A
    maid, hearing the king's remark, sent someone to investigate. He reported that the youth
    was only a hireling of the labourers. In spite of this report the king repeated the same
    remark on two subsequent days. Again, enquiries were made but with the same result. The
    maid thought that this was very strange, so she asked the king to give her permission to
    go and personally investigate.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Disguised as rustics, the maid and her daughter set out to
    the place of the labourers. Saying that they were travellers, they asked for shelter and
    was given accommodation in the house of Kumbhaghosaka just for one night. However, they
    managed to prolong their stay there. During that period, twice the king proclaimed that a
    certain ceremony must be performed in the locality of the labourers, and that every
    household must make contributions. Kumbhaghosaka had no ready cash for such an occasion.
    So he was forced to get some coins (Kahapanas) from his treasure, As these coins were
    handed over to the maid, she substituted them with her money and sent the coins to the
    king. After some time, she sent a message to the king asking him to send some men and
    summon Kumbhaghosaka to the court. Kumbhaghosaka, very reluctantly, went along with the
    men. The maid and her daughter also went to the palace, ahead of them. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the palace, the king told Kumbhaghosaka to speak out
    the truth and gave him assurance that he would not be harmed on this account.
    Kumbhaghosaka then admitted that those Kahapanas were his and also that he was the son of
    the city banker of Rajagaha, who died in the plague epidemic twelve years ago. He further
    revealed the place where the treasure was hidden. Subsequently, all the buried treasure
    was brought to the palace; the king made him a banker and gave his daughter in marriage to
    him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Afterwards, taking Kumbhaghosaka along with him, the king
    went to the Buddha at the Veluvana monastery and told him how the youth, though rich, was
    earning his living as a hireling of the labourers, and how he had appointed the youth a

    The Story of<a NAME="Culapanthaka"> Culapanthaka</a></b></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Veluvana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (25) of this book, with reference to Culapanthaka, a grandson of a banker of
    Rajagaha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The banker had two grandsons, named Mahapanthaka and
    Culapanthaka. Mahapanthaka, being the elder, used to accompany his grandfather to listen
    to religious discourses. Later, Mahapanthaka joined the Buddhist religious Order and in
    course of time became an arahat. Culapanthaka followed his brother and became a bhikkhu.
    But, because in a previous existence in the time of Kassapa Buddha Culapanthaka had made
    fun of a bhikkhu who was very dull, he was born a dullard in the present existence. He
    could not even memorize one verse in four months. Mahapanthaka was very disappointed with
    his younger brother and even told him that he was not worthy of the Order. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">About that time, Jivaka came to the monastery to invite
    the Buddha and the resident bhikkhus to his house for a meal. Mahapanthaka, who was then
    in charge of assigning the bhikkhus to meal invitations, left out Culapanthaka from the
    list. When Culapanthaka learnt about this he felt very much frustrated and decided that he
    would return to the life of a householder. Knowing his intention, the Buddha took him
    along and made him sit in front of the Gandhakuti hall. He then gave a clean piece of
    cloth to Culapanthaka and told him to sit there facing east and rub the piece of cloth. At
    the same time he was to repeat the word &quot;Rajoharanam&quot;, which means &quot;taking
    on impurity.&quot; The Buddha then went to the residence of Jivaka, accompanied by the
    bhikkhus.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Meanwhile, Culapanthaka went on rubbing the piece of
    cloth, all the time muttering the word &quot;Rajoharanam&quot;. Very soon, the cloth
    became soiled. Seeing this change in the condition of the cloth, Culapanthaka came to
    realize the impermanent nature of all conditioned things. From the house of Jivaka, the
    Buddha through super normal power learnt about the progress of Culapanthaka. He sent forth
    his radiance so that (to Culapanthaka) the Buddha appeared to be sitting in front of him,
    saying:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;It is not the piece of cloth alone that is made
    dirty by the dust; within oneself also there exist the dust of passion (raga), the dust of
    ill will (dosa), and the dust of ignorance (moha), i.e., the ignorance of the Four Noble
    Truths. Only by removing these could one achieve one's goal and attain arahatship&quot;.
    Culapanthaka got the message and kept on meditating and in a short while attained
    arahatship, together with Analytical Insight. Thus, Culapanthaka ceased to be a dullard.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the house of Jivaka, they were about to pour libation
    water as a mark of donation; but the Buddha covered the bowl with his hand and asked if
    there were any bhikkhus left at the monastery. On being answered that there were none, the
    Buddha replied that there was one and directed them to fetch Culapanthaka from the
    monastery. When the messenger from the house of Jivaka arrived at the monastery he found
    not only one bhikkhu, but a thousand identical bhikkhus. They all have been created by
    Culapanthaka, who by now possessed supernormal powers The messenger was baffled and he
    turned back and reported the matter to Jivaka. The messenger was sent to the monastery for
    the second time and was instructed to say that the Buddha summoned the bhikkhu by the name
    of Culapanthaka. But when he delivered the message, a thousand voices responded, &quot;I
    am Culapanthaka.&quot; Again baffled, he turned back for the second time. Then he was sent
    to the monastery, for the third time. This time, he was instructed to get hold of the
    bhikkhu who first said that he was Culapanthaka. As soon as he got hold of that bhikkhu
    all the rest disappeared, and Culapanthaka accompanied the messenger to the house of
    Jivaka. After the meal, as directed by the Buddha, Culapanthaka delivered a religious
    discourse confidently and bravely, roaring like a young lion.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Later, when the subject of Culapanthaka cropped up among
    the bhikkhus, the Buddha said that one who was diligent and steadfast in his striving
    would certainly attain arahatship.</font></p>

    the Buddha, went to a monastery in the forest. One of them, being negligent, spent his
    time warming himself by the fire and talking to young novices throughout the first watch
    of the night, and generally idling away his time. The other faithfully performed the

    had been idling away his time, just lying down and sleeping. The Buddha then asked,
    &quot;But, what about you?&quot; His reply was that he generally sat warming himself by
    the fire during the first watch of the night and then sat up without sleeping. But the

    The Story of a <a NAME="Certain">Certain Bhikkhu</a></b></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (31) of this book, with reference to a certain bhikkhu.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">A certain bhikkhu, after obtaining a subject of meditation
    from the Buddha, went to the forest to meditate. Although he tried hard he made very
    little progress in his meditation practice. As a result, he became very depressed and
    frustrated. So, with the thought of getting further specific instructions from the Buddha,
    he set out for the Jetavana monastery. On his way, he came across a big blazing fire. He
    ran up to the top of a mountain and observed the fire from there. As the fire spread, it
    suddenly occurred to him that just as the fire burnt up everything, so also Magga Insight
    will burn up all fetters of life, big and small.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Meanwhile, from the Gandhakuti hall in the Jetavana
    monastery, the Buddha was aware of what the bhikkhu was thinking. So, he transmitted his
    radiance and appeared to the bhikkhu and spoke to him. &quot;My son,&quot; he said,
    &quot;you are on the right line of thought; keep it up. All beings must burn up all
    fetters of life with Magga Insight.&quot;</font></p>

    Story of Thera<a NAME="Nigamavasitissa"> Nigamavasitissa</a></b></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (32) of this book, with reference to Thera Nigamavasitissa.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nigamavasitissa was born and brought up in a small market
    town near Savatthi. After becoming a bhikkhu he lived a very simple life, with very few
    wants. For alms-food, he used to go to the village where his relatives were staying and
    took whatever was offered to him. He kept away from big occasions. Even when Anathapindika
    and King Pasenadi of Kosala made offerings on a grand scale, the thera did not go.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some bhikkhus then started talking about the thera that he
    kept close to his relatives and that he did not care to go even when people like
    Anathapindika and King Pasenadi were making offerings on a grand scale, etc. When the
    Buddha was told about this, he sent for the thera and asked him. The thera respectfully
    explained the Buddha that it was true he frequently went to his village, but it was only
    to get alms-food, that when he had received enough food, he did not go any further, and
    that he never cared whether the food was delicious or not. Whereupon, instead of blaming
    him, the Buddha praised him for his conduct in the presence of the other bhikkhus. He also
    told them that to live contentedly with only a few wants is in conformity with the
    practice of the Buddha and the Noble Ones (Ariyas), and that all bhikkhus should, indeed,
    be like Thera Tissa from the small market town. In this connection, he further related the
    story of the king of the parrots.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once upon a time, the king of the parrots lived in a grove
    of fig trees on the banks of the Ganges river, with a large number of his followers. When
    the fruits were eaten, all the parrots left the grove, except the parrot king, who was
    well contented with whatever was left in the tree where he dwelt, be it shoot or leaf or
    bark. Sakka, knowing this and wanting to test the virtue of the parrot king, withered up
    the tree by his supernormal power. Then, assuming the form of geese, Sakka and his queen,
    Sujata, came to where the parrot king was and asked him why he did not leave the old
    withered tree as the others had done and why he did not go to other trees which were still
    bearing fruits. The parrot king replied, &quot;Because of a feeling of gratitude towards
    the tree I did not leave and as long as I could get just enough food to sustain myself I
    shall not forsake it. It would be ungrateful for me to desert this tree even though it be
    inanimate.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Much impressed by this reply, Sakka revealed himself. He
    took water from the Ganges and poured it over the withered fig tree and instantly, it was
    rejuvenated; it stood with branches lush and green, and fully decked with fruits. Thus,
    the wise even as animals are not greedy; they are contented with whatever is available.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The parrot king in the story was the Buddha himself; Sakka
    was Anuruddha.</font></p>
