    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since the day Kondadhana was admitted to the Order, the
    image of a female was always following him. This image was seen by others, but Kondadhana
    himself did not see it and so did not know about it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When he was out on an alms-round, people would offer two
    spoonfuls to him, saying, &quot;This is for you, Venerable Sir, and this is for your
    female companion.&quot; Seeing the bhikkhu going about with a woman, people went to King
    Pasenadi of Kosala and reported about the bhikkhu and the woman. They said to the king,
    &quot;O king! Drive out the bhikkhu, who is lacking in moral virtues, from your
    kingdom.&quot; So the king went to the monastery where that bhikkhu was staying and
    surrounded it with his men. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hearing noises and voices, the bhikkhus came out and stood
    at the door, and the image also was there not far from the bhikkhu. Knowing that the king
    had come, the bhikkhu went into the room to wait for him. When the king entered the room,
    the image was not there. The king asked the bhikkhu where the woman was and he replied
    that he saw no woman. The king wanted to make sure and he asked the bhikkhu to leave the
    room for a while. The bhikkhu left the room, but when the king looked out, again he saw
    the woman near the bhikkhu. But when the bhikkhu came back to the room the woman was
    nowhere to be found. The king concluded that the woman was not real and so the bhikkhu
    must be innocent. He therefore invited the bhikkhu to come to the palace every day for
    alms-food. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">When other bhikkhus heard about this, they were puzzled
    and said to the bhikkhu, &quot;O bhikkhu with no morals! Now that the king, instead of
    driving you out of his kingdom, has invited you for alms-food, you are doomed!&quot; The
    bhikkhu on his part retorted, &quot;Only you are the ones without morals; only you are
    doomed because you are the ones who go about with women!&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The bhikkhus then reported the matter to the Buddha. The
    Buddha sent for Kodadadhana and said to him, <i>&quot;My son, did you see any woman with
    the other bhikkhus that you have talked to them thus? You have not seen any woman with
    them as they have seen one with you. I see that you do not realize that you have been
    cursed on account of an evil deed done by you in a past existence. Now listen, I shall
    explain to you why you have an image of a woman following you about.</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;You were a deva in your last existence. During
    that time, there were two bhikkhus who were very much attached to each other. But you
    tried to create trouble between the two, by assuming the appearance of a woman and
    following one of the bhikkhus. For that evil deed you are now being followed by the image
    of a woman So, my son, in future do not argue with other bhikkhus any more; keep silent
    like a gong with the rim broken off and you will realize Nibbana.&quot; </i></font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, five hundred ladies from Savatthi came to the
    Pubbarama monastery to keep the Uposatha Sila vows. The donor of the monastery, the
    well-renowned Visakha, asked different age groups of ladies why they had come to keep the
    sabbath. She got different answers from different age groups for they had come to the
    monastery for different reasons. The old ladies came to the monastery to keep the sabbath
    because they hoped to gain the riches and glories of the devas in their next existence;
    the middle-aged ladies had come to the monastery because they did not want to stay under
    the same roof with the mistresses of their respective husbands. The young married ladies
    had come because they wanted their first born to be a son, and the young unmarried ladies
    had come because they wanted to get married to good husbands.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having had these answers, Visakha took all the ladies to
    the Buddha. When she told the Buddha about the various answers of the different age groups
    of ladies, the Buddha said, <i>&quot;Visakha! birth, ageing and death are always actively
    working in beings; because one is born, one is subject to ageing and decay, and finally to

    body burning in flames. The Buddha also said he himself had also seen that very peta soon
    after he had attained Buddhahood, but that he did not say anything about it because people
    might not believe him and thus they would be doing a great wrong to the Buddha. So out of
    compassion for these beings, the Buddha had kept silent. Then he continued, <i>&quot;Now
    that I have a witness in Moggallana, I will tell you about this boa constrictor peta. This
    peta was a thief during the time of Kassapa Buddha. As a thief and a cruel-hearted man, he
    had set fire to the house of a rich man seven times. And not satisfied with that, he also
    set fire to the perfumed hall donated by the same rich man to Kassapa Buddha, while
    Kassapa Buddha was out on an alms-round. As a result of those evil deeds he had suffered
    for a long time in niraya. Now, while serving out his term of suffering as a peta, he is

    Moggallana.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, the Nigantha ascetics planned to kill Thera Maha
    Moggallana because they thought that by doing away with Thera Maha Moggallana the fame and
    fortune of the Buddha would also be diminished. So they hired some assassins to kill Thera
    Maha Moggallana who was staying at Kalasila near Rajagaha at that time. The assassins
    surrounded the monastery; but Thera Maha Moggallana, with his supernormal power, got away
    first through a key hole, and for the second time through the roof. Thus, they could not
    get hold of the Thera for two whole months. When the assassins again surrounded the
    monastery during the third month, Thera Maha Moggallana, recollecting that he had yet to
    pay for the evil deeds done by him during one of his past existences, did not exercise his
    supernormal power. So he was caught and the assassins beat him up until all his bones were
    utterly broken. After that, they left his body in a bush, thinking that he had passed
    away. But the Thera, through his jhanic power, revived himself and went to see the Buddha
    at the Jetavana monastery. When he informed the Buddha that he would soon realize
    parinibbana at Kalasila, near Rajagaha, the Buddha told him to go only after expounding
    the Dhamma to the congregation of bhikkhus, as that would be the last time they would see
    him. So, Thera Maha Moggallana expounded the Dhamma and left after paying obeisance seven
    times to the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The news of the passing away of Thera Maha Moggallana at
    the hands of assassins spread like wild fire. King Ajatasattu ordered his men to
    investigate and get hold of the culprits. The assassins were caught and they were burnt to
    death. The bhikkhus felt very sorrowful over the death of Thera Maha Moggallana, and could
    not understand why such a personage like Thera Maha Moggallana should die at the hands of
    assassins. To them the Buddha said, <i>&quot;Bhikkhus! Considering that Moggallana had
    lived a noble life in this existence, he should not have met with such a death. But in one
    of his past existences, he had done a great wrong to his own parents, who were both blind.
    In the beginning, he was a very dutiful son, but after his marriage, his wife began to
    make trouble and she suggested that he should get rid of his parents. He took his blind
    parents in a cart into a forest, and there he killed them by beating them and making them
    believe that it was some thief who was beating them. For that evil deed he suffered in
    niraya for a long time; and in this existence, his last, he has died at the hands of
    assassins. Indeed, by doing wrong to those who should not be wronged, one is sure to
    suffer for it.&quot; </i></font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once there was a rich man in Savatthi. After the death of
    his wife, he decided to become a bhikkhu. But before he entered the Order, he built a
    monastery, which included a kitchen and a store room. He also brought his own furniture,
    utensils and a large stock of rice, oil, butter and other provisions. Whatever dishes he
    wanted was cooked for him by his servants. Thus, even as a bhikkhu he was living in
    comfort, and because he had so many things with him, he was known as 'Bahubhandika.' One
    day, other bhikkhus took him to the Buddha, and in his presence told the Buddha about the
    many things he had brought along with him to the monastery, and also how he was still
    leading the luxurious life of a rich man. So, the Buddha said to Bahubhandika, <i>&quot;My
    son, I have been teaching all of you to live an austere life; why have you brought so much
    property with you ?&quot; </i>When reprimanded even this much, that bhikkhu lost his
    temper and said angrily, &quot;Indeed, Venerable Sir! I will now live as you wish me
    to.&quot; So saying, he cast off his upper robe. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Seeing him thus, the Buddha said to him, <i>&quot;My son,
    in your last existence you were an ogre; even as an ogre you had a sense of shame and a
    sense of fear to do evil. Now that you are a bhikkhu in my Teaching, why do you have to
    throw away the sense of shame, and the sense of fear to do evil?&quot;</i> When he heard
    those words, the bhikkhu realized his mistake; his sense of shame and fear to do evil
    returned, and he respectfully paid obeisance to the Buddha and asked that he should be
    pardoned. The Buddha then said to him,<i> &quot;Standing there without your upper robe is
    not proper; just discarding your robe etc., does not maker you an austere bhikkhu; a

    the riverside for a bath. On the way, he met the Buddha going on an alms-round, and being
    drunk, he just bowed casually, as a sign of respect to the Buddha. The Buddha smiled, and
    Ananda asked the Buddha why he smiled. So, the Buddha said to Ananda, <i>&quot;Ananda,
    this minister will come to see me this very day and after I have given him a short
    discourse will become an arahat. Soon after becoming an arahat he will realize
    parinibbana.&quot;</i> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Santati and his party spent the whole day at the
    riverside, bathing, eating, drinking and thus thoroughly enjoying themselves. In the
    evening the minister and his party went to the garden to have more drinks and to be
    entertained by the dancer. The dancer, on her part, tried her best to entertain the
    minister. For the whole week she was living on reduced diet to keep herself trim. While
    dancing, she suffered a severe stroke and collapsed, and at that instant she died with her
    eyes and mouth wide open. The minister was shocked and deeply distressed. In agony, he
    tried to think of a refuge and remembered the Buddha. He went to the Buddha, accompanied
    by his followers, and related to him about the grief and anguish he suffered on account of
    the sudden death of the dancer. He then said to the Buddha, <font>&quot;Venerable Sir!
    Please help me get over my sorrow; be my refuge, and let me have the peace of mind.&quot;</font>
    To him the Buddha replied, <i>&quot;Rest assured my son, you have come to one, who could
    help you, One who could be a constant solace to you and who will be your refuge. The tears
    you have shed due to the death of this dancer throughout the round of rebirths is more
    than the waters of all the oceans.&quot;</i>The Buddha then instructed the minister in
    verse. The meaning of the verse is as follows. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;In the past there has been in you clinging
    (upadana) due to craving; get rid of it. In future, do not let such clinging occur in you.
    Do not also harbour any clinging in the present; by not having any clinging, craving and
    passion will be calmed in you and you will realize Nibbana.&quot; </i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After hearing the verse, the minister attained arahatship.
    Then, realizing that his life span was at an end, he said to the Buddha, &quot;Venerable
    Sir! Let me now realize parinibbana, for my time has come.&quot; The Buddha consenting,
    Santati rose to a height of seven toddy-palms into the sky and there, while meditating on
    the element of fire (<i>tejo kasina</i>), he passed away realizing parinibbana. His body
    went up in flames, his blood and flesh burnt up and the bone relics (<i>dhatu</i>) fell
    through the sky and dropped on the clean piece of cloth which was spread by the bhikkhus
    as instructed by the Buddha. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the congregation, the bhikkhus asked the Buddha,
    &quot;Venerable Sir! The minister had realized parinibbana dressed in full regalia; is he
    a samana on a brahmana?&quot; To them, the <i>&quot;Buddha replied Bhikkhus! My son can be

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verses (143) and (144) of this book, with reference to Thera Pilotikatissa. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, Thera Ananda saw a shabbily dressed youth going
    round begging for food; he felt pity for the youth and made him a samanera. The young
    samanera left his old clothes and his begging plate on the fork of a tree. When he became
    a bhikkhu he was known as Pilotikatissa. As a bhikkhu, he did not have to worry about food
    and clothing as he was in affluent circumstances. Yet, sometimes he did not feel happy in
    his life as a bhikkhu and thought of going back to the life of a lay man. Whenever he had
    this feeling, he would go back to that tree where he had left his old clothes and his
    plate. There, at the foot of the tree, he would put this question to himself, &quot;Oh
    shameless one! Do you want to leave the place where you are fed well and dressed well? Do
    you still want to put on these shabby clothes and go begging again with this old plate in
    your hand?&quot; Thus, he would rebuke himself, and after calming down, he would go back
    to the monastery. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After two or three days, again, he felt like leaving the
    monastic life of a bhikkhu, and again, he went to the tree where he kept his old clothes
    and his plate. After asking himself the same old question and having been reminded of the
    wretchedness of his old life, he returned to the monastery. This was repeated many times.
    When other bhikkhus asked him why he often went to the tree where he kept his old clothes
    and his plate, he told them that he went to see his teacher [*]. Thus keeping his mind on
    his old clothes as the subject of meditation, he came to realize the true nature of the
    aggregates of the khandhas (i. e., anicca, dukkha, anatta), and eventually he became an
    arahat. Then, he stopped going to the tree. Other bhikkhus noticing that Pilotikatissa had
    stopped going to the tree where he kept his old clothes and his plate asked him, &quot;Why
    don't you go to your teacher any more?&quot; To them, he answered, &quot;When I had the
    need, I had to go to him; but there is no need for me to go to him now.&quot; When the
    bhikkhus heard his reply, they took him to see the Buddha. When they came to his presence
    they said, &quot;Venerable Sir! This bhikkhu claims that he has attained arahatship; he
    must be telling lies.&quot; But the Buddha refuted them, and said, &quot;Bhikkhus!
    Pilotikatissa is not telling lies, he speaks the truth. Though he had relationship with
    his teacher previously, now he has no relationship whatsoever with his teacher. Thera
    Pilotikatissa has instructed himself to differentiate right and wrong causes and to
    discern the true nature of things. He has now become an arahat, and so there is no further
    connection between him and his teacher.&quot; </font></p>

    Thera Sariputta. On the eighth day after being made a samanera he followed Thera Sariputta
    on his alms-round. While doing the round they came across some farmers irrigating their
    fields, some fletchers straightening their arrows and some carpenters making things like
    cart-wheels, etc. Seeing these, he asked Thera Sariputta whether these inanimate things
    could be guided to where one wished or be made into things one wished to make, and the
    thera answered him in the affirmative. The young samanera then pondered that if that were
    so, there could be no reason why a person could not tame his mind and practise
    Tranquillity and Insight Meditation. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, he asked permission from the thera to return to the
    monastery. There, he shut himself up in his room and practised meditation in solitude,
    Sakka and the devas also helped him in his practice by keeping the monastery very quiet.
    That same day, the eighth day after his becoming a samanera, Sukha attained arahatship. In
    connection with this, the Buddha said to the congregation of bhikkhus, <i>&quot;When a
    person earnestly practises the Dhamma, even Sakka and the devas give protection and help.

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Five hundred men from Savatthi, wishing to make their

    her constant companions. During a bacchanalian festival which lasted for seven days, the
    wives of those men took all the drinks left by their husbands and got drunk in the absence
    of Visakha. For this misbehaviour they were beaten by their husbands. On another occasion,
    saying that they wished to listen to the Buddha's discourse, they asked Visakha to take
    them to the Buddha and secretly took small bottles of liquor hidden in their clothes. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On arrival at the monastery, they drank all the liquor
    they had brought and threw away the bottles. Visakha requested the Buddha to teach them
    the Dhamma. By that time, the women were getting intoxicated and felt like singing and
    dancing. Mara, taking this opportunity made them bold and shameless, and soon they were
    boisterously singing, dancing, clapping and jumping about in the monastery. The Buddha saw
    the hand of Mara in the shameless behaviour of these women and said to himself,<i>
    &quot;Mara must not be given the opportunity.&quot;</i> So, the Buddha sent forth
    dark-blue rays from his body and the whole room was darkened; the women were frightened
    and began to get sober. Then, the Buddha vanished from his seat and stood on top of Mount
    Meru, and from there he sent forth white rays and the sky was lit up as if by a thousand
    moons. After thus manifesting his powers, the Buddha said to those five hundred women, <i>&quot;You
    ladies should not have come to my monastery in this unmindful state. Because you have been
    negligent Mara has had the opportunity to make you behave shamelessly, laughing and

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, there lived in Rajagaha, a very beautiful courtesan
    by the name of Sirima. Every day Sirima offered alms-food to eight bhikkhus. One of these
    bhikkhus happened to mention to other bhikkhus how beautiful Sirima was and also that she
    offered very delicious food to the bhikkhus every day. On hearing this, a young bhikkhu
    fell in love with Sirima even without seeing her. The next day, the young bhikkhu went
    with the other bhikkhus to the house of Sirima. Sirima was not well on that day, but since
    she wanted to pay obeisance to the bhikkhus, she was carried to their presence. The young
    bhikkhu, seeing Sirima, thought to himself, &quot;Even though she is sick, she is very
    beautiful !&quot; And he felt a strong desire for her.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">That very night, Sirima died. King Bimbisara went to the
    Buddha and reported to him that Sirima, the sister of Jivaka, had died. The Buddha told
    King Bimbisara to take the dead body to the cemetery and keep it there for three days
    without burying it, but to have it protected from crows and vultures. The king did as he
    was told. On the fourth day, the dead body of the beautiful Sirima was no longer beautiful
    or desirable; it got bloated and maggots came out from the nine orifices. On that day, the
    Buddha took his bhikkhus to the cemetery to observe the body of Sirima. The king also came
    with his men. The young bhikkhu, who was so desperately in love with Sirima, did not know
    that Sirima had died. When he learnt that the Buddha and the bhikkhus were going to see
    Sirima, he joined them. At the cemetery, the corpse of Sirima was surrounded by the
    bhikkhus headed by the Buddha, and also by the king and his men. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha then asked the king to get a town crier
    announce that Sirima would be available on payment of one thousand in cash per night. But
    no body would take her for one thousand, or for five hundred, or for two hundred and
    fifty, or even if she were to be given free of charge. Then the Buddha said to the
    audience, <i>&quot;Bhikkhus! Look at Sirima. When she was living, there were many who were
    willing to give one thousand to spend one night with her; but now none would take her even
    if given without any payment. The body of a person is subject to deterioration and

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rupananda had heard from others that the Buddha often
    taught about the impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and insubstantiality of the khandhas. So
    she thought he would talk deprecatingly about her good looks if he should see her; and
    thus thinking, she kept away from the Buddha. But other bhikkhunis coming back from the
    monastery, kept talking in praise of the Buddha; so, one day, she decided to accompany
    other bhikkhunis to the monastery.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha saw her and reflected, <i>&quot;A thorn can

    sixteen years of age to be seated near him, fanning him. This young girl was visible only
    to Rupananda and the Buddha. When Rupananda saw the girl, she realized that compared to
    that girl, she herself was just like an old, ugly crow compared to a beautiful white swan.
    Rupananda had a good lock at the girl and she felt that she liked her very much. Then, she
    looked again and was surprised to find that the girl had grown to the age of about twenty.
    Again and again, she looked at the figure beside the Buddha and every time she noticed
    that the girl had grown older and older. Thus, the girl turned into a grown-up lady, then
    into a middle-aged lady, an old lady, a decrepit and a very old lady successively.
    Rupananda also noticed that with the arising of a new image, the old image disappeared,
    and she came to realize that there was a continuous process of change and decay in the
    body. With the coming of this realization, her attachment to the body diminished.
    Meanwhile, the figure near the Buddha had turned into an old, decrepit lady, who could no
    longer control her bodily functions, and was rolling in her own excreta. Finally, she
    died, her body got bloated, pus and maggots came out of the nine openings and crows and
    vultures were trying to snatch at the dead body.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Having seen all these, Rupananda pondered, <font>&quot;This
    young girl has grown old and decrepit and died in this very place under my own eyes. In
    the same way, my body will also grow old and wear out; it will be subject to disease and I
    will also die.&quot;</font> Thus, she came to perceive the true nature of the khandhas. At
    this point, the Buddha talked about the impermanence, the unsatisfactoriness and the
    insubstantiality of the khandhas, and Rupananda attained Sotapatti Fruition.</font></p>

    Story of Queen<a NAME="mallika"> Mallika</a></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (151) of this book, with reference to Mallika, queen of King Pasenadi of
    Kosala.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day, Mallika went into the bathroom to wash her face,
    hands and feet. Her pet dog also came in; as she was bending to wash her feet, the dog
    tried to have sex with her, and the queen appeared to be amused and somewhat pleased. The
    king saw this strange incident through the window from his bedroom. When the queen came
    in, he said angrily to the queen,<font> &quot;Oh, you wicked woman! What were you doing
    with that dog in the bathroom? Do not deny what I saw with my own eyes.&quot;</font> The
    queen replied that she was only washing her face, her hands and her feet, and so was doing
    nothing wrong. Then she continued, <font><i>&quot;But, that room is very strange. If
    anyone went into that room, to one looking from this window there would appear to be two.
    If you do not believe me, O King, please go into that room and I will look through this
    window.&quot;</i></font></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">So, the king went into the bathroom. When he came out,
    Mallika asked the king why he misbehaved with a she-goat in that room. The king denied it,
    but the queen insisted that she saw them with her own eyes. The king was puzzled, but
    being dim-witted, he accepted the queen's explanation, and concluded that the bath room
    was, indeed, very strange.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From that time, the queen was full of remorse for having
    lied to the king and for having brazenly accused him of misbehaving with a she-goat. Thus,
    even when she was approaching death, she forgot to think about the great unrivalled
    charities she had shared with her husband and only remembered that she had been unfair to
    him. As a result of this, when she died she was reborn in niraya. After her burial, the
    king intended to ask the Buddha where she was reborn. The Buddha wished to spare his
    feelings, and also did not want him to lose faith in the Dhamma. So he willed that this
    question should not he put to him, and King Pasenadi forgot to ask the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, after seven days in niraya, the queen was reborn
    in the <i>Tusita</i> deva world. On that day, the Buddha went to King Pasenadi's palace
    for alms-food; he indicated that he wished to rest in the coach-shed where the royal
    carriages were kept. After offering alms-food, the king asked the Buddha where queen
    Mallika was reborn and the Buddha replied, <i>&quot;Mallika has been reborn in the Tusita
    deva world.&quot; </i>Hearing this the king was very pleased, and said, <font>'Where else
    could she have been reborn? She was always thinking of doing good deeds, always thinking
    what to offer to the Buddha on the next day. Venerable Sir! Now that she is gone, I, your
    humble disciple, hardly know what to do.&quot;</font> To him the Buddha said, <i>&quot;Look
    at these carriages of your father and your grandfather; these are all worn down and lying
    useless; so also is your body, which is subject to death and decay. Only the Dhamma of the
    Virtuous is not subject to decay.&quot; </i></font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These two verses are expressions of intense and sublime
    joy felt by the Buddha at the moment of attainment of Supreme Enlightenment (<i>Bodhi nana
    or Sabbannuta nana</i>). These verses were repeated at the Jetavana monastery at the
    request of the Venerable Ananda.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Prince Siddhattha, of the family of Gotama, son of King
    Suddhodana and Queen Maya of the kingdom of the Sakyans, renounced the world at the age of
    twenty-nine and became an ascetic in search of the Dhamma (Truth). For six years, he
    wandered about the valley of the Ganges, approaching famous religious leaders, studying
    their doctrines and methods. He lived austerely and submitted himself strictly to rigorous
    ascetic discipline; but he found all these traditional practices to be unsound. He was
    determined to find the Truth in his own way, and by avoiding the two extremes of excessive
    sensual indulgence and self-mortification [*], he found the Middle Pathwhich would lead to
    Perfect Peace, Nibbana. This Middle Path (<i>Majjhimapatipada</i>) is the Noble Path of
    Eight Constituents, viz., Right view, Right thought, Right speech, Right action, Right
    livelihood, Right effort, Right mindfulness and Right concentration.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, one evening, seated under a Bo tree on the bank of
    the Neranjara river, Prince Siddhattha Gotama attained Supreme Enlightenment (<i>Bodhi
    nana</i> or <i>Sabbannuta nana</i>) at the age of thirty-five. During the first watch of
    the night, the prince attained the power of recollection of past existences (<i>Pubbenivasanussati-nana</i>)
    and during the second watch he attained the divine power of sight (<i>Dibbacakkhu nana</i>).
    Then, during the third watch of the night he contemplated the Doctrine of Dependent
    Origination (<i>Paticcasamuppada</i>) in the order of arising (<i>anuloma</i>) as well as
    in the order of cessation (<i>patiloma</i>). At the crack of dawn, Prince Siddhattha
    Gotama by his own intellect and insight fully and completely comprehended the Four Noble
    Truths. The Four Noble Truths are: The Noble Truth of Dukkha (<i>Dukkha Ariya Sacca</i>),
    the Noble Truth of the Cause of Dukkha (<i>Dukkha Samudaya Ariya Sacca</i>), the Noble
    Truth of the Cessation of Dukkha (<i>Dukkha Nirodha Ariya Sacca</i>), and The Noble Truth
    of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Dukkha (<i>Dukkha Nirodha Gamini Patipada Ariya
    Sacca</i>). There also appeared in him, in all their purity. The knowledge of the nature
    of each Noble Truth (<i>Sacca nana</i>), knowledge of the performance required for each
    Noble Truth (<i>Kicca nana</i>), and the knowledge of the completion of the performance
    required for each Noble Truth (<i>Kata nana</i>); and thus, he attained the <i>Sabbannuta
    nana </i>(also called <i>Bodhi nana</i>) of a Buddha. From that time, he was known as
    Gotama the Buddha.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In this connection, it should be noted that only when the
    Four Noble Truths, under their three aspects (therefore, the twelve modes), had become
    perfectly clear to him that the Buddha acknowledged in the world of Men, the world of
    Devas and that of Brahmas that he had attained the Supreme Enlightenment and therefore had
    become a Buddha.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Times New Roman">At the moment of the attainment of

    from Baranasi.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The son of Mahadhana did not study while he was young;
    when he came of age he married the daughter of a rich man, who, like him, also had no
    education. When the parents on both sides died, they inherited eighty crores from each
    side and so were very rich. But both of them were ignorant and knew only how to spend
    money and not how to keep it or to make it grow. They just ate and drank and had a good
    time, squandering their money. When they had spent all, they sold their fields and gardens
    and finally their house. Thus, they became very poor and helpless; and because they did
    not know how to earn a living they had to go begging. One day, the Buddha saw the rich
    man's son leaning against a wall of the monastery, taking the leftovers given him by the
    samaneras; seeing him, the Buddha smiled.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Venerable Ananda asked the Buddha why he smiled, and
    the Buddha replied, <i>&quot;Ananda, look at this son of a very rich man; he had lived a
    useless life, an aimless life of pleasure. If he had learnt to look after his riches in
    the first stage of his life he would have been a top-ranking rich man; or if he had become
    a bhikkhu, he could have been an arahat, and his wife could have been an anagami. If he
    had learnt to lock after his riches in the second stage of his life he would have been a
    second rank rich man, or if he had become a bhikkhu he could have been an anagami, and his
    wife could have been a sakadagami. If he had learnt to look after his riches in the third
    stage of his life he would have been a third rank rich man, or if he had become a bhikkhu
    he could have been a sakadagami, and his wife could have been a sotapanna. However,

    Verse (157) of this book, with reference to Prince Bodhi (Bodhirajakumara).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, Prince Bodhi built a magnificent palace for himself.
    When the palace was finished he invited the Buddha for alms-food. For this special
    occasion, he had the building decorated and perfumed with four kinds of scents and
    incense. Also, a long length of cloth was spread on the floor, starting from the threshold
    to the interior of the room. Then, because he had no children, the prince made a solemn
    asseveration that if he were to have any children the Buddha should step on the cloth.
    When the Buddha came, Prince Bodhi respectfully requested the Buddha three times to enter
    the room. But the Buddha, instead of moving, only looked at Ananda. Ananda understood him
    and so asked Prince Bodhi to remove the cloth from the door-step. Then only, the Buddha
    entered the palace. The prince then offered delicious and choice food to the Buddha. After
    the meal, the prince asked the Buddha why he did not step on the cloth. The Buddha in turn
    asked the prince whether he had not spread the cloth making a solemn asseveration that if
    he were to be blessed with a child, the Buddha would step on it; and the prince replied in
    the affirmative. To him, the Buddha said that he and his wife were not going to have any
    children because of their past evil deeds. The Buddha then related their past story. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">In one of their past existences, the prince and his wife
    were the sole survivors of a shipwreck. They were stranded on a deserted island, and there
    they lived by eating birds' eggs, fledglings and birds, without any feeling of remorse at
    any time. For that evil deed, they would not be blessed with any children. If they had
    felt even a slight remorse for their deed at any stage of their lives, they could have a
    child or two in this existence. Then turning to the prince, the Buddha said,<i> &quot;One

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Upananda was a very eloquent preacher. He used to preach
    to others not to be greedy and to have only a few wants and would talk eloquently on the
    merits of contentment and frugality (<i>appicchata</i>) and austere practices (<i>dhutangas</i>).
    However, he did not practise what he taught and took for himself all the robes and other
    requisites that were given up by others.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On one occasion, Upananda went to a village monastery just
    before the vassa. Some young bhikkhus, being impressed by his eloquence, asked him to
    spend the vassa in their monastery. He asked them how many robes each bhikkhu usually
    received as donation for the vassa in their monastery and they told him that they usually
    received one robe each. So he did not stop there, but he left his slippers in that
    monastery. At the next monastery, he learned that the bhikkhus usually received two robes
    each for the vassa; there he left his staff. At the next monastery, the bhikkhus received
    three robes each as donation for the vassa; there he left his water bottle. Finally, at
    the monastery where each bhikkhu received four robes, he decided to spend the vassa.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the end of the vassa, he claimed his share of robes
    from the other monasteries where he had left his personal effects. Then he collected all
    his things in a cart and came back to his old monastery. On his way, he met two young
    bhikkhus who were having a dispute over the share of two robes and a valuable velvet
    blanket which they had between them. Since they could not come to an amicable settlement,
    they asked Upananda to arbitrate. Upananda gave one robe each to them and took the
    valuable velvet blanket for having acted as an arbitrator.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The two young bhikkhus were not satisfied with the
    decision but they could do nothing about it. With a feeling of dissatisfaction and

    from the Buddha, left for the forest with five hundred other bhikkhus. There, he told the
    bhikkhus to be ever mindful and diligent in their meditation practice. After thus
    exhorting others he himself would lie down and go to sleep. The young bhikkhus did as they
    were told. They practised meditation during the first watch of the night and when they
    were about to go to bed, Padhanikatissa would get up and tell them to go back to their
    practice. When they returned after meditation practice during the second and third watches
    also he would say the same thing to them.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As he was always acting in this way, the young bhikkhus
    never had peace of mind, and so they could not concentrate on meditation practice or even
    on recitation of the texts. One day, they decided to investigate if their teacher was
    truly zealous and vigilant as he posed himself to be. When they found out that their
    teacher Padhanikatissa only exhorted others but was himself sleeping most of the time,
    they remarked, &quot;We are ruined, our teacher knows only how to scold us, but he himself
    is just wasting time, doing nothing.&quot; By this time, as the bhikkhus were not getting
    enough rest, they were tired and worn out. As a result, none of the bhikkhu made any
    progress in their meditation practice.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the end of the vassa, they returned to the Jetavana

    The Story of the Mother of<a NAME="kumarakassapa"> Kumarakassapa</a> </strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (160) of this book, with reference to the mother of Kumarakassapa.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once, a young married woman asked permission from her
    husband to become a bhikkhuni. Through ignorance, she went to join some bhikkhunis who
    were the pupils of Devadatta. This young woman was pregnant before she became a bhikkhuni,
    but she was not aware of the fact at that time. But in due course, the pregnancy became
    obvious and the other bhikkhunis took her to their teacher Devadatta. Devadatta ordered
    her to go back to the household life. She then said to the other bhikkhunis, &quot;I have
    not intended to become a bhikkhuni under your teacher Devadatta; I have come here by
    mistake. Please take me to the Jetavana monastery, take me to the Buddha.&quot; Thus she
    came to the Buddha. The Buddha knew that she was pregnant before she became a bhikkhuni
    and was therefore innocent; but he was not going to handle the case. The Buddha sent for
    King Pasenadi of Kosala, Anathapindika, the famous rich man, and Visakha, the famous donor
    of the Pubbarama monastery, and many other persons. He then told Thera Upali to settle the
    case in public.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Visakha took the young girl behind a curtain; she examined
    her and reported to Thera Upali that the girl was already pregnant when she became a
    bhikkhuni. Thera Upali then declared to the audience that the girl was quite innocent and
    therefore had not soiled her morality (sila). In due course, a son was born to her. The
    boy was adopted by King Pasenadi and was named Kumarakassapa. When the boy was seven years
    old, on learning that his mother was a bhikkhuni, he also became a samanera under the
    tutelage of the Buddha. When he came of age he was admitted to the Order; as a bhikkhu, he
    took a subject of meditation from the Buddha and went to the forest. There, he practised
    meditation ardently and diligently and within a short time attained arahatship. However,
    he continued to live in the forest for twelve more years. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus his mother had not seen him for twelve years and she
    longed to see her son very much. One day, seeing him, the mother bhikkhuni ran after her
    son weeping and calling out his name. Seeing his mother, Kumarakassapa thought that if he
    were to speak pleasantly to his mother she would still be attached to him and her future
    would be ruined. So for the sake of her future (realization of Nibbana) he was
    deliberately stern and spoke harshly to her: &quot;How is it, that you, a member of the
    Order, could not even cut off this affection for a son?&quot; The mother thought that her
    son was very cruel to her, and she asked him what he meant. Kumarakassapa repeated what he
    had said before. On hearing his answer, the mother of Kumarakassapa reflected: <font>&quot;O
    yes, for twelve years I have shed tears for this son of mine. Yet, he has spoken harshly
    to me. What is the use of my affection for him ?&quot;</font> Then, the futility of her
    attachment to her son dawned upon her, and then and there, she decided to cut off her
    attachment to her son. By cutting off her attachment entirely, the mother of Kumarakassapa
    attained arahatship on the same day.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day, at the congregation of bhikkhus, some bhikkhus
    said to the Buddha, &quot;Venerable Sir! If the mother of Kumarakassapa had listened to
    Devadatta, she as well as her son would not have become arahats. Surely, Devadatta had
    tried to do them a great wrong; but you, Venerable Sir, are a refuge to them!&quot; To
    them the Buddha said,<i> &quot;Bhikkhus! In trying to reach the deva world, or in trying
    to attain arahatship, you cannot depend on others, you must work hard on your own.&quot; </i></font></p>

    to the Jetavana monastery. On that day, he kept the sabbath by observing the eight moral
    precepts (Uposatha sila) and listened to the discourses on the Dhamma throughout the
    night. It so happened that on that same night, some thieves broke into a house; and the
    owners on waking up went after the thieves. The thieves ran away in all directions. Some
    ran in the direction of the monastery. It was then nearing dawn, and Mahakala was washing
    his face at the pond close to the monastery. The thieves dropped their stolen property in
    from of Mahakala and ran on. When the owners arrived, they saw Mahakala with the stolen
    property. Taking him for one of the thieves they shouted at him, threatened him and beat
    him hard. Mahakala died on the spot. Early in the morning, when some young bhikkhus and
    samaneras from the monastery came to the pond to fetch water, they saw the dead body and
    recognize it.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On their return to the monastery, they reported what they
    had seen and said to the Buddha, &quot;Venerable Sir! The lay disciple who was at this
    monastery listening to the religious discourses all through the night has met with a death
    which he does not deserve.&quot; To them the Buddha replied, <i>&quot;Bhikkhus! If you
    judge from the good deeds he has done in this existence, he has indeed met with a death he
    does not deserve. But the fact is that he has only paid for the evil he had done in a past
    existence. In one of his previous existences, when he was a courtier in the palace of the
    king, he fell in love with another man's wife and had beaten her husband to death. Thus,

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day, some bhikkhus were talking amongst themselves
    when the Buddha came in and asked the subject of their talk. They answered that they were
    talking about Devadatta and then continued as follows:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Venerable Sir! Devadatta is, indeed, a man without
    morality; he is also very avaricious. He has tried to gain fame and fortune by getting the
    confidence of Ajatasattu by unfair means. He has also tried to convince Ajatasattu that by
    getting rid of his father, he (Ajatasattu) would immediately become a powerful king.
    Having been thus misled by Devadatta, Ajatasattu killed his father, the noble king,
    Bimbisara. Devadatta has even attempted three times to kill you, our most Venerable
    Teacher. Devadatta is, indeed, very wicked and incorrigible !&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">After listening to the bhikkhus, the Buddha told them that
    Devadatta has tried to kill him not only now but also in his previous existences. The
    Buddha then narrated the story of a deer-stalker.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;Once, while King Brahmadatta was reigning in
    Baranasi, the future Buddha was born as a deer, and Devadatta was then a deer-stalker. One
    day, the deer-stalker saw the footprints of a deer under a tree. So, he put up a bamboo
    platform in the tree and waited with the spear ready for the deer. The deer came but he
    came very cautiously. The deer-stalker saw him hesitating, and threw some fruits of the
    tree to coax him. Bat that put the deer on guard; he looked more carefully and saw the
    deer-stalker in the tree. He pretended not to see the deer stalker and turned away slowly.
    From some distance, he addressed the tree thus:</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>'O tree! You always drop your fruits vertically, but
    today you have broken the law of nature and have dropped your fruits slantingly. Since you
    have violated the nature law of trees, I am now leaving you for another tree.'</i></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;Seeing the deer turning away, the dear-stalker
    dropped his spear to the ground and said, 'Yes, you can now move on; for today, I have
    been wrong in my calculations.' The deer who was the Buddha-to-be replied, 'O hunter! You
    have truly miscalculated today, but your evil kamma will not take any mistake; it will
    certainly follow you.' Thus, Devadatta had attempted to kill me not only now but also in
    the past, yet he had never succeeded.&quot; 'Then the Buddha continued, 'Bhikkhus! Just as
    a creeper strangles the tree to which it clings, so also, those without morality, being
    overwhelmed by lust, are finally thrown into niraya.&quot;</i></font></p>

    The Story of<a NAME="schism"> Schism </a>in the Order</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">While residing at the Veluvana monastery, the Buddha
    uttered Verse (163) of this book, with reference to Devadatta, who committed the offence
    of causing a schism in the Order of the bhikkhus.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On one occasion, while the Buddha was giving a discourse
    in the Veluvana monastery, Devadatta came to him and suggested that since the Buddha was
    getting old, the duties of the Order should be entrusted to him (Devadatta); but the
    Buddha rejected his proposal and also rebuked him and called him a &quot;spittle swallow
    or&quot; (Khelasika). From that time, Devadatta felt very bitter towards the Buddha. He
    even tried to kill the Buddha three times, but all his attempts failed. Later, Devadatta
    tried another tactic. This time, he came to the Buddha and proposed five rules of
    discipline for the bhikkhus to observe throughout their lives. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">He proposed:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>(i) that the bhikkhus should live in the forest; </i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>(ii) that they should live only on food received on
      alms-rounds; </i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>(iii) that they should wear robes made only from pieces
      of cloth collected from rubbish heaps; </i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>(iv) that they should reside under trees; and </i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>(v) that they should not take fish or meat.</i></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha did not have any objections to these rules and
    made no objections to those who were willing to observe them, but for various valid
    considerations, he was not prepared to impose these rules of discipline on the bhikkhus in
    general.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Devadatta claimed that the rules proposed by him were much
    better than the existing rules of discipline, and some new bhikkhus agreed with him. One
    day, the Buddha asked Devadatta if it was true that he was trying to create a schism in
    the Order, and he admitted that it was so. The Buddha warned him that it was a very
    serious offence, but Devadatta paid no heed to his warning. After this, as he met Thera
    Ananda on his alms-round in Rajagaha, Devadatta said to Thera Ananda, &quot;Ananda, from
    today I will observe the sabbath (Uposatha), and perform the duties of the Order
    separately, independent of the Buddha and his Order of bhikkhus.&quot; On his return from
    the alms-round, Thera Ananda reported to the Buddha what Devadatta had said.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On hearing this, the Buddha reflected, <i>&quot;Devadatta
    is committing a very serious offence; it will send him to Avici Niraya. For a virtuous
    person, it is easy to do good deeds and difficult to do evil; but for an evil one, it is
    easy to do evil and difficult to do good deeds. Indeed, in life it is easy to do something
    which is not beneficial, but it is very difficult to do something which is good and
    beneficial.&quot; </i></font></p>

    Thera named Kala, like her own son. One day hearing from her neighbours about the virtues
    of the Buddha, she wished very much to go to the Jetavana monastery and listen to the
    discourses given by the Buddha. So she told Thera Kala about her wishes; but the thera
    advised her against it. Three times she spoke to him about her wishes but he always
    dissuaded her. But one day, in spite of his dissuasion, the lady decided to go. After
    asking her daughter to look to the needs of Thera Kala she left the house. When Thera Kala
    came on his usual round of alms-food, he learned that the lady of the house had left for
    the Jetavana monastery. Then he reflected, &quot;It is quite possible that the lady of
    this house is losing her faith in me.&quot; So, he made haste and quickly followed her to
    the monastery. There, he found her listening to the discourse being given by the Buddha.
    He approached the Buddha respectfully, and said, &quot;Venerable Sir! This woman is very
    dull; she will not be able to understand the sublime Dhamma; please teach her only about
    charity (dana) and morality (sila).&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Buddha knew very well that Thera Kala was talking out
    of spite and with an ulterior motive. So he said to Thera Kala, <i>&quot;Bhikkhu! Because
