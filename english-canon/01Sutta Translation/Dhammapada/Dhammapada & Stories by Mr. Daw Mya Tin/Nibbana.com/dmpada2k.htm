residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (290) of this
book, with reference to the power and glory of the Buddha as witnessed by many
people on his visit to Vesali.</P>

<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#FEFEDA"><BR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once,
a famine broke out in Vesali. It began with a serious drought. Because of
drought, there was almost a total failure of crops and many people died of
starvation. This was followed by an epidemic of diseases and as people could
hardly cope with the disposal of the corpses there was a lot of stench in the
air. This stench attracted the ogres. The people of Vesali were facing the
dangers of destruction by famine, disease and also by the ogres. In their grief
and sorrow they tried to look for a refuge. They thought of going for help from
various sources but finally, they decided to invite the Buddha. So a mission
headed by Mahali, the Licchavi prince, and the son of the chief brahmin were
sent to King Bimbisara to request the Buddha to pay a visit to Vesali and help
them in their distress. The Buddha knew that this visit would be of much
benefit to many people, so he consented to go to Vesali.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, King
Bimbisara repaired the road between Rajagaha and the bank of the river Ganga.
He also made other preparations and set up special resting-places at an
interval of every yojana. When everything was ready, the Buddha set out for
Vesali with five hundred bhikkhus. King Bimbisara also accompanied the Buddha.
On the fifth day they came to the bank of the river Ganga and King Bimbisara
sent word to the Licchavi princes. On the other side of the river, the Licchavi
princes had repaired the road between the river and Vesali and had set up
resting places as had been done by King Bimbisara on his side of the river. The
Buddha went to Vesali with Licchavi princes but King Bimbisara stayed behind. 
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As
soon as the Buddha reached the other bank of the river heavy rains fell in
torrents, thus cleansing up Vesali. The Buddha was put up in the rest-house
which was specially prepared for him in the central part of the city. Sakka,
king of the devas, came with his followers to pay obeisance to the Buddha, and
the ogres fled. That same evening the Buddha delivered the Ratana Sutta and
asked the Venerable Ananda to go round between the threefold walls of the city
with the Licchavi princes and recite it. The Venerable Ananda did as he was
told. As the protective verses (parittas) were being recited, many of those who
were sick recovered and followed the Venerable Ananda to the presence of the
Buddha. The Buddha delivered the same Sutta and repeated it for seven days. At
the end of the seven days, everything was back to normal in Vesali. The
Licchavi princes and the people of Vesali were very much relieved and were
overjoyed. They were also very grateful to the Buddha. They paid obeisance to
the Buddha and made offerings to him on a grand and lavish scale. They also
accompanied the Buddha on his return journey until they came to the bank of the
Ganga at the end of three days.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On
arrival at the river bank, King Bimbisara was waiting for the Buddha; so also
were the devas and the brahmas and the king of the Nagas with their respective
entourage. All of them paid obeisance and made offerings to the Buddha. The
devas and the brahmas paid homage with umbrellas, flowers, etc., and sang in
praise of the Buddha. The Nagas had come with barges made of gold, silver and
rubies to invite the Buddha to the realm of the Nagas; they had also strewn the
surface of the water with five hundred kinds of lotuses. This was one of the
three occasions in the life of the Buddha when human beings, devas and brahmas
came together to pay homage to the Buddha. The first occasion was when the
Buddha manifested his power and glory by the miracle of the pairs, emitting
rays of light and sprays of water; and the second was on his return from the
Tavatimsa deva world after expounding the Abhidhamma.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Buddha, wishing to honour the Nagas, then paid a visit to the realm of the
Nagas accompanied by the bhikkhus. The Buddha and his entourage went in the
five hundred barges brought by the Nagas. After his visit to the realm of the
Nagas, the Buddha returned to Rajagaha accompanied by King Bimbisara. They
arrived at Rajagaha on the fifth day. Two days after their arrival at Rajagaha,
while the bhikkhus were talking about the amazing grandeur and glory of the
trip to and from Vesali, the Buddha arrived on the scene. On learning the
subject of their talk, the Buddha said to them, 'Bhikkhus, that I have been
revered so much by brahmas, devas and human beings alike and that they have
made offerings on such a grand and lavish scale to me on this occasion is not
due to the power I now possess; it is simply because I had done some small
meritorious deeds in one of my previous existences that I now enjoy such great
benefits&quot;. Then the Buddha related the story of one of his past
existences, when he was a brahmin by the name of Sankha.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once
there was a brahmin named Sankha who lived in the city of Taxila. He had a son
named Susima. When Susima was sixteen years old, he was sent by his father to
another brahmin to study astrology. His teacher taught him all that should be
learnt, but Susima was not fully satisfied. So, his teacher directed him to
approach the paccekabuddhas who were then staying in Isipatana. Susima went to
Isipatana, but the paccekabuddhas told him that he must first become a bhikkhu.
Thus, he became a bhikkhu, and was instructed how to conduct himself as a
bhikkhu. Susima diligently practised meditation and he soon comprehended the
Four Noble Truths, acquired Bodhi nana, and became a paccekabuddha himself. But
as a result of his previous kamma Susima did not live long; he realized
parinibbana soon afterwards.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sankha, the father of
Susima, came in search of his son, but when he arrived he only found the stupa
where the relics of his son were enshrined. The brahmin felt very much
distressed at the loss of his son. He proceeded to clean up the precincts of
the stupa, by clearing away grass and weeds; then he covered up the ground with
sand and sprinkled it with water. Next, he went into the nearby woods for some
wild flowers and stuck them on the wet ground. In that way, he offered his
services and paid respect to the paccekabuddha who was once his son. It was
because of that good deed done in that previous existence of his that the
Buddha gained such benefits, that he was showered with such lavish offerings,
that he was shown such deep reverence and great devotion on that particular
occasion.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then
the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:</P>
<P
 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><FONT

pleasures great happiness is to be found, the wise should give up small

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While

book, with reference to a feud between a woman and a hen.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#FEFEDA"><BR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once,
there lived a woman in a village near Savatthi. She had a hen in her house;
every time the hen laid an egg she would eat it up. The hen was very much hurt
and angry and made a vow to have vengeance on the woman and made a wish that it
should be reborn as some being that would be in a position to kill the
offspring of that woman. The hen's wish was fulfilled as it was reborn as a cat
and the woman was reborn as a hen in the same house. The cat ate up the eggs of
the hen. In their next existence the hen became a leopard and the cat became a
deer. The leopard ate up the deer as well as its offspring. Thus, the feud
continued for five hundred existences of the two beings. At the time of the
Buddha one of them was born as a woman and the other an ogress.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On
one occasion, the woman was returning from the house of' her parents to her own
house near Savatthi. Her husband and her young son were also with her. While
they were resting near a pond at the roadside, her husband went to have a bath
in the pond. At that moment the woman saw the ogress and recognized her as her
old enemy. Taking her child she fled from the ogress straight to the Jetavana
monastery where the Buddha was expounding the Dhamma and put her child at the
feet of the Buddha. The ogress who was in hot pursuit of the woman also came to
the door of the monastery, but the guardian spirit of the gate did not permit
her to enter. The Buddha, seeing her, sent the Venerable Ananda to bring the
ogress to his presence. When the ogress arrived, the Buddha reprimanded both
the woman and the ogress for the long chain of feud between them. He also
added, &quot;If you two had not come to me today, your feud would have
continued endlessly. Enmity cannot be appeased by enmity; it can only be
appeased by loving-kindness.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then
the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:</P>
<P
 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><FONT
COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT COLOR="#800040">Verse 291.</FONT> He who seeks his own
happiness by inflicting pain on others, being entangled by bonds of enmity,
cannot be free from enmity. </FONT></B> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At
the end of the discourse the ogress took refuge in the three Gems, viz., the
Buddha, the Dhamma and the Samgha, and the woman attained Sotapatti Fruition.

Jetavana monastery. While they were with the Buddha, Lakundaka Bhaddiya
happened to pass by not far from them. The Buddha called their attention to the
short thera and said to them, &quot;Bhikkhus, look at that thera. He has killed
both his father and his mother, and having killed his parents he goes about
without any dukkha.&quot; The bhikkhus could not understand the statement made

the above statement, the Buddha was referring to an arahat, who had eradicated
craving, conceit, wrong beliefs, and attachment to sense bases and sense
objects. The Buddha had made the statement by means of metaphors. Thus, the
terms 'mother' and 'father' are used to indicate craving and conceit
respectively. The Eternity-belief (Sassataditthi) and Annihilation-belief
(Ucchedaditthi) are likened to two kings, attachment is likened to a revenue
officer and the sense bases and sense objects (the ajjhatta and bahiddha
ayatanas) are likened to a kingdom.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once
in Rajagaha, a wood-cutter went into the woods with his son to cut some
firewood. On their return home in the evening, they stopped near a cemetery to
have their meal. They also took off the yoke from the two oxen to enable them
to graze nearby; but the two oxen went away without being noticed by them. As
soon as they discovered that the oxen were missing, the wood-cutter went to
look for them, leaving his son with the cart of firewood. The father entered
the town, looking for his oxen. When he returned to his son it was getting late
and the city-gate was closed. Therefore, the young boy had to spend the night
alone underneath his cart.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
wood-cutter's son, though young, was always mindful and was in the habit of
contemplating the unique qualities of the Buddha. That night two ogres came to
frighten him and to harm him. When one of the ogres pulled at the leg of the
boy, he cried out, &quot;I pay homage to the Buddha&quot; (Namo Buddhassa).
Hearing those words from the boy, the ogres got frightened and also felt that
they must look after the boy. So, one of them remained near the boy, guarding
him from all danger; the other went to the king's palace and brought the
food-tray of King Bimbisara. The two ogres then fed the boy as if he were their
own son. At the palace, the ogre left a written message concerning the royal
food-tray; and this message was visible only to the king.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
the morning, the king's men discovered that the royal food-tray was missing and
they were very upset and very much frightened. The king found the message left
by the ogre and directed his men where to look for it. The king's men found the
royal food-tray among the firewood in the cart, They also found the boy who was
still sleeping underneath the cart. When questioned, the boy answered that his
parents came to feed him in the night and that he went to sleep contentedly and
without fear after taking his food. The boy knew only that much and nothing
more. The king sent for the parents of the boy, and took the boy and his
parents to the Buddha. The king, by that time, had heard that the boy was
always mindful of the unique qualities of the Buddha and also that he had cried
out &quot;Namo Buddhassa&quot;, when the ogre pulled at his leg in the night. 
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
king asked the Buddha, &quot;Is mindfulness of the unique qualities of the
Buddha the only dhamma that gives one protection against evil and danger, or is
mindfulness of the unique qualities of the Dhamma equally potent and
powerful?&quot; To him the Buddha replied, 'O king, my disciple! There are six
things, mindfulness of which is a good protection against evil and
danger.&quot;</P>

lit up, and there was much merry-making with singing, dancing, etc. As he
looked towards the city, standing alone in the monastery, the bhikkhu felt
lonely and dissatisfied with his lot. Softly, he murmured to himself,
&quot;There can be no one whose lot is worse than mine&quot;. At that instant,
the spirit guarding the woods appeared to him, and said, &quot;those beings in
niraya envy the lot of the beings in the deva world; so also, people envy the
lot of those who live alone in the woods.&quot; Hearing those words, the

the marriage of their two children. So the marriage took place, and
Culasubhaddi, the daughter of Anathapindika, had to stay in the house of her

Sometimes, they would invite those non-Buddhist ascetics to their house. On

Buddha; they were also afraid that things would get worse if they did not do
something to damage the reputation of the Buddha. So, they sent for Sundari and
said to her, &quot;Sundari, you are a very beautiful and clever young lady. We
want you to put Samana Gotama to shame, by making it appear to others that you
are having sexual dealings with him. By so doing, his image will be impaired,
his following will decrease and many would come to us. Make the best use of
your looks and be crafty.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sundari understood what
was expected of her. Thus, late in the evening, she went in the direction of

&quot;I am going to visit Samana Gotama; I live with him in the Perfumed
Chamber of the Jetavana monastery.&quot; After saying this, she proceeded to
the place of the non-Buddhist ascetics. Early in the morning the next day, she
returned home, if anyone asked her from where she had come she would reply,
&quot;I have come from the Perfumed Chamber after staying the night with Samana
Gotama.&quot; She carried on like this for two more days. At the end of three
days, those ascetics hired some drunkards to kill Sundari and put her body in a
rubbish heap near the Jetavana monastery.</P>

went to the king to report the matter and their suspicion. The king gave them
permission to search where they wished. Finding the body near the Jetavana
monastery, they carried it to the palace. Then they said to the king, &quot;O
king, the followers of Gotama have killed this Paribbajika and have thrown away
her body in the rubbish heap near the Jetavana monastery to cover up the
misdeed of their teacher.&quot; To them the king replied, &quot;In that case,
you may go round the town and proclaim the fact.&quot; So they went round the
town carrying the dead body of Sundari, shouting, &quot;Look! What the
followers of Gotama have done; see how they have tried to cover up the misdeed
of Gotama!&quot; The procession then returned to he palace. The bhikkhus living
in the Jetavana monastery told the Buddha what those ascetics were (doing to
damage his reputation and impair his image. But the Buddha only said, &quot;My

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
king next ordered his men to further investigate the murder of Sundari. On
investigation, they found out that Sundari had died at the hands of some
drunkards. So they were brought to the king. When questioned, the drunkards
disclosed that they were hired by the ascetics to kill Sundari and put her body
near the Jetavana monastery. The king then sent for the non-Buddhist ascetics,
and they finally confessed their role in the murder of Sundari. The king then
ordered them to go round the town and confess their guilt to the people. So
they went round the town saying, &quot;We are the ones who killed Sundari. We
have falsely accused the disciples of Gotama just to bring disgrace on Gotama.
The disciples of Gotama are innocent, only we are guilty of the crime.&quot; As
a result of this episode, the power, the glory and the fortune of the Buddha
were very much enhanced.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once,
a woman with a very strong sense of jealousy lived with her husband in
Savatthi. She found that her husband was having an affair with her maid. So one
day, she tied up the girl with strong ropes, cut off her ears and nose, and
shut her up in a room. After doing that, she asked her husband to accompany her
to the Jetavana monastery. Soon after they left, some relatives of the maid
arrived at their house and found the maid tied up and locked up in a room. They
broke into the room, untied her and took her to the monastery. They arrived at
the monastery while the Buddha was expounding the Dhamma. The girl related to
the Buddha what her mistress had done to her, how she had been beaten, and how
her nose and ears had been cut off. She stood in the midst of the crowd for all
to see how she had been mistreated. So the Buddha said, &quot;Do no evil,
thinking that people will not know about it. An evil deed done in secret, when
discovered, will bring much pain and sorrow; but a good deed may be done
secretly, for it can only bring happiness and not sorrow.&quot;</P>

people of the town, therefore, had to rehabilitate their town and reinforce
fortifications. Thus, they were unable to look to the needs of the bhikkhus as
much as they would like to and the bhikkhus had to fend for themselves. At the
end of the vassa, those bhikkhus came to pay homage to the Buddha at the
Jetavana monastery in Savatthi. On learning about the hardships they had
undergone during the vassa, the Buddha said to them &quot;Bhikkhus, do not keep

enter a Buddhist monastery, they asked the Buddhist boy to go to the monastery

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once,
there lived in Savatthi an old brahmin who had eight lakhs in cash. He had four
sons; when each one of the sons got married, he gave one lakh to him. Thus, he
gave away four lakhs. Later, his wife died. His sons came to him and looked
after him very well; in fact, they were very loving and affectionate to him. In
course of time, somehow they coaxed him to give them the remaining four lakhs.
Thus, he was left practically penniless.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
First, he went to stay with his eldest son. After a few days, the
daughter-in-law said to him, &quot;Did you give any extra hundred or thousand
to your eldest son? Don't you know the way to the houses of your other
sons?&quot; Hearing this, the old brahmin got very angry and he left the eldest
son's house for the house of his second son. The same remarks were made by the
wife of his second son and the old man went to the house of his third son and
finally to the house of his fourth and youngest son. The same thing happened in
the houses of all his sons. Thus, the old man became helpless; then, taking a
staff and a bowl he went to the Buddha for protection and advice.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At
the monastery, the brahmin told the Buddha how his sons had treated him and
asked for his help. Then the Buddha gave him some verses to memorize and
instructed him to recite them wherever there was a large gathering of people.
The gist of the verses is this: &quot;My four foolish sons are like ogres. They
call me 'father, father', but the words come only out of their mouths and not
from their hearts. They are deceitful and scheming. Taking the advice of their
wives they have driven me out of their houses. So, now I have got to be
begging. Those sons of mine are of less service to me than this staff of
mine.&quot; When the old brahmin recited these verses, many people in the
crowd, hearing him, went wild with rage at his sons and some even threatened to
kill them.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At
this, the sons became frightened and knelt down at the feet of their father and
asked for pardon. They also promised that starting from that day they would
look after their father properly and would respect, love and honour him. Then,
they took their father to their houses; they also warned their wives to look
after their father well or else they would be beaten to death. Each of the sons
gave a length of cloth and sent every day a food-tray. The brahmin became
healthier than before and soon put on some weight. He realized that he had been
showered with these benefits on account of the Buddha. So, he went to the
Buddha and humbly requested him to accept two food-trays out of the four he was
receiving every day from his sons. Then he instructed his sons to send two
food-trays to the Buddha.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One
day, the eldest son invited the Buddha to his house for alms-food. After the
meal, the Buddha gave a discourse on the benefits to be gained by looking after
one's parents. Then he related to them the story of the elephant called
Dhanapala, who looked after his parents. Dhanapala when captured pined for the
parents who were left in the forest.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While
residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (326) of this
book, with reference to a young samanera named Sanu.</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#FEFEDA"><BR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One
day, Samanera Sanu was urged by older bhikkhus to go up on the dais and recite
parts of the Pali texts. When he had finished his recitation he solemnly called
out, &quot;May the merits gained by me today for reciting these sacred texts be
shared by my mother and my father&quot;. At that time, the devas and the ogress
who had been the mother of the young samanera in a previous existence were
listening to his recitation. When they heard his words, the ogress was elated
and promptly cried out, &quot;My dear son, how happy I am to share your merit;
you have done well, my son. Well done! Well done! (Sadhu! Sadhu !).&quot; On
account of Samanera Sanu, the mother ogress came to be very much respected and
was given precedence in their assemblies by the devas and other ogres.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As
the samanera grew older, he wanted to return to the life of a lay man; he went
home and asked for his clothes from his mother. His mother did not want him to
leave the Order and tried to dissuade him front leaving it, but he was quite
firm in his decision. So, his mother promised to give him the clothes after his
meal. As his mother was busy cooking his meal, the ogress, who was his mother
of a past existence, thought, &quot;If my son Sanu leaves the Order, I shall be
put to shame and become a laughing stock among other ogres and devas; I must
try and stop him leaving the Order.&quot; So, the young samanera was possessed
by her; the boy rolled on the floor, muttering in coherently with saliva
streaming out of his mouth. The mother got alarmed; neighbours came and tried
to appease the spirits. Then, the ogress spoke out &quot;This samanera wants to
leave the religious Order and return to the life of a lay man; if he does so he
will not be able to escape from dukkha.&quot; After saying those words, the
ogress left the body of the boy and the boy became normal again.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Finding his mother in tears and the neighbours crowding around him, he asked
what had happened. His mother told him everything that had happened to him and
also explained to him that to return to lay life after leaving it was very
foolish; in fact, even though living he would be like a dead person. The
samanera then came to realize his mistake. Taking the three robes from his
mother, he went back to the monastery and was soon admitted as a bhikkhu.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When
told about Samanera Sanu, the Buddha wishing to teach him about the restraint
of mind said, <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;My son, one who does not restrain the
mind which wanders about cannot find happiness. So, control your mind as a
mahout controls an elephant.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then
the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:</P>
<P
 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><FONT
COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT COLOR="#800040">Verse 326.</FONT> In the past, this mind
has wandered as it liked, wherever it liked, at its own pleasure. Now I will
control my mind wisely, as a mahout with his goad controls an elephant in must.
</FONT></B> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
the end of the discourse Thera Sanu comprehended the Four Noble Truths and
later attained arahat ship.</P>

Paveyyaka when young was very strong; in due course, he became old and
decrepit. One day, as old Paveyyaka went into a pond he was stuck in the mire
and could not get on to the shore. When King Pasenadi of Kosala was told about
it, he sent an elephant trainer to help the elephant get out of the mire. The
elephant trainer went to the site where the elephant was. There, he made the
musicians strike up a martial tune. Hearing the military airs, the elephant
felt as if he were in a battlefield; his spirits rose, he pulled him self with
all his might, and was soon out of the mire.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once,
the bhikkhus of Kosambi split into two groups; one group followed the master of
Vinaya and the other followed the teacher of the Dhamma. They did not listen
even to the Buddha who exhorted them to make peace. So, the Buddha left them
and spent the vassa all alone in the forest, where the elephant Palileyyaka
waited on him.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At
the end of the vassa, the Venerable Ananda went into the forest, accompanied by
five hundred bhikkhus. Leaving the bhikkhus at some distance, the Venerable
Ananda approached the Buddha alone. Then the Buddha told Ananda to call the
other bhikkhus. All of them came, paid obeisance to the Buddha and said,
&quot;Venerable Sir! You must have had a hard time spending the vassa all alone
in this forest.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
this, the Buddha replied,&quot; Bhikkhus, do not say so; the elephant
Palileyyaka had been looking after me all this time. He was, indeed, a very
good friend, a true friend. <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">If one has such a good friend
