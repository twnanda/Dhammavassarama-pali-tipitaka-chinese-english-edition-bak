ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During
the time of Kassapa Buddha, there was a bhikkhu named Kapila, who was very
learned in the <I>Pitakas</I>. Because of his great learning he gained much
fame and fortune; he also became very conceited and was full of contempt for
other bhikkhus. When other bhikkhus pointed out to him, what was proper or not
proper he invariably retorted, &quot;How much do you know?&quot; implying that
he knew much more than those bhikkhus. In course of time, all good bhikkhus
shunned him and only the bad ones gathered round him. On one sabbath day, while
the bhikkhus were reciting the Fundamental Precepts for the bhikkhus (i.e., the
<I>Patimokkha</I>) Kapila said, &quot;There is no such thing as <I>Sutta</I>,
<I>Abhidhamma</I>, or <I>Vinaya</I>. It makes no difference whether you have a
chance to listen to the Patimokkha or not, &quot; etc., and left the
congregation of the bhikkhus. Thus, Kapila was a hindrance to the development
and growth of the Teaching (<I>Sasana</I>).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For
this evil deed, Kapila had to suffer in niraya between the time of Kassapa
Buddha and Gotama Buddha. Later, he was reborn as a fish in the Aciravati
River. That fish, as mentioned above, had a very beautiful golden body, but his
mouth had a very horrid, offensive smell. One day, that fish was caught by some
fishermen, and because it was so beautiful, they took it in a boat to the king.
The king, in his turn took the fish to the Buddha. When the fish opened its
mouth, the horrid and offensive smell spread all around. The king then asked
the Buddha why such a beautiful fish should have such a horrid and offensive
smell. To the king and the audience, the Buddha explained, &quot;O king! During
the time of Kassapa Buddha there was a very learned bhikkhu who taught the
Dhamma to others. Because of that good deed, when he was reborn in another
existence, even as a fish, he was endowed with a golden body. But that bhikkhu
was very greedy, proud and very contemptuous of others; he also disregarded the
Disciplines and abused other bhikkhus. For these evil deeds, he was reborn in
niraya, and now, he has become a beautiful fish with a mouth that stinks.&quot;
The Buddha then turned to the fish and asked whether it knew where it would be
going in its next existence. The fish answered that it would have to go again
to niraya and it was filled with great despair. As predicted, on its death the
fish was reborn in niraya, to undergo another term of continuous torment.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All
those present hearing about the fish got alarmed. To then, the Buddha gave a
discourse on the benefits of combining learning with practice.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then

absorptions (jhanas). But one day, as he went for alms-food to his uncle's
house, he saw a woman and felt a great desire to have her. Then he left the
Order of the bhikkhus. As a layman, he was a failure as he did not work hard.
So, his uncle drove him out of the house, and subsequently he became mixed up
with some thieves. All of them were caught by the authorities and were taken to
the cemetery to be executed. The Venerable Mahakassapa saw his pupil as he was
being led out and said to him, &quot;My pupil, keep your mind steadfastly on a
subject of meditation.&quot; As instructed, he concentrated and let himself be
established in deep mental absorption. At the cemetery, while the executioners
were making preparations to kill him, the ex-bhikkhu was very much composed and
showed no signs of fear or anxiety. The executioners and the onlookers were
awe-struck and very much impressed by the man's courage and composure and they

morning, they asked the Buddha whether there were any other bonds stronger than
these. To them the Buddha answered, &quot;Bhikkhus! These bonds are nothing
compared to those of craving for food and clothing, for riches and for family.
Craving is a thousand times, a hundred thousand times stronger than those

monastery.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When
Queen Khema arrived at the monastery, the Buddha was expounding the Dhamma to
an audience. By his supernormal power, the Buddha made a very beautiful young
lady appear, sitting not far from him, and fanning him. When Queen Khema came
to the audience hail, she alone saw the beautiful young lady. Comparing the
exquisite beauty of the young lady to that of her own, Khema realised that her
beauty was much inferior to that of the young lady. As she looked again
intently at the young lady her beauty began to fade gradually. In the end, she
saw before her eyes an old decrepit being, which again changed into a corpse,
her stinking body being attacked by maggots. At that instant, Queen Khema
realized the impermanence and worthlessness of beauty.</P>

wandering theatrical troupe consisting of five hundred dancers and some
acrobats came to Rajagaha and performed on the grounds of the palace of King
Bimbisara for seven days. There, a young dancer who was the daughter of an
acrobat sang and danced on top of a long bamboo pole. Uggasena, the young son
of a rich man, fell desperately in love with this dancer and his parents could
not stop him from marrying her. He married the young dancer and followed the
troupe. As he was not a dancer nor an acrobat, he was not of much use to the
party. So, as the party moved from place to place, he had to help carry boxes,
to drive the carts, etc.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
course of time, a son was born to Uggasena and his wife, the dancer. To this
child, the dancer would often sing a song which ran thus: &quot;O you, son of
the man who keeps watch over the carts; the man who carries boxes and bundles!
O , you, son of the ignorant one who can do nothing!&quot; Uggasena heard the
song; he knew that his wife was referring to him and he was very much hurt and
depressed. So he went to his father-in-law, the acrobat, and requested him to
teach him acrobatics. After a year's training, Uggasena became a skilful
acrobat.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then,
Uggasena went back to Rajagaha, and it was proclaimed that Uggasena would
publicly demonstrate his skill in seven days' time. On the seventh day, a long
pole was put up and Uggasena stood on top of it. At a signal given from below
he somersaulted seven times on the pole. At about this time, the Buddha saw
Uggasena in his vision and knew that time was ripe for Uggasena to attain
arahatship. So, he entered Rajagaha and willed that the audience should turn
their attention to him instead of applauding Uggasena for his acrobatic feats.
When Uggasena saw that he was being neglected and ignored, he just sat on top
of the pole, feeling very discontented and depressed. The Buddha then addressed
Uggasena, &quot;Uggasena, a wise man should abandon all attachment to the<I>

rebirths.&quot;</P>

of Craving leads to the attainment of arahatship and is, therefore, the

occasion, King Pasenadi of Kosala came to pay homage to the Buddha. He
explained to the Buddha that he was late because earlier that day a rich man
had died in Savatthi without leaving any heirs, and so he had to confiscate all
that man's property. Then, he proceeded to relate about the man, who, although
very rich, was very stingy. While he lived, he did not give away anything in
charity. He was reluctant to spend his money even on himself, and therefore,
ate very sparingly and wore cheap, coarse clothes only. On hearing this the
Buddha told the king and the audience about the man in a past existence. In
that existence also he was a rich man.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One
day, when a paccekabuddha came and stood for alms at his house, he told his
wife to offer some thing to the paccekabuddha. His wife thought it was very
rarely that her husband gave her permission to give anything to anybody. So,
she filled up the alms-bowl with some choice food. The rich man again met the
paccekabuddha on his way home and he had a look at the alms-bowl. Seeing that
his wife had offered a substantial amount of good food, he thought, &quot;Oh,
this bhikkhu would only have a good sleep after a good meal. It would have been
better if my servants were given such good food; at least, they would have
given me better service.&quot; In other words, he regretted that he had asked
his wife to offer food to the paccekabuddha. This same man had a brother who
also was a rich man. His brother had an only son. Coveting his brother's
wealth, he had killed his young nephew and had thus wrongfully inherited his
brother's wealth on the latter's death.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Because the man had offered alms-food to the paccekabuddha he became a rich man
in his present life; because he regretted having offered food to the
paccekabuddha he had no wish to spend anything even on himself. Because he had
killed his own nephew for the sake of his brother's wealth he had to suffer in
niraya for seven existences. His bad kamma having come to an end he was born
into the human world but here also he had not gained any good kamma. The king
then remarked, &quot;Venerable Sir! Even though he had lived here in the
lifetime of the Buddha himself, he had not made any offering of anything to the
Buddha or to his disciples. Indeed, he had missed a very good opportunity; he
had been very foolish.&quot;</P>

Santusita, who had been his mother. During that time, there was a deva named
Indaka in Tavatimsa. Indaka, in his last existence as a man, had offered a
little alms-food to Thera Anuruddha. As this good deed was made to a thera
within the period of the Buddha's Teaching he was amply rewarded for it. Thus,
on his death he was reborn in the Tavatimsa realm and was lavishly bestowed
with the luxuries of the deva world. At that time, there was also another deva
by the name of Ankura in Tavatimsa who had given much in charity; in fact, many
times more than what Indaka had given. But his charity was made outside the
period of the Teaching of any of the Buddhas. So, in spite of his lavish and
grand charities, he was enjoying the benefits of the life of a deva on a much
smaller scale than Indaka, who had offered very little. As the Buddha was then
at Tavatimsa, Ankura asked him the reason for the discrepancy in gaining the
benefits. To him the Buddha answered, &quot;O deva! When giving charities and
donations you should choose whom you give, for acts of charities are just like
seeds. Seeds put into fertile soil will grow into strong, vigorous plants or
trees and will bear much fruit; but you had sown your seed in poor soil, so you

was made known to the disciples that the Buddha would realize Parinibbana in
four months' time, most of the puthujjana bhikkhus (i.e., those who had not
attained any of the Maggas) felt extremely depressed and were at a loss and did
not know what to do. They just stayed close to the Buddha, hardly ever leaving
his presence. However, there was a bhikkhu by the name of Dhammarama who kept
to himself and did not go near the Buddha. His intention was to strive most
ardently to attain arahatship before the passing away of the Buddha. So he
strove hard in Insight Meditation Practice. Other bhikkhus, not understanding
his attitude and his noble ambition, misunderstood his behaviour.</P>

bhikkhus took Dhammarama to the Buddha and said to the Enlightened One,
&quot;Venerable Sir! This bhikkhu does not seem to have any affection or regard
or reverence for you; he has been staying by himself while all the time other
bhikkhus are staying close to Your Venerable presence.&quot; When other
bhikkhus had said everything they wanted to say, Dhammarama respectfully
explained to the Buddha why he had not come to see the Buddha and also reported
that he had been striving his utmost in Insight Meditation Practice.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The

Devadatta, paid a visit to the monastery of Devadatta and stayed there for a
few days. Other bhikkhus reported to the Buddha that he had been mixing with
the followers of Devadatta and that he had even gone to the monastery of
Devadatta, spent there a few days, eating, sleeping and apparently enjoying the
choice food and the comforts of that monastery. The Buddha sent for that
bhikkhu and asked him whether what he had heard about his behaviour was true.
The bhikkhu admitted that he had gone to the monastery of Devadatta for a few
days, but he told the Buddha that he had not embraced the teaching of
Devadatta.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Buddha then reprimanded him and pointed out that his behaviour made him appear
like a follower of Devadatta. To him the Buddha said,<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
&quot;My son, even though you have not embraced the doctrine of Devadatta, you
are going about as if you were one of his followers. A bhikkhu should be
contented with what he gets and should not covet other people's gains. A
bhikkhu who is filled with envy at the good fortune of others will not attain
concentration (<I>samadhi</I>), or Insight, or the Path that leads to Nibbana

to attain concentration, Insight and the Path.&quot;</FONT></P>

of first-fruits in charity. The first-fruits here refer to the first-fruits of
the field. The first-fruits of the field are given in charity at the time of
harvesting, at the time of threshing, at the time of storing, at the time of

the Buddha saw the brahmin and his wife in his vision and knew that time was
ripe for the couple to attain Anagami Fruition. Accordingly, the Buddha set out
for their house and stood at the door for alms food. The brahmin who was then
having his meal, facing the interior part of the house, did not see the Buddha.
His wife who was near him saw the Buddha, but she was afraid that if her
husband saw the Buddha standing at the door for alms-food, he would offer all
his rice in the plate and, in that case, she would have to cook again. With
this thought in her mind, she stood behind her husband so that he would not see
the Buddha; when she quietly stepped backwards and slowly came to where the
Buddha was standing, and whispered to him, &quot;Venerable Sir! We do not have
any alms-food for you today.&quot; But the Buddha had decided not to leave the
house; he just shook his head. Seeing this gesture, the brahmin's wife could
not control herself and she burst out laughing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At
that instant, the brahmin turned round and saw the Buddha. At once he knew what
his wife had done, and he cried out, &quot;O you, my wretched wife! You have
ruined me.&quot; Then, taking up his plate of rice, he approached the Buddha
and apologetically requested, &quot;Venerable Sir! Please accept this rice
which I have partly consumed.&quot; To him the Buddha replied, &quot;O brahmin!
Any rice is suitable for me, whether it is not yet consumed, or is partly
consumed, or even if it is the last remaining spoonful.&quot; The brahmin was
very much surprised by the Buddha's reply; at the same time, it made him happy
because his offer of rice was accepted by the Buddha, The brahmin next asked
the Buddha by what standard a bhikkhu was judged and how a bhikkhu was defined.
The Buddha knew that both the brahmin and his wife had already learned
something about mind and body (<I>nama</I>-<I>rupa</I>); so he answered,
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;O brahmin! One who is not attached to mind and body

ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once
there was a very rich lady in the town of Kuraraghara, about one hundred and
twenty <I>yojanas</I> from Savatthi. She had a son who had become a bhikkhu;
his name was Sona. On one occasion, Bhikkhu Sona passed through his home town.
On his return from the Jetavana monastery his mother met him and organized a
grand charity in his honour. Having heard that Bhikkhu Sona could expound the
Dhamma very well she also requested him to expound the Dhamma to her and other
people of the home town. Bhikkhu Sona complied with her request. So a pavilion
was built and a meeting was organized for Bhikkhu Sona to give a discourse.
There was a large gathering at the pavilion; the mother of the bhikkhu also
went to listen to the Dhamma expounded by her son. She took all the members of
her household with her leaving only a maid to look after the house.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While
the lady was away, some thieves broke into the house. Their leader, however,
went io the pavilion where the mistress of the house was, sat down near her and
kept an eye on her. His intention was to get rid of her should she return home
early on learning about the theft at her house. The maid seeing the thieves
breaking into the house went to report the matter to her mistress, but the lady
only said, &quot;Let the thieves take all my money, I don't care; but do not
come and disturb we while I am listening to the Dhamma. You'd better go
back.&quot; So the maid went home.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There
the girl saw the thieves breaking into the room where her mistress kept all her
silverware. Again she went to the pavilion where her mistress was and reported
to her that thieve; were taking away her silverware, but she was given the same
answer as before. So she had to go back to the house. There she saw the thieves
breaking into the room where her mistress kept her gold and she reported the
matter to her mistress. This time, her mistress shouted at her, &quot;O dear!
Let the thieves take whatever they wish to take; why do you have to come and
worry me again when I am listening to a discourse on the Dhamma? Why did you
not go back when I told you to? Don't you dare come near me again and say
things about the theft or the thieves.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
leader of the gang of thieves who was close at hand heard everything the lady
had said and he was extremely surprised. Her words also kept him thinking,
&quot;If we take away the property of this wise and noble person, we will
surely be punished; we might even be struck by lightning and our heads broken
into many pieces. &quot;The leader got alarmed over this possibility and he
hurried back to the house of the lady and made his followers return all the
things they had taken. He then took all his followers to where the mistress of
the house was; she was still at the pavilion, listening attentively to the
Dhamma.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thera
Sona finished his exposition on the Dhamma with the crack of dawn and came down
from the dais from where he had expounded the Dhamma. The leader of the thieves
approached the rich, noble lady, paid respect to her and revealed his identity
to her. He also related to her how they had plundered her house and also that
they had returned all her property on hearing her words to her maid, who
reported the theft to her during the night. Then, the leader and all the
thieves asked the lady to forgive them for having wronged her. Then, they asked
Thera Sona to admit them to the Order of bhikkhus. After the admission, each
one of the nine hundred bhikkhus took a subject of meditation from Thera Sona
and went to the nearby forest to practise meditation in seclusion.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From

asked him teasingly, &quot;Why don't you go to your teacher now?&quot; To those
bhikkhus, he replied, &quot;I used to go to my teacher because I had need of
him; but now, I have no need to go to him.&quot; The bhikkhus understood what
he meant by his answer and they went to the Buddha and reported,
&quot;Venerable Sir! Thera Nangala claims to have attained arahatship. It
cannot be true; he must be boasting, he must be telling lies.<FONT
COLOR="#0000FF">&quot; To them the Buddha said, &quot;Bhikkhus! Do not say so;
for Nalagala is not telling lies. My son Nangala, by reproaching himself and
correcting himself, has indeed attained arahatship.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then
the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:</P>

was a brahmin who lived in Savatthi. One day when he saw the Buddha going on an
alms-round in the city, he was very much impressed by the noble appearance of
the Buddha. At the same time, he felt much affection and great reverence for
the Buddha and asked permission to join the Order just to be near him. As a
bhikkhu. Vakkali always kept close to the Buddha; he did not care much about
other duties of a bhikkhu and did not at all practise concentration meditation.
So, the Buddha said to him, <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;Vakkali, it will be of
no use to you by always keeping close to me, looking at my face. You should
practise concentration meditation; for, indeed, only the one who sees the
Dhamma sees me. One who does not see the Dhamma does not see me. So, you must
leave my presence.&quot; </FONT>When he heard those words Vakkali felt very
depressed. He left the Buddha as ordered, and climbed the Gijjhakuta hill with
the intention of committing suicide by jumping down from the peak.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Buddha, knowing full well the extent of Vakkali's grief and despondency,
reflected that because of his great sorrow and despondency Vakkali might miss
the chance of attaining the Maggas. Accordingly, he sent forth his radiance to
Vakkali, made him feel his presence and appeared as if in person to Vakkali.
With the Buddha near him, Vakkali soon forgot all his sorrow; he became
cheerful and very much heartened.</P>

Sumana was a pupil of Thera Anuruddha. Although he was only seven years old he
was an arahat, endowed with supernormal powers. Once, when his teacher
Anuruddha was ill at a monastery in a forest of the Himalayas, he fetched water
from the Anotatta lake which was five hundred yojanas away from the monastery.
The journey was made not by land but by air through his supernormal power.
Later, Thera Anuruddha took Samanera Sumana to the Buddha, who was then
sojourning at Pubbarama, the monastery donated by Visakha.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There, other young bhikkhus and samaneras teased him by patting his head, or
pulling his ears, nose and arms, and jokingly asked him if he was not feeling
bored. The Buddha saw them and thought that he would make those young bhikkhus
see the rare qualities of young Samanera Sumana. So it was made known by the
Buddha that he wanted some samanera to get a jar of water from the Anotatta
lake. The Venerable Ananda searched among the bhikkhus and samaneras of the
Pubbarama monastery, but there was none who was able to undertake the job.
finally, the Venerable Ananda asked Samanera Sumana who readily agreed to fetch
water from the Anotatta lake. He took a big golden jar front the monastery and
soon brought the water from the Anotatta lake for the Buddha. As before, he
went to the Anotatta lake and came back by air through his supernormal power.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At
the congregation of the bhikkhus in the evening, the bhikkhus told the Buddha
about the wonderful trip made by Samanera Sumana. To them the Buddha said,<FONT

zealously is capable of attaining supernormal powers, even though he is
young.&quot;</FONT></P>
