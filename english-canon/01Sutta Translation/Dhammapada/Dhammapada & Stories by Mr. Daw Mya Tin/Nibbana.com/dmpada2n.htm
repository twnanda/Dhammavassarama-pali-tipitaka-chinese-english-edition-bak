the bhikkhus, &quot;If people come to offer robes, send them to me or inform
me&quot;; and then he left for the Jetavana monastery to pay homage to the
Buddha. Other bhikkhus misunderstood Thera Sariputta's instructions, and said

material things like robes and other requisites of a bhikkhu.&quot; To them the
Buddha replied, <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;Bhikkhus! My son Sariputta has no

had, in a previous existence, made offerings of sandalwood to a stupa where the
relics of Kassapa Buddha were enshrined-For this good deed, he was reborn in a
brahmin family in Savatthi. He was born with a distinguishing mark, viz., a
circle of light radiating from around his navel. As this circle of light
resembled the moon he came to be known as Candabha. Some brahmins, taking
advantage of this unusual feature, put him on a cart and took him round the
town for exhibition and only those who paid a hundred or a thousand were
allowed to touch him. On one occasion, they stopped at a place between the town
and the Jetavana monastery. To <I>ariyas</I> going to the Jetavana monastery,
they said, 'What is the use of your going to the Buddha and listening to his
discourses? There is no one who is as powerful as Candabha. One who touches him
will get rich; why don't you come and see ?&quot; The <I>ariyas</I> then said
to them, &quot;Only our teacher is powerful; he is unrivalled and
matchless.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then
the brahmins took Candabha to the Jetavana monostely to compete with the
Buddha. But when Candabha was in the presence of the Buddha. the ring of light
went out by itself. When Candabha was taken out of sight of the Buddha, the
ring of light returned automatically; it again disappeared when taken back to
the presence of the Buddha. Candabha then asked the Buddha to give him the
mantra (words of incantation) that would make the ring of light disappear from
around his navel. The Buddha told him that the mantra could be given only to a
member of his Order. Candabha told the brahmins that he was getting a mantra
from the Buddha and that after mastering the mantra he would be the greatest
person in the whole of Jambudipa. So the brahmins waited outside the monastery.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Candabha became a bhikkhu. He was instructed to contemplate the
body, i.e., to reflect on the repulsiveness and impurity of the thirty-two
constituents of the body. Within a few days, Candabha attained arahat ship.
When the brahmins who were waiting outside the monastery came to enquire
whether he had acquired the mantra, Candabha replied. &quot;You people had
better go back now; as for me I am no longer in a position to go along with
you.&quot; Other bhikkhus, hearing him, went to the Buddha and said,
&quot;Candabha is falsely claiming that he has become an arahat.&quot; To them
the Buddha replied, &quot;Candabha speaks the truth; he has eradicated all
moral intoxicants.&quot;</P>

Suppavasa of Kundakoliya was in pregnancy for seven years and then for seven
days she was in labour pains. She kept contemplating the unique qualities of
the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Samgha and in the end she sent her husband to
the Buddha to pay obeisance to him on her behalf and to inform him of her
condition. When informed of the condition of the princess, the Buddha said,
&quot;May Suppavasa be free from danger and from sorrow; may she give birth to
a healthy noble son in safety.&quot; As these words were being spoken,
Suppavasa gave birth to her son at her house. On that very day, soon after the
birth of the child, the Buddha and some bhikkhus were invited to the house.
Alms-food was offered there and the newly born child offered filtered water to
the Buddha and the bhikkhus. To celebrate the birth of the child, the parents
invited the Buddha and the bhikkhus to their house to offer food for seven
days.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When
the child grew up he was admitted to the Order and as a bhikkhu he was known as
Sivali. He attained arahatship as soon as his head was shaved off. Later, he
became famous as the bhikkhu who received the largest amount of offerings. As a
recipient of offerings he was unsurpassed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On
one occasion, the bhikkhus asked the Buddha why Sivali, with the qualifications
to become an arahat, was confined in his mother's womb for seven years. To them
the Buddha replied, &quot;Bhikkhus! In a previous existence, Sivali was the son
of a king who lost his kingdom to another king. In trying to regain their
kingdom he had besieged the city on the advice of his mother. As a result, the
people in the city were without food or water for seven days. It was for this
evil deed that Sivali was imprisoned in his mother's womb for seven years. But
now, Sivali has come to the end of all dukkha; he has realized Nibbana.&quot;

Sundarasamudda was the son of a rich man from Savatthi. After he had entered
the Order, he left for Rajagaha, which was forty-five yojanas away from
Savatthi, to practise meditation. One day, while some festivities were going on
in Savatthi, the parents of Sundarasamudda missed him very much; they also felt
sorry for their son who was missing all the enjoyment and they wept. As they
were weeping, a courtesan came to them and asked what the matter was. On
hearing about their son, the courtesan said, &quot;If I could make your son
leave the Order and return to the life of a lay man how would you reward
me?&quot; The parents answered that they would make her rich. The courtesan
then asked for a large sum of money and left for Rajagaha with a number of
followers.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At
Rajagaha, she rented a house with seven-tiered pinnacles on the route where
Thera Sundarasamudda would come on his alms-round. She prepared good food and
waited for him. On the first few days, she offered alms-food to the thera at
the door of her house. Later, she invited him to come inside. Meanwhile, she
paid money to some children to come and play just outside the house about the
time the thera usually came on his alms-round. This gave her the excuse that it
was very dusty and noisy on the ground floor; with this excuse she invited the
thera to the top floor to have his alms-food. The thera consented and went up
and as soon as he had entered the room, the courtesan closed the door. Then she
started seducing the thera. She said to the thera, &quot;Venerable Sir! Please
be my youthful and energetic husband, and I will be your dearly beloved wife.
After our long and happy wedded life we can both leave it to enter the Order
and strive our very best to attain Nibbana.&quot; When he heard these words the
thera suddenly realized his mistake and got alarmed. Then he said to himself,
&quot;Indeed, by being negligent and unmindful I have made a great
mistake.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At
that instant, the Buddha saw from his Perfumed Chamber what was happening to
Thera Sundarasamudda at Rajagaha. He called the Venerable Ananda and said to
him, &quot;Ananda! On an upper storey of a pinnacled building in Rajagaha,
there now goes on a struggle between Sundarasamudda and a courtesan; but in the
end the thera will be the winner.&quot; After saying this to Ananda, the Buddha
sent forth his radiance to the thera, made him feel his presence, and said,
&quot;My son! Be resolute and get rid of love of wealth and sensual
pleasures.&quot;</P>

his wife were en gaged in a heated quarrel. The goldsmith shouted at the thera

the child in the pot and took it with her. She adopted him and named him
Jatila. Later, on the advice of a thera the woman sent Jatila to Taxila where
he had his education. While at Taxila the thera arranged for him to stay at the
house of a merchant who was a disciple of his. In due course, Jatila married
the daughter of the merchant. Soon after the marriage, a large mound of gold
appeared in the backyard of the house which was newly built for the couple.

offered alms-food to the Buddha and his disciples for fifteen days. Some time
afterwards, the bhikkhus asked Jatila whether he was still attached to his
mound of gold and his sons, and he answered that he had no more attachment to
them. The bhikkhus then said to the Buddha that Jatila was falsely claiming to
have attained arahatship. To them the Buddha said, &quot;Bhikkhus! Jatila has

tiered pinnacles. There were seven walls around his mansion, each of which had
an entrance guarded by celestial demons. The fame of his wealth spread far and
wide, and many people came to see his mansion. On one occasion, King Bimbisara
came to visit Jotika; he also brought his son Ajatasattu with him. Ajatasattu
seeing the grandeur of Jotika's mansion vowed that he would not allow Jotika to
live in such a magnificent mansion when he became king. On the king's departure
from his house Jotika presented the king with a large priceless ruby. It was
the custom of Jotika to give presents to all visitors who came to see him.</P>

Ajatasattu ascended the throne, after killing his father, he came with his
soldiers to take the mansion of Jotika by force. But as all the gates were well
guarded by celestial demons, Ajatasattu and his soldiers had to retreat.
Ajatasattu fled to the Veluvana monastery and he found Jotika listening to a
discourse given by the Buddha. Seeing Jotika at the feet of the Buddha,
Ajatasattu exclaimed, &quot;After making your guards fight me, you are now
pretending to be listening to a discourse!&quot; Jotika realized that the king
had gone to take his place by force and that he had been compelled to retreat.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a
past existence, Jotika had made a solemn wish that his properly might not be
taken away from him against his wish, and this wish had been fulfilled. So
Jotika said to King Ajatasattu, &quot;O king! My property cannot be taken away
against my wish.&quot; Saying this, he stretched out his ten fingers and asked
the king to take off the twenty rings he was wearing on his fingers. The king
tried hard to take them off but did not succeed. Jotika then asked the king to
spread out a piece of cloth and as Jotika put his fingers on to the cloth, all
his rings easily slipped off. After he had given all his rings to King
Ajatasattu, Jotika asked the Buddha that he might be permitted into the Order.
Soon after entering the Order, Jotika attained arahatship.</P>

the son of a dancer was going round the streets singing and dancing when he had
a chance to listen to a discourse given by the Buddha. After listening to the
discourse, he entered the Order and attained arahatship soon afterwards. One
day, while the Buddha and the bhikkhus including Nataputtaka were going on an
alms-round, they came across the son of another dancer dancing in the street.
Seeing the young man dancing, the other bhikkhus asked Nataputtaka whether he
still liked dancing. And Nataputtaka answered, &quot;No, I do not.&quot; The
bhikkhus then went to the Buddha and told him that Thera Nataputtaka was

Rajagaha, there was a brahmin by the name of Vangisa who by simply tapping on
the skull of a dead person could tell whether that person was reborn in the
world of the devas, or of the human beings, or in one of the four lower worlds
(apayas). The brahmins took Vangisa to many villages and people flocked to him
and paid him ten, twenty or a hundred to find out from him where their various
dead relatives were reborn.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On
one occasion, Vangisa and his party came to a place not far from the Jetavana
monastery. Seeing those people who were going to the Buddha, the brahmins
invited them to come to Vangisa who could tell where their relatives had been
reborn. But the Buddha's disciples said to them, &quot;Our teacher is one
without a rival, he only is the Enlightened One.&quot; The brahmins took that
statement as a challenge and took Vangisa along with them to the Jetavana
monastery to compete with the Buddha. The Buddha, knowing their intention,
instructed the bhikkhus to bring the skulls of a person reborn in niraya, of a
person reborn in the animal world, of a person reborn in the human world, of a
person reborn in the deva world and also of an arahat. The five were then
placed in a row. When Vangisa was shown those skulls he could tell where the
owners of the first four skulls were reborn but when he came to the skull of
the arahat he was at a loss. Then the Buddha said, &quot;Vangisa, don't you
know? I do know where the owner of that skull is.&quot; Vangisa then asked the
Buddha to let him have the magical incantation (mantra) by which he could thus
know; but the Buddha told him that the mantra could be given only to a bhikkhu.
Vangisa then told the brahmins to wait outside the monastery while he was being
taught the mantra. Thus,Vangisa became a bhikkhu and as a bhikkhu, he was
instructed by the Buddha to contemplate the thirty-two constituents of the
body. Vangisa diligently practised meditation as instructed by the Buddha and
attained arahatship within a short time.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When
the brahmins who were waiting outside the monastery came to ask Vangisa whether
he had acquired the mantra, Vangisa said, &quot;You all had better go now; as
for me, I should no longer go along with you.&quot; Other bhikkhus hearing him
thought he was telling lies, so they went to the Buddha and said,
&quot;Venerable Sir! Vangisa is falsely claiming to have attained
arahatship.&quot; To them the Buddha 'said, &quot;Bhikkhus! Vangisa really
