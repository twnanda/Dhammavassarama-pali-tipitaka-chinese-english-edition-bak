Savatthi, there lived a brahmin who became extremely devoted to the Buddha and
his Teaching, after hearing a discourse given by the Buddha. Every day, he
invited the bhikkhus to his house for alms-food. When the bhikkhus arrived at
his house, he addressed them as &quot;arahats&quot; and respectfully requested
them to enter his house. When thus addressed, the puthujjana bhikkhus and the
arahats felt embarrassed and they decided not to go to the brahmin's house the
next day.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When
the brahmin found that the bhikkhus did not come to his house again he felt
unhappy. He went to the Buddha and told him about the bhikkhus not coming to
his house. The Buddha sent for those bhikkhus and asked for explanation. The
bhikkhus told the Buddha about the brahmin addressing all of them as arahats.
The Buddha then asked them whether they felt any false pride and undue elation
when they were thus addressed. The bhikkhus answered in the negative. To them
the Buddha said, <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;Bhikkhus, if you don't feel any
false pride and undue elation when addressed as arahats, you are not guilty of
breaking any of the rules of discipline of the bhikkhus. The fact is that the
brahmin addressed you so because he was extremely devoted to the arahats. So.
my sons, you should strive hard to get rid of craving and attain
arahatship.&quot;</FONT></P>

great patience and extreme endurance. If he is abused or even beaten by others,
he does not lose his temper but remains calm and composed.&quot; As this was
often said of the Venerable Sariputta, a brahmin holding wrong views declared
to the admirers of Sariputta that he would provoke the Venerable Sariputta into
anger. At that moment, the Venerable Sariputta, Who was on his alms-round,
appeared on the scene; the brahmin went after him and hit him hard on his back
with his hand. 'The thera did not even look round to see who was the person
that attacked him, but proceeded on his way as if nothing had happened. Seeing
the magnanimity and great fortitude of the noble thera, the brahmin was very
much shaken. He got down on his knees at the feet of the Venerable Sariputta,
admitted that he had wrongfully hit the thera, and asked for pardon. The
brahmin then continued, &quot;Venerable Sir, should you forgive me, kindly come
to my house for alms-food.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In

they observed that the brahmin was sure to get bolder and he would soon be
assaulting other bhikkhus also. To those bhikkhus, the Buddha replied,<FONT

Mahapajapati Gotami was the stepmother of Gotama Buddha. On the death of Queen,
seven days after the birth of Prince Siddhattha, Mahapajapati Gotami became the
chief queen of King Suddhodana. At that time, her own son Nanda was only five
days old. She let her own son be fed by a wet-nurse, and herself fed Prince
Siddhattha, the future Buddha. Thus, Mahapajapati Gotami was a great benefactor
to Prince Siddhattha.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When
Prince Siddhattha returned to Kapilavatthu after the attainment of Buddhahood,
Mahapajapati Gotami went to see the Buddha and requested that women should also
be allowed to enter the Buddhist Order as bhikkhunis; but the Buddha refused
permission. Later, King Suddhodana died after attaining arahatship. Then, while
the Buddha was sojourning at the Mahavana forest near Vesali, Mahapajapati,
accompanied by five hundred ladies, came on foot from Kapilavatthu to Vasali.
They had already shaven their heads and had put on the dyed robes. There, for a
second time, Mahapajapati requested the Buddha to accept women in the Buddhist
Order. The Venerable Ananda also interceded on her behalf. So, the Buddha
complied, with the proviso that Mahapajapati abides by eight special conditions
(garudhammas). Mahapajapati undertook to observe the garudhammas as required,
and the Buddha admitted her into the Order. Thus, Mahapajapati was the first to
be admitted to the Order of the bhikkhunis. The other women were admitted to
the Order after her by the bhikkhus as instructed by the Buddha.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
course of time, it came to the minds of some bhikkhunis that Mahapajapati
Gotami had not been properly admitted as a bhikkhuni because she did not have a
preceptor; therefore. Mahapajapati Gotami was not a true bhikkhuni. With this
thought in their mind, they stopped doing sabbath (uposatha) ceremonies and
vassa (pavarana) ceremonies with her. They went to the Buddha and posed the
problem of Mahapajapati Gotami not having been properly admitted to the Order
of bhikkhunis as she had no preceptor. To them the Buddha replied,
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;Why do you say so? I myself gave the eight
garudhammas to Mahapajapati and she had learnt and practised the garudhammas as
required by me. I myself am her preceptor and it is quite wrong for you to say
that she has no preceptor. You should harbour no doubt whatsoever about an
arahat.&quot;</FONT></P>

Venerable Sariputta was born of brahmin parents of Upatissa village; that was
why he was named Upatissa. His mother was Sari. His very close friend was
Kolita, another brahmin youth, son of Moggali. Both the youths were searching
for the right doctrine, which would lead them to liberation from the round of
rebirths, and both of them had a great desire to enter a religious Order.
First, they went to Sancaya, but they were not satisfied with his teaching.
Then they wandered all over Jambudipa looking for a teacher who would show them
the way to the Deathless, but their search was fruitless. After some time, they
parted company but with the understanding that the one who found the true
dhamma first should inform the other.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About
that time, the Buddha arrived at Rajagaha with a company of bhikkhus, including
Thera Assaji, one of the group of the first Five Bhikkhus (Pancavaggis). While
Thera Assaji was on an alms-round, Upatissa saw the thera and was very much
impressed by his noble countenance. So Upatissa respectfully approached the
thera and asked who his teacher was, what doctrine his teacher taught, and also
briefly to explain the doctrine to him. Thera Assaji then told Upatissa about
the arising of the Buddha and about his sojourn at the Veluvana monastery in
Rajagaha. The thera also quoted a short stanza connected with the Four Noble

the Veluvana monastery, they asked permission to enter the Buddhist Order, and
both Upatissa and Kolita, together with their two hundred and fifty followers,
were admitted as bhikkhus. Upatissa, son of Sari, and Kolita, son of Moggali,
then came to be known as Sariputta and Moggallana. Soon after their admission
to the Order, the Buddha expounded to them a dhamma and the two hundred and
fifty bhikkhus attained arahatship; but Moggallana and Sariputta attained
arahatship only at the end of seven days and fifteen days respectively. The
reason for the delay in their attainment of arahatship was that they had made a
wish for Chief Discipleship, which required much more striving to achieve
perfection.</P>

Venerable Sariputta always remembered that he had been able to meet the Buddha
and attain the Deathless through the Venerable Assaji. So, he always paid
obeisance in the direction where his teacher was and he always went to bed with
his head lying in the same direction. Other bhikkhus who were staying with him
at the Jetavana monastery misinterpreted his actions and said to the Buddha,
&quot;Venerable Sir! The Venerable Sariputta still worships the various
directions, viz., the East, the South, the West, the North, the Nadir and the
Zenith, as he has done before as a brahmin youth; it seems as if he has not yet
given up his old beliefs.&quot; The Buddha sent for the Venerable Sariputta and
Sariputta explained to the Buddha that he was only paying obeisance to his
teacher, the Venerable Assaji, and that he was not worshipping the various
directions. The Buddha was satisfied with the explanation given by the
Venerable Sariputta and said to the other bhikkhus,<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
&quot;Bhikkhus! The Venerable Sariputta was net worshipping the various
directions; he was only paying obeisance to his teacher and benefactor, through
whom he had attained the Deathless. It is quite right and proper for him to pay
homage to such a teacher.&quot;</FONT></P>

there was a brahmin, whose wife was in the habit of blurting out a string of
words whenever she sneezed or when something or someone touched her unawares.
One day, the brahmin invited some of his friends to a meal and suddenly she
blurted out some words. Since she was a Sotapanna, the words<I><FONT

words of veneration to the Buddha were very much disliked by her husband, the
brahmin. So, in anger, he went to the Buddha hoping to put some challenging
questions to the Buddha. His first question was, &quot;What do we have to kill
to be able to live happily and peacefully?&quot; and his second question was,
&quot;Killing of what dhamma do you approve of?&quot; To these questions, the
Buddha replied,<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"> &quot; O brahmin, to be able to live
happily and peacefully, one will have to kill ill will (dosa). Killing one's
ill will is liked and praised by the Buddhas and the arahats.&quot;

with the answer that he asked to be permitted to enter the Order. Accordingly,
he entered the Order and later became an arahat.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
brahmin had a brother who was very notorious for his abusive words and was
known as Akkosaka Bharadvaja, the abusive Bharadvaja. When Akkosaka Bharadvaja
heard that his brother had joined the Order of the bhikkhus, he was furious. He
went straight away to the monastery and abused the Buddha. The Buddha in his
turn asked, &quot;O brahmin, let us suppose you offered some food to some
guests and they left the house without taking the food. Since the guests did
not accept your food, to whom would that food belong?&quot; To this question
the brahmin answered that the food would be his. On receiving that answer, the
Buddha said, <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;In the same way, O brahmin, since I do
not accept your abuse, the abuse would only go back to you.&quot;</FONT>
Akkosaka Bharadvaja instantly realized the sagacity of those words and he felt
a great respect for the Buddha. He also entered the Order and in due course
became an arahat.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After
Akkosaka Bharadvaja had entered the Order, his two younger brothers also came
to see the Buddha with the same intention of abusing the Buddha. They too were
made to see the light by the Buddha and they also, in their turn, entered the
Order. Eventually, both of them became arahats.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One
evening, at the congregation of the bhikkhus, the bhikkhus said to the Buddha,
&quot;O how wonderful and how great are the virtues of the Buddha! The four
brahmin brothers came here to abuse the Buddha; instead of arguing with them,
he made them see the light, and as a result, the Buddha has become a refuge to
them.&quot; To them, the Buddha replied,<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"> &quot;Bhikkhus!

Tissa, after taking a subject of meditation from the Buddha, went to a mountain
side. There, he found a cave which suited him and he decided to spend the three
months of the rainy season (vassa) in that cave. So he stayed in the cave and
went to the village for alms-food every morning. In the village, there was a
certain elderly woman who regularly offered him alms-food. In the cave, there
also lived the guardian spirit of the cave. As the thera was one whose practice
of morality was pure, the cave-spirit dared not live in the same cave with the
noble thera; at the same time, he did not have the courage to ask the thera to
leave the place. So he thought of a plan that would enable him to find fault
with the thera and thus cause him to leave the cave.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
cave-spirit possessed the son of the elderly woman from the house where the
thera usually went for his alms-food. He caused the boy to behave in a very
peculiar way, turning his head backwards, and rolling his wide open eyes. His
mother got alarmed and was in tears. The cave-spirit, who possessed the boy,
then said &quot;Let your teacher, the thera, wash his feet with water and pour
that water on the head of your son.&quot; The next day when the thera came to
her house for alms-food, she did as she was advised by the cave-spirit and the
boy was left in peace. The cave-spirit went back to the cave and waited at the
entrance for the return of the thera. When the thera returned from his
alms-round, the cave-spirit revealed himself and said, &quot;I am the spirit
guarding this cave. O you physician, do not enter this cave.&quot; The thera
knew that he had lived a clean life from the day he had become a thera, so he
replied that he did not remember practising medicine. Then the cave-spirit
accused him that in that very morning he had cured a young boy possessed by an
ogre at the house of the elderly woman. But the thera reflected that it was
not, in fact, practising medicine and he realized that even the cave spirit
could find no other fault with him. That gave him a delightful satisfaction
(<I>piti</I>) with himself, and abandoning <I>piti</I> and concentrating hard
on Insight Meditation he attained arahatship then and there, while still
standing at the entrance to the cave.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As
the thera had now become an arahat, he advised the cave-spirit to leave the
cave. The thera continued to stay there till the end of the vassa, and then he
returned to the Buddha. When he told the other bhikkhus about his encounter
with the cave-spirit, they asked him whether he did not get angry with the
cave-spirit when he was forbidden to enter the cave. The thera answered in the
negative but they did not believe him. So they went to the Buddha and said,
&quot;Thera Tissa claims himself to be an arahat ; he is not speaking the
truth.&quot; To them the Buddha replied,<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"> &quot;Bhikkhus,
my son Tissa was speaking the truth when he said he did not get angry. He has
indeed become an arahat he is no longer attached to anyone; he has no occasion

passed through a village. Just as he was going through the village, a woman
having quarrelled with her husband came out of her house and followed the
bhikkhus. The husband coming after his wife, seeing her behind the bhikkhu,
thought that the bhikkhu was taking his wife away. So he shouted at the bhikkhu
and threatened to beat him. His wife entreated him not to beat the bhikkhu, but
that made him more furious. As a result, the thera was beaten black and blue by

invite four bhikkhus to an alms-meal at their house. She told him to
specifically request for senior bhikkhus who were also true brahmanas. But four
seven year old arahat samaneras, viz., Samkicca, Pandita, Sopaka and Revata
were sent along with him. When his wife saw the young samaneras she was very
much dissatisfied and blamed the brahmin for bringing such young samaneras who
were even younger than her grandson. She was, in fact, furious with her
husband, and so she sent him back to the monastery to get older bhikkhus. In

for the bhikkhus; they were given lower seats and she did not offer them
alms-food.</P>

been offered alms-food yet. On learning that the arahat samaneras had not been
given alms-food yet and also that food had been prepared only for four persons
the Venerable Sariputta returned to the monastery without accepting alms-food
from the house of the brahmin. So his wife sent the brahmin back again to the
monastery to get another senior bhikkhu. This time, the Venerable Maha
Moggallana came along with the brahmin, but he also returned to the monastery
without accepting alms-food when he learned that the young samaneras had not
been offered alms-food and also that food had been prepared only for four

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By

the state of things took the form of an old brahmin and came to the house. The
brahmin and his wife paid respect to the old brahmin and offered him a seat of
honour, but Sakka just sat on the ground and paid respect to the four
samaneras. Then he revealed that he was Sakka. Seeing that Sakka himself was
paying respect to the young samaneras, the brahmin couple offered alms-food to
all the five. After the meal, Sakka and the samaneras manifested their
supernormal power by going right up into the sky through the roof. Sakka went
back to his celestial abode, the samaneras returned to the monastery.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When
