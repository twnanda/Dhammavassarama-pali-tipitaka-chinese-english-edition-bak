Jetavana monastery-complex with the intention of occupying it, when another
group comprising six bhikkhus arrived on the scene. The group of six said to
the first group, &quot;We are senior to you, so you had better give way to us;
we will take this place.&quot; The group of seventeen did not give in, so the

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> While res ding at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
uttered Verses (133) and (134) of this book, with reference to Thera
Kondadhana. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Since the day Kondadhana was admitted to the Order, the
image of a female was always following him. This image was seen by others, but
Kondadhana himself did not see it and so did not know about it.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> When he was out on an alms-round, people would offer two
spoonfuls to him, saying, &quot;This is for you, Venerable Sir, and this is for
your female companion.&quot; Seeing the bhikkhu going about with a woman,
people went to King Pasenadi of Kosala and reported about the bhikkhu and the
woman. They said to the king, &quot;O king! Drive out the bhikkhu, who is
lacking in moral virtues, from your kingdom.&quot; So the king went to the
monastery where that bhikkhu was staying and surrounded it with his men. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Hearing noises and voices, the bhikkhus came out and stood
at the door, and the image also was there not far from the bhikkhu. Knowing
that the king had come, the bhikkhu went into the room to wait for him. When
the king entered the room, the image was not there. The king asked the bhikkhu
where the woman was and he replied that he saw no woman. The king wanted to
make sure and he asked the bhikkhu to leave the room for a while. The bhikkhu
left the room, but when the king looked out, again he saw the woman near the
bhikkhu. But when the bhikkhu came back to the room the woman was nowhere to be
found. The king concluded that the woman was not real and so the bhikkhu must
be innocent. He therefore invited the bhikkhu to come to the palace every day
for alms-food. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> When other bhikkhus heard about this, they were puzzled and
said to the bhikkhu, &quot;O bhikkhu with no morals! Now that the king, instead
of driving you out of his kingdom, has invited you for alms-food, you are
doomed!&quot; The bhikkhu on his part retorted, &quot;Only you are the ones
without morals; only you are doomed because you are the ones who go about with
women!&quot; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The bhikkhus then reported the matter to the Buddha. The
Buddha sent for Kodadadhana and said to him, &quot;My son, did you see any
woman with the other bhikkhus that you have talked to them thus? You have not
seen any woman with them as they have seen one with you. I see that you do not
realize that you have been cursed on account of an evil deed done by you in a
past existence. Now listen, I shall explain to you why you have an image of a
woman following you about.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &quot;You were a deva in your last existence. During that
time, there were two bhikkhus who were very much attached to each other. But
you tried to create trouble between the two, by assuming the appearance of a
woman and following one of the bhikkhus. For that evil deed you are now being
followed by the image of a woman So, my son, in future do not argue with other
bhikkhus any more; keep silent like a gong with the rim broken off and you will

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Once, five hundred ladies from Savatthi came to the
Pubbarama monastery to keep the Uposatha Sila vows. The donor of the monastery,
the well - renowned Visakha, asked different age groups of ladies why they had
come to keep the sabbath. She got different answers from different age groups
for they had come to the monastery for different reasons. The old ladies came
to the monastery to keep the sabbath because they hoped to gain the riches and
glories of the devas in their next existence; the middle-aged ladies had come
to the monastery because they did not want to stay under the same roof with the
mistresses of their respective husbands. The young married ladies had come
because they wanted their first born to be a son, and the young unmarried
ladies had come because they wanted to get married to good husbands.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Having had these answers, Visakha took all the ladies to
the Buddha. When she told the Buddha about the various answers of the different
age groups of ladies, the Buddha said, &quot;Visakha! Birth, ageing and death
are always actively working in beings; because one is born, one is subject to
ageing and decay, and finally to death. Yet, they do not wish to strive for
liberation from the round of existences (samsara); they still wish to linger in
samsara&quot; </P>

said he himself had also seen that very peta soon after he had attained
Buddhahood, but that he did not say anything about it because people might not
believe him and thus they would be doing a great wrong to the Buddha. So out of
compassion for these beings, the Buddha had kept silent. Then he continued,
&quot;Now that I have a witness in Moggallana, I will tell you about this boa
constrictor peta. This peta was a thief during the time of Kassapa Buddha. As a
thief and a cruel-hearted man, he had set fire to the house of a rich man seven
times. And not satisfied with that, he also set fire to the perfumed hall
donated by the same rich man to Kassapa Buddha, while Kassapa Buddha was out on
an alms-round. As a result of those evil deeds he had suffered for a long time
in niraya. Now, while serving out his term of suffering as a peta, he is being
burnt with sparks of flames going up and down the length of his body. Bhikkhus,
fools when doing evil deeds do not know them as being evil; but they cannot

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
uttered Verses (137), (138), (139) and (140) of this book, with reference to
Thera Maha Moggallana.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Once, the Nigantha ascetics planned to kill Thera Maha
Moggallana because they thought that by doing away with Thera Maha Moggallana
the fame and fortune of the Buddha would also be diminished. So they hired some
assassins to kill Thera Maha Moggallana who was staying at Kalasila near
Rajagaha at that time. The assassins surrounded the monastery; but Thera Maha
Moggallana, with his supernormal power, got away first through a key hole, and
for the second time through the roof. Thus, they could not get hold of the
Thera for two whole months. When the assassins again surrounded the monastery
during the third month, Thera Maha Moggallana, recollecting that he had yet to
pay for the evil deeds done by him during one of his past existences, did not
exercise his supernormal power. So he was caught and the assassins beat him up
until all his bones were utterly broken. After that, they left his body in a
bush, thinking that he had passed away. But the Thera, through his jhanic
power, revived himself and went to see the Buddha at the Jetavana monastery.
When he informed the Buddha that he would soon realize parinibbana at Kalasila,
near Rajagaha, the Buddha told him to go only after expounding the Dhamma to
the congregation of bhikkhus, as that would be the last time they would see
him. So, Thera Maha Moggallana expounded the Dhamma and left after paying
obeisance seven times to the Buddha.</P>
<P> The news of the passing away of Thera Maha Moggallana at the hands of
assassins spread like wild fire. King Ajatasattu ordered his men to investigate
and get hold of the culprits. The assassins were caught and they were burnt to
death. The bhikkhus felt very sorrowful over the death of Thera Maha
Moggallana, and could not understand why such a personage like Thera Maha
Moggallana should die at the hands of assassins. To them the Buddha said,
&quot;Bhikkhus! Considering that Moggallana had lived a noble life in this
existence, he should not have met with such a death. But in one of his past
existences, he had done a great wrong to his own parents, who were both blind.
In the beginning, he was a very dutiful son, but after his marriage, his wife
began to make trouble and she suggested that he should get rid of his parents.
He took his blind parents in a cart into a forest, and there he killed them by
beating them and making them believe that it was some thief who was beating
them. For that evil deed he suffered in niraya for a long time; and in this
existence, his last, he has died at the hands of assassins. Indeed, by doing
wrong to those who should not be wronged, one is sure to suffer for it.&quot;

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
uttered Verse (141) of this book, with reference to Bahubhandika, a bhikkhu
with many possessions.</P>
<P> Once there was a rich man in Savatthi. After the death of his wife, he
decided to become a bhikkhu. But before he entered the Order, he built a
monastery, which included a kitchen and a store room. He also brought his own
furniture, utensils and a large stock of rice, oil, butter and other
provisions. Whatever dishes he wanted was cooked for him by his servants. Thus,
even as a bhikkhu he was living in comfort, and because he had so many things
with him, he was known as 'Bahubhandika.' One day, other bhikkhus took him to
the Buddha, and in his presence told the Buddha about the many things he had
brought along with him to the monastery, and also how he was still leading the
luxurious life of a rich man. So, the Buddha said to Bahubhandika, &quot;My
son, I have been teaching all of you to live an austere life; why have you
brought so much property with you ?&quot; When reprimanded even this much, that
bhikkhu lost his temper and said angrily, &quot;Indeed, Venerable Sir! I will
now live as you wish me to.&quot; So saying, he cast off his upper robe. </P>
<P> Seeing him thus, the Buddha said to him, &quot;My son, in your last
existence you were an ogre; even as an ogre you had a sense of shame and a
sense of fear to do evil. Now that you are a bhikkhu in my Teaching, why do you
have to throw away the sense of shame, and the sense of fear to do evil?&quot;
When he heard those words, the bhikkhu realized his mistake; his sense of shame
and fear to do evil returned, and he respectfully paid obeisance to the Buddha
and asked that he should be pardoned. The Buddha then said to him,
&quot;Standing there without your upper robe is not proper; just discarding
your robe etc., does not maker you an austere bhikkhu; a bhikkhu must also
discard his doubt.&quot; </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha

King Pasenadi of Kosala.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> On one occasion, Santati the minister returned after
suppressing a rebellion on the border. King Pasenadi was so pleased with him
that he honoured the minister with the gift of the riches and glory of a ruler
together with a dancing girl to entertain him for seven days. For seven days,
the king's minister enjoyed himself to his heart's content, getting intoxicated
with drink and infatuated with the young dancer. On the seventh day, riding the
ornamented royal elephant, he went down to the riverside for a bath. On the
way, he met the Buddha going on an alms-round, and being drunk, he just bowed
casually, as a sign of respect to the Buddha. The Buddha smiled, and Ananda
asked the Buddha why he smiled. So, the Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;Ananda,
this minister will come to see me this very day and after I have given him a
short discourse will become an arahat. Soon after becoming an arahat he will
realize parinibbana.&quot; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Santati and his party spent the whole day at the riverside,
bathing, eating, drinking and thus thoroughly enjoying themselves. In the
evening the minister and his party went to the garden to have mire drinks and
to be entertained by the dancer. The dancer, on her part, tried her best to
entertain the minister. For the whole week she was living on reduced diet to
keep herself trim. While dancing, she suffered a severe stroke and collapsed,
and at that instant she died with her eyes and mouth wide open. The minister
was shocked and deeply distressed. In agony, he tried to think of a refuge and
remembered the Buddha. He went to the Buddha, accompanied by his followers, and
related to him about the grief and anguish he suffered on account of the sudden
death of the dancer. He then said to the Buddha, &quot;Venerable Sir! Please
help me get over my sorrow; be my refuge, and let me have the peace of
mind.&quot; To him the Buddha replied, &quot;Rest assured my son, you have come
to One, who could help you, One who could be a constant solace to you and who
will be your refuge. The tears you have shed due to the death of this dancer
throughout the round of rebirths is more than the waters of all the
oceans.&quot; The Buddha then instructed the minister in verse. The meaning of
the verse is as follows. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &quot;In the past there has been in you clinging (upadana)
due to craving; get rid of it. In future, do not let such clinging occur in
you. Do not also harbour any clinging in the present; by not having any
clinging, craving and passion will be calmed in you and you will realize
Nibbana.&quot; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> After hearing the verse, the minister attained arahatship.
Then, realizing that his life span was at an end, he said to the Buddha,
&quot;Venerable Sir! Let me now realize parinibbana, for my time has
come.&quot; The Buddha consenting, Santati rose to a height of seven
toddy-palms into the sky and there, while meditating on the element of fire
(tejo kasina), he passed away realizing parinibbana. His body went up in
flames, his blood and flesh burnt up and the bone relics (dhatu) fell through
the sky and dropped on the clean piece of cloth which was spread by the
bhikkhus as instructed by the Buddha. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
uttered Verses (143) and (144) of this book, with reference to Thera
Pilotikatissa. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Once, Thera Ananda saw a shabbily dressed youth going round
begging for food; he felt pity for the youth and made him a samanera. The young
samanera left his old clothes and his begging plate on the fork of a tree. When
he became a bhikkhu he was known as Pilotikatissa. As a bhikkhu, he did not
have to worry about food and clothing as he was in affluent circumstances. Yet,
sometimes he did not feel happy in his life as a bhikkhu and thought of going
back to the life of a lay man. Whenever he had this feeling, he would go back
to that tree where he had left his old clothes and his plate. There, at the
foot of the tree, he would put this question to himself, &quot;Oh shameless
one! Do you want to leave the place where you are fed well and dressed well? Do
you still want to put on these shabby clothes and go begging again with this
old plate in your hand?&quot; Thus, he would rebuke himself, and after calming
down, he would go back to the monastery. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> After two or three days, again, he felt like leaving the
monastic life of a bhikkhu, and again, he went to the tree where he kept his
old clothes and his plate. After asking himself the same old question and
having been reminded of the wretchedness of his old life, he returned to the
monastery. This was repeated many times. When other bhikkhus asked him why he
often went to the tree where he kept his old clothes and his plate, he told
them that he went to see his teacher.* Thus keeping his mind on his old clothes
as the subject of meditation, he came to realize the true nature of the
aggregates of the khandhas (i. e., anicca, dukkha, anatta), and eventually he
became an arahat. Then, he stopped going to the tree. Other bhikkhus noticing
that Pilotikatissa had stopped going to the tree where he kept his old clothes
and his plate asked him, &quot;Why don't you go to your teacher any more?&quot;
To them, he answered, &quot;When I had the need, I had to go to him; but there
is no need for me to go to him now.&quot; When the bhikkhus heard his reply,
they took him to see the Buddha. When they came to his presence they said,
&quot;Venerable Sir! This bhikkhu claims that he has attained arahatship; he
must be telling lies.&quot; But the Buddha refuted them, and said,
&quot;Bhikkhus! Pilotikatissa is not telling lies, he speaks the truth. Though
he had relationship with his teacher previously, now he has no relationship
whatsoever with his teacher. Thera Pilotikatissa has instructed himself to
differentiate right and wrong causes and to discern the true nature of things.
He has now become an arahat, and so there is no further connection between him

</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Sukha was made a samanera at the age of seven years by
Thera Sariputta. On the eighth day after being made a samanera he followed
Thera Sariputta on his alms-round. While doing the round they came across some
farmers irrigating their fields, some fletchers straightening their arrows and
some carpenters making things like cart-wheels, etc. Seeing these, he asked
Thera Sariputta whether these inanimate things could be guided to where one
wished or be made into things one wished to make, and the thera answered him in
the affirmative. The young samanera then pondered that if that were so, there
could be no reason why a person could not tame his mind and practise
Tranquillity and Insight Meditation. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> So, he asked permission from the thera to return to the
monastery. There, he shut himself up in his room and practised meditation in
solitude, Sakka and the devas also helped him in his practice by keeping the
monastery very quiet. That same day, the eighth day after his becoming a
samanera, Sukha attained arahatship. In connection with this, the Buddha said
to the congregation of bhikkhus, &quot;When a person earnestly practises the
Dhamma, even Sakka and the devas give protection and help. I myself have kept
Sariputta at the entrance so that Sukha should not be disturbed. The samanera,
having seen the farmers irrigating their fields, the fletchers straightening
their arrows and the carpenters making cart-wheels and other things, trains his
mind and practises the Dhamma. Thus, he has now become an arahat.&quot; </P>

be her constant companions. During a bacchanalian festival which lasted for
seven days, the wives of those men took all the drinks left by their husbands
and got drunk in the absence of Visakha. For this misbehaviour they were beaten
by their husbands. On another occasion, saying that they wished to listen to
the Buddha's discourse, they asked Visakha to take them to the Buddha and
secretly took small bottles of liquor hidden in their clothes. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> On arrival at the monastery, they drank all the liquor they
had brought and threw away the bottles. Visakha requested the Buddha to teach
them the Dhamma. By that time, the women were getting intoxicated and felt like

shameless, and soon they were boisterously singing, dancing, clapping and
jumping about in the monastery. The Buddha saw the hand of Mara in the
shameless behaviour of these women and said to himself, &quot;Mara must not be
given the opportunity.&quot; So, the Buddha sent forth dark-blue rays from his
body and the whole room was darkened; the women were frightened and began to
get sober. Then, the Buddha vanished from his seat and stood on top of Mount
Meru, and from there he sent forth white rays and the sky was lit up as if by a

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Once, there lived in Rajagaha, a very beautiful courtesan
by the name of Sirima. Every day Sirima offered alms-food to eight bhikkhus.
One of these bhikkhus happened to mention to other bhikkhus how beautiful
Sirima was and also that she offered very delicious food to the bhikkhus every
day. On hearing this, a young bhikkhu fell in love with Sirima even without
seeing her. The next day, the young bhikkhu went with the other bhikkhus to the
house of Sirima. Sirima was not well on that day, but since she wanted to pay
obeisance to the bhikkhus, she was carried to their presence. The young
bhikkhu, seeing Sirima, thought to himself, &quot;Even though she is sick, she
is very beautiful !&quot; And he felt a strong desire for her.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> That very night, Sirima died. King Bimbisara went to the
Buddha and reported to him that Sirima, the sister of Jivaka, had died. The
Buddha told King Bimbisara to take the dead body to the cemetery and keep it
there for three days without burying it, but to have it protected from crows
and vultures. The king did as he was told. On the fourth day, the dead body of
the beautiful Sirima was no longer beautiful or desirable; it got bloated and
maggots came out from the nine orifices. On that day, the Buddha took his
bhikkhus to the cemetery to observe the body of Sirima. The king also came with
his men. The young bhikkhu, who was so desperately in love with Sirima, did not
know that Sirima had died. When he learnt that the Buddha and the bhikkhus were
going to see Sirima, he joined them. At the cemetery, the corpse of Sirima was
surrounded by the bhikkhus headed by the Buddha, and also by the king and his
men. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The Buddha then asked the king to get a town crier announce
that Sirima would be available on payment of one thousand in cash per night.
But no body would lake her for one thousand, or for five hundred, or for two
hundred and fifty, or even if she were to be given free of charge. Then the
Buddha said to the audience, &quot;Bhikkhus! Look at Sirima. When she was
living, there were many who were willing to give one thousand to spend one
night with her; but now none would take her even if given without any payment.
The body of a person is subject to deterioration and decay.&quot;</P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"> While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered
Verse (150) of this book, with reference to Janapadakalyani.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Princess Janapadakalyani was the daughter of Gotami, the
step-mother of Gotama the Buddha; because she was very beautiful she was also
known as Rupananda. She was married to Nanda, a cousin of the Buddha. One day
she pondered, &quot;My elder brother who could have become a Universal Monarch
has renounced the world to become a bhikkhu; he is now a Buddha. Rahula, the
son of my elder brother, and my own husband Prince Nanda have also become
bhikkhus. My mother Gotami has also become a bhikkhuni, and I am all alone
here!&quot; So saying, she went to the monastery of some bhikkhunis and became
a bhikkhuni herself. Thus, she had become a bhikkhuni not out of faith but only
in imitation of others and because she felt lonely.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Rupananda had heard from others that the Buddha often
taught about the impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and insubstantiality of the
khandhas. So she thought he would talk deprecatingly about her good looks if he
should see her; and thus thinking, she kept away from the Buddha. But other
bhikkhunis coming back from the monastery, kept talking in praise of the
Buddha; so, one day, she decided to accompany other bhikkhunis to the
monastery.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The Buddha saw her and reflected, &quot;A thorn can only be
taken out with a thorn; Rupananda being very attached to her body and being
very proud of her beauty, I must take the pride and attachment out of her
through beauty.&quot; So, with his supernormal power, he caused an image of a
very beautiful lady of about sixteen years of age to be seated near him,
fanning him. This young girl was visible only to Rupananda and the Buddha. When
Rupananda saw the girl, she realized that compared to that girl, she herself
was just like an old, ugly crow compared to a beautiful white swan. Rupananda
had a good lock at the girl and she felt that she liked her very much. Then,
she looked again and was surprised to find that the girl had grown to the age
of about twenty. Again and again, she looked at the figure beside the Buddha
and every time she noticed that the girl had grown older and older. Thus, the
girl turned into a grown-up lady, then into a middle-aged lady, an old lady, a
decrepit and a very old lady successively. Rupananda also noticed that with the
arising of a new image, the old image disappeared, and she came to realize that
there was a continuous process of change and decay in the body. With the coming
of this realization, her attachment to the body diminished. Meanwhile, the
figure near the Buddha had turned into an old, decrepit lady, who could no
longer control her bodily functions, and was rolling in her own excreta.
Finally, she died, her body got bloated, pus and maggots came out of the nine
openings and crows and vultures were trying to snatch at the dead body.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Having seen all these, Rupananda pondered, &quot;This young
girl has grown old and decrepit and died in this very place under my own eyes.
In the same way, my body will also grow old and wear out; it will be subject to
disease and I will also die.&quot; Thus, she came to perceive the true nature
of the khandhas. At this point, the Buddha talked about the impermanence, the
unsatisfactoriness and the insubstantiality of the khandhas, and Rupananda
attained Sotapatti Fruition.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha

Pasenadi of Kosala.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> One day, Mallika went into the bathroom to wash her face,
hands and feet. Her pet dog also came in; as she was bending to wash her feet,
the dog tried to have sex with her, and the queen appeared to be amused and
somewhat pleased. The king saw this strange incident through the window from
his bedroom. When the queen came in, he said angrily to the queen, &quot;Oh,
you wicked woman! What were you doing with that dog in the bathroom? Do not
deny what I saw with my own eyes.&quot; The queen replied that she was only
washing her face, her hands and her feet, and so was doing nothing wrong. Then
she continued, &quot;But, that room is very strange. If anyone went into that
room, to one looking from this window there would appear to be two. If you do
not believe me, O King, please go into that room and I will look through this
window.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> So, the king went into the bathroom. When he came out,
Mallika asked the king why he misbehaved with a she-goat in that room The king
denied it, but the queen insisted that she saw them with her own eyes. The king
was puzzled, but being dim-witted, he accepted the queen's explanation, and
concluded that the bath room was, indeed, very strange.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> From that time, the queen was full of remorse for having
lied to the king and for having brazenly accused him of misbehaving with a
she-goat. Thus, even when she was approaching death, she forgot to think about
the great) unrivalled charities she had shared with her husband and only
remembered that she had been unfair to him. As a result of this, when she died
she was reborn in niraya. After her burial, the king intended to ask the Buddha
where she was reborn. The Buddha wished to spare his feelings, and also did not
want him to lose faith in the Dhamma. So he willed that this question should
not he put to him, and King Pasenadi forgot to ask the Buddha.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> However, after seven days in niraya, the queen was reborn
in the <I>Tusita</I> deva world. On that day, the Buddha went to King
Pasenadi's palace for alms-food; he indicated that he wished to rest in the
coach-shed where the royal carriages were kept. After offering alms-food, the
king asked the Buddha where queen Mallika was reborn and the Buddha replied,
&quot;Mallika has been reborn in the <I>Tusita deva</I> world.&quot; Hearing
this the king was very pleased, and said, 'Where else could she have been
reborn? She was always thinking of doing good deeds, always thinking what to
offer to the Buddha on the next day. Venerable Sir! Now that she is gone, I,
your humble disciple, hardly know what to do.&quot; To him the Buddha said,
&quot;Look at these carriages of your father and your grandfather; these are
all worn down and lying useless; so also is your body, which is subject to
death and decay. Only the Dhamma of the Virtuous is not subject to decay.&quot;

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> While residing at the Migadaya wood, the Buddha uttered
Verses (155) and (156) of this book, with reference to the son of Mahadhana, a
rich man from Baranasi.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The son of Mahadhana did not study while he was young; when
he came of age he married the daughter of a rich man, who, like him, also had
no education. When the parents on both sides died, they inherited eighty crores
from each side and so were very rich. But both of them were ignorant and knew
only how to spend money and not how to keep it or to make it grow. They just
ate and drank and had a good time, squandering their money. When they had spent
all, they sold their fields and gardens and finally their house. Thus, they
became very poor and helpless; and because they did not know how to earn a
living they had to go begging. One day, the Buddha saw the rich man's son
leaning against a wall of the monastery, taking the leftovers given him by the
samaneras; seeing him, the Buddha smiled.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The Venerable Ananda asked the Buddha why he smiled, and
the Buddha replied, &quot;Ananda, look at this son of a very rich man; he had
lived a useless life, an aimless life of pleasure. If he had learnt to look
after his riches in the first stage of his life he would have been a
top-ranking rich man; or if he had become a bhikkhu, he could have been an
arahat, and his wife could have been an anagami. If he had learnt to lock after
his riches in the second stage of his life he would have been a second rank
rich man, or if he had become a bhikkhu he could have been an anagami, and his
wife could have been a <I>sakadagami</I>. If he had learnt to look after his
riches in the third stage of his life he would have been a third rank rich man,
or if he had become a bhikkhu he could have been a sakadagami, and his wife
could have been a sotapanna. However, because he had done nothing in all the
three stages of his life he had lost all his worldly riches, he had also lost
all opportunities of attaining any of the Maggas and Phalas. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> While residing at the Bhesakala wood, the Buddha uttered
Verse (157) of this book, with reference to Prince Bodhi (Bodhirajakumara).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Once, Prince Bodhi built a magnificent palace for himself.
When the palace was finished he invited the Buddha for alms-food. For this
special occasion, he had the building decorated and perfumed with four kinds of
scents and incense. Also, a long length of cloth was spread on the floor,
starting from the threshold to the interior of the room. Then, because he had
no children, the prince made a solemn asseveration that if he were to have any
children the Buddha should step on the cloth. When the Buddha came, Prince
Bodhi respectfully requested the Buddha three times to enter the room. But the
Buddha, instead of moving, only looked at Ananda. Ananda understood him and so
asked Prince Bodhi to remove the cloth from the door-step. Then only, the
Buddha entered the palace. The prince then offered delicious and choice food to
the Buddha. After the meal, the prince asked the Buddha why he did not step on
the cloth. The Buddha in turn asked the prince whether he had not spread the
cloth making a solemn asseveration that if he were to be blessed with a child,
the Buddha would step on it; and the prince replied in the affirmative. To him,
the Buddha said that he and his wife were not going to have any children
because of their past evil deeds. The Buddha then related their past story. 
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> In one of their past existences, the prince and his wife
were the sole survivors of a shipwreck. They were stranded on a deserted
island, and there they lived by eating birds' eggs, fledglings and birds,
without any feeling of remorse at any time. For that evil deed, they would not
be blessed with any children. If they had felt even a slight remorse for their
deed at any stage of their lives, they could have a child or two in this
existence. Then turning to the prince, the Buddha said, &quot;One who loves
himself should guard himself in all stages of life, or at least, during one
stage in his life.&quot; </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
uttered Verse (158) of this book, with reference to Upananda, a thera of the
Sakyan Clan.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Upananda was a very eloquent preacher. He used to preach to
others not to be greedy and to have only a few wants and would talk eloquently
on the merits of contentment and frugality (<I>appicchata</I>) and austere
practices (<I>dhutangas</I>). However, he did not practise what he taught and
took for himself all the robes and other requisites that were given up by
others.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> On one occasion, Upananda went to a village monastery just
before the vassa. Some young bhikkhus, being impressed by his eloquence, asked
him to spend the vassa in their monastery. He asked them how many robes each
bhikkhu usually received as donation for the vassa in their monastery and they
told him that they usually received one robe each. So he did not stop there,
but he left his slippers in that monastery. At the next monastery, he learned
that the bhikkhus usually received two robes each for the vassa; there he left
his staff. At the next monastery, the bhikkhus received three robes each as
donation for the vassa; there he left his water bottle. Finally, at the
monastery where each bhikkhu received four robes, he decided to spend the
vassa.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> At the end of the vassa, he claimed his share of robes from
the other monasteries where he had left his personal effects. Then he collected
all his things in a cart and came back to his old monastery. On his way, he met
two young bhikkhus who were having a dispute over the share of two robes and a
valuable velvet blanket which they had between them. Since they could not come
to an amicable settlement, they asked Upananda to arbitrate. Upananda gave one
robe each to them and took the valuable velvet blanket for having acted as an
arbitrator.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The two young bhikkhus were not satisfied with the decision
but they could do nothing about it. With a feeling of dissatisfaction and
dejection, they went to the Buddha and reported the matter. To then the Buddha

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Thera Padhanikatissa, after taking a subject of meditation
from the Buddha, left for the forest with five hundred other bhikkhus. There,
he told the bhikkhus to be ever mindful and diligent in their meditation
practice. After thus exhorting others he himself would lie down and go to
sleep. The young bhikkhus did as they were told. They practised meditation
during the first watch of the night and when they were about to go to bed,
Padhanikatissa would get up and tell them to go back to their practice. When
they returned after meditation practice during the second and third watches
also he would say the same thing to them.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> As he was always acting in this way, the young bhikkhus
never had peace of mind, and so they could not concentrate on meditation
practice or even on recitation of the texts. One day, they decided to
investigate if their teacher was truly zealous and vigilant as he posed himself
to be. When they found out that their teacher Padhanikatissa only exhorted
others but was himself sleeping most of the time, they remarked, &quot;We are
ruined, our teacher knows only how to scold us, but he himself is just wasting
time, doing nothing.&quot; By this time, as the bhikkhus were not getting
enough rest, they were tired and worn out. As a result, none of the bhikkhu
made any progress in their meditation practice.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> At the end of the vassa, they returned to the Jetavana

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha
uttered Verse (169) of this book, with reference to the mother of
Kumarakassapa.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Once, a young married woman asked permission from her
husband to become a bhikkhuni. Through ignorance, she went to join some
bhikkhunis who were the pupils of Devadatta. This young woman was pregnant
before she became a bhikkhuni, but she was not aware of the fact at that time.
But in due course, the pregnancy became obvious and the other bhikkhunis took
her to their teacher Devadatta. Devadatta ordered her to go back to the
household life. She then said to the other bhikkhunis, 'I have not intended to
become a bhikkhuni under your teacher Devadatta; I have come here by mistake.
Please take me to the Jetavana monastery, take me to the Buddha.&quot; Thus she
came to the Buddha. The Buddha knew that she was pregnant before she became a
bhikkhuni and was therefore innocent; but he was not going to handle the case.
The Buddha sent for King Pasenadi of Kosala, Anathapindika, the famous rich
man, and Visakha, the famous donor of the Pubbarama monastery, and many other
persons. He then told Thera Upali to settle the case in public.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Visakha took the young girl behind a curtain; she examined
her and reported to Thera Upali that the girl was already pregnant when she
became a bhikkhuni. Thera Upali then declared to the audience that the girl was
quite innocent and therefore had not soiled her morality (sila). In due course,
a son was born to her. The boy was adopted by King Pasenadi and was named
Kumarakassapa. When the boy was seven years old, on learning that his mother
was a bhikkhuni, he also became a samanera under the tutelage of the Buddha.
When he came of age he was admitted to the Order; as a bhikkhu, he took a
subject of meditation from the Buddha and went to the forest. There, he
practised meditation ardently and diligently and within a short time attained
arahatship. However, he continued to live in the forest for twelve more years. 
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Thus his mother had not seen him for twelve years and she
longed to see her son very much. One day, seeing him, the mother bhikkhuni ran
after her son weeping and calling out his name. Seeing his mother,
Kumarakassapa thought that if he were to speak pleasantly to his mother she
would still be attached to him and her future would be ruined. So for the sake
of her future (realization of Nibbana) he was deliberately stern and spoke
harshly to her: &quot;How is it, that you, a member of the Order, could not
even cut off this affection for a son?&quot; The mother thought that her son
was very cruel to her, and she asked him what he meant. Kumarakassapa repeated
what he had said before. On hearing his answer, the mother of Kumarakassapa
reflected: &quot;O yes, for twelve years I have shed tears for this son of
mine. Yet, he has spoken harshly to me. What is the use of my affection for him
?&quot; Then, the futility of her attachment to her son dawned upon her, and
then and there, she decided to cut off her attachment to her son. By cutting
off her attachment entirely, the mother of Kumarakassapa attained arahatship on
the same day.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> One day, at the congregation of bhikkhus, some bhikkhus
said to the Buddha, &quot;Venerable Sir! If the mother of Kumarakassapa had
listened to Devadatta, she as well as her son would not have become arahats.
Surely, Devadatta had tried to do them a great wrong; but you, Venerable Sir,
are a refuge to them!&quot; To them the Buddha said, &quot;Bhikkhus! In trying
to reach the deva world, or in trying to attain arahatship, you cannot depend
on others, you must work hard on your own.&quot; </P>

the Jetavana monastery. On that day, he kept the sabbath by observing the eight
moral precepts (<FONT COLOR="#800040">Uposatha sila</FONT>) and listened to the
discourses on the Dhamma throughout the night. It so happened that on that same
night, some thieves broke into a house; and the owners on waking up went after
the thieves. The thieves ran away in all directions. Some ran in the direction
of the monastery. It was then nearing dawn, and Mahakala was washing his face
at the pond close to the monastery. The thieves dropped their stolen property
in from of Mahakala and ran on. When the owners arrived, they saw Mahakala with
the stolen property. Taking him for one of the thieves they shouted at him,
threatened him and beat him hard. Mahakala died on the spot. Early in the
morning, when some young bhikkhus and samaneras from the monastery came to the
pond to fetch water, they saw the dead body and recognize it.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> On their return to the monastery, they reported what they
had seen and said to the Buddha, &quot;Venerable Sir! The lay disciple who was
at this monastery listening to the religious discourses all through the night
has met with a death which he does not deserve.&quot; To them the Buddha
replied, &quot;Bhikkhus! If you judge from the good deeds he has done in this
existence, he has indeed met with a death he does not deserve. But the fact is
that he has only paid for the evil he had done in a past existence. In one of
his previous existences, when he was a courtier in the palace of the king, he

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &quot;Once, while King Brahmadatta was reigning in

deer-stalker. One day, the deer-stalker saw the footprints of a deer under a
tree. So, he put up a bamboo platform in the tree and waited with the spear
ready for the deer. The deer came but he came very cautiously. The deer-stalker
saw him hesitating, and threw some fruits of the tree to coax him. Bat that put
the deer on guard; he looked more carefully and saw the deer-stalker in the

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> While residing at the Veluvana monastery, the Buddha

the offence of causing a schism in the Order of the bhikkhus.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> On one occasion, while the Buddha was giving a discourse in
the Veluvana monastery, Devadatta came to him and suggested that since the
Buddha was getting old, the duties of the Order should be entrusted to him
(Devadatta); but the Buddha rejected his proposal and also rebuked him and
called him a &quot;spittle swallow or&quot; (Khelasika). From that time,
Devadatta felt very bitter towards the Buddha. He even tried to kill the Buddha
three times, but all his attempts failed. Later, Devadatta tried another
tactic. This time, he came to the Buddha and proposed five rules of discipline
for the bhikkhus to observe throughout their lives. <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">He
proposed (i) that the bhikkhus should live in the forest; (ii) that they should
live only on food received on alms-rounds; (iii) that they should wear robes
made only from pieces of cloth collected from rubbish heaps; (iv) that they
should reside under trees; and (v) that they should not take fish or meat.
</FONT>The Buddha did not have any objections to these rules and made no
objections to those who were willing to observe them, but for various valid
considerations, he was not prepared to impose these rules of discipline on the
bhikkhus in general.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Devadatta claimed that the rules proposed by him were much
better than the existing rules of discipline, and some new bhikkhus agreed with
him. One day, the Buddha asked Devadatta if it was true that he was trying to
create a schism in the Order, and he admitted that it was so. The Buddha warned
him that it was a very serious offence, but Devadatta paid no heed to his
warning. After this, as he met Thera Ananda on his alms-round in Rajagaha,
Devadatta said to Thera Ananda, &quot;Ananda, from today I will observe the
sabbath (Uposatha), and perform the duties of the Order separately, independent
of the Buddha and his Order of bhikkhus.&quot; On his return from the
alms-round, Thera Ananda reported to the Buddha what Devadatta had said.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> On hearing this, the Buddha reflected,
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;Devadatta is committing a very serious offence; it
will send him to Avici Niraya. For a virtuous person, it is easy to do good
deeds and difficult to do evil; but for an evil one, it is easy to do evil and
difficult to do good deeds. Indeed, in life it is easy to do something which is
not beneficial, but it is very difficult to do something which is good and

the virtues of the Buddha, she wished very much to go to the Jetavana monastery
and listen to the discourses given by the Buddha. So she told Thera Kala about
her wishes; but the thera advised her against it. Three times she spoke to him
about her wishes but he always dissuaded her. But one day, in spite of his
dissuasion, the lady decided to go. After asking her daughter to look to the
needs of Thera Kala she left the house. When Thera Kala came on his usual round
of alms-food, he learned that the lady of the house had left for the Jetavana
monastery. Then he reflected, &quot;It is quite possible that the lady of this
house is losing her faith in me.&quot; So, he made haste and quickly followed
her to the monastery. There, he found her listening to the discourse being
given by the Buddha. He approached the Buddha respectfully, and said,
&quot;Venerable Sir! This woman is very dull; she will not be able to
understand the sublime Dhamma; please teach her only about charity (dana) and
morality (sila).&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The Buddha knew very well that Thera Kala was talking out
of spite and with an ulterior motive. So he said to Thera Kala, &quot;Bhikkhu!
Because you are foolish and because of your wrong view, you scorn my Teaching.
You yourself are your own ruin; in fact, you are only trying to destroy
yourself.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows: </P>

</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Cukakala, a lay disciple, observed the Uposatha precepts on
a certain sabbath day and spent the night at the Jetavana monastery, listening
to religious discourses all through the night. Early in the morning, as he was
washing his face at the pond near the monastery, some thieves dropped a bundle
near him. The owners seeing him with the stolen property took him for a thief
and beat him hard. Fortunately some slave girls who had come to fetch water
testified that they knew him and that he was not the thief. So Culakala was let
off.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> When the Buddha was told about it, he said to Culakala,
&quot;You have been let off not only because the slave girls said that you were
not the thief but also because you did not steal and was therefore innocent.
Those who do evil go to niraya, but those who do good are reborn in the deva

attain arahatship during the lifetime of the Buddha, was striving hard in the
meditation practice. Other bhikkhus, not understanding him, took him to the
Buddha and said, &quot;Venerable Sir, this bhikkhu does not seem to love and
revere you as we do; he only keeps to himself.&quot; The thera then explained
to them that he was striving hard to attain arahatship before the Buddha
realized parinibbana and that was the only reason why he had not come to the
Buddha.</P>
