<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered
Verse (60) of this book, with reference to a certain young man and King
Pasenadi of Kosala.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One day King Pasenadi, while going out in the city, happened
to see a beautiful young woman standing at the window of her house and he
instantly fell in love with her. So the king tried to find ways and means of
getting her. Finding that she was a married woman, he sent for her husband and
made him serve at the palace. Later, the husband was sent on an impossible
errand by the king. The young man was to go to a place, a yojana (twelve miles)
away from Savatthi, bring back some<B> Kumuda</B> lotus flowers and some red
earth called '<B>arunavati</B>' from the land of the dragons (nagas) and arrive
back at Savatthi the same evening, in time for the king's bath. The king's
intention was to kill the husband if he failed to arrive back in time, and to
take the wife for himself.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hurriedly taking a food packet from his wife, the young man
set out on his errand. On the way, he shared his food with a traveller. He also
threw some rice into the water and said loudly, &quot;O guardian spirits and
dragons inhabiting this river! King Pasenadi has commanded me to get some
Kumuda lotus flowers and arunavati red earth for him. I have today shared my
food with a traveller; I have also fed the fish in the river; I now share with
you the benefits of the good deeds I have done today. Please get the Kumuda
lotus and arunavati red earth for me.&quot; The king of the dragons, hearing
him, took the appearance of an old man and brought the lotus and the red earth.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On that evening, King Pasenadi, fearing that the young
husband might arrive back in time, had the city-gates closed early. The young
man, finding the city-gates closed, placed the red earth on the city-wall and
stuck the flowers on the earth. Then he declared loudly,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;O citizens! Be my witnesses! I have today accomplished
my errand in time as instructed by the king. King Pasenadi, without any
justification, plans to kill me.&quot; After that, the young man left for the
Jetavana monastery to take shelter and find solace in the peaceful atmosphere
of the monastery.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Meanwhile, King Pasenadi, obsessed with sexual desire, could
not sleep, and kept thinking out how he would get rid of the husband in the
morning and take his wife. At about midnight, he heard some eerie sounds;
actually, these were the doleful voices of four persons suffering in
<B>Lohakumbhi Niraya</B> . Hearing those weird voices, the king was terrified.
Early in the morning, he went to the Buddha, as advised by Queen Mallika. When
the Buddha was told about the four voices the king heard in the night, he
explained to the king that those were the voices of four beings, who were the
sons of rich men during the time of Kassapa Buddha, and that now they were
suffering in Lohakumbhi Niraya because they had committed sexual misconduct
with other people's wives. Then, the king came to realize the depravity of the
deed and the severity of the punishment. So, he decided then and there that he
would no longer covet another man's wife. &quot;After all, it was on account of
my intense desire for another man's wife that I was tormented and could not
sleep the whole of last night,&quot; he reflected. Then King Pasenadi said to
the Buddha, &quot;Venerable Sir, now I know how long the night is for one who
cannot sleep.&quot; The young man who was close at band also said,
&quot;Venerable Sir, because I had travelled the full distance of a yojana
yesterday, I, too, know how long the journey of a yojana is to one who is
weary.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Combing their two statements, the Buddha spoke in verse as

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered
Verse (61) of this book, with reference to a resident pupil of Thera
Mahakassapa.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Thera Mahakassapa was residing near Rajagaha, he had
two young bhikkhus staying with him. One of them was respectful, obedient and
dutiful to the thera, but the other one was not. When the old thera chided the
latter for his slackness in his duties, he was very much offended. On one
occasion, he went to the house of a lay-disciple of the thera, and lied to them
that the thera was ill. Thus, he got some choice food from them for the thera;
but he ate the food on the way. When admonished by the thera for this he was
extremely angry. The next day, when the thera was out on his alms-round, the
young foolish bhikkhu stayed behind, broke the pots and pans and set fire to
the monastery.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When a bhikkhu from Rajagaha told the Buddha about this, the
Buddha said that it would have been much better for Thera Mahakassapa to live
alone than to live with a foolish companion.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered
Verse (62) of this book, with reference to a miserly rich man, named Ananda.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was once a very wealthy man named Ananda in Savatthi.
Although he possessed eighty crores, he was very reluctant to give anything in
charity. To his son, Mulasiri, he used to say, &quot;Don't think the wealth we
have now is very much. Do not give away anything from what you have, for you
must make it grow. Otherwise your wealth will dwindle away.&quot; This rich man
had five pots of gold buried in his house and he died without revealing their
location to his son.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ananda, the rich man, was reborn in a village of beggars,
not far from Savatthi. From the time his mother was pregnant, the income of the
beggars decreased; the villagers thought there must be a wicked and unlucky one
amongst them. By dividing themselves up into groups and by the process of
elimination, they came to the conclusion that the pregnant beggar woman must be
the unfortunate one. Thus, she was driven out of the village. When her son was
born, the son proved to be extremely ugly and repulsive. If she went out
begging by herself, she would get as before, but if she went out with her son
she would get nothing. So, when the boy could go out by himself, his mother
placed a plate in his hand and left him. As he wandered about in Savatthi, he
remembered his old house and his past existence. So he went into the house.
When the sons of his son Mulasiri saw him, they were frightened by his ugly
looks and began to cry. The servants then beat him and threw him out of the
house.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Buddha who was on his alms-round saw the incident and
asked the Venerable Ananda to fetch Mulasiri. When Mulasiri came, the Buddha
told him that the young beggar was his own father in his previous existence.
But Mulasiri could not believe it. So, the Buddha directed the beggar boy to
show where he had buried his five pots of gold. Then only, Mulasiri accepted
the truth and from that time he became a devoted lay-disciple of the Buddha.

lay-disciples going to the Jetavana monastery, where the Buddha was giving a
discourse. One of them listened attentively to the discourse and soon attained
Sotapatti Fruition. However, the second thief did not attend to the discourse
as he was bent on stealing only; and he managed to snatch a small sum of money
from one of the lay-disciples. After the discourse they went back and cooked
their meal at the house of the second thief, the one who managed to get some
money. The wife of the second thief taunted the first thief, &quot;You are so
wise, you don't even have anything to cook at your house.&quot; Hearing this
remark, the first thief thought to himself, &quot;This one is so foolish that
she thinks she is being very smart.&quot; Then, together with some relatives,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered
Versa (66) of this book, with reference to Suppabuddha, a leper.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Suppabuddha the leper, while sitting at the back of the
crowd and listening attentively to the discourse given by the Buddha, attained
Sotapatti Fruition. When the crowd had dispersed, he followed the Buddha to the
monastery as he wished to tell the Buddha about his attainment of Sotapatti
Fruition. Sakka, king of the devas, wishing to test the leper's faith in the
Buddha, the Dhamma and the Samgha, appeared to him and said, &quot;You are only
a poor man, living on what you get by begging, with no one to fall back on. I
can give you immense wealth if you deny the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Samgha
and say that you have no use for them.&quot; To this, Suppabuddha replied.
&quot;I am certainly not a poor man, with no one to rely on. I am a rich man; I
possess the seven attributes which the ariyas possess; I have faith (saddha),
morality (sila), sense of shame to do evil (hiri), sense of fear to do evil
(ottappa), learning (sula), generosity (caga) and knowledge (panna).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then, Sakka went to the Buddha ahead of Suppabuddha and
related the conversation between himself and Suppabuddha. To him the Buddha
replied that it would not be easy even for a hundred or a thousand Sakkas to
coax Suppabuddha away from the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Samgha. Soon after
this, Suppabuddha arrived at the monastery and reported to the Buddha about his
attainment of Sotapatti Fruition. On his way back from the Jetavana monastery,
Suppabuddha was gored to death by an infuriated cow, who, in fact, was an
ogress assuming the form of a cow. This ogress was none other than the
prostitute who was killed by Suppabuddha in one of his previous existences and
who had vowed to have her revenge on him.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the news of Suppabuddha's death reached the Jetavana
monastery, the bhikkhus asked the Buddha where Suppabuddha was reborn and the
Buddha replied to them that Suppabuddha was reborn in Tavatimsa deva realm. The
Buddha also explained to them that Suppabuddha was born a leper because, in one
of his previous existences, he had spat upon a paccekabuddha.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered
Verse (67) of this book, with reference to a farmer who handled poison.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One day, some thieves having stolen some valuables and cash
from the house of a rich man came to a field. There, they divided the stolen
property among themselves and dispersed; but a packet containing one thousand
in cash, having dropped from one of the thieves, was left behind unnoticed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Early in the morning on that day, the Buddha, on surveying
the world with his supernormal power, perceived that a farmer, cultivating near
that field, would attain Sotapatti Fruition on that very day. So, the Buddha
went there, accompinied by the Venerable Ananda. The farmer on seeing the
Buddha paid obeisance to him and continued to plough the field. The Buddha
seeing the packet of money said to the Venerable Ananda, &quot;Ananda, look at
that very poisonous snake,&quot; and Ananda replied, &quot;Venerable Sir, yes,
it is, indeed, a very poisonous snake!&quot; Then, both the Buddha and the -
Venerable Ananda continued their way.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The farmer, hearing them, went to find out if there really
was a snake and found the packet of money. He took the picket and hid it in a
place. The owners of the property coming after the thieves came to the field,
and tracing the footprints of the farmer, found the packet of money. They beat
the farmer and took him to the king, who ordered his men to kill the farmer. On
being taken to the cemetery, where he was to be killed, the farmer kept on
repeating, &quot;Ananda, look at that very poisonous snake. Venerable Sir, I
see the snake; it is, indeed, a very poisonous snake!&quot; When the king's men
heard the above dialogue between the Buddha and the Venerable Ananda being
repeated all the way, they were puzzled and took him to the king. The king
surmised that the farmer was calling upon the Buddha as a witness; he was
therefore taken to the presence of the Buddha. After hearing from the Buddha
everything that had happened in the morning, the king remarked, &quot;If he had
not been able to call upon the Buddha as a witness of his innocence, this man
would have been killed.&quot; To him, the Buddha replied, &quot;A wise man
should not do anything that he would repent after doing it.&quot;</P>

<P>While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (68) of
this book, with reference to Sumana the florist.</P>
<P>A florist, named Sumana, had to supply King Bimbisara of Rajagaha with
jasmin flowers every morning. One day, as he was going to the king's palace he
saw the Buddha, with a halo of light-rays radiating from him, coming into town
for alms-food accompanied by many bhikkhus. Seeing the Buddha in his
resplendent glory, the florist Sumana felt a strong desire to offer his flowers
to the Buddha. Then and there, he decided that even if the king were to drive
him out of the country or to kill him, he would not offer the flowers to the
king for that day. Thus, he threw up the flowers to the sides, to the back and
over and above the head of the Buddha. The flowers remained hanging in the air;
those over the head formed a canopy of flowers and those at the back and the
sides formed walls of flowers. These flowers followed the Buddha in this
position as he moved on, and stopped when the Buddha stopped. As the Buddha
proceeded, surrounded by walls of flowers, and a canopy of flowers, with the
six-coloured rays radiating from his body, followed by a large entourage,
thousands of people inside and outside of Rajagaha came out of their houses to
pay obeisance to the Buddha. As for Sumana, his entire body was suffused with
delightful satisfaction (Piti).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The wife of the florist Sumana then went to the king and
said that she had nothing to do with her husband failing to supply the king
with flowers for that day. The king, being a Sotapanna himself, felt quite
happy about the flowers. He came out to see the wonderful sight and paid
obeisance to the Buddha. The king also took the opportunity to offer alms-food
to the Buddha and his disciples. After the meal, the Buddha returned in the
Jetavana monastery and the king followed him for some distance. On arrival back
at the palace King Bimbisara sent for Sumana and offered him a reward of eight
elephants, eight horses, eight male slaves, eight female slaves, eight maidens
and eight thousand in cash.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the Jetavana monastery, the Venerable Ananda asked the
Buddha what benefits Sumana would gain by his good deed done on that day. The
Buddha answered that Sumana, having given to the Buddha without any
consideration for his life, would not be born in any of the four lower worlds
(Apaya) for the next one hundred thousand worlds and that eventually he would
become a paccekabuddha. After that, as the Buddha entered the Perfumed Hall
(<B>Gandhakuti</B>) the flowers dropped off of their own accord.</P>

many others. But she decided that it would be better for her to become a

Verse (70) of this book, with reference to Thera Jambuka.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jambuka was the son of a rich man in Savatthi. Due to his
past evil deeds he was born with very peculiar habits. As a child, he wanted to
sleep on the floor with no proper bed, and to take his own excreta for food
instead of rice. When he grew older, his parents sent him to the Ajivakas, the
naked ascetics. When those ascetics found out about his peculiar food habits
they drove him away. At nights he ate human excreta and in the day time stood
still on one leg and kept his mouth open. He used to say that he kept his mouth
open because he only lived on air and that he stood on one leg because it would
otherwise be too heavy for the earth to bear him. &quot;I never sit down, I
never go to sleep,&quot; he boasted and on account of this, he was known as
Jambuka, a 'jackal'.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people believed him and some would come to him with
offerings of choice food. Then Jambuka would refuse and say, &quot;I do not
take any food except air.&quot; When pressed, he would take just a little of
the food with the tip of a blade of grass and say, &quot;Now go, this little
will give you enough merit.&quot; In this way, Jambuka lived for fifty-five
years, naked and taking only excreta.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One day, the Buddha saw in his vision that Jambuka was due
to attain arahatship within a short time. So, in the evening, the Buddha went
to where Jambuka was staying and asked for some place to spend the night.
Jambuka pointed out to him a mountain-cave not far from the stone slab on which
he himself was staying. During the first, second and third watches of the
night, the Catumaharajika devas, Sakka and Mahabrahma came to pay homage to the
Buddha in turn. On all the three occasions, the forest was lit up and Jambuka
saw the light three times. In the morning, he walked over to the Buddha and
enquired about the lights.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When told about the devas, Sakka and Mahabrahma coming to
pay homage to the Buddha, Jambuka was very much impressed, and said to the
Buddha, &quot;You must, indeed, be a wonderfully great person for the devas,
Sakka and Mahabrahma to come and pay homage to you. As for me, even though I
have I practised austerely for fifty-five years, living only on air and
standing only on one leg, none of the devas, nor Sakka, nor Mahabrahma has ever
came to me&quot; To him, the Buddha replied, &quot;O Jambuka! You have been
deceiving other people, but you cannot deceive me. I know that for fifty-five
years you have been eating excreta and sleeping on the ground.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, the Buddha explained to him how in one of his
past existences during the time of Kassapa Buddha, Jambuka had prevented a
thera from going with him to the house of a lay-disciple where alms-food was
being offered and how he had also thrown away the food that was sent along with
him for that thera. It was for those evil deeds that Jambuka had to be eating
excreta and sleeping on the ground. Hearing that account, Jambuka was horrified
and terror-strickeen, and repented for having done evil and for having deceived
other people. He went down on his knees and the Buddha gave him a piece of
cloth to put on. The Buddha then proceeded to deliver a discourse; at the end
of the discourse Jambuka attained arahatship and joined the Buddhist Order on
the spot.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Soon after this, Jambuka's pupils from Anga and Magadha
arrived and they were surprised to see their teacher with the Buddha. Theta
Jambuka then explained to his pupils that he had joined the Buddhist Order and
that he was now only a disciple of the Buddha. To them, the Buddha said that
although their teacher had lived austerely by taking food very sparingly, it
was not worth even one-sixteenth part of his present practice and achievement.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered
Verse (71) of this book, with reference to a peta-ghost.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chief Disciple Maha Moggallana was on one occasion going
on an alms-round with Thera Lakkhana in Rajagaha. On seeing something, he
smiled but said nothing. When they were back at the monastery, Thera Maha
Moggallana told Thera Lakkhana that he smiled because he saw a peta-ghost with
the head of a human being and the body of a snake. The Buddha then said that he
himself had seen that very peta-ghost on the day he attained Buddhahood. The
Buddha also explained that, a very long time ago, there was a paccekabuddha,
who was respected by many. People going to his monastery had to traverse a
field. The owner of the field, fearing that his field would be damaged by too
many people going to and from the monastery, set fire to it. Consequently, the
paccekabuddha had to move to some other place. The disciples of the
paccekabuddha, being very angry with the land-owner, beat him and killed him.
On his death he was reborn in Avici Niraya. In his present existence, he was
serving out the remaining term of the evil consequences (kamma) as a
peta-ghost.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, the Buddha said, &quot;An evil deed does not
bear fruit immediately, but it invariably follows the evil doer. There is no
escape from the consequences of an evil deed.&quot;</P>

Verse (72) of this book with reference to a peta-ghost named Satthikutapeta.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chief Disciple Maha Moggallana saw this enormous
peta-ghost while going on an alms-round with Thera Lakkhana. In this
connection, the Buddha explained that Satthikutapeta, in one of his previous
existences, was very skilful in throwing stones at things. One day, he asked
permissions from his teacher to try out his skill. His teacher told him not to
hit a cow, or a human being as he would have to pay compensation to the owner
or to the relative, but to find a target which was ownerless or guardianless.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On seeing the paccekabuddha, the idiots lacking in
intelligence, thought the paccekabuddha, having no relative or guardian, would
be an ideal target. So he threw a stone at the paccekabuddha who was on an
alms-round. The stone entered from one ear and came out of the other. The
paccekabuddha expired when he reached the monastery. The stone-thrower was
killed by the disciples of the paccekabuddha and he was reborn in Avici Niraya.
Afterwards, he was reborn as a peta-ghost and had since been serving the
remaining term of the evil consequences (kamma) of his evil deed. As a
pita-ghost his enormous head was being continuously hit with red-hot hammers.

the householder.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Citta, a householder, once met <B>Thera Mahanama</B>, one of
the group of the first five bhikkhus (Pancavaggis), going on an alms-round, and
invited the thera to his house. There, he offered alms-food to the thera and
after listening to the discourse given by him, Citta attained Sotapatti
Fruition. Later, Citta built a monastery in his mango grove. There, he looked
to the needs of all bhikkhus who came to the monastery and Bhikkhu Sudhamma was
installed as the resident bhikkhu.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One day, the two Chief Disciples of the Buddha, the
Venerable Sariputta and the Venerable Mahaa Moggallana, came to the monastery
and after listening to the discourse given by the Venerable Sariputta, Citta
attained Anagami Fruition. Then, he invited the two Chief Disciples to his
house for alms-food the next day. He also invited Thera Sudhamma, but Thera
Sudhamma refused in anger and said, &quot;You invite me only after the other
two.&quot; Citta repeated his invitation, but it was turned down. Nevertheless,
Thera Sudhamma went to the house of Citta early on the following day. But when
invited to enter the house, Thera Sudhamma refused and said that he would not
sit down as he was going on his alms-round. But when he saw the things that
were to be offered to the two Chief Disciples, he envied them so much that he
could not restrain his anger. He abused Citta and said, &quot;I don't want to
stay in your monastery any longer,&quot; and left the house in anger.</P>
<P>From there, he went to the Buddha and reported everything that had happened.
To him, the Buddha said, &quot;You have insulted a lay-disciple who is endowed
with faith and generously. You'd better go back to him and own up your
mistake.&quot; Sudhamma did as he was told by the Buddha, but Citta would not
be appeased; so he returned to the Buddha for the second time. The Buddha,
knowing that the pride of Sudhamma had dwindled by this time, said, &quot;My
son, a good bhikkhu should have no attachment; a good bhikkhu should not be
conceited and say 'This is my monastery, this is my place, these are my
lay-disciples,' etc., for in one with such thoughts, covetousness and pride

<P ALIGN="CENTER">V (15)<B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">The Story of Samanera<A
NAME="Tissa"> Tissa</A> of the Forest Monastery</FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered
Verse (75) of this book, with reference to Tissa, a samanera, who dwelt in a
forest monastery.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tissa was the son of a rich man from Savatthi. His father
used to offer alms-food to the Chief Disciple Sariputta in their house and so
Tissa even as a chid had met the Chief Disciple on many occasions. At the age
of seven he became a novice (samanera) under the Chief Disciple Sariputta.
While he was staying at the Jetavana monastery, many of his friends and
relatives came to see him, bringing presents and offerings. The samanera found
these visits to be very tiresome; so after taking a subject of meditation from
the Buddha, he left for a forest monastery. Whenever a villager offered him
anything, Tissa would just say 'May you be happy, may you be liberated from the
ills of life,' (&quot;Sukhita hotha, dukkha muccatha&quot;), and would go on
his own way. While he stayed at the forest monastery, he ardently and
diligently practised meditation, and at the end of three months he attained
arahatship.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the vassa, the Venerable Sariputta accompanied by the
Venerable Maha Moggallana and other senior disciples paid a visit to Samanera
Tissa, with the permission of the Buddha. All the villagers came out to welcome
the Venerable Sariputta and his company of four thousand bhikkhus. They also
requested the Venerable Sariputta to favour them with a discourse, but the
Chief Disciple declined; instead, he directed his pupil Tissa to deliver a
discourse to the villagers. The villagers, however, said that their teacher
Tissa could only say &quot;May you be happy, may you be liberated from the ills
of life,&quot; and asked the Chief Disciple to assign another bhikkhu in his
place. But the Venerable Sariputta insisted that Tissa should deliver a
discourse on the dhamma, and said to Tissa, &quot;Tissa, talk to them about the
dhamma and show them how to gain happiness and how to be liberated from the
ills of life.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus, in obedience to his teacher, Samanera Tissa went up
the platform to deliver his discourse. He explained to the audience the meaning
of the aggregates (khandhas), sense bases and sense objects (ayatanas),
elements of the perpetuation of the Teaching (Bodhipakkhiya Dhamma), the Path
leading to arahatship and Nibbana, etc. Finally he concluded, &quot;And thus,
those who attain arahatship are liberated from all the ills of life and have
Perfect Peace; all the rest will still wander about in the round of rebirths
(samsara).&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Venerable Sariputta praised Tissa for having expounded
the dhamma so well. Dawn was approaching when he finished his exposition, and
all the villagers were very much impressed. Some of them were surprised that
Samanera Tissa knew the dhamma so well, but they were also dissatisfied with
him because formerly he had talked so little about the dhamma to them; the
others were happy and contented to find the samanera to be so learned and felt
that they were very lucky to have him amongst them.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Buddha, with his supernormal power, saw from the
Jetavana monastery these two groups of villagers and appeared before them. His
intention in coming to the village was to clear up the misunderstanding amongst
the first group of villagers. The Buddha arrived while the villagers were
preparing alms-food for the bhikkhus. So, they had the opportunity to offer
alms-food to the Buddha as well. After the meal, the Buddha addressed the
villagers, &quot;O lay disciples, all of you are so lucky to have Samanera
Tissa amongst you. It is on account of his presence here that I myself, my
Chief Disciples, senior disciples and many other bhikkhus now pay you a
visit.&quot; These words made them realize how fortunate they were to have
Samanera Tissa with them and they were satisfied. The Buddha then delivered a
discourse to the villagers and the bhikkhus, and consequently, many of them
attained Sotapatti Fruition.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the discourse, the Buddha returned to the Jetavana
monastery. In the evening, the bhikkhus said in praise of Tissa to the Buddha,
&quot;Venerable Sir, Samanera Tissa had performed a very difficult task; he was
so well provided with gifts and offerings of all kinds here in Savatthi, yet he
gave up all these to go and live austerely in a forest monastery.&quot; To them
the Buddha replied, &quot;Bhikkhus, a hhikkhu, whether in town or in village,
should not live for the sake of gifts and offerings, if a bhikkhu renounces all
good prospects or worldly gain and diligently practises the dhamma in solitude,
he is sure to attain arahatship.&quot;</P>

path that leads to worldly gain is one and the Path that leads to Nibbana is

solitude, detachment and the realization of Nibbana.</B></P>
