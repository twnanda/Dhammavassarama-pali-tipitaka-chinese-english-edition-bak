<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><FONT COLOR="#800040">Dhammapada </FONT></B>is one of the
best known books of tho Pitaka. It is a collection of the teachings of the
Buddha expressed in clear, pithy verses. These verses were culled from Various
discourses given by the Buddha in the course of forty-five years of his
teaching, as he travelled in the valley of the Ganges (Ganga) and the
sub-mountain tract of the Himalayas. These verses are often terse, witty and
convincing. Whenever similes are used, they are those that are easily
understood even by a child, e.g., the cart's wheel, a man's shadow, a deep
pool, flowers. Through these verses, the Buddha exhorts one to achieve that
greatest of all conquests, the conquest of self; to escape from the evils of
passion, hatred and ignorance; and to strive hard to attain freedom from
craving and freedom from the round of rebirths. Each verse contains a truth
(dhamma), an exhortation, a piece of advice. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dhammapada verses</FONT></B> are
often quoted by many in many countries of the world and the book has been
translated into many languages. One of the earliest translations into English
was made by Max Muller in 1870. Other translations that followed are those by
F.L. Woodward in 1921, by Wagismara and Saunders in 1920, and by A.L. Edmunds
(Hymns of the Faith) in 1902. Of the recent translations, that by Narada
Mahathera is the most widely known. Dr. Walpola Rahula also has translated some
selected verses from the Dhammapada and has given them at the end of his book
&quot;What the Buddha Taught,&quot; revised edition. The Chinese translated the
Dhammapada from Sanskrit. The Chinese version of the Dhammapada was translated
into English by Samuel Beal (Texts from the Buddhist Canon known as Dhammapada)
in 1878. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Burma, translations have been male into Burmese, mostly
in prose, some with paraphrases, explanations and abridgements of stories
relating to the verses. In recent years, some books on Dhammapada with both
Burmese and English translations, together with Pali verses, have also been
published.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Dhammapada is the second book of the Khuddaka Nikaya of
the Suttanta Pitaka, consisting of four hundred and twenty-three verses in
twenty-six chapters arranged under various heads. - In the Dhammapada are
enshrined the basic tenets of the Buddha's Teaching.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Verse (21) which begins with &quot;Appamado amatapadam&quot;
meaning &quot;Mindfulness is the way to Nibbana, the Deathless,&quot; is a very
important and significant verse. Mindfulness is the most important element in
Tranquillity and Insight Meditation. The last exhortation of the Buddha just
before he passed away was also to be mindful and to endeavour diligently (to
complete the task of attaining freedom from the round of rebirths through Magga
and Phala). It is generally accepted that it was on account of this verse on
mindfulness that the Emperor Asoka of India And King Anawrahta of Burma became
converts to Buddhism. Both kings had helped greatly in the propagation of
Buddhism in their respective countries. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In verse (29) the Buddha has coupled his call for
mindfulness with a sense of urgency. The verse runs: &quot;Mindful amongst the
negligent, highly vigilant amongst the drowsy, the wise man advances like a
race horse, leaving the jade behind.&quot; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Verses (1) and (2) illustrate the immutable law of Kamma,
under which every deed, good or bad, comes back to the doer. Here, the Buddha
emphasizes the importance of mind in all our actions and speaks of the
inevitable consequences of our deeds, words and thoughts. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Verses (153) and (154) are expressions of sublime and
intense joy uttered by the Buddha at the very moment of his Enlightenment.
These two verses give us a graphic account of the culmination of the Buddha's
search for Truth. They tell us about the Buddha finding the 'house-builder,'
Craving, the cause of repeated births in Samsara. Having rid of Craving, for
him no more houses (khandhas) shall be built by Craving, and there will be no
more rebirths. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Verses (277), (278) and (279) are also important as they
tell us about the impermanent, unsatisfactory and the non-self nature of all
conditioned things; It is every important that one should perceive the true
nature of all conditioned things and become weary of the khandhas, for this is
the Path to Purity.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then the Buddha shows us the Path leading to the liberation
from round of rebirths, i.e., the Path with eight constituents (Atthangiko
Maggo) in Verse (273). Further, the Buddha exhorts us to make our own effort in
Verse (276) saying, &quot;You yourselves should make the effort, the Tathagatas
only show the way.&quot; Verse (183) gives us the teaching of the
Buddhas.&quot; It says, &quot;Do no evil, cultivate merit, purify one's mind;
this is the teaching of the Buddhas.&quot; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Verse (24) the Buddha shows us the way to success in
life, thus: &quot;If a person is energetic, mindful, pure in thought, word and
deed, if he does everything with care and consideration, restrains his senses;
earns his living according to the Dhamma and is not unheedful, then, the fame
and fortune of that mindful person increase.&quot; </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are some of the examples of the gems to be found in
the Dhammapada. Dhammapada is, indeed, a philosopher, guide and friend to all. 
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This translation of verses is from Pali into English. The
Pali text used is the Dhammapada Pali approved by the Sixth International
Buddhist Synod. We have tried to make the translation as close to the text as
possible, but sometimes it is very difficult, if not impossible, to find an
English word that would exactly correspond to a Pali word. For example, we
cannot yet find a single English word that can convey the real meaning of the
word &quot;dukkha&quot; used in the exposition of the Four Noble Truths. In
this translation, wherever the term &quot;dukkha&quot; carries the same meaning
as it does in the Four Noble Truths, it is left untranslated; but only
explained. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When there is any doubt in the interpretation of the dhamma
concept of the verses or when the literal meaning is vague or unintelligible,
we have referred to the Commentary (in Pali) and the Burmese translation of the
Commentary by the Nyaunglebin Sayadaw, a very learned thera. On many occasions
we have also consulted the teachers of the Dhamma (Dhammacariyas) for
elucidation of perplexing words and sentences.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition we have also consulted Burmese translations of
the Dhammapada, especially the translation by the Union Buddha Sasana Council,
the translation by the Sangaja Sayadaw (l805-1876), a leading maha thera in the
time of King Mindon and King Thibaw, and also the translation by Sayadaw U
Thittila, an Ovadacariya maha thera of the Burma Pitaka Association. The book
by the Sangaja Sayadaw also includes paraphrases and abridgements of the
Dhammapada stories. </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dhammapada Stories</FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Summaries of the Dhammapada stories are given in the second
part of the book as it is generally believed that the Dhammapada Commentary
written by Buddhaghosa (5th. century A.D.) is a great help towards a better
understanding of the Dhammapada. Three hundred and five stories are included in
the Commentary. Most of the incidents mentioned in the stories took place
during the life-time of the Buddha. In some stories, some facts about some past
existences were also retold.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In writing summaries of stories we have not tried to
translate the Commentary. We have simply culled the facts of the stories and
have rewritten them briefly: A translation of the verses is given at the end of
each story.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It only remains for me now to express my deep and sincere
gratitude to the members of the Editorial Committee, Burma Pitaka Association,
for having meticulously gone through the script; to Sayagyi Dhammacariya U Aung
Moe and to U Thein Maung, editor, Burma Pitaka Association, for helping in the
translation of the verses.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">May the reader find the Path to Purity.</P>
