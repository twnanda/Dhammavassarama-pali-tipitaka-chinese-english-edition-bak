<h1 align=center>V. Fools</h1>
<p>
<b>60:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="60"></a>Long for the wakeful is the night.<BR>
Long for the weary, a league.<BR>
For fools<BR>
unaware of True Dhamma,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; samsara<BR>
is long.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<br><p>
<b>61:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="61"></a>If, in your course, you don't meet<BR>
your equal, your better,<BR>
then continue your course,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; firmly,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alone.<BR>
There's no fellowship with fools.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<br><p>
<b>62:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="62"></a>'I have sons, I have wealth' -- <BR>
the fool torments himself.<BR>
When even he himself <BR>
doesn't belong to himself,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how then sons?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How wealth?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<br><p>
<b>63:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="63"></a>A fool with a sense of his foolishness<BR>
is -- at least to that extent -- wise.<BR>
But a fool who thinks himself wise<BR>
really deserves to be called <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a fool.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<br><p>
<b>64-65:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="64"></a>Even if for a lifetime<BR>
the fool stays with the wise,<BR>
he knows nothing of the Dhamma -- <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as the ladle, <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the taste of the soup.
<p>
<a name="65"></a>Even if for a moment,<BR>
the perceptive person stays with the wise,<BR>
he immediately knows the Dhamma -- <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as the tongue,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the taste of the soup.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<br><p>
<b>66:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="66"></a>Fools, their wisdom weak,<BR>
are their own enemies<BR>
as they go through life,<BR>
doing evil <BR>
that bears <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bitter fruit.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<br><p>
<b>67-68:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="67"></a>It's not good,<BR>
the doing of the deed<BR>
that, once it's done, <BR>
you regret, <BR>
whose result you reap crying,<BR>
your face in tears.<BR>
<P>
<a name="68"></a>It's good,<BR>
the doing of the deed<BR>
that, once it's done, <BR>
you don't regret,<BR>
whose result you reap gratified,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; happy at heart.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<br><p>
<b>69:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="69"></a>As long as evil has yet to ripen,<BR>
the fool mistakes it for honey.<BR>
But when that evil ripens,<BR>
the fool falls into <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pain.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<br><p>
<b>70:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="70"></a>Month after month<BR>
the fool might eat<BR>
only a tip-of-grass measure of food,<BR>
but he wouldn't be worth<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one sixteenth<BR>
of those who've fathomed <BR>
the Dhamma.

<b><A HREF="notes.htm#n71" tppabs="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/dhp/notes.htm#n71">71*</A>:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="71"></a>An evil deed, when done,<BR>
doesn't -- like ready milk -- <BR>
come out right away.<BR>
It follows the fool, <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; smoldering<BR>
like a fire <BR>
hidden in ashes.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<br><p>
<b>72-74:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="72"></a>Only for his ruin<BR>
does renown come to the fool.<BR>
It ravages his bright fortune<BR>
&amp; rips his head &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; apart.
<p>
<a name="73"></a>He would want unwarranted status,<BR>
preeminence &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; among monks,<BR>
authority &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; among monasteries,<BR>
homage &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from lay families.
<p>
<a name="74"></a>'Let householders &amp; those gone forth<BR>
both think that this <BR>
was done by me alone.<BR>
May I alone determine<BR>
what's a duty, what's not':<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the resolve of a fool<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as they grow -- <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his desire &amp; pride.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<br><p>
<b>75:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="75"></a>The path to material gain<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; goes one way,<BR>
the way to Unbinding,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; another.<BR>
Realizing this, the monk,<BR>
a disciple to the Awakened One,<BR>
should not relish offerings,<BR>
should cultivate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seclusion <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; instead.
