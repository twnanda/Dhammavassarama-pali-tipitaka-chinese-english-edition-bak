<a name="235"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are now<BR>
like a yellowed leaf.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Already<BR>
Yama's minions stand near.<BR>
You stand at the door to departure<BR>
but have yet to provide<BR>
for the journey.
<p>
<a name="236"></a>Make an island for yourself!<BR>
Work quickly! Be wise!<BR>
With impurities all blown away,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unblemished,<BR>
you'll reach the divine realm<BR>
of the noble ones.
<p>
<a name="237"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are now<BR>
right at the end of your time.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are headed <BR>
to Yama's presence,<BR>
with no place to rest along the way,<BR>
but have yet to provide<BR>
for the journey.
<p>
<a name="238"></a>Make an island for yourself!<BR>
Work quickly! Be wise!<BR>
With impurities all blown away,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unblemished,<BR>
you won't again undergo birth <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; aging.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="239"></a>Just as a silver smith<BR>
step by<BR>
step,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bit by <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bit,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moment to <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moment,<BR>
blows away the impurities <BR>
of molten silver -- <BR>
so the wise man, his own.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="240"></a>Just as rust<BR>
-- iron's impurity -- <BR>
eats the very iron<BR>
from which it is born,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so the deeds<BR>
of one who lives slovenly<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lead him on<BR>
to a bad destination.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<br><p>
<b>241-243:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="241"></a>No recitation: the ruinous impurity <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of chants.<BR>
No initiative: of a household.<BR>
Indolence: of beauty.<BR>
Heedlessness: of a guard.<BR>
<P>
<a name="242"></a>In a woman, misconduct is an impurity.<BR>
In a donor, stinginess.<BR>
Evil deeds are the real impurities<BR>
in this world &amp; the next.<BR>
<P>
<a name="243"></a>More impure than these impurities<BR>
is the ultimate impurity:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ignorance.<BR>
Having abandoned this impurity,<BR>
monks, you're impurity-free.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<b>244-245:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="244"></a><a name="245"></a>Life's easy to live<BR>
for someone unscrupulous,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cunning as a crow,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; corrupt, back-biting, <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forward, &amp; brash;<BR>
but for someone who's constantly<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scrupulous, cautious,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; observant, sincere,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pure in his livelihood,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clean in his pursuits,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it's hard.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<br><p>
<b>246-248:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="246"></a>Whoever kills, lies, steals,<BR>
goes to someone else's wife,<BR>
&amp; is addicted to intoxicants,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; digs himself up<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the root<BR>
right here in this world.<BR>

<P><a name="248"></a>So know, my good man,<BR>
that bad deeds are reckless.<BR>
Don't let greed &amp; unrighteousness<BR>
oppress you with long-term pain.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<br><p>
<b>249-250:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="249"></a>People give <BR>
in line with their faith,<BR>
in line with conviction.<BR>
Whoever gets flustered<BR>
at food &amp; drink given to others,<BR>
attains no concentration <BR>
by day or by night.<BR>
<P>
<a name="250"></a>But one in whom this is<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cut &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; up- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rooted<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wiped out -- <BR>
attains concentration<BR>
by day or by night.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<br><p>
<b>251:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="251"></a>There's no fire like passion,<BR>
no seizure like anger,<BR>
no snare like delusion,<BR>
no river like craving.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<br><p>
<b>252-253:</b>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="252"></a>It's easy to see<BR>
the errors of others, <BR>
but hard to see<BR>
your own.<BR>
You winnow like chaff<BR>
the errors of others,<BR>
but conceal your own -- <BR>
like a cheat, an unlucky throw.<BR>
<P>
<a name="253"></a>If you focus on the errors of others,<BR>
constantly finding fault,<BR>
your effluents flourish.<BR>
You're far from their ending.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<a name="254"></a>There's no trail in space,<BR>
no outside contemplative.<BR>
People are smitten<BR>
with complications,<BR>
but devoid of complication are<BR>
the Tathagatas.<BR>
<P>
<a name="255"></a>There's no trail in space,<BR>
no outside contemplative,<BR>
no eternal fabrications,<BR>
no wavering in the Awakened.
