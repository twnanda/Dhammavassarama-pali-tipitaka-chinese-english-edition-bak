<h1>Satipatthana Sutta</h1>
<h1>The Foundations of Mindfulness</h1>
<h3 class="ctr">Translated from the Pali by Nyanasatta Thera</h3>
<hr>
<p><b>Thus have I heard</b>. At one time the Blessed One was living among the Kurus, at Kammasadamma, a market town of the Kuru people. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhu thus:</p>
<p>&quot;Monks,&quot;</p>
<p>and they replied to him, &quot;Venerable Sir.&quot;</p>
<p>The Blessed One spoke as follows:</p>
<p>This is the only way, monks, for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the destruction of suffering and grief, for reaching the right path, for the attainment of Nibbana, namely, the four foundations of mindfulness.</p>
<p>What are the four?</p>
<p>Herein (in this teaching) a monk lives contemplating the body in the body,[<a name="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>] ardent, clearly comprehending and mindful, having overcome, in this world, covetousness and grief; he lives contemplating feelings in feelings, ardent, clearly comprehending and mindful, having overcome, in this world, covetousness and grief; he lives contemplating consciousness in consciousness,[<a name="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>] ardent, clearly comprehending and mindful, having overcome, in this world, covetousness and grief; he lives contemplating mental objects in mental objects,[<a name="fn2a" href="#n2a">2a</a>] ardent, clearly comprehending and mindful, having overcome, in this world, covetousness and grief.</p>
<h4>I. <a href="MahaSatipatthanaSuttanta.htm#body">The Contemplation of the Body</a></h4>
<h5>1. <i><a name="Breathing">Mindfulness of Breathing</a></i></h5>
<p>And how does a monk live contemplating the body in the body?</p>
<p>Herein, monks, a monk, having gone to the forest, to the foot of a tree or to an empty place, sits down with his legs crossed, keeps his body erect and his mindfulness alert.[<a name="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</p>
<p>Ever mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out. Breathing in a long breath, he knows, &quot;I am breathing in a long breath&quot;; breathing out a long breath, he knows, &quot;I am breathing out a long breath&quot;; breathing in a short breath, he knows, &quot;I am breathing in a short breath&quot;; breathing out a short breath, he knows, &quot;I am breathing out a short breath.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Experiencing the whole (breath-) body, I shall breathe in,&quot; thus he trains himself. &quot;Experiencing the whole (breath-) body, I shall breathe out,&quot; thus he trains himself. &quot;Calming the activity of the (breath-) body, I shall breathe in,&quot; thus he trains himself. &quot;Calming the activity of the (breath-) body, I shall breathe out,&quot; thus he trains himself.</p>
<p>Just as a skilful turner or turner's apprentice, making a long turn, knows, &quot;I am making a long turn,&quot; or making a short turn, knows, &quot;I am making a short turn,&quot; just so the monk, breathing in a long breath, knows, &quot;I am breathing in a long breath&quot;; breathing out a long breath, he knows, &quot;I am breathing out a long breath&quot;; breathing in a short breath, he knows, &quot;I am breathing in a short breath&quot;; breathing out a short breath, he knows, &quot;I am breathing out a short breath.&quot; &quot;Experiencing the whole (breath-) body, I shall breathe in,&quot; thus he trains himself. &quot;Experiencing the whole (breath-) body, I shall breathe out,&quot; thus he trains himself. &quot;Calming the activity of the (breath-) body, I shall breathe in,&quot; thus he trains himself. &quot;Calming the activity of the (breath-) body, I shall breathe out,&quot; thus he trains himself.</p>
<p>Thus he lives contemplating the body in the body internally, or he lives contemplating the body in the body externally, or he lives contemplating the body in the body internally and externally.[<a name="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>] He lives contemplating origination factors[<a name="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>] in the body, or he lives contemplating dissolution factors[<a name="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>] in the body, or he lives contemplating origination-and-dissolution factors[<a name="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>] in the body. Or his mindfulness is established with the thought: &quot;The body exists,&quot;[<a name="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>] to the extent necessary just for knowledge and mindfulness, and he lives detached,[<a name="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>] and clings to nothing in the world. Thus also, monks, a monk lives contemplating the body in the body.</p>
<h5>2. <a name="Postures"> The Postures of the Body</a></h5>
<p>And further, monks, a monk knows, when he is going, &quot;I am going&quot;; he knows, when he is standing, &quot;I am standing&quot;; he knows, when he is sitting, &quot;I am sitting&quot;; he knows, when he is lying down, &quot;I am lying down&quot;; or just as his body is disposed so he knows it.</p>
<p>Thus he lives contemplating the body in the body internally, or he lives contemplating the body in the body externally, or he lives contemplating the body in the body internally and externally. He lives contemplating origination factors in the body, or he lives contemplating dissolution factors in the body, or he lives contemplating origination-and-dissolution factors in the body.[<a name="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>] Or his mindfulness is established with the thought: &quot;The body exists,&quot; to the extent necessary just for knowledge and mindfulness, and he lives detached, and clings to nothing in the world. Thus also, monks, a monk lives contemplating the body in the body.</p>
<h5>3. <a name="whateverhedoes">Mindfulness with Clear Comprehension</a></h5>
<p>And further, monks, a monk, in going forward and back, applies clear comprehension; in looking straight on and looking away, he applies clear comprehension; in bending and in stretching, he applies clear comprehension; in wearing robes and carrying the bowl, he applies clear comprehension; in eating, drinking, chewing and savoring, he applies clear comprehension; in walking, in standing, in sitting, in falling asleep, in waking, in speaking and in keeping silence, he applies clear comprehension.</p>
<p>Thus he lives contemplating the body in the body....</p>
<h5>4. <a name="Repulsiveness">The Reflection on the Repulsiveness of the Body</a></h5>
<p>And further, monks, a monk reflects on this very body enveloped by the skin and full of manifold impurity, from the soles up, and from the top of the head-hairs down, thinking thus: &quot;There are in this body hair of the head, hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, marrow, kidney, heart, liver, midriff, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, gorge, faeces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, nasal mucus, synovial fluid, urine.&quot;</p>
<p>Just as if there were a double-mouthed provision bag full of various kinds of grain such as hill paddy, paddy, green gram, cow-peas, sesamum, and husked rice, and a man with sound eyes, having opened that bag, were to take stock of the contents thus: &quot;This is hill paddy, this is paddy, this is green gram, this is cow-pea, this is sesamum, this is husked rice.&quot; Just so, monks, a monk reflects on this very body enveloped by the skin and full of manifold impurity, from the soles up, and from the top of the head-hairs down, thinking thus: &quot;There are in this body hair of the head, hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, marrow, kidney, heart, liver, midriff, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, gorge, faeces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, nasal mucus, synovial fluid, urine.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus he lives contemplating the body in the body....</p>
<h5>5. <a name="Elements">The Reflection on the Material Elements</a></h5>
<p>And further, monks, a monk reflects on this very body, however it be placed or disposed, by way of the material elements: &quot;There are in this body the element of earth, the element of water, the element of fire, the element of wind.&quot;[<a name="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</p>
<p>Just as if, monks, a clever cow-butcher or his apprentice, having slaughtered a cow and divided it into portions, should be sitting at the junction of four high roads, in the same way, a monk reflects on this very body, as it is placed or disposed, by way of the material elements: &quot;There are in this body the elements of earth, water, fire, and wind.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus he lives contemplating the body in the body....</p>
<h5>6. <a name="CemeteryContemplations">The Nine Cemetery Contemplations</a></h5>
<p>(1) And further, monks, as if a monk sees a body dead one, two, or three days; swollen, blue and festering, thrown in the charnel ground, he then applies this perception to his own body thus: &quot;Verily, also my own body is of the same nature; such it will become and will not escape it.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus he lives contemplating the body in the body internally, or he lives contemplating the body in the body externally, or he lives contemplating the body in the body internally and externally. He lives contemplating origination-factors in the body, or he lives contemplating dissolution factors in the body, or he lives contemplating origination-and-dissolution-factors in the body. Or his mindfulness is established with the thought: &quot;The body exists,&quot; to the extent necessary just for knowledge and mindfulness, and he lives detached, and clings to nothing in the world. Thus also, monks, a monk lives contemplating the body in the body.</p>
<p>(2) And further, monks, as if a monk sees a body thrown in the charnel ground, being eaten by crows, hawks, vultures, dogs, jackals or by different kinds of worms, he then applies this perception to his own body thus: &quot;Verily, also my own body is of the same nature; such it will become and will not escape it.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus he lives contemplating the body in the body....</p>
<p>(3) And further, monks, as if a monk sees a body thrown in the charnel ground and reduced to a skeleton with some flesh and blood attached to it, held together by the tendons....</p>
<p>(4) And further, monks, as if a monk sees a body thrown in the charnel ground and reduced to a skeleton blood-besmeared and without flesh, held together by the tendons....</p>
<p>(5) And further, monks, as if a monk sees a body thrown in the charnel ground and reduced to a skeleton without flesh and blood, held together by the tendons....</p>
<p>(6) And further, monks, as if a monk sees a body thrown in the charnel ground and reduced to disconnected bones, scattered in all directions_here a bone of the hand, there a bone of the foot, a shin bone, a thigh bone, the pelvis, spine and skull....</p>
<p>(7) And further, monks, as if a monk sees a body thrown in the charnel ground, reduced to bleached bones of conchlike color....</p>
<p>(8) And further, monks, as if a monk sees a body thrown in the charnel ground reduced to bones, more than a year-old, lying in a heap....</p>
<p>(9) And further, monks, as if a monk sees a body thrown in the charnel ground, reduced to bones gone rotten and become dust, he then applies this perception to his own body thus: &quot;Verily, also my own body is of the same nature; such it will become and will not escape it.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus he lives contemplating the body in the body internally, or he lives contemplating the body in the body externally, or he lives contemplating the body in the body internally and externally. He lives contemplating origination factors in the body, or he lives contemplating dissolution factors in the body, or he lives contemplating origination-and-dissolution factors in the body. Or his mindfulness is established with the thought: &quot;The body exists,&quot; to the extent necessary just for knowledge and mindfulness, and he lives detached, and clings to nothing in the world.

<p>When the enlightenment-factor of <i>equanimity</i> is present, he knows, &quot;The enlightenment-factor of equanimity is in me&quot;; when the enlightenment-factor of equanimity is absent, he knows, &quot;The enlightenment-factor of equanimity is not in me&quot;; and he knows how the arising of the non-arisen enlightenment-factor of equanimity comes to be, and how perfection in the development of the arisen enlightenment-factor of equanimity comes to be.</p>
<p>Thus he lives contemplating mental objects in mental objects internally, or he lives contemplating mental objects in mental objects externally, or he lives contemplating mental objects in mental objects internally and externally. He lives contemplating origination-factors in mental objects, or he lives contemplating dissolution-factors in mental objects, or he lives contemplating origination-and-dissolution-factors in mental objects.[<a name="fn26" href="#n26">26</a>] Or his mindfulness is established with the thought, &quot;Mental objects exist,&quot; to the extent necessary just for knowledge and mindfulness, and he lives detached, and clings to nothing in the world. Thus, monks, a monk lives contemplating mental objects in the mental objects of the seven factors of enlightenment.</p>
<h5>5. <a name="TheFourNobleTruths">The Four Noble Truths</a></h5>
<p>And further, monks, a monk lives contemplating mental objects in the mental objects of the four noble truths.</p>
<p>How, monks, does a monk live contemplating mental objects in the mental objects of the four noble truths?</p>
<p>Herein, monks, a monk knows, <i>&quot;This is suffering,&quot;</i> according to reality; he knows, <i>&quot;This is the origin of suffering,&quot;</i> according to reality; he knows, <i>&quot;This is the cessation of suffering,&quot;</i> according to reality; he knows <i>&quot;This is the road leading to the cessation of suffering,&quot;</i> according to reality.</p>
<p>Thus he lives contemplating mental objects in mental objects internally, or he lives contemplating mental objects in mental objects externally, or he lives contemplating mental objects in mental objects internally and externally. He lives contemplating origination-factors in mental objects, or he lives contemplating dissolution-factors in mental objects, or he lives contemplating origination-and- dissolution-factors in mental objects.[<a name="fn27" href="#n27">27</a>] Or his mindfulness is established with the thought, &quot;Mental objects exist,&quot; to the extent necessary just for knowledge and mindfulness, and he lives detached, and clings to nothing in the world. Thus, monks, a monk lives contemplating mental objects in the mental objects of the four noble truths.</p>
<p>Verily, monks, whosoever practices these four foundations of mindfulness in this manner for seven years, then one of these two fruits may be expected by him: highest knowledge (Arahantship) here and now, or if some remainder of clinging is yet present, the state of non-returning.[<a name="fn28" href="#n28">28</a>]</p>
<p>O monks, let alone seven years. Should any person practice these four foundations of mindfulness in this manner for six years ... five years ... four years ... three years ... two years ... one year, then one of these two fruits may be expected by him: highest knowledge here and now, or if some remainder of clinging is yet present, the state of non-returning.</p>
<p>O monks, let alone a year. Should any person practice these four foundations of mindfulness in this manner for seven months ... six months ... five months ... four months ... three months ... two months ... a month ... half a month, then one of these two fruits may be expected by him: highest knowledge here and now, or if some remainder of clinging is yet present, the state of non-returning.</p>
<p>O monks, let alone half a month. Should any person practice these four foundations of mindfulness in this manner for a week, then one of these two fruits may be expected by him: highest knowledge here and now, or if some remainder of clinging is yet present, the state of non-returning.</p>
<p>Because of this it was said: &quot;This is the only way, monks, for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and lamentation, for the destruction of suffering and grief, for reaching the right path, for the attainment of Nibbana, namely the four foundations of mindfulness.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus spoke the Blessed One. Satisfied, the monks approved of his words.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>. ] The repetition of the phrases 'contemplating the body in the body', 'feelings in feelings', etc. is meant to impress upon the meditator the importance of remaining aware whether, in the sustained attention directed upon a single chosen object, one is still keeping to it, and has not strayed into the field of another contemplation. For instance, when contemplating any bodily process, a meditator may unwittingly be side-tracked into a consideration of his <i>feelings</i> connected with that bodily process. He should then be clearly aware that he has left his original subject, and is engaged in the contemplation of feeling.</p>

<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>. ] Mind (Pali <i>citta,</i> also consciousness or <i>viññana)</i> in this connection means the states of mind or units in the stream of mind of momentary duration.</p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n2a" href="#fn2a">2a</a>.] Mental objects, <i>dhamma,</i> are the mental contents or factors of consciousness making up the single states of mind.</p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>. ] Literally, &quot;setting up mindfulness in front.&quot;</p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>. ] 'Internally': contemplating his own breathing; 'externally': contemplating another's breathing; 'internally and externally': contemplating one's own and another's breathing, alternately, with uninterrupted attention. In the beginning one pays attention to one's own breathing only, and it is only in advanced stages that for the sake of practicing insight, one by inference at times pays attention also to another person's process of breathing.</p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>. ] The origination factors <i>(samudaya-dhamma),</i> that is, the conditions of the origination of the breath-body; these are: the body in its entirety, nasal aperture and mind.</p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>. ] The conditions of the dissolution of the breath-body are: the destruction of the body and of the nasal aperture, and the ceasing of mental activity.</p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>. ] The contemplation of both, alternately.</p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>. ] That is, only impersonal bodily processes exist, without a self, soul, spirit or abiding essence or substance. The corresponding phrase in the following contemplations should be understood accordingly.</p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>. ] Detached from craving and wrong view.</p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>. ] All contemplations of the body, excepting the preceding one, have as factors of origination: ignorance, craving, kamma, food, and the general characteristic of originating; the factors of dissolution are: disappearance of ignorance, craving, kamma, food, and the general characteristic of dissolving.</p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>. ] The so-called 'elements' are the primary qualities of matter, explained by Buddhist tradition as solidity (earth), adhesion (water), caloricity (fire) and motion (wind or air).</p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>. ] The factors of origination are here: ignorance, craving, kamma, and sense-impression, and the general characteristic of originating; the factors of dissolution are: the disappearance of the four, and the general characteristic of dissolving.</p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>. ] This refers to a rigid and indolent state of mind.</p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>. ] This refers to a restless mind.</p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>. ] The consciousness of the meditative absorptions of the fine-corporeal and uncorporeal sphere <i>(rupa-arupa-jhana).</i></p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>. ] The ordinary consciousness of the sensuous state of existence <i>(kamavacara).</i></p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>. ] The consciousness of the sensuous state of existence, having other mental states superior to it.</p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>. ] The consciousness of the fine-corporeal and the uncorporeal spheres, having no mundane mental state superior to it.</p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>. ] Temporarily freed from the defilements either through the methodical practice of insight <i>(vipassana)</i> freeing from single evil states by force of their opposites, or through the meditative absorptions <i>(jhana).</i></p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>. ] The factors of origination consist here of ignorance, craving, kamma, body-and-mind <i>(nama-rupa),</i> and the general characteristic of originating; the factors of dissolution are: the disappearance of ignorance, etc., and the general characteristic of dissolving.</p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>. ] The factors of origination are here the conditions which produce the hindrances, such as wrong reflection, etc., the factors of dissolution are the conditions which remove the hindrances, e.g. right reflection.</p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>. ] These five groups or aggregates constitute the so-called personality. By making them objects of clinging, existence, in the form of repeated births and deaths, is perpetuated.</p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>. ] The origination-and-dissolution factors of the five aggregates: for material form, the same as for the postures (<a href="#n10">Note 10</a>); for feeling, the same as for the contemplation of feeling (<a href="#n12">Note 12</a>); for perception and formations, the same as for feeling (<a href="#n12">Note 12</a>); for consciousness, the same as for the contemplation of consciousness (<a href="#n20">Note 20</a>).</p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>. ] The usual enumeration of the ten principal fetters <i>(samyojana),</i> as given in the Discourse Collection (Sutta Pitaka), is as follows: (1) self-illusion, (2) skepticism, (3) attachment to rules and rituals, (4) sensual lust, (5) ill-will, (6) craving for fine-corporeal existence, (7) craving for incorporeal existence, (8) conceit, (9) restlessness, (10) ignorance.</p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>. ] Origination factors of the ten physical sense-bases are ignorance, craving, kamma, food, and the general characteristic of originating; dissolution factors: the general characteristic of dissolving and the disappearance of ignorance, etc. The origination-and-dissolution factors of the mind-base are the same as those of feeling (<a href="#n12">Note 12</a>).</p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>. ] Just the conditions conducive to the origination and dissolution of the factors of enlightenment comprise the origination-and-dissolution factors here.</p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>. ] The origination-and-dissolution factors of the truths should be understood as the arising and passing of suffering, craving, and the path; the truth of cessation is not to be included in this contemplation since it has neither origination nor dissolution.</p>
<p class="lgqt">[ <a name="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>. ] That is, the non-returning to the world of sensuality. This is the last stage before the attainment of the final goal of Arahantship.</p>
