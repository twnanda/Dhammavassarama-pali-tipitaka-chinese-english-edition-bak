        go to see the Buddha)</FONT></H4>
        <P align=justify><FONT face="Times New Roman">1. I heard thus. Once the 
        Blessed One, while wandering in the <A name=kosala>Kosala</A> country 
        with a large community of bhikkhus, entered a town of the <A 
        name=kalama>Kalama</A> people called <A name=kesaputta>Kesaputta</A>. 
        The Kalamas who were inhabitants of Kesaputta: "Reverend Gotama, the 
        monk, the son of the Sakyans, has, while wandering in the Kosala 
        country, entered Kesaputta. The good repute of the Reverend Gotama has 
        been spread in this way: Indeed, the Blessed One is thus consummate, 
        fully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and practice, sublime, knower 
        of the worlds, peerless, guide of tamable men, teacher of divine and 
        human beings, which he by himself has through direct knowledge 
        understood clearly. He set forth the Dhamma, good in the beginning, good 
        in the middle, good in the end, possessed of meaning and the letter, and 
        complete in everything; and he proclaims the holy life that is perfectly 
        pure. Seeing such consummate ones is good indeed." </FONT></P>
        <P align=justify><FONT face="Times New Roman">2. Then the Kalamas who 
        were inhabitants of Kesaputta went to where the Blessed One was. On 
        arriving there some paid homage to him and sat down on one side; some 
        exchanged greetings with him and after the ending of cordial memorable 
        talk, sat down on one side; some saluted him raising their joined palms 
        and sat down on one side; some announced their name and family and sat 
        down on one side; some without speaking, sat down on one side.

        <P align=justify><FONT face="Times New Roman">3. The Kalamas who were 
        inhabitants of Kesaputta sitting on one side said to the Blessed One: 
        "There are some monks and brahmins, venerable sir, who visit Kesaputta. 
        They expound and explain only their own doctrines; the doctrines of 
        others they despise, revile, and pull to pieces. Some other monks and 
        brahmins too, venerable sir, come to Kesaputta. They also expound and 
        explain only their own doctrines; the doctrines of others they despise, 
        revile, and pull to pieces. Venerable sir, there is doubt, there is 
        uncertainty in us concerning them. Which of these reverend monks and 
        brahmins spoke the truth and which falsehood?" </FONT></P>

        <P align=justify><FONT face="Times New Roman">4. "It is proper for you, 
        Kalamas, to doubt, to be uncertain; uncertainty has arisen in you about 
        what is doubtful. Come, Kalamas. Do not go upon what has been acquired 
        by repeated hearing; nor upon tradition; nor upon rumor; nor upon what 
        is in a scripture; nor upon surmise; nor upon an axiom; nor upon

        pondered over; nor upon another's seeming ability; nor upon the

        overwhelmed and vanquished mentally by greed, this man takes life,
