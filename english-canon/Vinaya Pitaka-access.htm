<P>The Vinaya Pitaka, the first division of the <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/index.html">Tipitaka</A>, is the 
textual framework upon which the monastic community (Sangha) is built. It 
includes not only the rules governing the life of every Theravada <I>bhikkhu</I> 
(monk) and <I>bhikkhuni</I> (nun), but also a host of procedures and conventions 
of etiquette that support harmonious relations, both among the monastics 
themselves, and between the monastics and their lay supporters, upon whom they 
depend for all their material needs.</P>
<P>When the Buddha first established the Sangha, the community initially lived 
in harmony without any codified rules of conduct. As the Sangha gradually grew 
in number and evolved into a more complex society, occasions inevitably arose 
when a member would act in an unskillful way. Whenever one of these cases was 
brought to the Buddha's attention, he would lay down a rule establishing a 
suitable punishment for the offense, as a deterrent to future misconduct. The 
Buddha's standard reprimand was itself a powerful corrective:</P>
<DIV class="excerpt sutta">
<P>It is not fit, foolish man, it is not becoming, it is not proper, it is 
unworthy of a recluse, it is not lawful, it ought not to be done. How could you, 
foolish man, having gone forth under this Dhamma and Discipline which are 
well-taught, [commit such and such offense]?... It is not, foolish man, for the 
benefit of un-believers, nor for the increase in the number of believers, but, 
foolish man, it is to the detriment of both unbelievers and believers, and it 
causes wavering in some.</P>
<P class=cite>— <I>The Book of the Discipline, Part I,</I> by I.B. Horner 
(London: Pali Text Society, 1982), pp. 36-37.</P></DIV>
<P>The monastic tradition and the rules upon which it is built are sometimes 
naïvely criticized — particularly here in the West — as irrelevant to the 
"modern" practice of Buddhism. Some see the Vinaya as a throwback to an archaic 
patriarchy, based on a hodge-podge of ancient rules and customs — quaint 
cultural relics that only obscure the essence of "true" Buddhist practice. This 
misguided view overlooks one crucial fact: it is thanks to the unbroken lineage 
of monastics who have consistently upheld and protected the rules of the Vinaya 
for almost 2,600 years that we find ourselves today with the luxury of receiving 
the priceless teachings of Dhamma. Were it not for the Vinaya, and for those who 
continue to keep it alive to this day, there would be no Buddhism.</P>
<P>It helps to keep in mind that the name the Buddha gave to the spiritual path 
he taught was <I>"Dhamma-vinaya"</I> — the Doctrine <I>(Dhamma)</I> and 
Discipline <I>(Vinaya)</I> — suggesting an integrated body of wisdom and ethical 
training. The Vinaya is thus an indispensable facet and foundation of all the 
Buddha's teachings, inseparable from the Dhamma, and worthy of study by all 
followers — lay and ordained, alike. Lay practitioners will find in the Vinaya 
Pitaka many valuable lessons concerning human nature, guidance on how to 
establish and maintain a harmonious community or organization, and many profound 
teachings of the Dhamma itself. But its greatest value, perhaps, lies in its 
power to inspire the layperson to consider the extraordinary possibilities 
presented by a life of true renunciation, a life lived fully in tune with the 
Dhamma.</P>
