  <b>(19) The Twofold Thought Processes.</b> </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus. </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika in
  Jeta&#146;s grove in Saavatthi. From there the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus
  &quot;Bhikkhus, when I was a seeker of enlightenment, this occured to me: What if I
  arranged my thoughts in two folds. So I arranged these sensual thoughts, angry thoughts
  and hurting thoughts in one fold., and arranged the non-sensual thoughts, non-angry
  thoughts and the non-hurting thoughts in the second fold. When I abide diligent to dispel,
  sensual thoughts would arise. Then I know, this sensual thought has arisen to me, it is
  injurious to me, to others and to both.It is a destroyer of wisdom, on the side of trouble
  and not conductive to extinction. It fades as I think it is injurious to me, it fades, as
  I think it is injurious to others, it fades as I think it is injurious to both..It fades
  as I think it is a destroyer of wisdom, on the side of trouble and not conductive to
  extinction .Whatever sensual thoughts arise I dispel them and make them not to arise
  again. When I abide diligent to dispel angry thoughts arise. Then I know, this angry
  thought has arisen to me, it is injurious to me, to others and to both, is a destroyer of
  wisdom, on the side of trouble and not conductive to extinction. It fades as I think it is
  injurious to me, it fades as I think it is injurious to others, it fades as I think it is
  injurious to both. It fades as I think it is a destroyer of wisdom, on the side of
  trouble, and not conductive to extinction.Whatever angry thoughts arise I dispel them and
  make them not to arise again. When I abide diligent to dispel hurting thoughts arise. Then
  I know, this hurting thought has arisen to me, it is injurious to me, to others and to
  both, is a destroyer of wisdom, on the side of trouble and not conductive to extinction.
  It fades as I think it is injurious to me, it fades as I think it is injurious to others,
  it fades as I think it is injurious to both. It fades as I think it is a destroyer of
  wisdom, on the side of trouble and not conductive to extinction..Whenever hurting thoughts
  arise, I dispel them and make them not to arise again. Bhikkhus, whatever thoughts are
  thought and discursively thought, to that the mind bends Bhikkhus, when sensual thoughts
  are thought and discursively thought, they drive out non-sensual thoughts, that mind bends
  to sensual thoughts.When angry thoughts are thought and discursively thought, they drive
  out non-angry thoughts, that mind bends to angry thoughts. When hurting thoughts are
  thought and discursively, they drive out non-hurting thoughts, that mind bends to hurting
  thoughts.Like the cowherd, in the autumn months protecting the the thick corn.would thrash
  the cattle, check them and turn them out. What is the reason. The cowherd knows the danger
  and the blame that he has to face on account of it. Bhikkhus, in the same manner, I saw
  the danger of defiling demeritorious things, and the benefits and purity of
  non-sensual.thoughts when I abide diligent to dispel, non-sensual thoughts arise. Then I
  know, this non-sensual thought has arisen to me, it is not injurious to me, not injurious
  to others and not injurious to either. It is not a destroyer of wisdom, not in the side of
  trouble and conductive to extinction. If these thoughts are thought and discursively
  thought, throughout the night I do not see any fear on account of it. If these thoughts
  are thought and discursively thought, throughout the day, I do not see any fear on account
  of it. If these thoughts are thought throughout and night and day, I do not see any fear
  on account of it.Yet when these thoughts are thought and discursively thought too long,
  the body gets exhausted. When the body is exhausted, the mind is disturbed, the disturbed
  mind is far from concentration. What is the reason. May my mind not be disturbed When I
  abide diligent to dispel, non-angry thoughts arise. Then I know, this non-angry thought
  has arisen to me, it is not injurious to me, not injurious to others and not injurious to
  either. It is not a destroyer of wisdom, not in the side of trouble and conductive to
  extinction. If these thoughts are thought and discursively thought, throughout the night I
  do not see any fear on account of it. If these thoughts are thought and discursively
  thought, throughout the day, I do not see any fear on account of it. If these thoughts are
  thought throughout and night and day, I do not see any fear on account of it.Yet when
  these thoughts are thought and discursively thought too long, the body gets exhausted.
  When the body is exhausted, the mind is disturbed, the disturbed mind is far from
  concentration. What is the reason. May my mind not be disturbed.When I abide diligent to
  dispel, non-hurting thoughts arise. Then I know, this non-hurting thought has arisen to
  me, it is not injurious to me, not injurious to others and not injurious to either. It is
  not a destroyer of wisdom, not in the side of trouble and conductive to extinction. If
  these thoughts are thought and discursively thought, throughout the night I do not see any
  fear on account of it. If these thoughts are thought and discursively thought, throughout
  the day, I do not see any fear on account of it. If these thoughts are thought throughout
  and night and day, I do not see any fear on account of it.Yet when these thoughts are
  thought and discursively thought too long, the body gets exhausted. When the body is
  exhausted, the mind is disturbed, the disturbed mind is far from concentration. What is
  the reason. May my mind not be disturbed. Bhikkhus, whatever thoughts are thought and
  discursively thought, to that the mind bends Bhikkhus, when non- sensual thoughts are
  thought and discursively thought, they drive out sensual thoughts, that mind bends to non-
  sensual thoughts.When non-angry thoughts are thought and discursively thought, they drive
  out angry thoughts, that mind bends to non-angry thoughts. When non- hurting thoughts are
  thought and discursively thought, they drive out hurting thoughts, that mind bends to
  non-hurting thoughts. Like the cowherd, in the last month in Summer, when all the corn is
  stored at the end of the village protecting the cattle, would be only mindful of them, in
  the shade of a tree or in the open. Bhikkhus, in the same manner, the bhikkhu has only to
  be mindful of these meritorious things. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, my effort aroused undeterred, unconfused mindfulness established, the body
  appeased, the mind concentrated in one point. I secluded it from sensual thoughts and evil
  thoughts, with thoughts and thought processes experiencing joy and pleasantness born of
  seclusion abode in the first jhaana. </p>
  <p>Overcoming thoughts and thought processes, the mind internally appeased, in one point,
  without thoughts and thought processes, experiencing joy and pleasantness born of
  concentration I abode in the second jhaana. With joy and with equanimity to detachment
  became mindful and aware experiencing pleasantness with the body, and abode in the third
  jhaana. To this the noble ones say, abiding mindfully in equanimity. </p>
  <p>Dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness, earlier having dispelled pleasure and
  displeasure and without unpleasantness and pleasaantness mindfulness purified with
  equanimity abode in the fourth jhaana. </p>
  <p>When the concentrated mind was without blemish pure, malleable, workable and not
  vacillating I directed the mind to know previous births. I recollected the manifold
  previous births such as one birth, two births, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty,
  forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand births, innumerable forward cycles
  of births, innumerable backward cycles of births and innumerable forward and backward
  cycles of births. There I was of such name, clan, disposition, supports, experiencing such
  pleasant and unpleasant feelings, and with such a life span. Disappearing from there was
  born there, There too I was of such name, clan, disposition, supports, experiencing such
  pleasant and unpleasant feelings, and with such .a life span. Disappearing from there is
  born here.Thus I recollect the manifold previous births..This is the first knowledge that
  I realized in the first watch of the night and knowledge arose and darkness got dispelled
  when I abode diligent for dispelling. </p>
  <p>When the concentrated mind was without blemish pure, malleable, workable and not
  vacillating I directed the mind to know the disappearing and appearing of beings. With the
  purified heavenly eye gone beyond human, I saw beings disappearing and appearing unexalted
  and exalted, beautiful and ugly, in good and bad states, according to their actions I knew
  beings. These good beings, misconducting in bodily, verbal and mental behaviour, blaming
  noble ones and with wrong view, at the end of life go to loss are born in hell. . </p>
  <p>These good beings, endowed with good conduct, bodily, verbally and mentally,not blaming
  noble ones, come to right view and to right view of actions, at the end of life go to
  increase are born in heaven. Thus with the purified heavenly eye gone beyond human I saw
  beings disappearing and appearing unexalted and exalted, beautiful and ugly, in good and
  bad states according their actions. This is the second knowledge I realized in the second
  watch of the night and knowledge arose and darkness got dispelled, when I abode diligent
  for dispelling. </p>
  <p>When the concentrated mind was without blemish pure, malleable, workable and not
  vacillating I directed the mind to the knowledge of the destruction of desires: Then I
  thoroughly knew as it really is, this is unpleasant. Thoroughly knew as it really is, this
  is the arising of unpleasantness. Thoroughly knew as it really is, this is the cessation
  of unpleasantness. Thoroughly knew as it really is, this is the path to the cessation of
  unpleasantness. Knew as it really is , these are desires. Knew as it really is, this is
  the arising of desires. Knew as it really is, this is the cessation of desires. Knew as it
  really is, this is the path to the cessation of desires. When I knew and realized this, my
  mind experienced the release from sensual desires. the release from desires &#145;to
  be&#146;., the release from desires of ignorance.. Knowledge arose I am released, birth is
  ended, the holy life is lived to the end, what should be done is done is done, there is
  nothing more to wish . This is the third knowledge I realized in the third watch of the
  night and knowledge arose and darkness got dispelled, when I abode diligent for
  dispelling. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, just as there is a large marshy land in the forest woodlands, where supported
  many wild animals live. To a certain man arises unwholesome thoughts, he closes up the
  peaceful happy ways of the wild animals and opens up a vicious path, places a male and
  female decoy, a large number of animals come to destruction on account of that. A certain
  other man desires the welfare and relief of those same wild animals. He opens up a
  peaceful path that brings menal peace and calm, closes up the vicious path, destroys the
  male and female decoys. As time went a large number of wild animals came to growth and
  development. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, this is only a simile to explain the meaning, A larage marshy land is a
  synonym for sensuality, many wild animals is a synonym for beings, a man with unwholesome
  thoughts is a synonym for Maara the defiler. Bhikkhus, the vicious path is a synonym for
  the wrong eightfold path, such as wrong view, wrong thoughts, wrong speech, wrong actions,
  wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness and wrong concentration. Male decoy is a
  synonym for greed and interest. Female decoy is a synonym for ignorance. </p>
  <p>The man who desires the welfare and relief of the wild animals is a synonym for the
  Thus Gone One, worthy and rightfully enlightened. The peaceful path that brings peace and
  mental calm is a synonym for the Noble eightfold path: such as right view, right thoughts,
  right speech, right actions, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right
  concentration. Thus bhikkhus, I have opened peaceful path, that brings mental peace and
  calm, the vicious path is closed up, the male decoy is removed, the female decoy is
  destroyed. What a Teacher could do out of compassion for his disciples, that I have done,
  There are roots of trees and empty houses. Bhikkhus, concentrate do not be negligent and
  repent later. This is our advice to you. </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One.
