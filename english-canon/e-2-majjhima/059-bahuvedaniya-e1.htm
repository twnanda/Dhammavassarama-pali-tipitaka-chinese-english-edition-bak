  <b>(59) The Discourse On Many Feelings.</b> </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus. </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anathapindika in
  Jeta&#146;s grove in Savatthi. The carpenter Pancakanga approached venerable Udayi
  worshipped and sat on a side and asked &#145;Venerable sir, how many feelings are made
  known by the Blessed One?&#146; &#145;Householder, three feelings, are made known by the
  Blessed One. They are pleasant feelings, unpleasant feelings and neither unpleasant nor
  pleasant feelings&#146;.&#146;Venerable Udayi, there are only two feelings pointed out by
  the Blessed One. They are pleasant feelings and unpleasant feelings, neither unpleasant
  nor pleasant feelings are an exalted state declared by the Blessed One&#146;. For the
  second time venerable Udayi said to the carpenter Pancakanga. &#145;Householder, not two
  feelings, the Blessed One has said of three feelings, pleasant feelings, unpleasant
  feelings and neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings&#146;. For the second time, the
  carpenter Pancakanga said, &#145;Venerable Udayi, two feelings are made known by the
  Blessed One and they are pleasant feelings and unpleasant feelings. This neither
  unpleasant nor pleasant feelings, is an exalted state is said, by the Blessed One&#146;.
  For the third time venerable Udayi said to the carpenter Pancakanga. &#145;Householder,
  the Blessed One has said of three feelings, pleasant feelings, unpleasant feelings and
  neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings&#146;. For the third time, the carpenter
  Pancakanga said. &#145;Venerable Udayi, only two feelings are pointed out by the Blessed
  One and they are pleasant feelings and unpleasant feelings. The neither unpleasant nor
  pleasant feelings, is an exalted state is said, by the Blessed One&#146;. Venerable Udayi
  could not convince the carpenter Pancakanga and the carpenter Pancakanga could not
  convince venerable Udayi. </p>
  <p>Venerable Ananda heard this conversation between venerable Udayi and the carpenter
  Pancakanga and approached the Blessed One worshipped the Blessed One and sat on a side and
  related the complete conversation to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One addressed
  venerable Ananda. &#145;Two feelings are also declared by me,three in another, five in
  another, six in another, eighteen in another, thirty-six in another and also in another
  one hundred and eight feelings. Thus Ananda, this Teaching is analytically preached.
  Ananda, in this analytical Teaching, if one does not approve another&#146;s view
  appreciating and accepting it, this kind of thing could happen and quarrels, fights,
  disputes and verbal fights would ensue. Therefore you should be united, open hearted,
  should co-operate like milk and water, and should look at each other with understanding
  and abide&#146;. </p>
  <p>Ananda, there are five strands of sense desires. What five: Pleasant agreeable forms
  cognizable by eye consciousness arousing fondness and sensual desires. Pleasant agreeable
  sounds&#151;Pleasant agreeable smells-- Pleasant agreeable tastes -- Pleasant agreeable
  touches cognizable by body consciousness arousing fondness and sensual desires. Ananda,
  these are the five strands of sensual desires. All pleasure and pleasantness that arise on
  account of the five strands of sensual desires, are said sensual pleasures. </p>
  <p>Ananda, if someone says, this is the highest pleasure, beings experience, I would not
  second it. What is the reason? Ananda, there is a pleasantness which exceeds this, and is
  more exalted than this. Ananda, what is that pleasantness which exceeds this and is more
  exalted than this? Here the bhikkhu secluded from sensual desires, secluded from things of
  demerit, with thoughts and thought processes and with joy and pleasantness born from
  seclusion abides in the first jhaana. Ananda, this exceeds, and is more exalted than the
  previous.. </p>
  <p>Ananda, if someone says, this is the highest pleasure, beings experience, I would not

  exalted than this? Here, the bhikkhu overcoming thoughts and thought processes, and the
  mind, in one point internally appeased without thoughts and thought processes and with joy
  and pleasantness born of concentration abides in the second jhaana Ananda, this
  pleasantness exceeds and is more exalted than the previous. </p>

  more exalted than this? </p>
  <p>Here the bhikkhu with equanimity to joy and detachment abides mindful and aware, of
  pleasantness with the body too and abides in the third jhaana. To this the noble ones say,
  abiding mindfully in equanimity. Ananda, this exceeds and is more exalted than the
  previous. </p>

  <p>Here, Ananda, the bhikkhu, overcoming all the sphere of neither perception nor
  non-perception attains to the sphere where perceptions and feelings fade Ananda, this
  pleasantness exceeds and is more exalted than the previous. </p>
  <p>Ananda, there is a possibility, for ascetics of other sects to question, does the
  recluse Gotama declare the cessation of perceptions and feelings also as a feeling? How
  could that happen? How could that be? This is our reply to those ascetics of other sects.
  Friends, for the matter of only feeling pleasant, the Blessed One does not declare it as
  pleasant. Whenever pleasantness is gained to that the Blessed One declares pleasant (* ). </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said thus and venerable Aananda, delighted in the words of the Blessed
  One. </p>
  <p><b>Notes:</b> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(*) Friends for the matter of only feeling pleasant, the Blessed One does not declare
    it as pleasant. Whenever pleasantness is gained, to that the Blessed One declares
    pleasant.<em>&#146;na kho aavuso bhagavaa sukha.myeva vedana.m sandhaaya sukhasmi.m
    pa~n~naapeti.apica aavuso yattha yattha sukha.m upalabhati yahi.m yahi.m ta.m ta.m
    tathaagato sukhasmi.m pa~n~naapeti.&#146;</em> Yet when pleasantness is gained, to that
    the Blessed One declares pleasant. Thediscourse shows how the least pleasantness in the
    sensual sphere and the most exalted pleasantness in the immaterial sphere is gained,. yet
    the Blessed One is not pleased clinging to even that highest pleasantness. Extinction and
    enlightenment means giving up that too.&nbsp; </p>
