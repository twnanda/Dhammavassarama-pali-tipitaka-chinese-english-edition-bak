  <b>(21) The Simile of the Saw.</b> </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus. </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika in
  Jeta&#146;s grove in Saavatthi. At that time venerable Moliyaphagguna spent much time
  associating the bhikkhunis.This association was such that if any bhikkhu blamed the
  bhikkhunis in the presence of venerable Moliyaphagguna, he was annoyed and spoke much in
  favour of them and if any bhikkhu blamed venerable Moliyaphagguna in the presence of the
  bhikkhunis, they were annoyed and spoke much in favour of him. Venerable Moliyaphagguna
  and the bhikkhunis maintained such an association. Then a certain bhikkhu approached the
  Blessed One, worshipped the Blessed One, sat on a side and said thus: Venerable sir,
  venerable Moliyaphagguna spends much time associating the bhikkhunis. This association is
  such that if any bhikkhu blamed the bhikkhunis in the presence of venerable
  Moliyaphagguna, he gets annoyed and speaks much in favour of them. And if any bhikkhu
  blamed venerable Moliyaphagguna in the presence of the bhikkhunis, they were annoyed and
  spoke much in favour of him. Venerable Moliyaphagguna maintains such an association with
  the bhikkhunis. Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu &#145;Come here bhikkhu,
  in my words, call bhikkhu Moliyaphagguna, tell the Teacher wants you&#146; He consented
  and approached venerable Moliyaphagguna and said the Teacher calls you venerable Phagguna.
  He said yes, venerable one and approached the Blessed One worshipped and sat on a side.
  Then the Blessed One said thus: </p>
  <p>Phagguna, is it true, that you spend much time with the bhikkhunis. Do you maintain
  such an association with the bhikkhunis that when a bhikkhu blames the bhikkhunis in your
  presence, you get annoyed and talk in favour of the bhikkhunis, and when a bhikkhu blames
  you in the presence of the bhikkhnis, they get annoyed and talk in favour of you.
  Phagguna, do you maintain such an association with the bhikkhunis-Yes, veneraable sir.-
  Aren&#146;t you the son of a clansman who has gone forth as a homeless out of faith-I am
  venerable sir.-Phagguna, it is not suitable for the son of a clansman, who has gone forth
  as a homeless to spend much time with the bhikkhunis- Therefore Phagguna, when anyone
  blames the bhikkhunis in your presence, you should give up that worldly interest and
  worldly thoughts. Phagguna, there you should train like this -My mind will not change, I
  will not utter evil words, I will abide with compassion and loving kindness without an
  angry thought. Again Pagguna, if anyone beat those bhikkhunis with their hands or with
  clods, or sticks, or weapons, you should train as above. Again Phagguna, if anyone blames
  you in the face, you should train as above. If anyone beats you with hands, or clods, or
  sticks, or weapons, you should give up that worldly interest and worldly thoughts.
  Phagguna, there you should train like this- My mind will not change, I will not utter evil
  words, I will abide with compassion and loving kindness, without an angry thought. </p>
  <p>Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus. O! Bhikkhus, at one time I convinced the
  minds of the bhikkhus to partake of one meal a day, this is what I said: Bhikkhus, I
  partake of one meal a day, partaking one meal a day I experienced few ailments, few
  disorders, lightness, power, and a comfortable abiding. Bhikkhus, you too partake of one
  meal a day and experience few ailments, few disorders, lightness, power and a comfortable
  abiding. There wasn&#146;t a need to advice those bhikkhus, the mere arousing of
  mindfulness was enough. Like a cart with thoroughbreds yoked, stationed on the four cross
  roads in some even land. Then a clever tamer of horses, a charioteer comes and mounting
  the cart takes the reins in the left hand and the whip in the right hand proceeds and
  receeds as he likes and where he likes. Even so there wasn&#146;t a need to advice those
  bhikkhus,only arousing mindfulness was necessary. Therefore bhikkhus, dispel demerit and
  pursuse merit. In that manner, you come to growth and development in this dispensation of
  the Teaching Like a Sal grove near a village or hamlet would have an under growth of
  weeds. Then a certain man desiring their welfare uproots all the weeds which rob the
  moisture and throws them out and the Sal trees grow straight, and well . Thus in the mean
  time the Sal trees grow and develop well. Bhikkhus, in the same manner, dispel demerit and
  pursue merit.So you too grow and develop in this dispensation </p>
  <p>At one time in this same Saavatthi there was a householer&#146;s wife named Vedehikaa
  and there was such praise given to her, Vedehikaa is gentle, humble and calm. This
  householder&#146;s wife had a slave named Kaali. She was clever, not lazy, and well
  arranged in her work.It occured to Kaali, my mistress is praised as gentle, humble and
  calm, What, is my mistress really calm that she does not show the anger within, or is she
  not calm. Or is it because I am well arranged in my work that my mistress does not show
  her anger, or is she not calm What if I examined my mistress. So the slave Kaali got up
  late in the day. The householder&#146;s wife Vedehikaa called out, Hey Kaali! Why do you
  get up late. For no reason Lady. Evil one why do you get up late, without a reason, saying
  this she was angry and showed displeasure. Then to the slave Kaali it occured thus: Does
  my mistress have anger within, which she does not show or hasn&#146;t she. Is it because
  am well arranged in my work that my mistress does not show anger and not that she
  hasn&#146;t. What if I examine her further. Then the slave Kaali got up still more
  late.Then the householder&#146;s wife Vedehikaa called out: Hey Kaali! Why do you get up
  late. For no reason lady. Evil one, why do you get up late, without a reason, saying this
  she was angry, showed displeasure and uttered distasteful words. Then it occured to the
  slave Kaali, me&#146; lady indeed has anger within which she does not put out, it is not
  she hasn&#146;t. It is because am well arranged in my work, that she does not show her
  anger and it is not that she hasn&#146;t anger. What if I examine my mistress further. So
  she got up still more late. Then the householder&#146;s wife Vedehikaa called out, Hey
  Kaali! Why do you get up late. For no reason lady. Evil one, why do you get up late for no
  reason, saying this she showed anger, took a rolling pin and hit Kaali on her head. Then
  Kaali with her head split, blood oozing and dripping called out to the neighbours: Ladies
  look at the gentle one&#146;s work, look at the humble one&#146;s work, look at the calm
  one&#146;s work How could she hit the head, and split the head of her only slave, for
  getting up late. Then, the householder&#146;s wife Vedehika&#146;s ill fame spread.
  Vedehika the householder&#146;s wife is rough, not humble and not calm. Bhikkhus, in the
  same manner a certain bhikkhu would be gentle, humble and calm until he is touched by
  disagreeable words. It is when touched by disagreeable words that it should be known
  whether the bhikkhu is gentle, humble and calm. Bhikkhus, in the same manner a bhikkhu may
  become calm with the gain of robes, morsel food, dwellings and requisites when ill, not
  gaining robes, morsel food, dwellings and requissites when ill, he would not be calm any
  more. </p>
  <p>The bhikkhu who becomes calm honouring the Teaching and according to the Teaching, is
  calm and suave. </p>
  <p>Therefore you should train, we honouring the Teaching, and living according to the
  Teaching, will be calm and suave. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, others speaking would speak in this fivefold way. At the right time, or not
  at the right time, The false or the truth. With kindness or roughly. For the good of
  someone, or for his disaster. With thoughts of loving kindness, or with anger. Then you
  should train thus: Our minds will not change, we will not utter evil words, We will abide
  compassionate with thoughts of loving kindness not angry. We will pervade that person who
  uttered those words, with thoughts of loving kindness. With that same thought of loving
  kindness grown great and measureless, without enmity we will abide pervading everywhere.
  Bhikkhus, thus you should train. . </p>
  <p>Like a man who comes with hoe and basket saying, I will make this great earth go
  without earth . Then he would dig here and there, throw earth here and there, spit here
  and there, urinate here and there and would say, be without earth. Yet would he be able to
  make this great earth without earth. This great earth is deep and immearsurable and it
  would not be possible to make this great earth go without earth, it will only bring
  fatigue to that man. In the same manner fivefold is the ways of speech. It would be at the
  right time or not at the right time. The false or the truth. With kindness or roughly. For
  the good of someone or for his disaster. With thoughts of loving kindness or with anger.
  Then you should train thus. Our minds will not change, we will not utter evil words. We
  will abide compassionate with thoughts of loving kindness not angry. We will pervade that
  person who uttered those words with thoughts of loving kindness. With that same sign,
  grown great and developed extensively as much as the world I pervade and abide. Bhikkhus,
  you should train thus. </p>
  <p>Like a man who comes with various colours of dye, red, yellow, blue and orange saying I
  will draw pictures in space.I will make them appear in space.Yet would he be able to draw
  pictures in space, to make them appear . In immaterial space, he cannot draw pictures and
  make them appear, it is not easy, it will bring him only fatigue In the same manner
  fivefold is the ways of speech. It would be at the right time or not at the right time.
  The false or the truth. With kindness or roughly. For the good of someone or for his
  disaster. With thoughts of loving kindness or with anger. Then you should train thus. Our
  minds will not change, we will not utter evil words. We will abide compassionate with
  thoughts of loving kindness not angry. We will pervade that person who uttered those words
  with thoughts of loving kindness. With that same sign, grown great and developed
  extensively as much as space I pervade and abide. Bhikkhus, you should train thus. </p>
  <p>Like a man who comes with a burning grass torch saying I will heat, scorch and dry up
  river Ganges. Yet would he be able to heat, scorch and dry up river Ganges. As immense as
  the waters of river Ganges it is not posssible to heat, scorch and dry her up, it will
  cause that man only fatigue. In the same manner fivefold is the ways of speech. It would
  be at the right time or not at the right time. The false or the truth. With kindness or
  roughly. For the good of someone or for his disaster. With thoughts of loving kindness or
  with anger. Then you should train thus. Our minds will not change, we will not utter evil
  words. We will abide compassionate with thoughts of loving kindness not angry. We will
  pervade that person who uttered those words with thoughts of loving kindness. With that
  same sign, grown great and developed extensively as much as the water of Ganges, I pervade
  and abide. Bhikkhus, you should train thus. </p>
  <p>Like a man who comes with a catskin bag threshed, polished and tested for
  soundlessness, saying I will make a sound with this catskin bag with a stick or stone. Yet
  would he be able to make a sound with the catskin bag with a stick or stone. That catskin
  bag is threshed, polished and tested for soundlessness, it would not be possible to make a
  sound with it, he will only gain fatigue on account of it. In the same manner fivefold is
  the ways of speech. It would be at the right time or not at the right time. The false or
  the truth. With kindness or roughly. For the good of someone or for his disaster. With
  thoughts of loving kindness or with anger. Then you should train thus. Our minds will not
  change, we will not utter evil words. We will abide compassionate with thoughts of loving
  kindness not angry. We will pervade that person who uttered those words with thoughts of
  loving kindness. With that same sign, grown great and developed extensively as much as the
  catskin bag , I pervade and abide. Bhikkhus, you should train thus. </p>
  <p>O! Bhikkhus, even if robbers cut your limbs one after another with a two handled saw,
  if your mind be defiled on account of that, you have not done the duty in my dispensation
  Then too you should train thus. Our minds will not change, we will not utter evil words.
  We will abide compassionate with thoughts of loving kindness not angry. We will pervade
  that person with thoughts of loving kindness. With that same sign, grown great and
  developed extensively, I pervade and abide. Bhikkhus, you should train thus. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, you should constantly attend to the advice on the simile of the saw. Is there
  anything small or large in those words of others which you would not endure. Therefore
  bhikkhus, constantly attend to the advice on the simile of the saw, it will be for your
  welfare and happiness for a long time. </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One.
