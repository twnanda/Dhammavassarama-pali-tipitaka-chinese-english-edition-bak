  (134) A single auspicious attachment&nbsp;to Venerable Lomasangiya</span></strong></font></p>
  <p><span lang="EN-GB">I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika in
  Jeta&#146;s grove in Saavatthi. At that time venerable Lomasangiya was dwelling in
  Nigrodha&#146;s monasteryin Kapilavatthu in the Sakya country. Then the deity Chandana
  when the night was waning illuminated the whole Nigrodha monastery with a resplendent
  light, approached venerable Lomasangiya, stood on a side and said&#146;Bhikkhu, do you
  remember the short and detailed exposition of the single auspicious attachment? </p>
  <p>&#145;Friend, I do not remember the short and detailed exposition of the single
  auspicious attachment. Do you remember it? </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhu, I too do not remember the short and detailed exposition of the single
  auspicious attachment. Bhikkhu, do you remember the verses of the single auspicious
  attachment.&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Friend, I do not remember the verses of the single auspicious attachment. Do you
  remember them?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhu, I remember the verses of the single auspicious attachment.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Friend, how is it that you remember the verses of the ssingle auspicious
  attachment?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhu, once the Blessed One abode under the Paricchattaka shade with the gods
  of the thirty and there the short and detailed explanation ofthe single auspicious
  attachment was preached to the gods of the thirty three. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Do not recollect the past, nor desire the future, <br>
    The past is over, the future has not come. <br>
    These things of the present, see them with insight as they arise <br>
    Not faltering and not moved, think about them. <br>
    Today itself the dispelling should be done <br>
    Tomorrow death might come <br>
    We will not have any associations with Death and his great army <br>
    You should abide dispelling thus, day and night zealously, <br>
    This is the single auspicious attachment, the appeased sage tells&nbsp; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Bhikkhu, in this manner I remember the verses of the single auspicious
  attachment.Bhikkhu, learn, practise and remember the short and detailed exposition of the
  single auspicious attachment, it tells the fundamentalsof the holy life.saying this, the
  deity vanished from there.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Venerable Lomasangiya at the end of that night, arranged his dwelling and taking bowl
  and robes, left on a tour to reach Saavatthi. Coming in stages he reached the monastery
  offered by Anaathapindika in Jeta&#146;s grove in Saavatthi, approached the Blessed One
  worshipped and sat on a side. Venerable Lomasangiya said. &#145;Venerable sir, once I was
  dwelling in Nigrodha&#146;s monasteryin Kapilavatthu in the Sakya country. Then a certain
  deity, when the night was waning illuminated the whole Nigrodha monastery with a
  resplendent light, approached me, stood on a side and said&#146;Bhikkhu, do you remember
  the short and detailed exposition of the single auspicious attachment? I said friend, I do
  not remember the short and detailed exposition of the single auspicious attachment. Do you
  remember it? Then that deity said, bhikkhu, I too do not remember the short and detailed
  exposition of the single auspicious attachment. Bhikkhu, do you remember the verses of the
  single auspicious attachment? Then I saidfriend, I do not remember the verses of the
  single auspicious attachment. Do you remember them? Then he said bhikkhu, I remember the
  verses of the single auspicious attachment. Then I asked, friend, how is it that you
  remember the verses of the single auspicious attachment? Venerablesir he said, bhikkhu,
  once the Blessed One abode under the Paricchattaka shade with the gods of the thirty and
  there the short and detailed explanation ofthe single auspicious attachment was preached
  to the gods of the thirty three. </p>
