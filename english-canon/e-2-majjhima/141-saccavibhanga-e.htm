  <b>141. Classification of the Truth.</b> </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One was lived in the deer sanctuary in Isispatana, in Benares
  and addressed the bhikkhus from there. &#145;O! Bhikkhus.&#146; Those bhikkhus replied
  &#145;Yes venerable sir.&#146; The Blessed One said &#145;Bhikkhus, the Thus Gone One
  worthy, rightfully enlightened set rolling the Teaching not to be interrupted by a
  recluse, a brahmin, a god, Maara, Brahmaa or anyone in the world, announcing, detailing
  establishing and explaining the four noble truths. </p>
  <p>What are the four? They are the announcing, detailing, establishing and explaining, the
  noble truth of unpleasantness, its arising, its cessation and the path and method leading
  to its cessation. Bhikkhus, associate Saariputta and Moggallaana. They are wise and
  helpful to those leading the holy life. </p>
  <p>Saariputta is like the mother who gives birth and Moggallaana is like the father.
  Saariputta trains until the fruition of the entry into the stream of the Teaching and
  Moggallaana until the highest aim is attained. Bhikkhus, Saariputta can announce, detail,
  establish and explain the four noble truths. </p>
  <p>Saying this the Blessed One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. </p>
  <p>Then venerable Saariputta soon after the Blessed had left, addressed the bhikkhus.
  &#145;Bhikkhus, the Thus Gone One worthy, rightfully enlightened set rolling the Teaching
  not to be interrupted by a recluse, a brahmin, a god, Maara, Brahmaa or anyone in the
  world, announcing, detailing establishing and explaining the four noble truths. </p>
  <p>Friends, what is the noble truth of unpleasantness? Birth is unpleasant. So too are
  decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress. Unfulfilled desires
  are also unpleasant. In short the five holding masses are unpleasant. </p>
  <p>Friends, what is birth? The conscious birth in the womb of that and other group of
  beings, appearing of the masses and the gain of the mental faculties is birth. </p>
  <p>Friends, what is decay? The breaking up of the body, grayness of hair, wrinkling of the
  skin, the decrease of the life span and maturing of the mental faculties in this and other
  group of beings is decay. </p>
  <p>Friends, what is death? The disappearing, falling away, breaking up, apparent death,
  end of the life span, the falling apart of the masses and laying down the body of this and
  other group of beings is called death. </p>
  <p>Friends, what is grief? Faced with one or the other kind of disaster, the grievous
  thoughts stricken by grief and the resulting internal and severe grief is called grief. </p>
  <p>Friends, what is lament? Faced with one or the other kind of disaster, the grievous
  laments stricken by grief and the resulting loud and soft laments are called lamenting. </p>
  <p>Friends, what is unpleasantness? Unpleasant, disagreeable feeling born of unpleasant
  disagreeable bodily contact (*1) is called unpleasantness. </p>
  <p>Friends, what is displeasure? Unpleasant, disagreeable feeling born of unpleasant
  disagreeable mental contact (*2) is called displeasure. </p>
  <p>Friends, what is a disturbed condition? Faced with one or the other kind of disaster,
  the arising unpleasant thoughts cause a disturbed condition that is troublesome and
  disturbing. This is called a disturbing condition. </p>
  <p>Friends, what are unfulfilled desires that are unpleasant? Beings have such desires
  about birth. May birth not be to me. In this way non-birth does not come. It is not
  obtainable by desiring. This is an unfulfilled desire, which is unpleasant. Beings have
  such desires about decay. May decay not be to me. In this way non-decay does not come. It
  is not obtainable by desiring. This is an unfulfilled desire, which is unpleasant. Beings
  have such desires about ailing. May ailments not come to me. In this way non-ailing does
  not come. It is not obtainable by desiring. This is an unfulfilled desire that is
  unpleasant. Beings have such desires about death. May death not be to me. In this way
  deathlessness does not come. It is not obtainable by desiring. This is an unfulfilled
  desire, which is unpleasant. Beings have such desires about grief, lament, unpleasantness,
  displeasure and disturbed conditions. May grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and
  disturbed conditions not come to me. In this way non-grief, non-lament, pleasantness,
  pleasure and the undisturbed condition do not come. They are not obtainable by desiring.
  These are unfulfilled desires, which are unpleasant. </p>
  <p>Friends, how are the five holding masses in short unpleasant? In short the five holding
  masses of matter, feelings, perceptions, determinations and consciousness are unpleasant
  (*3). </p>
  <p>Friends, this is the noble truth of unpleasantness. </p>
  <p>Friends, what is the noble truth, of the arising of unpleasantness? The interest and
  greed to be again and again, rejoicing in sensuality, in desires &#145;to be&#146; and
  desires &#145;not to be&#146;. To this is called the noble truth of the arising of
  unpleasantness. </p>
  <p>Friends, what is the noble truth, of the cessation of unpleasantness? Non-greed without
  anything left behind, the cessation, giving up the settlements of that same greed, is
  called the noble truth of the cessation of unpleasantness. </p>
  <p>Friends, what is the noble truth, of the path and method for the cessation of
  unpleasantness? This same noble Eight-fold path, such as right view, right thoughts, right
  speech, right actions, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right
  concentration is called the noble truth, of the path and method for the cessation of
  unpleasantness. </p>
  <p>Friends, what is right view? Recognizing unpleasantness, its arising, its cessation and
  the path and method leading to the cessation of unpleasantness is called right view. </p>
  <p>Friends, what are right thoughts? Thoughts, of giving up sensuality, turning away from
  anger and turning away from hurting are called right thoughts. </p>
  <p>Friends, what is right speech? Abstaining from lies, slandering, rough speech and
  frivolous speech is called right speech. </p>
  <p>Friends, what is right action? Abstaining from, destroying living things, taking the
  not given and misbehaving in sexual needs is called right action. </p>
  <p>Friends, what is right livelihood? Here the noble disciple refrains from wrong
  livelihood and leads a livelihood that is right. This is called right livelihood. </p>
  <p>Friends, what is right effort? Here, the bhikkhu arouses interest, puts forth effort
  and makes the mind spring forward. For the non arising of non-arisen evil thoughts of
  demerit, for the dispelling of arisen evil thoughts of demerit, for the arousing of non
  arisen thoughts of merit and for the non deluded establishment, development and completion
  of arisen thoughts of merit. This is called right effort. </p>
  <p>. Friends, what is right mindfulness? Here the bhikkhu is zealously mindful and aware
  to dispel covetousness and displeasure in the world, reflecting, the body in the body, the
  feeling in feelings, the mental state in the mind and the thought in thoughts. This is
  called right mindfulness. </p>
  <p>Friends, what is right concentration? Here the bhikkhu forsaking sensuality and evil
  thoughts, with thoughts, discursive thoughts and joy and pleasantness born of seclusion
  abides in the first jhaana. Overcoming thoughts and discursive thoughts, the mind
  internally appeased and concentrated in one point, and with joy and pleasantness born of
  concentration abides in the second jhaana.. Again the bhikkhu abides mindful and aware
  with equanimity to joy and detachment, with the body experiencing pleasantness too (*4)
  and abides in the third jhaana. To this the noble ones say abiding in pleasantness mindful
  of equanimity. Again the bhikkhu dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness and earlier
  having dispelled pleasure and displeasure and with mindfulness purified with equanimity
  abides in the fourth jhaana. To this is called right mindfulness. </p>
  <p>Friends, this is the noble truth of the path and method for the cessation of
  unpleasantness. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, the Thus Gone One worthy, rightfully enlightened set rolling the Teaching not
  to be interrupted by a recluse, a brahmin, a god, Maara, Brahmaa or anyone in the world,
  announcing, detailing establishing and explaining the four noble truths. </p>
  <p>Venerable Saariputta said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed
  One. </p>
  <p><b>Notes.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Unpleasant, disagreeable feeling born of unpleasant disagreeable bodily contact is
    called unpleasantness.&#146;<i>ya.m kho, aavuso, kaayika.m dukkha.m kaayika.m asaata.m
    kaayasamphassaja.m dukkha.m asaata.m vedaniiya.m &#150;ida.m vuccati aavuso dukkha.m&#146;</i>
    The body consists of six doors of mental contact pervading the six spheres of contact in
    the form of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches and ideas. A person collects data from
    the world through these contacts. Some contacts are unpleasant and disagreeable and they
    give birth to unpleasant and disagreeable feelings. This is unpleasantness. </p>
    <p>2. Unpleasant disagreeable feeling born of unpleasant disagreeable mental contact is
    called displeasure. <i>&#146;ya.m kho aavuso cetasika.m asaata.m manosamphassaja.m
    dukkha.m asaata.m vedaniiya.m &#150;ida.m vuccati aavuso domanassa.m&#146;</i>The mental
    unpleasant, disagreeable feeling is displeasure. As soon as the bodily pleasant agreeable
    feeling fades, there pervades the mental unpleasant, disagreeable feeling. </p>
    <p>3. In short the five holding masses of matter, feelings, perceptions, determinations
    and consciousness are unpleasant. <i>&#145;seyyathiida.m ruupuupaadaanakkhando
    vedanuupaadaanakkhando sa~n~nuupaadaanakkhanado sankhaaruupaadaanakkhando
    vi~n~naanuupaadanakkhando;-ime vuccanti aavuso sa.mkhittena pa~ncupaadaanakkhanaa
    dukkhaa.&#146;</i> These are called masses as there is a lot of matter, a lot of feelings,
    a lot of perceptions, a lot of determinations and a lot of consciousness. If someone
    probes into them meditating with keen interest, he finds that to hold them with the mind
    is unpleasant. </p>
    <p>4. With the body experiencing pleasantness too. <i>&#146;sukha.m ca kaayena
    patisa.mvedeti&#146;</i> Here the third <i>jhaana</i> is described and it is said that
    pleasantness is experienced with the body too. As the body is also the six doors of mental
    contact, pleasantness is enjoyed by not being disturbed by any of the contacts that come
    from these six spheres of mental contact. Is a pleasant experience enjoyed by the worthy
    ones &#145;<i>arahantaa&#146;</i> </p>
