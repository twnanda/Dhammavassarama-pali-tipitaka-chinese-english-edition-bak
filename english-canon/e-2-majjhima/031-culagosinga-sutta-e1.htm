  <b>(31) The Minor Discourse in the Gosinga Forest..</b> </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus. </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One was living in a brick house in Naadikaa. At that time
  venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya and Kimbila were abiding in the Gosinga Sala forest gifted
  by the king. The Blessed One getting up from his seclusion in the evening approached the
  Sala forest. The forest keeper saw the Blessed One coming in the distance and said,
  recluse, do not enter this forest. There are three sons of clansmen abiding here seeking
  their own good, do not inconvenience them. Venerable Anuruddha heard this conversation
  between the forest keeper and the Blessed One and told the forest keeper. Do not obstruct
  the Blessed One, it is our Teacher, the Blessed One. Venerable Anuruddha addressed
  venerables Nandiya and Kimbila, come! Venerable ones, our Teacher has arrived. Then
  Venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila approached the Blessed One, accepted bowl and
  robes from the Blessed One. One prepared a seat and another administered water to wash the
  feet. The Blessed One sat on the prepared seat and washed his feet. Those venerable ones
  worshipped the Blessed One and sat on a side. </p>
  <p>The Blessed One addressed venerable Anuruddha: Anuruddha, are you alright, do you have
  any fatigue owing to want of morsel food? Venerable sir, we are alright, we have no
  fatigue owing to lack of morsel food. Anuruddha, are you united and friendly without a
  dispute, like milk and water and do you abide seeing each other with friendly eyes?
  Venerable sir, we are united like milk and water, friendly, without a dispute and abide
  seeing each other with friendly eyes. Anuruddha, how do you abide united like milk and
  water, friendly, without a dispute seeing each other with friendly eyes? Venerable sir,
  this thought occurs to me It is gain for me that I live with such co-associates in the
  holy life. So I abide with bodily actions of loving kindness towards these venerable ones
  openly and secretly. With verbal actions of loving kindness towards these venerable ones
  openly and secretly. With mental actions of loving kindness towards these venerable ones
  openly and secretly Sometimes it occurs to me what if I discard my thoughts and concede to
  the thoughts of these venerable ones. So I discard my thoughts and concede to the thoughts
  of these venerable ones. Venerable sir, we are various in bodies, and one in mind. </p>
  <p>Venerable Nandiya and venerable Kimbila too said to the Blessed One, venerable sir,
  this thought occurs to me. It is gain for me, that I live with such co-associates in the
  holy life. So I abide, with bodily actions of loving kindness towards these venerable ones
  openly and secretly. With verbal actions of loving kindness openly and secretly. With
  mental actions of loving kindness openly and secretly Sometimes it occurs to me, what if I
  discard my thoughts and concede to the thoughts of these venerable ones. So I discard my
  thoughts and concede to the thoughts of these venerable ones. Venerable sir, we are
  various in bodies and one single in mind. . . </p>
  <p>Venerable sir, in this manner we abide united like milk and water, friendly, without a
  dispute, seeing each other with friendly eyes. Good, Anuruddha, do you live diligently for
  dispelling? Venerable sir, indeed we abide diligently for dispelling. Anuruddha, how do
  you abide diligently for dispelling? Venerable sir, whoever comes from the village first,
  after collecting morsel food, prepares the seats administers water for drinking and
  washing and places the spittoons. Whoever comes last from the village, partakes of what is
  left over if he desires, if he does not, throws it to a place where nothing grows, or puts
  into some water where there is no life. He puts away the seats, and the vessels of water,
  washes the spittoons and sweeps the refectory, Whoever sees the water vessels for
  drinking, washing or toilets empty, fills them up. If he finds it not in his capacity to
  carry it, would call another with the wave of the hand. Would not utter a word on account
  of it. On every fifth day we would sit throughout the night discussing a topic on the
  Teaching. Venerable sir, thus we abide diligently for dispelling. Good, Anuruddha, you
  abide diligently for dispelling (*1). Have you attained any distinctive knowledge above
  human? Why not venerable sir, Whenever we desire, seclude the mind from sensual thoughts
  and defiling thoughts and with joy and pleasantness born from seclusion attained to abide
  in the first jhaana. Venerable sir, that is the distinctive knowledge we have attained
  above human. Good, Anuruddha, overcoming that and above that, is there any distinctive
  knowledge you have attained and abide above human?. Why not venerable sir. Whenever we
  desire, overcoming thoughts and thought processes, the mind internally settled in one
  point, with joy and pleasantness born of concentration attained to abide in the second
  jhaana. Venerable sir, overcoming that and above that, this is the distinctive knowledge
  we have attained and abide above human. Good, Anuruddha, having overcome that and above
  that is there any distinctive knowledge you have attained to, abide above human..Why not
  venerable sir? Whenever we desire, with equanimity to joy and detachment we abide mindful
  and aware experiencing pleasantness with the body, in the third jhaana... To this, the
  noble ones say abiding mindfully in pleasantaness with equanimity. Good Anuruddha, having
  overcome that and above that is there any distinctive knowledge you attain to abide above
  human? Why not venerable sir. Whenever we desire, dispelling pleasantness and
  unpleasantness, having overcome pleasure and displeasure earlier, with equanimity
  mindfulness purified, attained to, we abide in the fourth jhaana. Venerable sir,
  overccoming that and above that, this is the distinctive knowledge we have attained and
  abide above human. Good, Anuruddha, overcoming that and above it, is there any distinctive
  knowledge you attained to, abide above human?. Why not venerable sir. Whenever we desire
  overcoming all perceptions of matter and overcoming perceptions of anger, not attending to
  various perceptions, with space is boundless attained to, abide in the sphere of space.
  Venerable sir, overcoming that and above that, this is the distinctive knowledge we
  attained to, abide above human..Good, Anuruddha, having overcome that and above that is
  there any distinctive knowledge and vision you have attained to, abide above human?. Why
  not venerable sir? Whenever we desire overcoming all the sphere of space, with
  consciousness is boundless, and with there is nothing, attained to, abide in the sphere of
  no-thingness. Overcoming all the sphere of no-thingness attained to abide in the sphere of
  neither-peception-nor-non-perception, Venerable sir, overcoming that and above it, this is
  the distinctive knowledge and vision we attained to abide, above human. Good, Anuruddha,
  overcoming that, is there any distinctive knowledge and vision you have attained to, abide
  above human? Why not venerable sir. Whenever we desire attaining to the sphere of neither-
  perception &#150;nor &#150;non-perception we abide in the cessation of perceptions and
  feelings. Seeing this with wisdom desires get destroyed. Venerable, sir, overcoming that
  and above that, this is the distinctive knowledge and vision we attained to, abide, above
  human. Venerable sir, we have not seen a more noble and a more exalted abiding above
  this.&#151;Good, Anuruddha, there is no abiding more noble and more exalted than this. . .
  </p>
  <p>Then the Blessed One advised, instructed, incited, and made the hearts light of
  venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya and Kimbila and getting up from the seat went away. When the
  Blessed One was going the three venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya and Kimbila followed after
  the Blessed One and stopped short. Then venerables Nandiya and Kimbila asked venerable
  Anuruddha. What, did we tell you venerable Anuruddha, that we are gainers of those
  abidings and attainments .that the venerable one told the Blessed One as much as our
  destruction of desires? Not that the venerable ones told me about their abidings and
  attainments yet we penetrated the minds of the venerable ones and knew that the venerable
  ones are gainers of those attainments. The gods too told me about this, and when the
  Blessed One questioned me about it I replied. </p>
  <p>Then the demon Diigha approached the Blessed One worshipped, stood on a side and said
  thus to the Blessed One: Venerable sir, &#145;It is great gain for the Vajjis that the
  Blessed One abides perfect and rightfully enlightened and also these three sons of
  clansmen, venerable Anuruddha, venerable Kimbila and venerable Nandiya&#146; . Hearing the
  sound of the demon Diigha the terrestrial gods echoed it. Hearing the sound of the
  terrestial gods, the retinue of the four great kings echoed it . Hearing the sound of the
  four great kings, the group of thirty two gods echoed it. Hearing the sound of the group
  of thirty two gods, the Yaama gods echoed it. Hearing the sound of the Yaama gods, the
  gods of happiness echoed it, Hearing the sound of the gods of happiness, the gods attached
  to creations, echoed it. Hearing the sound of the gods attached to creations, the gods
  attached to the creations of others, echoed it. Hearing the sound of the gods attached to
  the creations of others, the brahma gods echoed it . In a moment it was known as far as
  the Brahmaa world </p>
  <p>Diigha, this is so, from whatever clan these three sons of clansmen went forth, if
  those clans recall these three with a pleasant mind, it will conduce to their happiness
  for a long time. If their family circle,----the people in the village from where they went
  forth--- from whatever hamlet,--- from whatever town,---- from whatever state---whoever
  warriors recall these three sons of clansmen--- whoever brahmins &#150;whoever
  househoders--- whoever outcastes recall these three clansmen with a pleasant mind it will
  conduce to their happiness for a long time. Diigha, anyone in this world of gods and men
  together with its Maaras, Brahmaas, were to recall these three sons of clansmen, it will
  conduce to their happiness for a long time. </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said thus and the demon Diigha delighted in the words of the Blessed
  One. </p>
  <p><strong>Notes. </strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Abide diligently for dispelling. &#145;<i>eva.m kho maya.m bhante appamattaa
    aataapino pahitatta.m viharaamaati</i>&#146; When asked how they abode diligently for
    dispelling, he gives a complete picture of how they behaved. It becomes such behaviour
    where there are no disputes what so ever. Yet all the necessary work is done with complete
    clarity and preciseness This kind of behaviour involves a lot of clear thinking and
    dispelling all kinds defilements in the mind such as sensual thoughts, angry thoughts and
    hurting thoughts..This behaviour is founded on a lot of loving kindness, compassion,
    intrinsic joy and also equanimity and it promotes harmony. These are indeed the basics
    necessary for concentration. <br>
