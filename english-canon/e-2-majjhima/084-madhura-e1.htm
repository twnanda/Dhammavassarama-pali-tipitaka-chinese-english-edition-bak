  <b>(84) The Discourse given at Madhura.</b> </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At one time venerable Mahaakaccaayana was living in Madhura in the Gunda forest. King
  Avantiputta of Madhura heard that venerable Mahaakaccaayana was living in Madhura in the
  Gunda forest, and fame of venerable Mahaakaccaayana had spread, he is wise, learned, a
  clever preacher, a perfected one since long, and it is good to see such perfect ones. Then
  king Avantiputta of Madhura getting ready good conveyances went to see venerable
  Mahaakaccaayana in all royal splendour. Going as far as the conveyances could carry them
  went on foot and approached venerable Mahaakaccaayana. Approaching and exchanging friendly
  greetings with venerable Mahaakaccaaya, sat on a side and said thus: Venerable sir,
  brahmins say, brahmins are from the chief clan, the most superior in appearance, all other
  clans are inferior, its the brahmins born from the mouth of Brahma, his hereditary sons,
  that purify, non-brahmins do not purify. What has good Kaccaayana to say about this?&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>Great king it&#146;s only an utterance in the world: Brahmins are from the chief clan,
  the most superior in appearance, all other clans are inferior, its only the brahmins born
  from the mouth of Brahma, his hereditary sons, that purify, non-brahmins do not
  purify..Great king, this, &#145;Brahmins are from the chief clan, the most superior in
  appearance, all other clans are inferior, its the brahmins born from the mouth of Brahma,
  his hereditary sons, that purify, non-brahmins do not purify&#146; you should know that it
  is only an utterance in this manner. Great king, to a warrior, there is prosperity,
  wealth, grains, silver, or soverign gold, then would a warrior, stand up, retire last, do
  his biddings and talk to him pleasantly, or would a brahmin, or would one of householder
  clan, or would, one of out caste clan, stand up, retire last, do his biddings and talk to
  him pleasantly? </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Kaccayana, if there is prosperity, wealth, grains, silver, or soverign gold
  to a warrior, then a warrior would stand up, retire last, do his biddings and talk to him
  pleasantly, or even a brahmin,or even one of householder clan, or evenone of out caste
  clan, would stand up, retire last, do his biddings and talk to him pleasantly.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Great king, if there is prosperity wealth, grains, silver, or soverign gold to a
  Brahmin then would a brahmin, stand up, retire last, do his biddings and talk to him
  pleasantly, or would a warrior, or would one of householder clan, or would one of out
  caste clan, stand up, retire last, do his biddings and talk to him pleasantly?&#146; </p>

  would stand up, retire last, do his biddings and talk to him pleasantly.&#146; </p>
  <p>.&#145;Great king, if there is prosperity, wealth, grains, silver, or soverign gold, to
  one of househoder clan, would someone from the householder clan, warrior clan, or brahmin
  clan, or out caste clan, stand up, retire last, do his biddings and talk to him
  pleasantly?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Kaccayana, if there is prosperity to one of househlolder clan in the form of
  wealth, grains, silver, soverign gold, thenawarrior wouldstand up, retire last, do his
  biddings and talk to him pleasantly, or even a brahmin,or even one of householder clan, or

  <p>&#145;Great king, if there is prosperityin the form of wealth, grains, silver, soverign
  gold to one of out caste clan, then would one of out castes&#146; clan, stand up, retire
  last, do his biddings and talk to him pleasantly, or would a warrior,or would one of
  brahmin clan, orwould one of householder clan, stand up, retire last, do his biddings and
  talk to him pleasantly?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Kaccayana, if there is prosperity in the form of wealth, grains, silver, or
  soverign gold to one of out caste clan, then one of out castes&#146; clan would stand up,
  retire last, do his biddings and talk to him pleasantly, or even a warrior,or even a
  brahmin, or evenone of householder clan, would stand up, retire last, do his biddings and
  talk to him pleasantly.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Great king, when this is so, are not these four clans the same, or how is it
  here?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Kaccayana, when this is so, these four clans become equal and I do not see
  any difference in them.&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Great king, this, &#145;Brahmins are from the chief clan, the most superior in
  appearance, all other clans are inferior, its the brahmins born from the mouth of Brahma,
  his hereditary sons, that purify, non-brahmins do not purify.&#146; You should know that
  it is only an utterance in this manner too. Great king, there are warriors, who destroy
  life,take the not given, misbehave in sexuality, tell lies, slander, speak rough words,
  speak frivolous words, covet, those bear angry minds and wrong view, would they after
  death be born in decrease in hell? Or is it they would not be born in hell?&#146;&nbsp; </p>

  sexuality, tell lies, slander, speak rough words and speak frivolous words, covet and bear
  an angry mind and maintain wrong view, after death they would be born in decrease will go
  to loss. It occures to me thus, and I have heard this from perfect ones.&#146; </p>

  Brahma, his hereditary sons, that purify, non-brahmins do not purify&#146; you should know

  abstain from, destroying life, taking the not given, misbehaving in sexuality, telling
  lies, slandering, speaking rough words, speaking frivolous words, coveting, bearing angry
  minds and with right view, would they after death be born in increase in heaven? Or is it
  they would not be born in heaven?&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Kaccayana, even the warriors, who abstain from, destroying life, taking the
  not given, misbehaving in sexuality, telling lies, slandering, speaking rough words,
  speaking frivolous words, coveting, bearing angry minds and who maintain rightview, after
  death would be born in increase in heaven ithappens thus, I have heard it from the perfect

  house, carries away loot, robs, waits in ambush, or goes to others&#146; wives, then
  people get hold of him and show him to the king. Me&#146; lord this is a highway robber,
  mete him the punishment you desire&#151;What would you do?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Kaccayana, I will get him destroyed or banished or mete to him, the
  suitablepunishment.What is the reason? Good Kaccayana, earlier, he was reckoned a warrior,
  and afterwards he came to be known as a robber.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Here, great king a certain brahmin, --one of householder clan, --of

  appearance, all other clans are inferior, it&#146;s the brahmins born from the mouth of
  Brahma, his hereditary sons, that purify, non-brahmins do not purify you should know that
  it is only an utterance in this manner too. Here, great king a certain warrior shaves head
  and beard, dons yellow clothes, goes forth as a homeless. Gone forth abstains from
  destroying life, abstains from taking the not given, abstains from telling lies, partakes
  one meal per a day and leads a pure holy life: What would you do to him?&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Kaccayana, I will get up from the seat at his approach, offer him a seat,
  invite him will provide with the four requisties of life, such as robes, morsel food,
  dwellings and requisties when ill, and I will see to his righteous protection. What is the
  reason? Good Kaccayana, earlier, he was reckoned a warrior, and later he is reckoned a
  recluse.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Here, great king a certain, brahmin,-- one of householder clan,--- one of
  outcastes&#146; clan, shaves head and beard, dons yellow clothes, goes forth homeless.
  Gone forth abstains from, destroying life, taking the not given, abstains telling lies,
  partakes one meal per a day and leads a pure holy life: What would you do to
  him?&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Good Kaccayana, I will, get up from the seat at his approach, offer him a seat, invite
  him, provide with the four requisties of life, such as robes, morsel food, dwellings and
  requisties when ill, and see to his righteous protection. What is the reason? Good
  Kaccayana, earlier, he was reckoned an outcaste, and later he is reckoned a recluse.&#146;
  </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Kaccayana, when this is so, these four clans are equal and I do not see any
  difference in them.&#146;&nbsp; </p>

  hereditary sons, onlypurify, non-brahmins do not purify, you should know that it is only
  an utterance in this manner too.&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>When this was said, king Avantiputta of Madhura said thus to venerable Mahaakaccayana.
  &#146;Now I understand good Kaccaayana, it&#146;s like something over turned, is
  reinstalled, as something covered is made manifest, as the path was shown to someone who
  had lost his way. It&#146;s as though an oil lamp was lighted for those who have sight to
  see forms in the dark. In various ways the Teaching, is explained by good Kaccayana. Now I
  take refuge in good Kaccayana, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. May I be
  remembered as a lay disciple who has taken refuge from today until the end of life.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Great king do not take my refuge, take refuge in that Blessed One as I have
  done.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Kaccayana, where does the Blessed One, perfect rightfully enlightened live
  now?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Great king, the Blessed One, perfect rightfully enlightened has passed
  away.&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Kaccayana, if I hear, that the Blessed One perfcct rightfully enlightened is
  seventy miles from here, I would go there, to see the Blessed One. If I hear that the
  Blessed One perfcct rightfully enlightened is one hundred and forty miles away from here
  two hundred and ten miles from here, three hundred and fifty miles from here, seven
  hundred miles from here, I would go there, to see the Blessed One. Good Kaccayana, since
  the Blessed One, perfect rightfully enlightened has passed away. I take refuge in that
  Blessed One, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. May good Kaccayana bear me as
  a lay disciple from today until I die.&#146;. </p>
