  <b><font size="+1">(7) The Simile of the Cloth.</font></b> </p>
  <p>I heard thus. <br>
  At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika in
  Jeta&#146;s grove in Saavatthi.. </p>
  <p>From there the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: O! Bhikkhus, just as an impure
  stained cloth when dyed into whatever colour, blue, yellow, red or crimson would take a
  bad hue and an impure colour because the cloth is impure and stained, in the same manner,
  bhikkhus, when the mind is defiled a bad state could be expected. Just as a pure unstained
  cloth when dyed into whatever colour, blue, yellow, red or crimson, it would take a pure
  colour and a bright hue, in the same manner, bhikkhus, when the mind is pure a good state
  could be expected. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, what are the minor defillements of the mind. Covetousness is a defilement of
  the mind. Aversion is a defilement of the mind. Anger is a defilement of the mind. Illwill
  is a defilement of the mind. Contempt is a defilement of the mind. Mercilessness is a

  talk is a defilement of the mind. Measuring is a defilelment of the mind. Conceit is a
  defilement of the mind. Intoxication is a defilement of the mind. Negligence is a
  defilement of the mind. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu knowing covetoussness as a defilement of the mind dispels
  it. Knowing aversion as a defilement of the mind dispels it. Knowing anger as a
  defilelment of the mind dispels it. Knowing illwill as a defilement of the mind dispels

  it. Knowing conceit as a defilement of the mind dispels it. Knowing intoxication as a
  defilement of the mind, dispels it. Knowing negligence as a defilement of the mind dispels

  rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, knower of worlds,
  the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened and
  blessed. Is endowed with unwavering faith in the Teaching: The Blessed One&#146;s Teaching
  is well proclaimed, here and now, not a matter of time, inviting for inspection, leading
  beyond, for the wise to be realized by themselves..Is endowed with unwavering faith in the
  Community: The disciples of the Blessed One have fallen to the right path, the
  straightforward path, the wise path, and to the path of mutual understanding. They are the
  four pairs of the eight Great Men. the disciples of the Blessed One, worthy of offerings,
  hospitality, gifts and reverential salutation, the highest field of merit for the world. .
  </p>
  <p>When his mind is cleaned, released and established as far as the limit allows he
  knowing I have unwavering faith in enlightenment, gains meanings in the Teaching and
  experiencs the Teaching, and joy arises, to the joyful there&#146;s delight.the delighted
  mind appeases the body. The appeased body feels pleasant. Of the pleasant, the mind
  concentrates. He knowing I have unwavering faith in the Teaching, gains meanings in the
  Teaching and experiences the Teaching, and joy arises, to the joyful there&#146;s delight,
  the delighted mind appeases the body. The appeased body feels pleasant. Of the pleasant
  the mind concentrates. He knowing I have unwavering faith in the Community, gains meanings
  in the Teaching and experiences the Teaching, and joy arises, to the joyful there&#146;s
  delight, the delighted mind appeases the body. The appeased body feels pleasant. Of the

  <p>As far as the limit goes my mind is cleaned, released, giving up is established, by
  that the Teaching has beccome meaningful and I experience the Teaching, and joy arise, to
  the joyful there&#146;s delight, the delighted mind appeases the body. The appeased body
  feels pleasant. Of the pleasant, the mind concentrates. </p>
  <p>O! Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu with such virtues, thoughts and wisdom were to partake of
  morsel food cooked out of fine rice with dark seeds picked, together with various soups
  and curries, there would not be any danger to him. Just as the impure stained cloth is
  cleaned with pure clean water, Just as pure gold comes out of the furnace. Even so
  bhikkhus, the bhikkhu with such virtues, thoughts and wisdom were to partake of morsel
  food cooked out of fine rice with dark seeds picked, together with various soups and
  curries, there would not be any danger to him. </p>
  <p>He abides pervading one direction with a mind of loving kindness, so too the second,
  third, fourth, above, below, across, always, for all purposes, he pervades the whole world
  with loving kindness, with a developed limitless mind without enmity and anger. He abides
  pervading one direction with a compassionate mind, so too the second, third, fourth,
  above, below, across, always, for all purposes, he pervades the whole world with
  compassion, with a developed, limitless mind without enmity and anger. He abides pervading
  one direction with intrinsic joy, so too the second, third, fourth, above, below, across,
  always, for all purposes, he pervades the whole world with intrinsic joy, with a developed
  limitless mind without enmity and anger.. He abides pervading one direction with
  equanimity, so too the second, third, fourth, above, below, across, always, for all
  purposes, he pervades the whole world with a developed and limitless mind without enmity
  and anger. </p>
  <p>He knows, in this are unexalted and exalted states, there is a noble escape from this
  pereceptive sphere. When he knows and sees that, his mind seeks release from sensual
  desires, from desires to be, and from desires through ignorance. Knowledge arises, am
  released, birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived to the end, what should be done is
  done, there is nothing more to wish. Bhikkhus, to this is called internal cleaning. </p>
  <p>At that time the brahmin Sundarikabhaaradvaaja was sitting near the Blessed One, and
  asked does good Gotama go to Baahuka river to bathe. Brahmin, what is river Baahuka, and
  what will it do. The brahmin said Good Gotama, many people consider river Baahuka is the
  release, River Baahuka is meritorious. </p>
  <p>Many people wash off their demeritorious actions in river Baahuka. Then the Blessed One
  addressed the brahmin Sundarikabhaaradvaaja in verses:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>River Baahuka with many precious stones, rivers Gayaa, Sundarikaa, <br>
    And even Sarassatii, Payaaga, and Baahumathie <br>
    Fools may be for ever submerged in these but their dark actions will not be washed <br>
    How could Sundarikaa, Payaaga, and Baahuka help angry beings gone wrong <br>
    Their evil actions will not be washed off, <br>
    The pure are always pure, to them every day is a sabbath day <br>
    The pure with pure actions are always bound in virtues <br>
    Brahmin, bathe here itself, develop loving kindness to all beings <br>
    If you do not tell lies, do not hurt living things <br>
    Not take that not given, with faith become not selfish <br>
    What could be done, gone to Gayaa, may drink water there. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When this was said the brahmin Sundarikabhaaradvaaja said thus to the Blessed One: Now
  I know good Gotama, It seems as though something over turned is re-installed, something
  covered is made manifest, It seems as though the path is told to someone who has lost his
  way. It seems as though a lamp is lighted for the darkness, for those who have eyes to see
  forms. In various ways the Teaching is explained by good Gotama.Now I take refuge in good
  Gotama, in the Teaching and the Community. May I gain the going forth and the higher
  ordination. The brahmin Sundarikabhaaradvaaja obtained the going forth and the higher
  ordination. Soon after the higher ordination, venerable Bhaaradvaaja withdrawn from the
  crowd, alone and secluded abode diligent for dispelling. Before long, for whatever purpose
  sons of clansmen go forth from the household, and lead the holy life, that highest end of
  the holy life by himself knowing realizeing abode,.here and now, He knew birth is
  destroyed, the holy life is lived, what should be done is done,there is nothing more to
  wish. Venerable Bhaaradvaaja became one of the noble ones. </p>
