  <b>150. The discourse delivered at Nagaravindika</b> </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One was touring the Kosala country with a large Community of
  bhikkhus and arrived at the brahmin village Nagaravindika of Kosala. The brahmin
  householders of Nagaravindika heard &#145;The good recluse Gotama, son of the Sakyas, who
  became homeless, while touring the Kosala country with a large Community of bhikkhus have
  arrived at the brahmin village Nagaravindika. This is the fame that has spread about him.
  That Blessed One is worthy, rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct,
  has gone well, knows the worlds, is the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, Teacher
  of gods and men, enlightened and blessed. We should see such worthy ones. Then the brahmin
  householders of Nagaravindika approached the Blessed One. Some of them exchanged friendly
  greetings with the Blessed One and sat on a side. Some joined their hands in reverence and
  sat on a side. Some made their names and clans heard in the presence of the Blessed One
  and sat on a side and the rest silently sat on a side. </p>
  <p>To the brahmin householders of Nagaravindika the Blessed One said. </p>
  <p>&#145;Householders, if the homeless ascetics of other beliefs ask you:
  &quot;Householders, what kind of recluses and brahmins should not be revered, esteemed and
  worshipped?&quot; You should reply them thus. Those recluses and brahmins, without
  dispelled greed, aversion and delusion, for forms cognizable by eye-consciousness,
  internally not appeased, abide with good and bad conduct by body, speech and mind. Such
  recluses and brahmins should not be revered, esteemed and worshipped. For we too are
  without dispelled greed, aversion and delusion, for forms cognizable by eye-consciousness,
  internally not appeased, abide with good and bad conduct by body, speech and mind. Not
  seeing any good conduct above that, we should not revere, esteem and worship those good
  recluses and brahmins. Those recluses and brahmins, without dispelled greed, aversion and
  delusion, for sounds cognizable by ear-consciousness,&#133;re&#133; for scents cognizable
  by nose consciousness,&#133;re&#133;for tastes cognizable by
  tongue-consciousness,&#133;re&#133;for touches cognizable by body consciousness and for
  thoughts cognizable by mind-consciousness internally not appeased, abide with good and bad
  conduct by body, speech and mind. Such recluses and brahmins should not be revered,
  esteemed and worshipped. For we too are without dispelled greed, aversion and delusion,
  for thoughts cognizable by mind-consciousness, internally not appeased, abide with good
  and bad conduct by body, speech and mind. Not seeing any good conduct above that, we
  should not revere, esteem and worship those good recluses and brahmins. Householders, you
  should reply those ascetics of other beliefs in this manner. </p>
  <p>Householders, if the homeless ascetics of other beliefs ask you: &quot;Householders,

  should reply them thus. Those recluses and brahmins, with dispelled greed, aversion and
  delusion, for forms cognizable by eye-consciousness, internally appeased, abide with the
  right conduct by body, speech and mind. Such recluses and brahmins should be revered,
  esteemed and worshipped. For we are without dispelled greed, aversion and delusion, for
  forms cognizable by eye-consciousness, internally not appeased, abide with good and bad
  conduct by body, speech and mind. Seeing good conduct in these recluses and brahmins above
  us, we should revere, esteem and worship those good recluses and brahmins. Those recluses
  and brahmins, with dispelled greed, aversion and delusion, for sounds cognizable by

  these recluses and brahmins above us, we should revere, esteem and worship those good
  recluses and brahmins. Householders, you should reply those ascetics of other beliefs in
  this manner. </p>
  <p>Householders, if the homeless ascetics of other beliefs ask you: Householders, what are
  the ways and behavior patterns, of those venerable ones, that you say: Indeed these
  venerable ones are free of greed, or fallen to train for it? Free of aversion or fallen to
  train for it and free of delusion, or fallen to train for it? You should reply them thus.
  Those venerable ones abide in forest dwellings and leaves huts, where such forms
  cognizable by eye consciousness could not be enjoyed. Such sounds cognizable
  ear-consciousness could not be enjoyed, such scents cognizable nose-consciousness could
  not be enjoyed, such tastes cognizable tongue-consciousness could not be enjoyed, such
  touches cognizable body-consciousness could not be enjoyed. Because of these ways and
  behavior patterns, we say that these venerable ones are free of greed, or fallen to train
  for it, free of aversion or fallen to train for it, free of delusion, or fallen to train
  for it.&#146; </p>
  <p>When this was said the brahmin householders of Nagaravindika said. &#145;Good Gotama,
  now we understand. It&#146;s like something overturned was reinstated&#133;.re&#133;. From
  today, until we live, remember us as your disciples.&#146; </p>
