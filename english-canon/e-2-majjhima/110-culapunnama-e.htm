  <b>(110) The shorter discourse on the full moon night</b> </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the Pubba monastery, the palace of Migaara&#146;s
  mother, in Saavatthi. On that full moon night of the fifteenth day the Blessed One sat in
  the open, attended by the Community of bhikkhus. Then the Blessed One observed the silent
  Community of bhikkhus and addressed them. &#145;Bhikkhus, does the unworthy one know the
  unworthy one, as this good one is unworthy?&#146; (*1) </p>
  <p>&#145;No, venerable sir, he does not know that.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good! Bhikkhus, it is not possible that the unworthy one should know the unworthy
  one, as this good one is unworthy. Bhikkhus, does the unworthy one know the worthy one, as
  this good one is worthy?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;No, venerable sir, he does not know that.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good! Bhikkhus, it is not possible that the unworthy one should know the worthy
  one, as this good one is worthy. Bhikkhus, the unworthy one is endowed with unworthy
  qualities, unworthy devotion, thoughts, musings, words, actions and views and gives gifts
  that are unworthy. Bhikkhus, how is the unworthy one endowed with unworthy qualities?
  Bhikkhus, the unworthy one has no faith, shame and remorse. Has learned little, is
  forgetful and without wisdom. Thus the unworthy one is endowed with unworthy
  qualities.Bhikkhus, how is the unworthy one with unworthy devotion? Bhikkhus, the unworthy
  one becomes friendly with those without faith, shame, remorse, with little learning,
  forgetful and without wisdom. Thus the unworthy one is with unworthy devotion. Bhikkhus,

  takes what is not given and misbehaves sexually. Thus the unworthy one is with unworthy
  actions. Bhikkhus, how is the unworthy one with unworthy views? Here the unworthy one is
  with the view, there are no results for gifts, sacrifices and offerings, there are no
  rssults for good and bad actions. There is no this world, no other world, no mother, no
  father.There are no beings that arise spontaneously, no recluses and brahmins in the
  world, who have come to the right path, realizing this world and the other world, by
  themselves, declare it. Thus the unworthy one is with unworthy view. Bhikkhus, how does
  the unworthy one make an unworthy offering? Bhikkhus, the unworthy one gives an offering
  disrespectfully, does not give with his own hands, does not give it honourably, gives it
  as though throwing it, gives it without faith in results. Thus bhikkhus, the unworthy one
