  (133)- Venerable Mahaakaccaana&#146;s explanation of the single auspicious attachment</strong></font></p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery that offered warm water in
  Raajagaha. Venerable Samiddhi got up in the last watch of the night and went to wash his
  body in warm water having washed his body, came out and stood in one robe to dry his body.
  Then a certain deity illuminated the whole of the warm forest, approached venerable
  Samiddhi, stood on a side and said &#146;Bhikkhu, do you remember the short and detailed
  exposition of the single auspicious attachment? </p>
  <p>&#145;Friend, I do not remember the short and detailed exposition of the single
  auspicious attachment. Do you remember it? </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhu, I too do not remember the short and detailed exposition of the single
  auspicious attachment. Bhikkhu, learn the short and detailed expsition of the single
  auspicious attachment, it tells the fundamentalsof the holy life. </p>
  <p>The deity saying this vanished from there. Venerable Samiddhi at the end of that night
  approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said. </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, I got up in the last watch of the night and went to wash my body
  in warm water having washed I came out and stood in one robe to dry my body. Then a
  certain deity illuminated the whole of the warm forest, approached me and stood on a side
  and said, bhikkhu, do you remember the short and detailed exposition of the single
  auspicious attachment? I said, Friend, I do not remember the short and detailed exposition
  of the single auspicious attachment. Do you remember it? </p>
  <p>Then the deity said, &#145;Bhikkhu, I too do not remember the short and detailed
  exposition of the single auspicious attachmentand the deity also said Bhikkhu, learn the
  short and detailed expsition of the single auspicious attachment, it tells the
  fundamentalsof the holy life.saying this, the deity vanished from there. Venerable sir,
  what is the short and detailed exposition of the single auspicious attachment? </p>
  <p>Bhikkhu, then I will teach the exposition of the single auspicious attachment, listen
  attending carefully. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Do not recollect the past, nor desire the future, <br>
    The past is over, the future has not come. <br>
    These things of the present, see them with insight as they arise <br>
    Not faltering and not moved, think about them. <br>
    Today itself the dispelling should be done <br>
    Tomorrow death might come <br>
    We will not have any associations with Death and his great army <br>
    You should abide dispelling thus, day and night zealously, <br>
    This is the single auspicious attachment, the appeased sage tells&nbsp; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Blessed One said this and getting up from his seat went into his dwelling&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Soon after the Blessed One was gone, it occurred to those bhikkhus.&#146;Friends, the
  Blessed One gave us this short exposition and without giving the detailed exposition, went
  into his dwelling. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Do not recollect the past, nor desire the future, <br>
    The past is over, the future has not come. <br>

  </blockquote>
  <p>Now who could give us the detailed exposition of this short exposition? </p>
  <p>It occurred to those bhikkhus, venerable Mahaakaccaana is praised by the Teacher as
  well as the wise co-associates of the holy life. It is possible for venerable
  Mahaakaccaana to give the detailed exposition for this short exposition given by the
  Blessed One. What if we approached venerable Mahaakaccaana and asked this. Then those
  bhikkhus approached venerable Mahaakaccaana, exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side
  and said. &#145;Friend, Kaccaana, the Blessed One gave this short exposition and without
  giving the detailed exposition got up from the seat and went to his dwelling. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Do not recollect the past, nor desire the future, <br>

  Mahaakaccaana and said &#145;Friend Kaccaana, explain this to us.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Friends, it is like a man in need of heartwood, going in search of it, come to a
  standing huge tree full of heartwood, ignoring the heartwood, roots and trunk was to think
  that the branches and leaves was the heartwood. In the same manner, the venerable ones
  come face to face with the Teacher have ignored him and should ask it from me. That
  Blessed One knows, sees, has become wise, has become the Teaching and has become Brahmaa.
  He preaches and practises, is the bringer of meanings, the giver of deathlessness, the
  lord of the Teachingand thus gone. Now is the right time to ask this from him and as he
  explains it, we will bear it in our minds&#146;. </p>
