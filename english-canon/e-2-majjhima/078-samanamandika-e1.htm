  <b>(78) Advice to the Wandering Ascetic UggaahamaanaSamanamandikaaputta</b> </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anathapindika in
  Jet&#146;s grove in Savatthi. At that time the wandering ascetic
  UggaahamaanaSamanamandikaaputta with the opportunitst view was living in the single halled
  Mallika monastery on the bank of Tindukaa, with a large gathering of wandering ascetics
  about three hundred. It happened that the carpenter Pancakanga arrived in Savatthi during
  the day to see the Blessed One and it occurred to him. It is too early to see the Blessed
  One, he is abiding in his seclusion. He also thought of approaching the bhikkhus who give
  advice for the development of the mind, and thought. They should be in seclusion and then
  thought of approaching the wandering ascetic Uggaahamaana Samanamandikaaputta in the
  single halled Mallika monastery and approached him At the time the wandering ascetic
  Uggaahamaana Samanamandikaaputta was seated with a large gathering of wandering
  ascetics&nbsp; making much noise. They were engaged in various kinds of childish talk,
  about kings, robbers, chief ministers, the army, fears, fights, eatables, drinks, dress,
  beds, flowers scents, relations, conveyances, villages, hamlets, towns and states, women
  heros, gossip at the corner of the street and at the well. Gossip about those dead and
  gone, various other talk about the origin of the world and the ocean and the things
  thathappenedand did not happen. The wandering ascetic Uggaahamaana Samanamandikaaputta saw
  the carpenter Pancakanga coming in the distance and silenced the gathering. &#145;Good
  sirs, make less noise, do not make such a noise. A lay disciple of the recluse Gotama the
  carpenter Pancanga is coming. He is one of the lay disciples of the recluse Gotama, of
  those who live in Savatthi and wear white clothes These venerable ones make little noise,
  are trained to make little noise and they train others to make little noise. Thinking this
  gathering makes little noise may have thought to approach.&#146; Then those wandering
  ascetics became silent. The carpenter Pancakanga approached the wandering ascetic
  Uggahamana Samanamandikaputta, exchanged friendly greetings with the wandering ascetic
  Uggaahamaana Samanamandikaaputta and sat on a side. When he was seated the wandering
  ascetic Uggaahamaana Samanamandikaaputta said thus to him. &#146;Carpenter, I declare the
  person endowed with four things as the most skilled, perfect recluse, endowed with highest
  merit. What are four? Here carpenter, he does no evil by body, no evil by words, does not
  think evil thoughts and does not lead an evil livelihood. A man endowed with these four
  things, I declare as the most skilled, perfect recluse endowed with the highest
  merit.&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The carpenter Pancakanga was not pleased nor did condemn those words of the wandering
  ascetic Uggahamana Samanamandikaputta. He got up thinking I will know the meaning of these
  words from the Blessed One approached the Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side. Then
  he related the conversation, that occurred between himself and the wandering ascetic
  Uggaahamaana Samanamandikaaputta. The Blessed One said to the carpenter Pancakanga.
  &#145;Carpenter, if this is so, a toddler who could not stand or sit quickly would be the
  most skilled, perfect recluse endowed with the highest merit. Carpenter, a toddler who
  could not stand and sit quickly, would not have an idea of a body, so how could he do evil
  with the body, other than move his limbs. Carpenter, a toddler who could not stand and sit
  quickly, would not have even words, so how could there be evil done with words, other than
  crying. Carpenter, a toddler who could not stand and sit quickly, would not have even
  thoughts, so how could he think evil thoughts, other than expressing displeasure.
  Carpenter, a toddler who could not stand and sit quickly, would not have even a
  livelihood, so how could there be evil livelihood to him, other than drinking the
  mother&#146;s milk. Carpenter, according to the words of the wandering ascetic
  Uggaahamaana Samanamandikaputta, a toddler who could not stand and sit quickly would be
  the most skilled, perfect recluse endowed with the highest merit.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Carpenter, I do not declare the most skilled perfect recluse endowed with the highest
  merit with these four things, as the wandering ascetic Uggaahamaana Samanamandikaputta
  says. I say these are the perfect qualities of a toddler who could not stand and sit
  quickly. What are the four? Carpenter, he does no evil action by body, utters no evil
  words, does not think evil thoughts, and has no evil livelihood. I do not declare the most
  skilled perfect recluse endowed with the highest merit with these four qualities. They are
  the perfect qualities of a toddler who could not stand and sit quickly. </p>
  <p>Carpenter, with these ten things I declare the most skilled perfect recluse endowed
  with the highest merit. I say, he should know, these observances lead to demerit. These
  observances of demerit start here. The observances of demerit cease here without a
  remainder. Carpenter, I say, this is the method of ceasing observances of demerit. He
  should know these observances of merit start here and cease here without a remainder. I
  say, this is the method of ceasing observances of merit. Carpenter, I say, he should know,
  that these are evil thoughts that start here. He should know, these evil thoughts cease
  here without a remainder. Carpenter, I say, this is the method of ceasing evil thoughts.
  He should know these are thoughts of merit, and they start here. These thoughts of merit
  cease here without a remainder. Carpenter, I say, this is the method for the cessation of
  thoughts of merit, he should know this too.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Carpenter, what are observances of demerit? Bodily actions of demerit, verbal actions
  of demerit and a livelihood of demerit are the observances of demerit. Carpenter, where do
  these observances of demerit rise? They arise in the mind, is the reply What is that mind?
  Minds are various and different. The mind is with greed, anger and delusion. Thus
  observances of demerit start there. Carpenter, where do these observances of demerit cease
  completely? Their cessation is thus. The bhikkhu gives up bodily actions of demerit and
  develops bodily actions of merit. Gives up verbal actions of demerit and develops verbal
  actions of merit. Gives up mental actions of demerit and develops mental actions of merit.
  Giving up wrong livelihood develops the right livelihood. Here, these observances of
  demerit cease completely. Carpenter, fallen to what method, is the ceasing of observances
  of demerit? Carpenter, the bhikkhu arouses interest and effort to push the mind forward
  with endeavour, for the not arising of not arisen demerit. The bhikkhu arouses interest
  and effort, to push the mind forward with endeavour, to dispel arisen demerit. The bhikkhu
  arouses interest and effort to push the mind forward with endeavour for arousing not
  arisen merit. The bhikkhu arouses interest and effort, to push the mind forward with
  endeavour for the undeluded stabilisation, growth, development and completion of arisen
  merit. Carpenter, this is the method, of ceasing observances of demerit.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>. Carpenter, what are observances, for merit?Bodily actions of merit, verbal actions of
  merit and a pure livelihood are observances for merit. Where do these observances of merit
  rise? They arise in the mind, is the reply What is that mind? Minds are various and
  different. The mind without greed, the mind without anger and the mind without delusion,
  are the varied and different minds. Thus observances of merit start here. Carpenter, where
  do these observances of merit cease completely? Their cessation too is told. Carpenter,
  the bhikkhu becomes virtuous, not only that, but knows as it really is, how there is to
  him the release of the mind and the release through wisdom through the cessation of the
  observances of merit (* 1) Here, these observances of merit completely cease. Carpenter,
  fallen to what method, is the ceasing of observances of merit? Carpenter, the bhikkhu
  arouses interest and effort to push the mind forward with endeavour for not arousing of
  not arisen demerit. The bhikkhu arouses interest and effort to push the mind forward with
  endeavour to dispel arisen demerit. The bhikkhu arouses interest and effort to push the
  mind forward with endeavour to arouse, not arisen merit. The bhikkhu arouses interest and
  effort, to push the mind forward with endeavour for undeluded stabilisation, growth,
  development and completion of arisen merit. Carpenter, the bhikkhu falls to this method,
  for ceasing observances of merit. .&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Carpenter, what are thoughts of demerit? Sensual thoughts, angry thoughts and hurting
  thoughts, are thoughts of demerit. Where do these thoughts of demerit arise? They arise
  from perceptions, is the reply. What are perceptions? Perceptions are also various and
  different. They are sensual perceptions, angry perceptions, and hurting perceptions.
  Thoughts of demerit arise from these perceptions. Carpenter, where do these thoughts of
  demerit cease completely? Their cessation too is told. Here, the bhikkhu secluded from
  sensual thoughts ---abides in the first jhana. Here, all thoughts of demerit cease
  completely. Carpenter, fallen to what method is the ceasing of thoughts of demerit? Here,
  carpenter, the bhikkhu arouses interest and effort to push the mind forward with endeavour
  for the non arising of not arisen thoughts of demerit. The bhikkhu arouses interest and
  effort to push the mind forward with endeavour to dispel arisen thoughts of demerit. The
  bhikkhu arouses interest and effort to push the mind forward with endeavour for the
  arousing of not arisen thoughts of merit. The bhikkhu arouses interest and effort to push
  the mind forward with endeavour for the undeluded stabilisation, growth, development and
  completion of arisen thoughts of merit. Carpenter, the bhikkhu falls to this method, for
  the cessation of thoughts of demerit..&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Carpenter, what are thoughts of merit? Non-sensual thoughts, non-angry thoughts and not
  hurting thoughts are thoughts of merit. Carpenter, where do these thoughts of merit
  arise?.There arising is also told, they arise in perceptions, is the reply. What are
  perceptions? Perceptions are also various and different, non-sensual perceptions,
  non-angry perceptions and non-hurting perceptions. From these arise thoughts of merit.
  Carpenter, where do these thoughts of merit cease without a remainder. Carpenter, their
  cessation is also told. Here, carpenter, the bhikkhu, overcoming thoughts and thought
  processes &#150;re&#151;attained to abide in the second jhana. Here all thoughts of merit
  cease without a remainder. Carpenter, fallen to what method, is the cessation of thoughts
  of merit? Here, carpenter, the bhikkhu arouses interest and effort to push the mind
  forward with endeavour for the not arising of not arisen thoughts of demerit. The bhikkhu
  arouses interest and effort, to push the mind forward with endeavour to dispel arisen
  thoughts of demerit. The bhikkhu arouses interest and effort to push the mind forward with
  endeavour to arouse not arisen thoughts of merit. The bhikkhu arouses interest and effort,
  to push the mind forward with endeavour for the undeluded stabilisation, growth,
  development and completion of arisen thoughts of merit. Carpenter, the bhikkhu falls to
  this method for the cessation of thoughts of merit. Carpenter, endowed with what ten
  things do I declare the most skilled perfect recluse with the highest merit.? Here,
  carpenter, the bhikkhu is endowed with, right understanding of one gone beyond the
  training. He is endowed with right thoughts right speech, right actions, right livelihood,
  right endeavour, right mindfulness and right concentration of one gone beyond the
  training. He is endowed with right knowledge and right release of one gone beyond the
  training. Endowed with these ten things, I declare the most skilled perfect recluse with
  the highest merit.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said thus and the carpenter Pancakanga delighted in the words of the
  Blessed One.. ....&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 .&nbsp;The bhikkhu becomes virtuous, not only that, but knows as it really is, how
    there is to him the release of the mind and the release through wisdom, through the
    cessation of observances of merit.&#146;<i>bhikkhu siilavaa hoti naca siilamyo
    ta.mcacetovimutti.m pa~n~naavimutti.m yatthaabhuuta.m pajaanaati yatthaassa ce
    kusalaasiilaa aparisesaa nirujjhanti&#146;&nbsp;</i>The sutta explains with precision how
    the mind has to be developed to attain the release of mind. It is to the four endeavours
    that the prominence is given. </p>
