  <b>(97) To the Brahmin Dhaananjaani</b></font>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>I heard thus. </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One was living in the squirrels&#146; sanctuary in the bamboo
  grove in Raajagaha. At that time venerable Saariputta was touring the southern hilly
  regions with a large community of bhikkhus. A certain bhikkhu who had spent the rains in
  Rajagaha approached venerable Saariputta and exchanged friendly greetings and sat on
  side.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Venerable Saariputta asked him.&#146;Venerable one, is the Blessed One without ailments
  and has he a light living?&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Yes, venerable one, the Blessed One is without ailments and has a light
  living.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;How is the Community of bhikkhus, are they without ailments, and with a light
  living?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Yes, venerable one, the Community of bhikkhus, too are without ailments and they
  too have a light living.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable one, there is the Brahmin Dhaananjaani, who has power over fields and
  grains. Is he without ailments and in good health?&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;The Brahmin Dhaananjaani is powerful and in good health.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;How is he living diligently?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable one where&#146;s diligence to the Brahmin Dhaananjaani? On account of
  the kings he plunders the Brahmin householders. On account of the Brahmin householders he
  plunders the kings. His wife who had faith, brought from a family, which had faith in the
  Blessed One, has died. Now he has brought a wife from a family, which has no faith and she
  has not faith.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;We heard something that should not be heard, about the negligence of the Brahmin
  Dhaananjaani. Indeed we should meet the brahamin Dhaananjaani and have a conversation
  about this.&#146; </p>
  <p>Venerable Saariputta abiding as long as he wished in the southern hilly regions, left
  on a tour to reach Rajagaha in stages. Venerable Saariputta was then abiding in the
  squirrels&#146; sanctuary in the bamboo grove in Rajagaha. Venerable Saariputta put on
  robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes entered Rajagaha for alms. At that time the
  Brahmin Dhaananjaani was milking the cows out side the city close to it. Venerable
  Saariputta having gone the alms round, and after the meal was over approached the Brahmin
  Dhaananjaani. The Brahmin, seeing venerable Saariputta approaching in the distance
  said.&#146;Good sir, Saariputta, there is milk, the time to partake has not elapsed
  yet.&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Useless, Brahmin, I have finished with today&#146;s meal, I will be spending the
  day under that tree come there.&#146; </p>
  <p>The Brahmin Dhaananjaani agreeing, after partaking his meal approached venerable
  Saariputta, exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side. Then venerable Saariputta
  asked. &#145;Brahmin, do you live diligently?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good, sir, Sariputta, where is diligence to me. I have to support my mother and
  father, sons and wife, my servants and workmen. I have to do what should be done for my
  friends and co-associates. I have to do what should be done for my blood relations and
  guests. I have to think of those who are dead and gone. Have to attend to the needs of
  recluses and Brahmins. Have to see to the needs of the king, and also please myself.&#146;
  </p>
  <p>&#145;Dhaananjaani, a certain person for the purpose of supporting mother and father
  was unvirtuous and misbehaved himself. He was pulled along to hell by the warders on
  account of misbehaving and lack of virtues. If he told the warders, I was unvirtuous and
  misbehaved to support my mother and father, would he be spared by the warders of hell? Or
  if the mother and father said, this one was unvirtuous and misbehaved for the purpose of
  supporting us, would he be spared? &#145;Good sir, Saariputta, they would not spare, they
  would pull him.along even when wailing.&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>If he told the warders, I was unvirtuous and misbehaved to support my sons and wife,
  would he be spared by the warders of hell? Or if the wife and children said, this one was
  unvirtuous and misbehaved for the purpose of supporting us, would he be spared?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good sir, Saariputta, they would not spare, they would pull him along even when
  wailing.&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>If he told the warders, I was unvirtuous and misbehaved to support my servants and
  workmen, would he be spared by the warders of hell? Or if the servants and workmen said,

  spared? &#145;Good sir, Saariputta, they would not spare, they would pull him along even
  when wailing.&#146; </p>
  <p>If he told the warders, I was unvirtuous and misbehaved to support my friends and blood
  relations, would he be spared by the warders of hell? Or if the friends and blood
  relations said, this one was unvirtuous and misbehaved for the purpose of supporting us,
  would he be spared?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good sir, Saariputta, they would not spare, they would pull along even when
  wailing.&#146; </p>
  <p>If he told the warders, I was unvirtuous and misbehaved to support my guests would he
  be spared by the warders of hell? Or if the guests said, this one was unvirtuous and

  gone, would he be spared by the warders of hell? Or if they said, this one was unvirtuous

  wailing.&#146; </p>
  <p>If he told the warders, I was unvirtuous and misbehaved to attend on the recluses and
  brahmins, would he be spared by the warders of hell? Or if the recluses and brahmins said,
  this one was unvirtuous and misbehaved for the purpose of supporting us, would he be
  spared? </p>
  <p>&#145;Good sir, Saariputta, they would not spare, they would pull him along even when
  wailing.&#146; </p>
  <p>If he told the warders, I was unvirtuous and misbehaved, doing the duties of the king,
  would the warders of hell spare him? Or if the king said, this one was unvirtuous and
  misbehaved doing my duties, would he be spared?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good sir, Saariputta, they would not spare, they would pull him along even when
  wailing.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Dhaananjaani, a certain person for the purpose of growing the self and pleasing
  it was unvirtuous and misbehaved himself. He was pulled along to hell by the warders on
  account of misbehaving and lack of virtues. If he told the warders, I was unvirtuous and
  misbehaved to grow myself and please it, would the warders of hell spare him? Or if the
  others said, this one was unvirtuous and misbehaved trying to grow the self and please it,
  would he be spared? &#145;Good sir, Saariputta, they would not spare, they would pull him
  along even when wailing.&#146; </p>

  on the prepared seat. Venerable Saariputta asked the Brahmin. &#145;How are you feeling,
  would you survive? Are the unpleasant feelings decreasing or increasing? Are they
  increasing showing the end?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good sir, Saariputta, I&#146;m feeling bad, will not survive. The unpleasant
  feelings increase, they increase up to the end. It is like a strong man was carving my top
  with the sharp edge of a sword. In this manner my top is disturbed with much air. Good sir

  <p>I&#146;m feeling bad, will not survive. The unpleasant feelings increase, they increase
  up to the end. It is like a strong man was giving a head wrap with a band. Like this there
  is a lot of pain, in my head. . </p>

  my belly with a sharp butcher&#146;s knife Like this a lot of air is disturbing my belly.
  Good sir Saariputta, I&#146;m feeling bad, will not survive. The unpleasant feelings
  increase, they increase up to the end. It is like two strong men were pulling along a
  weaker one with his hands and feet to a pit of burning embers and scorching him. Like this
  there is a lot of burning in my body. Good sir Saariputta, I&#146;m feeling bad, will not
  survive. The unpleasant feelings increase, they increase up to the end.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Dhaananjaani, what is better, birth in hell or in the animal world? </p>
  <p>&#145;Good sir, Saariputta, the animal world is better than birth in hell.&#146; </p>

  ghosts?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good sir, Saariputta, the sphere of ghosts is better than the animal world.&#146;
  </p>
  <p>&#145;Dhaananjaani, what is better, birth in the sphere of ghosts, or birth as a
  human?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good sir, Saariputta, birth as a human is better than the sphere of ghosts.&#146;
  </p>
  <p>&#145;Dhaananjaani, what is better, birth as a human or birth with the retinue of the
  guardian gods?&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good sir, Saariputta, birth with the retinue of the guardian gods is better than
  human birth.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Dhaananjaani, what is better, birth with the retinue of the guardian gods or in
  the retinue of the thirty three gods?&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good sir, Saariputta, birth with the retinue of the thirty three gods is better
  then birth with the guardian gods.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Dhaananjaani, what is better, birth with the Titan gods, or in the retinue of the
  thirty three gods?&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good sir, Saariputta, birth with the Titan gods is better, than birth with the
  retinue of the thirty three gods.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Dhaananjaani, what is better, birth with the Titan gods, or with the happy
  gods?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good sir, Saariputta, birth with the happy gods is better than birth with Titan
  gods.&#146; . </p>
  <p>&#145;Dhaananjaani, what is better, birth with the gods of creation or with the gods
  of, lords of creations?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good sir, Saariputta, of the gods of creation, the lords of creations are
  superior.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Dhaananjaani, what is better, birth with the gods of the lords of creations, or
  the world of Brahmaa?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Did good sir, Saariputta, say, it is the world of Brahmaa, is it the world of
  Brahmaa?&#146; </p>
  <p>Then it occurred to venerable Saariputta, these Brahmins intend to be born in the world
  of Brahmaa. I will show him the path, to be born with Brahmaa, and said.
  &#145;DhaananjaaniI will teach you the path to the world of Brahmaa, listen
  carefully.&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The Brahmin Dhaananjaani agreed. </p>
  <p>Venerable Saariputta said. &#146;Brahmin, this is the method to be born with Brahmaa.
  Dhaananjaani. The bhikkhu pervades one direction with thoughts of loving kindness, so too
  the second, the third, the fourth, above, below, across, in every respect, in all
  circumstances, the entire world, is pervaded with the thought of loving kindness grown
  great and immeasurable without anger and ill will. Dhaananjaani this is the method to be
  born with Brahmaa. Again Dhaananjaani, the bhikkhu pervades one direction with the thought
  of compassion,&#133;re&#133;. with intrinsic joy,&#133;re&#133; with equanimity, so too
  the second, the third, the fourth, above, below, across, in every respect, in all
  circumstances, the entire world, is pervaded with equanimity grown great and immeasurable
  without anger and ill will. Dhaananjaani this is the method to be born with Brahmaa.&#146;
  </p>
  <p>&#145;Then good sir Saariputta, worship the feet of the Blessed One for my sake and
  also tell the Blessed One. &#145;Venerable sir, the Brahmin Dhaananjaani is seriously ill.
  He worships the feet of the Blessed One.&#146; </p>
  <p>Venerable Saariputta, established his consciousness in the lower brahmaa world, when it
  should had been raised to a higher degree, got up from his seat and went away. Soon after
  venerable Saariputta had gone away, the Brahmin Dhaananjaani died and was born in the
  world of Brahmaa.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus. &#145;Bhikkhus, Saariputta, has established the
  consciousness of the Brahmin Dhaananjaani for birth in the world of Brahmaa, when he
  should have raised it to a higher degree, got up from his seat and came away.&#146; </p>
  <p>Venerable Saariputta, approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and
  said.&#146;Venerable sir, the Brahmin Dhaananjaani is seriously ill and he said. &#146;I
  worship the feet of the Blessed One with my head at the feet of the Blessed One.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Saariputta, when the mind of the Brahmin Dhaananjaani, could have been raised to
  a higher degree, why did you establish it in the lower Brahmaa world?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, it occurred to me thus these Brahmins intend to be born in the
  world of Brahmaa. I will show him the path, to be born with Brahmaa.&#146; </p>
  <p>Saariputta, the Brahmin Dhaananjaani died and is born in the world of Brahmaa. </p>
