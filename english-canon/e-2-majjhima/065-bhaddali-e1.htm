  <b>(65)Advice to Venerable Bhaddaali</b> </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus. </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anathapindika in
  Jeta&#146;s grove in Savatthi. The Blessed One addressed from there.Bhikkhus, I partake a
  single meal for the day, and on accont of it experience few afflictions, few ailments,
  lightness, power, and a pleasant abiding.Come! bhikkhus, you too partake a single meal for
  the day, and on accont of it experience few afflictions, few ailments, lightness, power,
  and a pleasant abiding. When this was said venerable Bhaddali said thus to the Blessed
  One-Venerable sir, I would not venture to eat one meal for the day. Eating one meal a day,
  doubts and remorse arise to me (* 1). Then Bhaddali, when you are invited do you partake
  there, and carry away food to another region and partake it? Bhaddali are you supported
  that way too? Even then venerable sir, I would not venture to eat one meal for the day.
  Eating one meal a day, doubts and remorse arise to me. When the Blessed One, was laying
  down the rules and the Community of bhikkhus accepting to abide by the rules, venerable
  Bhaddali was not venturing to accept them. So Venerable Bhaddali did not come to the
  presence of the Blessed One during those three months as one incomplete in the training,
  in the dispensation.of the Teacher.. </p>
  <p>At that time many bhikkhus were sewing the Blessed One&#146;s robe; When the robe was
  sewn and completed the Blessed One was to leave on a tour. Venerable Bhaddali approached
  those bhikkhus, exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side. Then those bhikkhus said.
  &#145;Bhaddali, here, we are sewing the Blessed One&#146;s robe, when it is completed and
  at the end of the three months the blessed One is leaving on a tour. Come, Bhaddali, be
  careful. Don&#146;t fall into unpleasantness for a long time.&#146; Venerable Bhaddali
  accepting the advice given by those bhikkhus, approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat
  on a side and said, to the Blessed One: &#145;Venerable sir, I have transgressed, owing to
  foolishness, delusion and demerit. When the rules were laid down for the Community of
  bhikkhus, and when the bhikkhus were accepting the rules, I declared not venturing to
  accept.Pardon my fault, venerable sir, and that would be for future restraint&#146;.
  &#145;Bhaddali, you have transgressed, owing to foolishness, delusion, and demerit. When I
  was laying down the rules, and when the Community of bhikkhus were accepting the rules,
  you declared not venturing to accept them. </p>
  <p>Bhaddali, didn&#146;t it occur to you, the Blessed One lives in Savatthi, and will know
  me as a bhikkhu incomplete in the training? Bhaddali, didn&#146;t it occur to you, many
  bhikkhus have come for the rains to Savatthi, they will know me as a bhikkhu incomplete in
  the training? Bhaddali, didn&#146;t it occur to you, many bhikkhunis have come for the
  rains to Savatthi, they will know me as a bhikkhu incomplete in the training? Bhaddali,
  didn&#146;t it occur to you, many male lay disciples have come to Savatthi, they will know
  me as a bhikkhu incomplete in the training? Bhaddali, didn&#146;t it occur to you, many
  female lay disciples have come to Savatthi, they will know me as a bhikkhu incomplete in
  the training? Bhaddali, this too didn&#146;t occur to you, many recluses and brahmins of
  other sects have come to Savatthi for the rains, they will know me as a bhikkhu incomplete
  in the training? A disciple of the recluse Gotama, a certain elder in the dispensation is
  incomplete in the training.&#146; &#145;Venerable sir, I have transgressed, owing to
  foolishness, delusion and demerit. When the rules were laid down for the Community of
  bhikkhus, and when the bhikkhus were accepting the rules, I declared not venturing to
  accept them. Pardon my fault, venerable sir, and that would be for future restraint.
  Bhaddali, you have transgressed, owing to foolishness, delusion, and demerit, when I was
  laying down the rules, and when the Community of bhikkhus were accepting the rules, you
  declared not venturing to accept them. </p>
  <p>Bhaddali, I tell a bhikkhu released both ways, (* 1) Come bhikkhu, lie in this mud for
  me. Would he lie in the mud, or would he put something else on the mud, or would he say
  no?&#146; &#145;That, would not happen, venerable sir.&#146; &#145;Bhaddali, I tell a
  bhikkhu released through wisdom. (* 2) Come bhikkhu lie in this mud for me. Would he lie
  in the mud, or would he put something else on the mud, or would he say no?&#146;
  &#145;That would not be venerable sir.&#146; &#145;Bhaddali, I tell a body witness of the
  path, (* 3) or one come to righteousness of view, (* 4) or one released through faith (*
  5), or one faring according to the Teaching, (* 6) or one faring according to faith (* 7).
  Come bhikkhu lie in the mud for me. Would he lie in the mud, or would he put something
  else on the mud, or would he say no?&#146; &#145;That would not be venerable sir.&#146;
  &#145;Bhaddali, weren&#146;t you at that time empty, useless and gone wrong?&#146;
  &#145;Yes, venerable sir.I have transgressed owing to foolishness, delusion and demerit.
  When the rules were laid down for the Community of bhikkhus, and when the bhikkhus were
  accepting the rules, I declared not venturing to accept them.Pardon my fault, venerable
  sir. That would be for future restraint.&#146; &#145;Bhaddali, you have transgressed,
  owing to foolishness, delusion, and demerit. When I was laying down the rules, and when
  the Community of bhikkhus were accepting the rules, you declared not venturing to accept
  them. Bhaddali, since you accept the fault, and ask to be pardond for future restraint, I
  pardon you. It is growth in the noble one&#146;s dispensation to ask to be pardoned,
  seeing the fault and for future restraint. </p>
  <p>Bhaddali, there is a bhikkhu in the dispensation of the Teacher not yet complete in the
  training, he thinks Indeed I will attain some distinctive knowledge above human if I dwelt
  in some secluded dwelling like the root of a tree in the forest, a cave or grotto in the
  mountains, a charnel ground, a jungle forest, an open space or a heap of straw..He dwells
  in some secluded dwelling like the root of a tree in the forest, a cave or grotto in the
  mountains, a charnel ground, a jungle forest, an open space or a heap of straw. The
  Teacher blames him, considering it the wise co-associates blame him, gods and he himself
  blames him and he does not attain some distinctive knowledge above human. What is the
  reason? That happens to one incomplete in the training in the dispensation of the
  Teacher.. </p>
  <p>Bhaddali, there is a bhikkhu in the dispensation of the Teacher complete in the
  training, he thinks Indeed I will attain some distinctive knowledge above human if I dwelt
  in some secluded dwelling like the root of a tree in the forest, a cave or grotto in the
  mountains, a charnel ground, a jungle forest, an open space or a heap of straw..He dwells
  in some secluded dwelling like the root of a tree in the forest, a cave or grotto in the
  mountains, a charnel ground, a jungle forest, an open space or a heap of straw. When he
  abides thus secluded the Teacher does not blame him, considering it the wise co-associates
  do not blame him, gods and he himself do not blame him and he attains some distinctive
  knowledge above human. Secluded from sensual desires, and thoughts of demerit, with
  thoughts and thought processes and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion attained to
  abides in the first jhana: What is the reason?. Bhaddali it happens to one complete in the
  training of the dispensation of the Teacher. Again the bhikkhu overcoming thoughts and
  thought processes with the mind appeased and in one point, without thoughts and thought
  processes and with joy and pleasantness born of concentration attained to abides in the
  second jhana: What is the reason? Bhaddali, it happens to one complete in the training.
  Again, Bhaddali the bhikkhu with equanimity to joy and detachment and experiencing
  pleasantness with the body too abides in the third jhaana. To this the noble ones say
  abiding in pleasantness minful of equanimity. What, is the reason?. Bhaddali it happens to
  one complete in the training. Again, Bhaddali, the bhikkhu dispelling pleasantness and
  unpleasantness and earlier having overcome pleasure and displeasure..With equnimity
  purifying mindfulness abides in the fourth jhana. What is the reason? Bhaddali it happens
  to one complete in the training in the dispensation of the Teacher. </p>
  <p>When the mind is concentrated, pure without blemish free of minor defilements workable
  and malleable and is steady he directs the mind to know previous births. He recollects
  innumerable previous births. What is the reason? Bhaddali it happens to one complete in
  the training in the dispensation of the Teacher. When the mind is concentrated, pure
  without blemish free from minor defilements, workable malleable and steady, he directs the
  mind to know the disappearing and appearing of beings. With the heavenly eye purified
  beyond human he sees beings disappearing and appearing in unexalted and exalted states,
  beautiful and ugly in good and bad states. Knows beings according their actions. What is
  the reason? Bhaddali it happens to one complete in the training in the dispensation of the
  Teacher When the mind is concentrated, pure, without blemish free from minor defilements,
  workable malleable and is steady directs the mind for the destruction of desires. He
  knows, as it really is, this is unpleasant---- knows the path to the cessation of desires
  as it really. When he knows and sees thus, his mind is released from sensual desires, from
  the desires &#145;to be&#146; and from ignorant desires. When released knows, I&#146;m
  released. Birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived, what should be done is done. There
  is nothing more to wish. What is the reason? Bhaddali it happens to one complete in the
  training, in the dispensation, of the Teacher&#146; </p>
  <p>When this was said venerable Bhaddali said to the Blessed One.Venerable sir, why is a
  certain bhikkhu pursued closely and another not? Bhaddali, a certain bhikkhu always does
  an offence. When the bhikkhus question him, he leads the talk aside and shows anger,
  aversion and displeasure. He does not behave correctly and say, I will act in such a way
  to please the Community. Then it occurs to those bhikkhus. This bhikkhu always does an
  offence. When questiond by the bhikkhus, he leads the talk aside and shows anger, aversion
  and displeasure. He does not behave correctly and say, I will act in such a way to please
  the Community. Then the bhikkhus say, good if the venerable ones do not settle this
  bhikkhu&#146;s question quickly. Bhaddali, then it happens that the bhikkhus do not settle
  that bhikkhu&#146;s question quickly. Here Bhaddali, a certain bhikkhu always does an
  offence, when the bhikkhus question him, he does not lead the talk aside and does not show
  anger, aversion and displeasure, he behaves calmly and says, I will act in such a way to
  please the Community. Then it occurs to those bhikkhus.The bhikkhu always does an offence.
  When questiond by the bhikkhus he does not lead the talk aside and show anger, aversion
  and displeasure. He behaves calmly and says, I will act in such a way to please the
  Community, Then the bhikkhus say, good if the venerable ones settle this bhikkhu&#146;s
  question quickly. Bhaddali, then it happens that the bhikkhus settle that bhikkhu&#146;s
  question quickly. . </p>
  <p>Here Bhaddali, a certain bhikkhu is always guilty, without an offence when the bhikkhus
  question him, he leads the talk aside and shows anger, aversion and displeasure. He does
  not behave correctly and say, I will act in such a way to please the Community.Then it
  occurs to those bhikkhus. This bhikkhu is always guilty without an offence, when questiond
  by the bhikkhus leads the talk aside and shows anger, aversion and displeasure. He does
  not behave correctly and say, I will act in such a way to please the Community, Then the
  bhikkhus say, good if the venerable ones do not settlethis bhikkhu&#146;s question
  quickly. Bhaddali, then it happens that the bhikkhus do not settle that bhikkhu&#146;s
  question quickly. Here Bhaddali, a certain bhikkhu is always guilty without an offence,
  when the bhikkhus question him, he does not lead the talk aside and does not show anger,
  aversion and displeasure. He behaves calmly and says, I will act in such a way to please
  the Community. Then it occurs to those bhikkhus. This bhikkhu is always guilty without an
  offence, when questiond by the bhikkhus he does not lead the talk aside and show anger,
  aversion and displeasure he behaves calmly and says. I will act in such a way to please
  the Community, Then the bhikkhus say, good if the venerable ones settle this
  bhikkhu&#146;s question quickly. Bhaddali, then it happens that the bhikkhus settle that
  bhikkhu&#146;s question quickly. . </p>
  <p>Bhaddali, a certain bhikkhu goes on, only out of faith and love. Then it occurs to the
  bhikkhus: This bhikkhu goes on only out of faith and love: If we pursue this bhikkhu too
  much his little faith and love will decrease. When a man has a single eye, his friends,
  co-associates and blood relations protect his single eye, do not do this and that, your
  one eye will be lost. In the same manner it occurs to the bhikkhus: This bhikkhu goes on
  only out of faith and love: If we pursue this bhikkhu too much even his little faith and
  love will decrease. </p>
  <p>Bhaddali this is the reason for a certain bhikkhu to be pursued closely and another not
  to be pursued closely &#145; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, what is the reason that earlier, with few rules many bhikkhus
  attained extinction, and now with many rules a few bhikkhus attain extinction?&#146;
  &#145;Baddali, it happens when human beings diminish in good and when the Teaching
  deteriorates. Many rules are appointed few bhikkhus attain extinction. Bhaddali, the
  Teacher does not appoint a rule until a fall for desires is evident, when falls for
  desires are evident among the Community, the Teacher appoints a rule for the dispelling of
  those falls for desires. Until the Community grows large, these falls for desires do not
  become evident. Until the Community become the highest gainers, the Community reaches the
  highest fame, become the most learned, the long standing ones, a fall for desires does not
  become evident. Bhaddali, when a bhikkhu becomes a long standing one a fall for desires
  becomes evident and then the Teacher appoints a rule to dispel those falls for
  desires.&#146; </p>
  <p>Bhaddali you were small when I taught the discourse with the comparison of the
  thoroughbred, do you remember it? No, venerable sir. Bhaddali, do you know why it was
  taught? Venerable sir, isn&#146;t it for being incomplete in the training in the
  dispensation of the Teacher for a long time? Bhaddali, that only, is not the reason, I
  have penetrated and seen your mind throughout a long time. I knew,:this foolish man does
  not consider the Teaching as a whole and and take the essence. I will give the discourse
  with the simile of the thoroughbred, listen and attend carefully.&#146; Venerable Bhaddali
  agreed and the Blessed One said thus: </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhaddali, a good tamer of horses, getting a thoroughbred to train would first
  train it to the mouth. While getting trained to the mouth it would be restless,
  disagreeable and would writhe with the unusual training but would quickly do the first and
  the last of those exercises and soon the restlessness, disagreeability and the writhing
  would subside. When the restlessness, disagreeability and the writhing by wearing the
  mouth -piece subsides, the horse trainer gives it a further training in fixing the yoke.
  When fixed to the yoke too the thoroughbred would be restless, disagreeable and would
  writhe with the unusual training but would quickly do the first and the last of the
  exercises and soon the restlessness, disagreeability and the writhing would subside. Then
  the horse trainer would give him a further training in gallopping in circles, repeatedly.
  Getting trained in the unusual gallopping in circles, repeatedly it would be restless,
  disagreeable and would writhe with the unusual training but would quickly do the first and
  the last of those exercises and soon the restlessness, disagreeability and the writhing
  would subside. When the restlessness, disagreeability and the writhing subsides, when
  gallopping in circles, repeatedly, the horse trainer would give it a further training in
  maintaining silence. While getting trained in maintaining silence too, it would be
  restless, disagreeable and would writhe with the unusual training but would quickly do the
  first and the last of those exercises and soon the restlessness, disagreeability and the
  writhing would subside. When the thoroughbred has finished this tenfold training, it
  becomes worthy for the king, worthy for the services of the king, the royal property. In
  the same manner the bhikkhu endowed with these ten things would be worthy for hospitality,
  offerings, gifts, and for reverential salutation. He becomes an incomparable field of
  merit for the world: What ten: The bhikkhu should be endowed with the right view, of one
  gone beyond the training and right thoughts of one gone beyond the training. Endowed with
  right words and right actions of one gone beyond the training. Endowed with the right
  livelihood of one gone beyond the training. With right effort and right mindfulness of one
  gone beyond the training. Should be endowed with the right concentration and right release
  of one gone beyond the training. Bhaddali, the bhikkhu endowed with these ten things
  becomes worthy for hospitality, worthy for offerings, worthy for gifts, worthy for
  reverential salutation and an incomparable field of merit for the world&#146;. </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said thus and venerable Bhaddali delighted in the words of the Blessed
  One.</p>
  <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. A bhikkhu released both ways.&#146;<em>ubhatovimutto</em>&#146; A bhikkhu released
    both ways literary knows the release and he experiences that release here and now. That is
    he experiences the release that he knows with the body here and now.eg. He is not touched
    by any contact at one or the other doors of mental contact. He also has experienced this
    through the jhaanas. </p>
    <p>2. Released through wisdom.&#146;<em>pa~n~naavimutto&#146;</em> He literary knows the
    release, and he experiences it in jhaanas and higher absorptions. </p>
    <p>3. A body witness of the path.&#146;<em>kaayasakkhi&#146;</em> The body witness of the
    path, once in a way has experienced the path. He has to make much effort to experience the
    results here and now. Yet he is quite safe and would experience its results at least on
    his death bed. </p>
    <p>4.One come to righteousness of view.&#146;<em>di.t.thipatto</em>&#146; The one come to
    righteousness of view is safely gliding on the path. He also is safe and would experience,
    results on his death bed, to the extent of his attainment, if he does not make effort here
    and now. </p>
    <p>5. One released through faith.&#146;<em>saddhaavimutto</em>&#146; The one released
    through faith has a lot of faith in the enlightenment of the Blessed One, in the Teaching
    and in the Community of bhikkhus. On account of it he is released through faith. He is
    safely on the path and the maximum number of births left for him would be seven, even if
    he becomes lazy and indolent. </p>
    <p>6. The one faring according to the Teaching <em>&#145;dhammaanusaari&#146;</em> He
    leads a life according to the Teaching and if he is not lazy and indolent, is sure to
    enter the stream of the Teaching.</p>
    <p>7. One faring according to faith.&#146;<em>saddhaanusaari&#146;</em> The one faring
    according to faith too is sure to enter the stream of the Teaching, if he is not lazy and
    indolent. </p>
