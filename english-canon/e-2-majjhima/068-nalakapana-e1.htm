  <b>(68) The Discourse at Nalakapana.</b> </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus. </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One was living in a forest in Nalakapaana in the kingdom of
  Kosala. At that time many, well known sons of clansmen had gone forth as homeless ones,
  through faith for the Blessed One. Well known ones such venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya,
  Kimbila, Bhagu, Kundadaana, Revata, Aananda, and other sons of clansmen. At that time the
  Blessed One was seated in the open attended by the Community of bhikkhus. The Blessed One
  addressed the bhikkhus on account of those sons of clansmen. The bhikkhus, the sons of
  clansmen who have gone forth, on account of faith in me, do you lead the holy life with
  attachment? When this was said the bhikkhus, were silent. For the second time, and up to
  the third time the Blessed One said, The bhikkhus, the sons of clansmen who have gone
  forth, on account of faith in me, do you lead the holy life with an attachment? Even for
  the third time the bhikkhus were silent. </p>
  <p>Then it occurred to the Blessed One, what if I question one of the sons of those
  clansmen, then the Blessed One addressed venerable Anuruddha: Anuruddha, are you attached
  to the holy life? Venerable sir, I&#146;m attached to the holy life. Good! Anurudddha,
  lead the holy life with attachment! Sons of clansmen, gone forth out of faith in me,
  should do so. Anurudddha, you are in the prime of youth, in the first stage of life, even
  with black hair. When you should enjoy the five strands of sense pleasure, you have gone
  forth and become homeless. Anuruddha, you were not thrown to recluseship out of fear for
  the king or robbers. Nor out of fear of a debt, not because you have no means to live. It
  is because you thought, I&#146;m overcome by birth, decay, death, grief, lament,
  unpleasantness, displeasure and distress, and that few could declare the complete ending
  of unpleasantness. Anuruddha, didn&#146;t you go forth with that faith? Yes, venerable sir
  I did. Anuruddha, to the son of a clansman who has gone forth thus, what&#146;s there to
  be done in this dispensation? Anuruddha, if you do not seclude the mind from sensual
  desires and things of demerit, or attain something more exalted than that, covetousness
  takes hold of your mind and stays (* 1). Anger takes hold of your mind and stays. Sloth
  and torpor takes hold of your mind and stays. Restlessness and worry takes hold of your
  mind and stays and doubts take hold of your mind and stay. Therefore, Anuruddha, seclude
  the mind from sensual desires and things of demerit, or attain something more exalted than
  that.So that covetoutness may not take hold of your mind and stay. Anger may not take hold
  of your mind and stay, sloth and torpor may not take hold of your mind and stay,
  restlessness and worry may not take hold of your mind and stay and doubts may not take
  hold of your mind stay. </p>
  <p>Anuruddha, do you think that these defiling desires, full of unplessant results of a
  future birth, decay and death, are not dispelled to the Thus Gone One. Therefore the Thus
  Gone One carefully pursues one, endures one, dispels one and destroys another. Venerable
  sir, we do not think in that manner. We think it should be like this. Defiling desires,
  full of unpleasant results, of a future birth, decay and death, are dispelled to the Thus
  Gone One. Therefore the Thus Gone One carefully pursues one, endures one, dispels one and
  destroys another. Good, Anuruddha, you have understood it. To the Thus Gone One these
  defiling desires, full of unpleasant results of a future birth, decay and death, are
  dispelled. They are pulled out from the roots, made palm stumps, made things that would
  not grow again. Anuruddha, it is like a palm of which the top is cut and is not able to
  grow again. In the same manner, these defiling desires, full of unplessant results, of a
  future birth, decay and death, are dispelled to the Thus Gone One. Therefore the Thus Gone
  One, carefully pursues one, endures one, dispels one and destroys another. </p>
  <p>Anuruddha, for what purpose does the Thus Gone One tell the disciples, without wasting
  time, before you die, be born in something higher. Stating one is born there, another
  there. (* 2) The Teaching&#146;s origin is the Blessed One, its lead is from the Blessed
  One, and its refuge is the Blessed One. Good that the meaning occurs to the Blessed
  One.We, bhikkhus, hearing it from the Blessed One, will bear it in mind. Anuruddha, the
  Thus Gone One tells the disciples, without wasting time before you die, be born in
  something higher. Telling them one is born there, another there. Not to deceive people,
  not for prattling, and not for gain honour or fame and not thinking may the people know me
  thus. Yet, Anuruddha, there are sons of clansmen who are born in faith and are pleased, to
  hear it. Hearing it they would arouse interest and direct their minds to that and it would
  be for their good for a long time. </p>
  <p>Here, Anuruddha, a bhikkhu hears, the venerable bhikkhu of this name has passed away,
  and the Blessed One has declared that he is enlightened. Now this venerable bhikkhu
  happens to be a person seen by that bhikkhu, or not seen by him. He hears, these were the
  virtues of the venerable bhikkhu, these, his thoughts, such his wisdom, he developed these
  abidings and was released. So this bhikkhu recollects that faith, those virtues, his
  learnedness, benevolence and wisdom and directs his mind to it. Anuruddha, in this manner
  too there is a pleasant abiding to a bhikkhu (* 3). </p>

  and the Blessed One has declared that he with the destruction of the five lower bonds has
