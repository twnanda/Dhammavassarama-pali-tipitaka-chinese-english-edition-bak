  (120) -Arising of Intentions (*) </strong></font></p>
  <p>I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika in
  Jeta&#146;s grove in Saavatthi. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkus from there.
  &#145;Bhikkhus, I will tell the arising of intentions, listen carefully with attention.
  Those bhikkhus agreed and the Blessed One said: &#145;Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is endowed
  with faith, virtues, learning, benevolence and wisdom. It occurs to the bhikkhu, O! I
  should be born with the high warriors at the break up of the body, after death. He bears
  it in the mind, directs thoughts to it, develops that thought.Those intentions and that
  abiding, developped and made much, conduces to be born there. This is the path and method
  to be born there. </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is endowed with faith, virtues, learning, benevolence and
  wisdom. It occurs to the bhikkhu, O! I should be born with the high brahmins,...re....high
  middle class, at the break up of the body, after death. He bears it in the mind, directs
  thoughts to it, develops that thought, and those intentions. That abiding, developped and
  made much, conduces to be born there. This is the path and method to be born there. </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is endowed with faith, virtues, learning, benevolence and
  wisdom. It occurs to the bhikkhu, O! I should be born with the four guardian gods with
  long life, beauty and much pleasantness, at the break up of the body, after death. He
  bears it in the mind, directs his thoughts to it, develops that thought, and those
  intentions. That abiding, developped and made much, conduces to be born with the guardian
  gods with long life, beauty and much pleasantness. This is the path and method to be born
  there. </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is endowed with faith, virtues, learning, benevolence and
  wisdom. It occurs to the bhikkhu, O! I should be born with the company of gods of the
  thirty three. ....re.... with the Yaama gods,...re.... with the happy gods,...re...withthe
  gods attached to creating, ...re... with the gods attached to creating others, with long
  life, beauty and much pleasantness, at the break up of the body, after death. He bears it
  in the mind, directs thoughts to it, develops that thought, and those intentions.That
  abiding, developped and made much, conduces to be born with the gods attached to creatig
  others, with long life, beauty and much pleasantness. This is the path and method to be
  born there. </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is endowed with faith, virtues, learning, benevolence and
  wisdom. The bhikkhu learns, Sahasa Brahmaa wields power over the thousandfold world
  systems, with long life, beauty and much pleasantness. He wields power over those born
  there. Like a wise man drawing a circle on his palm woud reflect, in the same manner
  Sahasa Brahmaa wields power over the thousandfold world systems and wields power over
  those born there. It occurs to him. O! I should be born with Sahasaa Brahma at the break
  up of the body, after death. He bearsthat mind, directs thoughts to it, develops that
  thought, and those intentions.That abiding, developped and made much, conduces to be born
  with Sahasaa Brahmaa, who wields power over the thousandfold world syetems, with long
  life, beauty and much pleasantness. This is the path and method to be born there.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is endowed with faith, virtues, learning, benevolence and
  wisdom. The bhikkhu learns, Dvi Sahasa Brahmaa,..re... Ti Sahasaa Brahmaa...re.... Catu
  Sahasaa Brahmaa,...re...Panca Sahasaa Brahmaa wields power over the five thousandfold
  world systems, with long life, beauty and much pleasantness. He wields power over those
  born there. Like a wise man drawing five circles on his palm woud reflect, in the same
  manner Panca Sahasa Brahmaa wields power over the thousandfold world systems and wields
  power over those born there. It occurs to him. O! I should be born with Panca Sahasaa
  Brahma at the break up of the body, after death. He bearsthat mind, directs thoughts to it
  and develops that thought. Those intentions and that abiding, developped and made much,
  conduces to be born with Panca Sahasaa Brahmaa, who wields power over the five
  thousandfold world syetems, with long life, beauty and much pleasantness. This is the path
  and method to be born there. </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is endowed with faith, virtues, learning, benevolence and
  wisdom. The bhikkhu learns, Dasa Sahasa Brahmaa, wields power over the ten thousandfold
  world systems, with long life, beauty and much pleasantness. He wields power over those
  born there.like the welcome lepis gem with eight facets well completed placed on the
  yellow blanket would shne and emanate radiance in the same manner Dasa Sahasa Brahmaa
  wields power over theten thousandfold world systems and wields power over those born
  there. It occurs to him. O! I should be born with Dasa Sahasaa Brahma at the break up of
  the body, after death. He bearsthat mind, directs thoughts to it, develops that thought.
  Those intentions and that abiding, developped and made much, conduces to be born with Dasa
  Sahasaa Brahmaa, who wields power over the ten thousandfold world syetems, with long life,
  beauty and much pleasantness. This is the path and method to be born there. </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is endowed with faith, virtues, learning, benevolence and
  wisdom. The bhikkhu learns, Sata Sahasa Brahmaa, wields power over the hundred
  thousandfold world systems, with long life, beauty and much pleasantness. He wields power
  over those born there. Like a clever goldsmith who would purify born gold putting it in
  the furnace and it would radiate light and heat placed on the orange blanket in the same
  manner Sata Sahasa Brahmaa wields power over theten thousandfold world systems and wields
  power over those born there. It occurs to him. O! I should be born with Sata Sahasaa
  Brahma at the break up of the body, after death. He bearsthat mind, directs thoughts to it
  and develops that thought.Those intentions and that abiding, developped and made much,
  conduces to be born with Sata Sahasaa Brahmaa, who wields power over the hundred

  and method to be born there. </p>

  should be born with gods of the highest order with long life, beauty and much
  pleasantness. This is the path and method to be born there. </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is endowed with faith, virtues, learning, benevolence and
  wisdom. The bhikkhu learns, that gods born in space have a long life span </p>
  <p>and enjoy much pleasantness. It occurs to him. O! I should be born with gods of space
  with long life, much pleasantness. This is the path and method to be born there. </p>
  <p>.Again the bhikkhu is endowed with faith, virtues, learning, benevolence and wisdom.

  span and enjoy much pleasantness. It occurs to him. O! I should be born with gods of the
  sphere of neither perception nor non perception with long life, much pleasantness. This is
  the path and method to be born there. </p>
  <p>Again the bhikkhu is endowed with faith, virtues, learning, benevolence and widom. It
  occurs to the bhikkhu O! I should destroy desires, without desires, the mind released and

  desires, without desires, the mind released and released through wisdom here and now by
  himself realizing abides. Bhikkhus, this bhikkhu is not born any where for any reason. </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Notes </strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(*). Sankhaaruppattisutta shows how living with intentions, directing thoughts to them
    and developping those thoughts leads to the flowering of those intentions, desires and
    thoughts. Lastly, when desires are destroyed, the mind is released and there is no more
    birth. </p>
