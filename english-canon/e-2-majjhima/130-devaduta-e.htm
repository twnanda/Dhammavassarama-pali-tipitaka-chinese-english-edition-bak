  (130)-The Heavenly Messengers.</strong></font></p>
  <p>I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika in
  Jeta&#146;s grove in Saavatthi. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from there.
  &#145;Bhikkhus, like a man standing between two houses with doors standing adjacently
  would see people entering, leaving, wandering and roaming in the two houses.Likewise I see
  with my heavenly eye purified beyond human, beings disappearing and appearing, unexalted
  and exalted, beautiful and ugly, in heaven and in hell. I see beings according their
  actions: These good beings conducting well by body, speech and mind, not blaming noble
  ones, developping right view, bearing the right view of actions, at the break up of the
  body, after death, go to increase, are born in heavenThese good beings conducting well by
  body, speech and mind, not blaming noble ones, developping right view, bearing the right
  view of actions, at the break up of the body, after death, are born with humans. These
  good beings mis -conducting by body, speech and mind, blaming noble ones, developping
  wrong view, bearing the wrong view of actions, at the break up of the body, after death,. </p>
  <p>are born in the sphere of ghosts These good beings misconducting by body, speech and
  mind, blaming noble ones, developping wrong view, bearing the wrong view of actions, at
  the break up of the body, after death, are born with animals.These good beings
  misconducting by body, speech and mind, blaming noble ones, developping wrong view,
  bearing the wrong view of actions, at the break up of the body, after death, decrease, and
  are born in hell. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, the warders of hell take him by his hands and feet and show him to the king
  of the under world &#145;Lord, this man is unfriendly, not uniting, not chaste, does not
  honour the elders in the family, mete him the suitable punishment. </p>
  <p>The king of the under world cross questions, asks for reasons and studies together with
  him thus. &#145;Good man did you not see the first divine messenger among humans?&#146; He
  says &#145;Sir I did not see.&#146; Then the king of the under world would ask him.
  &#145;Good man didn&#146;t you see a todler who stands and lies with difficulty, mingled
  in his own urine and excreta while lying?&#146; Then he says, &#145;Sir, I saw.&#146;The
  king of the under world asks him. &#145;Goodman, being a wise aged one, didn&#146;t it
  occur to you, I have not gone beyond birth, now I will do some good by body, words and
  mind?&#146; He would say, &#145;Sir, I could not do.owing to negligence&#146; The king of
  the under world says. &#145;Good one, owing to negligence you acted in that manner. This
  evil action was not done by your, mother, father, brother, sister, friends, co -associates
  or blood relations. It was not done by recluses, brahmins or gods, it was done by you and
  you will experience its results </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, the king of the under word having finished cross questioning, asking for
  reasons and studying together about the first divine messenger asks him&#145;Good man did
  you not see the second divine messenger among humans?&#146; He says &#145;Sir I did not
  see.&#146; Then the king of the under world would ask him. &#145;Good man didn&#146;t you
  see among humans a woman or man, eighty or ninety years old, decayed and bent like the

  saw.&#146;The king of the under world asks him. &#145;Goodman, being a wise aged one,

  see.&#146; Then the king of the under world would ask him. &#145;Good man didn&#146;t you
  see among humans a woman or man, gravely ill immersed in his own urine and excreta, raised
  by others and conducted by others?&#146; Then he says, &#145;Sir, I saw.&#146;The king of
  the under world asks him. &#145;Goodman, being a wise aged one, didn&#146;t it occur to

  you will experience its results </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, the king of the under word having finished cross questioning, asking for
  reasons and studying together about the third divine messenger asks him&#145;Good man did
  you not see the fourth divine messenger among humans?&#146; He says &#145;Sir I did not
  see.&#146; Then the king of the under world would ask him. &#145;Good man didn&#146;t you

  saw.&#146;The king of the under world asks him. &#145;Goodman, being a wise aged one,
  didn&#146;t it occur to you, the results for evil actions are here and now there is no
  other alternative. Now I will do some good by body, words and mind?&#146; He would say,

  &#145;Good one, owing to negligence you acted in that manner. This evil action was not
  done by your, mother, father, brother, sister, friends, co -associates or blood relations.
  It was not done by recluses, brahmins or gods, it was done by you and you will experience
  its results </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, the king of the under word having finished cross questioning, asking for
  reasons and studying together about the fourth divine messenger asks him&#145;Good man did
  you not see the fifth divine messenger among humans?&#146; He says &#145;Sir I did not

  <p>Bhikkhus, the king of the under word having finished cross questioning, asking for
  reasons and studying together about the fifth divine messenger becomes silent.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Then the warders of hell give him the fivefold binding. That is two hot iron spikes are
  sent through his two palms, and two other hot spikes are sent through his two feet and the
  fifth hot iron spike is sent through his chest. On account of this he experiences sharp
  piercing unpleasant feelings. Yet he does not die, until his demerit finishes. Next the

  the molten pot.On account of this too he experiences sharp piercing unpleasant feelings.
  Yet he does not die, until his demerit finishes.Next the warders of hell throw him to the
  Great Hell. The square Great Hell has four gates and is divided in two,&nbsp; Enclosed by
  iron walls, is closed with an iron lid.&nbsp; The floor spreads for seven hundred miles,
  And it stands there everyday.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>A fire springs from the eastern wall of the Great Hell to scorch the western wall. A

  northern wall to scorch the southern wall. A fire springs from the southern wall to scorch

  <p>Bhikkhus, after the lapse of a very long time, it happens that the eastern door of the

  you desire?&#146; He says, &#145;Sir, I&#146;m hungry.&#146; The warders of hell open his
  mouth with hot iron spikes and pour into his mouth burning, flaming iron balls. They burn

  with the insides There he experiences sharp piercing unpleasant feelings, yet he does not
  die, until his demerit comes to an end. </p>

  <p>Then the warders of Hell put him back to the Great Hell.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>In the past to the king of the Under World it occurred thus. To those who do evil in
  the world, these various punishments are given. O! IfI gain humanity. O! If the Thus Gone
  One, perfect and rightfully enlightened is born in the world. O! I should associate that
  Blessed One. O! the Blessed One should teach me and I should know that Teaching. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, I say this not hearing from another recluse or brahmin, this is what I have
  myself known and seen and so I say it.&#146; </p>
  <p>Then the Blessed One further said. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Those humans that are negligent, when blamed by the divine messengers <br>
    Are born in low births, there they grieve long <br>
    The appeased and worthy ones blamed by the divine messengers,&nbsp; <br>
    Are not negligent in the noble Teaching any day. <br>
    They see fear in holding, birth, death and being <br>
    And release themselves without holding,destroying birth and death <br>
    They are the appeased and pleasant, the extinguished here and now <br>
    Gone beyond all fear and revenge, have gone beyond all unpleasantness. </p>
