  <b>(74) Advice to Dighanakha the wandering Ascetic</b>. </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus. </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived on vultures&#146; peak where pigs were molested, in
  Rajagaha. Then the wandering ascetic Dighanakha approached the Blessed One, exchanged
  friendly greetings, stood on a side, and said to the Blessed One: &#145;Good Gotama,
  I&#146;m of this view, and declare Everything is not pleasing.to
  me&#146;.&#145;Aggivessana, according to this view of yours, everything is not pleasing to
  me. Is that view pleasing to you?&#146; &#145;Good Gotama, that view pleases me and such
  others like them.&#146; &#145;Aggivessana, there are very many in the world, who have this
  view, that too is like that and that too is like that. They do not give up that view, but
  take up another view. Aggivessana, only a few in this world say, that too is like that and
  that too is like that, and they give up that view and do not uphold another view&#146;. </p>
  <p>&#145;Aggivessana, there are recluses and brahmins, in this world, who uphold this view
  and declare it. Every thing is pleasing to me Aggivessana, there are recluses and brahmins
  in this world, who uphold this view and declare it. Every thing is not pleasing to me.
  Aggivessana, there are recluses and brahmins, in this world, who uphold this view and
  declare it. Some things are pleasing to me and other things are not pleasing to me.
  Aggivessana the view of those recluses and brahmins, every thing is pleasing to me, is
  close upon greed, is yoked to interest, appropriating and seizing. Aggivessana the view of
  those recluses and brahmins, every thing is not pleasing to me, is away from greed, not
  yoked to interest, appropriating and seizing&#146;. When this was said, the wandering
  ascetic Dighanakha said thus to the Blessed One.&#146; Does good Gotama, praise my
  view.&#146; &#145;Aggivessana, the view of those recluses and brahmins, some things are
  pleasing to me and other things are not pleasing. Pleasing things, are close upon greed,
  yoked to interest, appropriating and seizing. The things not pleasing, are away from
  greed, unyoked from interest, appropriating and seizing.. </p>
  <p>Aggivessana, a wise man reflects, if I held this view, every thing is pleasing to me,
  this only is the truth all else is false, stubbornly and did not give it up easily. I have
  to worry on account of two things. About the recluses and brahmins of this view, every
  thing is not pleasing to me and the recluses and brahmins of this view, some things are
  pleasing to me and some other things are not pleasing to me. On account of these two
  views, there is a split. On account of a split, a dispute, and trouble. Then seeing that
  his view has split, and there is a dispute and trouble, he gives up that view and does not
  uphold another view. This is the giving up of such views. Aggivessana, a wise man
  reflects. If I held this view, every thing, is not pleasing to me, this is the truth. All
  else is false, stubbornly and not give it up easily. I have to worry on account of two
  things. About the recluses and brahmins of this view. Every thing is pleasing, to me and
  the recluses and brahmins of this view, some things are pleasing to me and some other
  things are not pleasing to me. On account of these two views, there is a split, a dispute
  and trouble. Then seeing that his view has split, and there is a dispute and trouble, he

  <p>Aggivessana, this material body of the four primary elements, brought forth by mother
  and father and supported on rice and bread, is subject to change through brushing and
  breaking. It should be reflected, as impermanent, unpleasaant, an illness, an abscess, an
  arrow, a troublesome thing, as foreign and as breaking apart, as void, and as not mine.
  When he sees this body as impermanent, unpleasaant, an illness, an abscess, an arrow, as a
  troublesome thing, as foreign and as breaking apart, as void, and as not mine, the
  interest for the body, the love for it and following the needs of the body, fade. </p>
  <p>Aggivessana, these three are the feelings, pleasant, unpleasant and neither unpleasant
  nor pleasaant. Aggivessana, when a pleasant feeling is felt, at such time an unpleasant
  feeling or a neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings is not felt. Only the pleasant
  feeling is felt. Aggivessana, when an unpleasant feeling is felt, at such times a pleasant
  feeling or a neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings is not felt. Only the unpleasant
  feeling is felt. . Aggivessana, when a neither unpleasant nor pleasant feeling is felt, at
  such time a pleasant feeling or an unpleasant feelings is not felt. Only the neither
  unpleasant nor pleasant feeling is felt. Aggivessana, even the pleasant feelings are
  impermanent, compounded, dependently arisen. They get destroyed, fade, get detached and
  cease. Aggivessana, even the unpleasant feelings are impermanent, compounded and
  dependently arisen. They get destroyed, fade, get detached and cease. Aggivessana, even
  the neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings are impermanent, compounded and dependently
  arisen. They get destroyed, fade, get detached and cease. When the noble disciple sees
  this, his mind breaks away from pleasant feelings, unpleasant feelings and even from
  neither unpleasant- norpleasant feelings. When the mind breaks away, it gets detached,
  when detached it is released. When released knowledge arises I&#146;m released. Birth is
  destroyed, the holy life is lived. What should be done is done. He knows there is nothing
  more to wish. Aggivessana, the so released mind does not disagree with anyone has no
  dispute with any one, abides with the truth vogue in the world without a dispute. At that
  time venerable Sariputta was fanning the Blessed One, standing beside him, and it occurred
  to venerable Sariputta. This is the reason, that the Blessed One asked us constantly, to
  dispel thoughts. When venerable Sariputta reflected on this, his mind was released from
  desires, without holdings. To the wandering ascetic Dighanakha the stainless, pure vision
  arose. Whatever arises, all that ceases. (* 1) Then the wandering ascetic Dighanakha here
  and now, mastered the Teaching, experienced it and penetrated it, without doubts became
  confident of things that should be done and should not be done and did not need a teacher
  in the dispensation any more. Then he said. I understand good Gotama. It is like something
  over turned is reinstalled. Something covered is made manifest. As though the path is told
  to one who had lost his way. As though an oil lamp was lighted for those who have sight to
  see forms in the dark. In various ways, good Gotama explained it. Now I take refuge in
  good Gotama, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. May I be remembered as a lay
  disciple from today until life lasts. .. </p>

    <p>1. Whatever arises, all that ceases.&#146;<em>ya.m kinci samudayadhamma.m sabba.m tam
    nirodhadhamma.m ti.</em>&#146; This is the core of the Teaching, and it is this
    realization, that happens, when he enters the stream of the Teaching. </p>
