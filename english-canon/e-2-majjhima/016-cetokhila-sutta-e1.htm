  <b>(16) The Arrow in the Mind.</b> </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus. </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika in
  Jeta&#146;s grove in Saavatthi. From there the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus.
  &quot;O! Bhikkhus, if the five arrows in the mind of the bhikkhu are not dispelled, and if
  the five bonds are not cut, that bhikkhu should come to growth and development in the
  dispensation, is not a posssibility. How are his five arrows of the mind not dispelled:
  Here the bhikkhu doubts.and does not accept the Teacher with assurance. When he doubts and
  does not accept the Teacher with assurance his mind does not tend to exert and make
  effort.to dispel. -This is the first arrow in the mind not dispelled. Again the bhikkhu
  doubts and does not accept the Teaching with assurance. When the bhikkhu doubts and does
  not accept the Teaching with assurance his mind does not tend to exert and make effort to
  dispel. This is the second arrow in the mind not dispelled. Again the bhikkhu doubts and
  does not accept the Community of bhikkhus with assurance. When the bhikkhu doubts and does
  not accept the Community of bhikkhus with assurance his mind does not tend to exert and
  make effort to dispel. This is the third arrow in the mind not dispelled. Again, the
  bhikkhu doubts and does not accept the Training with assurance. When the bhikkhu doubts
  and does not accept the Training with assurance his mind does not tend to exert and make
  effort to dispel. This is the fourth arrow in the mind not dispelled. Again, the bhikkhu
  angry with the co-associates in the holy life is displeased and hurt, and his mind does
  not tend to exert and make effort to dispel. This is the fifth arrow in the mind not
  dispelled. These five arrows in the mind are not dispelled. </p>
  <p>How are the five bonds of the mind not cut. Here the bhikkhu has undispelled greed,
  intereest, love, thirst and burning for sensuality. When he has not dispelled greed,
  interest, love, thirst and burning for sensuality, his mind does not tend to exert and
  make effort to dispel. This is the first bond not cut. Again the bhikkhu has undispelled
  greed, interest, love, thirst and burning for the body. When the bhikkhu has not dispelled
  greed, interest, love, thirst and burning for the body, his mind does not tend to exert
  and make effort to dispel. This is the second bond not cut. Again the bhikkhu has
  undispelled greed, interest, love, thirst and burning for matter. When the bhikkhu has not
  dispelled greed, interest, love, thirst and burning for material, his mind does not tend
  to exert and make effort to dispel. This is the third bond not cut. Again, the bhikkhu
  partaking food as much as he likes, is yoked to the pleasure of torpor touch and sleep.
  When the bhikhu partaking food as much as he likes, is yoked to the pleasure of torpor,
  touch and sleep, his mind does not tend to exert and make effort to dispel. This is the
  fourth bond not cut. Again the bhikkhu observing these virtues and austerities and leading
  this holy life, aspires may I be with those gods, or may I be a certain god When the
  bhikkhu observes virtues and austerities and leads the holy life aspiring to be with a
  certain retinue of gods or to be a certain god his mind does not tend to exert and make
  effort to dispel. This is the fifth bond not cut These are the five bonds of the mind not
  cut.If in that bhikkhu the five arrows in the mind are not dispelled, the five bonds are
  not cut, that he should come to growth and devlopment in this dispensation is not
  possible. </p>
  <p>Whoever bhikkhu has the five arrows in the mind dispelled and the five bonds cut, that
  he should come to growth and development in this dispensation is possible. How are the
  five arrows in the mind dispelled. Here the bhikkhu does not doubt, accepts the Teacher
  with assurance. When he does not doubt accepts the Teacher with assurance his mind tends
  to exert and makes effort.to dispel. -This first arrow in the mind is dispelled. Again,
  the bhikkhu does not doubt, accepts the Teaching with assurance. When he does not doubt
  accepts the Teaching with assurance his mind tends to exert and makes effort to dispel.
  This second arrow in the mind is dispelled. Again, the bhikkhu does not doubt, accepts the
  Community of Bhikkkhus with assurance. When he does not doubt accepts the Community of
  Bhikkhus with assurance his mind tends to exert and makes effort to dispel. This third
  arrow in the mind is dispelled. Again, the bhikkhu does not doubt accepts the Training
  with assurance. When he does not doubt accepts the Training with assurance his mind tends
  to exert and makes effort to dispel. This fourth arrow in the mind is dispelled. Again the
  bhikkhu not angry with the co-associates in the holy life, is pleased and not hurt his
  mind tends to exert and makes effort to dispel. This fifth arrow in the mind is dispelled.
  Thus the five arrows in the mind are dispelled. </p>
  <p>How are the five bonds in the mind cut. Here the bhikkhu has dispelled greed, interest,
  love, thirst and burning for sensuality. When the bhikkhu has dispelled greed, interest,
  love, thirst and burning for sensuality,. his mind tends to exert and makes effort to
  dispel. This is the first bond cut. Again the bhikkhu has dispelled greed, interest, love,
  thirst and burning for the body. When the bhikkhu has dispelled greed, interest, love,
  thirst and burning for the body, his mind tends to exert and makes effort to dispel. This
  is the second bond cut. Again the bhikkhu has dispelled greed, interest, love, thirst and
  burning for matter. When the bhikkhu has dispelled greed, interest, love, thirst and
  burning for material, his mind tends to exert and makes effort to dispel. This is the
  third bond cut. Again, the bhikkhu not partaking food as much as he likes, is not yoked to
  the pleasure of torpor, touch and sleep. When the bhikhu not partaking food as much as he
  likes, is not yoked to the pleasure of torpor, touch and sleep, his mind tends to exert
  and makes effort to dispel. This is the fourth bond cut. Again the bhikkhu observing these
  virtues and austerities and leading this holy life, does not aspire may I be with those
  gods, or may I be a certain god When the bhikkhu observes virtues and austerities and
  leads the holy life not aspiring a certain retinue of gods or to be a certain god, his
  mind tends to exert and makes effort to dispel. This is the fifth bond cut These are the
  five bonds of the mind cut. When the bhikkhu has dispelled the five arrows in the mind,
  and cut the five bonds, that he should come to growth and devlopment in this dispensation
  is possible. </p>
  <p>The bhikkhu develops the potential endowed with interest, concentration, effort, and
  determination, develops the potential endowed with endeavour, concentration, effort and
  determination. Develops the potential endowed with mind, concentration, effort, and
  determination. Develops the potential endowed with discrimination, concentration, effort
  and determination The fifth is exertion. With exertion there are fifteen things, endowed
  with these fifteen things it becomes possible for the bhikkhu to attain enlightenment. </p>
  <p>It becomes possible to come to the noble end of the yoke. Like the hen that had sat on
  the eggs for eight, or ten or twelve days, then a desire would rise to her, why
  shouldn&#146;t the chicken, come out of the shell breaking it with the nails of their feet
  or with the beak. Then the chicken come out of the shell safely breaking the shell with
  the nails of their feet or with their beak. In the same manner endowed with these fifteen
  things it becomes possible for the bhikkhu to attain enlightenment, it becomes possible to
  come to the noble end of the yoke. </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One.
