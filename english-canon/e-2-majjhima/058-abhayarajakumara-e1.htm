  <b>(58)To the King&#146;s son Abhaya</b>. </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus. </p>
  <p>At One time the Blessed One was living in the squirrels&#146; sanctuary in the bamboo
  grove in Rajagaha. Then the king&#146;s son Abhaya approached Niganthanataputta worshipped
  and sat on a side. Niganthanataputta said to the king&#146;s son: &#145;&#147;Come!
  Prince, arouse a dispute with the recluse Gotama. When you argue with a person like the
  recluse Gotama, so powerful and so majestic, your fame will spread.&#148; &#147;Venerable
  sir, how could I arouse a dispute with the recluse Gotama, so powerful and so
  majestic?&#148; &#147;Come prince, approach the recluse Gotama and ask. Venerable sir,
  does the Thus Gone One say, such words that are disagreeable and distasteful to
  others?&#148; When asked thus if, the recluse Gotama replies. &#147;Yes, prince, the Thus
  Gone One, says words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others.&#148; Then you
  should say. &#147;Venerable sir, what is the difference between you and the ordinary one?
  The ordinary one says words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others.&#148; If he
  says, &#147;Prince, the Thus Gone One does not say words that are disagreeable and
  distasteful to others.&#148; Then you should say. &#147;Venerable sir, why did you say
  these words to Devadadtta? Devadatta is in loss, in hell in much difficulty, till the end
  of the world cycle? On account of those words Devadatta was displeased.&#148; When this
  forked question, is asked, he would not be able to swallow it or spit it out. A man with
  an iron ring stuck in the throat would not be able to swallow or spit it out. In the same
  manner when this forked question is asked, he would not be able to swallow it or spit it
  out.&#146; </p>
  <p>Prince Abhaya agreed with the words of Niganthanataputta, got up from his seat,
  worshipped, circumambulated Niganthanataputta and approached the Blessed One. Worshipping
  the Blessed One he sat on a side. The prince considered the time, and thought it is not
  the proper time to arouse a dispute with the Blessed One. He thought, I will invite the
  Blessed One for tomorrow&#146;s meal and arouse the dispute at home. He said. &#145;May
  the Blessed One, accept tomorrow&#146;s meal with three others.&#146; The Blessed One
  accepted in silence and the prince knowing that the Blessed One had accepted the
  invitation, got up from his seat worshipped, circumambulated the Blessed One and went
  away. The Blessed One at the end of that night, putting on robes in the morning, taking
  bowl and robes approached the dwelling of the prince, and sat on the prepared seat. Prince
  Abhaya with his own hands served the nourishing eatables and drinks, and after the meal
  was over, took a low seat and sat on a side </p>
  <p>Prince Abhaya then, said to the Blessed. &#145;One.Venerable sir, does the Thus Gone
  One say words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others?&#146; &#145;Prince, in
  certain respects I do not&#146;.&#146;Venerable sir we heard this from the nigantas&#146;.
  &#145;Prince, why do you say, we heard this from the nigantas?&#146; &#145;Here venerable
  sir, I approached Niganthanaataputta worshipped him and sat on a side. Then
  Niganthanaataputta said to me. Come prince, approach the recluse Gotama and ask. Venerable
  sir, does the Thus Gone One say, words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others?
  When asked thus if the recluse Gotama replies. The Thus Gone One says words that are
  disagreeable and distasteful to others. Then you say. If that is so venerable sir, what is
  the difference between you and the ordinary one? The ordinary one says words that are
  disagreeable and distasteful to others. If he says, Prince, the Thus Gone One does not say
  words that are disagreeable and distasteful to others. Ask him, venerable sir, why did you
  say these words to Devadatta? Devadatta is in loss, in hell, in much difficulty till the
  end of the world cycle. On account of those words Devadatta was displeased. When this
  forked question is asked, he would not be able to swallow it or spit it out. Like a man
  with an iron ring stuck in the throat would not be able to swallow or spit it out. In the
  same manner when this forked question is asked, he would not be able to swallow it or spit
  it out&#146;. </p>
  <p>At that time a baby boy, a toddler was seated on the lap of prince Abhaya, the Blessed
  One said.&#145;Prince, on account of some negligence of yours or the nurse, if this baby
  swallows a piece of stick or a stone, what would you do?&#146; &#145;Venerable sir, I will
  pull it out. If I could not take it out quickly, taking hold of the head with the left
  hand, would pull it out with the finger of the right hand, even while blood is spilt. What
  is the reason? Venerable sir, there is my compassion for the baby&#146;. &#145;Prince, in
  the same manner, when the Thus Gone One knows that words are not true, not conductive to
  good, and are disagreeable and distasteful to others, the Thus Gone One does not say those
  words. When the Thus Gone One knows that words are nottrue, not conductive to good,
  disagreeable and distasteful to others, the Thus Gone One does not say those words. When
  the Thus Gone One knows that the words are true, are conductive to good, disagreeable and
  distasteful to others, the Thus Gone One waits for the right time to explain those words.
  When the Thus Gone one knows that the words are true, conductive to good, agreeable and
  tasteful to others, the Thus Gone One does not say those words. When the Thus Gone One
  knows that the words are true, not conductive to good, agreeable and tasteful to others,
  the Thus one does not say those words. When the Thus Gone One knows that the words are
  trueconductive to good, agreeable and tasteful to others the Thus Gone One waits for the
  right time to explain those words. What is the reason: Prince there is compassion for
  beings in the Thus Gone One&#146;. </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, wise, warriors, or brahmins, or householders, or recluses concoct
  a question, approach the Thus Gone One and question him. Venerable sir, does the Blessed
  One, know before hand, they would approach me and ask these questions? Does it occur to
  the Thus Gone One, when asked thus I will reply thus? Or does the reply at that moment
  occur to the Thus Gone One?&#146; &#145;Then prince, I will ask a question from you on
  this, you may reply, as it pleases you. Prince, are you clever about the large and small
  parts of a chariot?&#146; &#145;Yes, venerable sir, I&#146;m clever in the large and small
  parts of a chariot. Prince, if someone approaches you and asks, about the large and small
  parts of the chariot, would you before hand know these people will approach me and ask
  about these parts of the chariot, and when asked this and other thing I will reply thus
  and thus?&#146; &#145;Venerable sir, I&#146;m a charioteer and I&#146;m clever in the
  large and small parts of the chariot. When asked the reply occurs to me that moment.&#146;
  &#145;Prince, in the same manner, these wise, warriors, brahmins, householders, and
  recluses concoct a question and approach the Thus Gone One, and question him. The answer
  occurs to the Thus Gone One instantly. What is the reason?: The element of the Teaching is
  thoroughly known to the Thus Gone One. So the reply to the question occurs to the Thus
  Gone One that moment.&#146; </p>
  <p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">When this was said, prince Abhaya
  said thus to the Blessed One. &#145;Now I understand it, venerable sir. It is as though
  something over turned is reinstated. Something covered is made manifest. As though the
  path was told to someone who had lost his way. It is like an oil lamp lighted in the dark,
  for those who have sight to see forms. In various ways the Blessed One has explained the
  Teaching. Now I take refuge in the Blessed One, in the Teaching and the Community of
  bhikkhus. May I be remembered as a lay disciple who has taken refuge from today until life
  lasts.&#146; </p>
