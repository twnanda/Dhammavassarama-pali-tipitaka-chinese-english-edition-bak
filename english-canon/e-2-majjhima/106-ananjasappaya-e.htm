  <b>(106) Suitability to attain Imperturbability</b> </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One was living in the Kuru country, in the hamlet named
  Kammassadhamma. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from there. </p>
  <p>'Bhikkhus, sensuality is impermanent, useless, false, a stupid thing and a deception.
  It is prattle and foolish talk. Sensuality here and now and hereafter, sensual perceptions
  here and now and hereafter, all these are the domain of death, the pasture of death. The
  evil mind with sensuality is led to greed, anger and quarrels </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus. the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality is impermanent, useless, false, a
  stupid thing and a deception. It is prattle and foolish talk. Sensuality here and now and
  hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, all these are the domain of
  death, the pasture of death. The evil mind with sensuality is led to greed, anger and
  quarrels. What if I develop the mind grown great and much, above the material world, then
  there will be no greed, anger or quarrels. When these are dispelled my mind will be
  significant, limitless and well developed. Fallen to this method, when developped much,
  the mind, partakes pleasure in that sphere or abides in imperturbability here and now, or
  with wisdom it is released. (*1) After death, there is a possibility that the led on,
  consciousness should reach imperturbability. Bhikkhus, I say, this is the first
  suitability to reach imperturbability. </p>
  <p>Again bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality here and now and hereafter,
  sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, whatever matter of the four primary
  elements, is on account of this held on matter. (*2) Fallen to this method, when
  developped much, the mind, partakes pleasure in that sphere or abides in imperturbability
  here and now, or with wisdom it is released. After death, there is a possibility that the
  led on, consciousness should reach imperturbability. Bhikkhus, I say, this is the second
  suitability to reach imperturbability. </p>
  <p>Again bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality here and now and hereafter,
  sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, whatever matter, here and now or
  hereafter, whatever material perceptions here and now and here after, all these are
  impermanent. It is not suitable to take pleasure and appropriate what is impermanent.
  Fallen to this method, when developped much, the mind, partakes pleasure in that sphere or
  abides in imperturbability here and now, or with wisdom it is released. After death, there
  is a possibility that this led on, consciousness should reach imperturbability. Bhikkhus,
  this is the third suitability to reach imperturbability, I say. </p>
  <p>Again bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality here and now and hereafter,
  sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, whatever matter, here and now or
  hereafter, whatever material perceptions here and now and here after and the perception of
  imperturbability, all these perceptions cease in this sphere of nothingness, without a
  remainder. It is peaceful and exalted. Fallen to this method, when developped much, the
  mind, partakes pleasure in that sphere or abides in imperturbability here and now, or with
  wisdom it is released. After death, there is a possibility that this led on, consciousness
  should reach imperturbability. Bhikkhus, I say, this is the first suitability to reach the
  sphere of nothingness. </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, the noble disciple gone to the forest or to the root of a tree
  reflects. All these are perceived things, of the self, or of the belongings of the self. </p>
  <p>Fallen to this method, when developped much, the mind, partakes pleasure in that sphere
  or abides in imperturbability here and now, or with wisdom it is released. After death,
  there is a possibility that this led on, consciousness should reach imperturbability.
  Bhikkhus, I say, this is the second suitability to reach the sphere of nothingness. </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflects, I have no greed, hate or delusion for
  anybody, neither is there greed, hate and delusion to me from anyone. Fallen to this
  method, when developped much, the mind, partakes pleasure in that sphere or abides in
  imperturbability here and now, or with wisdom it is released. After death, there is a
  possibility that this led on, consciousness should reach imperturbability. Bhikkhus, I
  say, this is the third suitability to reach the sphere of nothingness. </p>
  <p>Again Aananda, the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality here and now and hereafter,
  sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, whatever matter, here and now or
  hereafter, whatever material perceptions here and now and here after, the perception of
  imperturbability and the perception of nothingness, all these perceptions cease in this
  sphere of neither perception nor non-perception, without a remainder. It is peaceful and
  exalted. Fallen to this method, when developped much, the mind, partakes pleasure in that
  sphere or abides in neither perception nor non perception here and now, or with wisdom it
  is released. After death, there is a possibility that this led on, consciousness should
  reach the sphere of neither perception nor non perception. Bhikkhus, I say, this is
  suitability to reach the sphere of neither perception nor non perception.' </p>
  <p>Then venerable Aananda said. 'Venerable sir, the bhikkhu falls to this method, there is
  not, there is not to me, there will not be, there will not be to me, whatever there is,
  whatever produced, I discard, thus he gains equanimity. Venerable sir, is that bhikkhu
  extinguished?' </p>
  <p>'Aananda, a certain bhikkhu fallen to this method may extinguish, another would not.' </p>
  <p>'Venerable sir, why should a certain bhikkhu fallen to this method extinguish and
  another not extinguish?' </p>
  <p>'Ananda, the bhikkhu falls to this method, there is not, there is not to me, there will
  not be, there will not be to me, whatever there is, whatever produced, I discard, thus he
  gains equanimity. He delights in that equanimity, welcomes it, tied to it, his
  consciousness settles in it. Aananda, the bhikkhu with settlements does not extinguish.' </p>
  <p>'Venerable sir, where does the bhikkhu setttle' </p>
  <p>'Aananda, in neither-perception-nor-non-perception.' </p>
  <p>'Venerable sir, he settles in the highest settlement.' </p>
  <p>'Aananda, of settlements neither-perception-nor non-perception, is the highest
  settlement Ananda, the bhikkhu falls to this method, there is not, there is not to me,
  there will not be, there will not be to me, whatever there is, whatever produced, I
  discard, thus he gains equanimity. He does not delight in that equanimity, does not
  welcome it, not tied to it his consciousness does not settle in it. Aananda, the bhikkhu
  without settlements is extinguished.' </p>
  <p>'Wonderful, venerable sir, the Blessed One has explained the crossing of the flood
  supported on higher and higher spheres. Venerable sir, how is noble release?' </p>
  <p>'Again Aananda, the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality here and now and hereafter,
  sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, whatever matter, here and now or
  hereafter, whatever material perceptions here and now and here after, the perception of
  imperturbability, the perception of nothingness, and the sphere of neither perception nor
  non perception, these are things of the self and are holdings, that mind without holdings
  is the mind's release. Aananda, I have taught you the method to attain, imperturbability,
  the sphere of nothingness, the sphere of neither perception-nor-non-perception, the method
  of crossing the flood supported on higher and higher spheres and the noble release.
  Whatever a teacher should do to his disciples out of compassion, that I have done to you.
  Aananda, these are the roots of trees, and these are the empty houses. Aananda,
  concentrate and do not have remorse later. This is our advice to you. </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said those words and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the
  Blessed One. </p>
