  <b>(29) The Major Discourse on Heartwood</b> </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus. </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived on vultures&#146; peak in Raajagaha soon after
  Devadatta had left the dispensation and the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus on account
  of Devadatta. </p>
  <p>&quot;Here, bhikkhus, a certain son of a clansman victimised by birth, decay and death
  leaves the household out of faith and becomes a homeless thinking I am submerged in grief,
  lament, unpleasantness, displeasure, distress and death, saying only a few declare the
  complete ending of this mass of unpleasantness. Gone forth thus, he is reborn in gain,
  honour and fame. Satisfied with it, his desires fulfilled with that gain, honour and fame,
  he praises himself and disparages others. I am a gainer of hospitality, these other
  bhikkhus are impotent and not wise.He becomes intoxicated and negligent on account of that
  gain honour and fame and abides in unpleasantness (*1).Like a man in need of heartwood,
  wandering in search of heartwood, coming to a standing tree with heartwood would ignore
  the heartwood, sapwood, bark and shoots, and cutting the branches and leaves would carry
  them away thinking it&#146;s the heartwood. &#150; A wise man seeing him would say: This
  good man does not know the heartwood, sapwood, bark, shoots, branches or leaves. So this
  man in need of heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood, coming to a standing tree with
  heartwood has ignored the heartwood, sapwood, bark and shoots. He has cut the branches and
  leaves and is carrying them away thinking that it is the heartwood, Whatever work he has
  to do with the heartwood, to that he would not come. Bhikkhus, in the same manner, a
  certain son of a clansman, victimised by birth, decay and death leaves the household out
  of faith. He becomes homeless thinking I am submerged in grief, lament unpleasantness,
  displeasure, distress and death and says only a few declare the complete ending of this
  mass of unpleasanatness. Gone forth he is reborn in gain, honour and fame. Satisfied with
  that, and his desires fulfilled he praises himself and disparages others. I am a gainer of
  hospitality, these other bhikkhus are impotent and not wise.Thus he becomes intoxicated
  and negligent on account of that gain, honour and fame and lives in unpleasanatness.
  Bhikkhus, to this is said, the bhikkhu has come to the end of the holy life among the
  branches and leaves. </p>

  he does not praise himself or disparage others. He is not intoxicated and not negligent on
  account of that gain honour and fame and takes upon himself to observe the virtues.
  Satisfied with it and desires fulfilled he praises himself and disparages others. Saying
  my virtues are pure, these others are evil, and become intoxicated and negligent abides in
  unpleasantness*.Like a man in need of heartwood wandering in search heartwood, coming to a
  standing tree with heartwood would ignore the heartwood and sapwood. Cutting the shoots
  would carry them away thinking that is the heartwood.A wise man seeing him would say: This

  that he would not come.Bhikkhus, in the same manner, a certain son of a clansman,
  victimised by birth, decay and death would leave the household out of faith.Becoming a
  homeless, thinking I am submerged in grief, lament unpleasantness, displeasure, distress

  unpleasantness. Having gone forth thus is reborn in gain, honour and fame. Satisfied with
  it and his desires not fulfilled he would not praise himself nor disparage others. He
  would .take upon himself to observe the virtues. Satisfied with it and his desires
  fulfilled he would praise himself and disparage others. My virtues are pure, these others
  are evil without virtues. Become intoxicated and negligent, he abides in
  unpleasanatness.*. Bhikkhus, to this said, the bhikkhu has come to the end of the holy
  life among the shoots. </p>

  would praise himself and disparage others. Saying I,m concentrated with the mind in one
  point, other bhikkhus are with distracted minds. Intoxicated and negligent on account of
  the endowment of concentration would abide in unpleasanatness. Bhikkhus, to this said, the
  bhikkhu has come to the end of the holy life in the bark. </p>

  not seeing, intoxicated and negligent on account of the endowment of knowledges and vision
  would abide in unpleasantness*. Like a man in need of heartwood wandering in search of

  knowledges and vision would take upon himself to attain the timeless release of mind.
  Bhikkhus, it is not possible that the bhikhu should fall from the timeless release of
  mind.. Like a man in need of heartwood wandering in search of heartwood, coming to a
  standing tree with heartwood would cut the heartwood and carry it away knowing it is
  heartwood.. A wise man seeing him would say: This good man, knows the heartwood, sapwood,
  bark, shoots, branches and leaves. So this man in need of heartwood, wandering in search
  of heartwood, coming to a standing tree with heartwood, has cut the heartwood and is
  carrying it away knowing that it is the heartwood. Whatever work he has to do with the
  heartwood, to that he would come. Bhikkhus, in the same manner, a certain son of a
  clansman, victimised by birth, decay and death would leave the household out of faith.
  Become a homeless would think I&#146;m submerged in grief, lament unpleasantness,
  displeasure, distress and death. Saying only a few declare the complete ending of this
  mass of unpleasantness.Gone forth thus, is reborn in gain, honour and fame. Satisfied with
  it and his desires not fulfilled with that gain, honour and fame, would not praise himself
  nor disparage others. Would.take upon himself to observe the virtues. Satisfied with it
  and his desires not fulfilled with the endowment of virtues would not praise himself nor
  disparage others. Not intoxicated nor negligent, would take upon himself the endowment of
  concentration Satisfied with it and his desires not fulfilled with the endowment of
  concentration would not praise himself nor disparage others. Not intoxicated and not
  negligent would take upon himself to develop knowledges and vision Satisfied with it and
  desired unfulfilled with the endowment of knowledges and vision would take upon himself to
  attain the timeless release of mind. Bhikkhus, it is not possible that the bhikkhu should
  fall from the timeless release of mind (*2) </p>
  <p>So then, bhikkhus, the holy life is led not for, gain, honour and fame, not for the
  endowment of virtues, not for the endowment of concentration, not for the endowment of
  knowledges and vision. Bhikkhus, it is for the unshakeable release of mind*,2) that is the
  essence and end of the holy life, . </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One.

  <p><strong>Notes.</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Intoxicated and negligent on account of the endowment of concentration abides in
    unpleasantness.&#146;<i>so taaya samaadhisampadaaya majjati pamajjati pamaada.m aapajjati
    pamatto samaano dhukkha.m viharati</i>&#146; We see the bhikkhu abiding in unpleasaantness
    on several occasions when he is intoxicated and negligent over his gain honour and fame,
    attainment of virtues, attainment of concentration, attainment of knowledges and vision.
    The person who has realised the timeless release of mind only does not abide in
    unpleasaanatness. The lessening of unpleasaantness starts with the attainment of the entry
    into the stream of the Teaching and reaches the climax with the attainment of extinction.
    Arahatta. </p>
    <p>2. The timeless release of mind, the unshakeable release of mind.&#146;<i>asamaya
    vimokkha.m aaraadeti&#146; &#145;akuppaacetovimutti</i>&#146; This is the attainment of
    extinction, when attained to it, unpleasaantness is not experienced any more. <br>
