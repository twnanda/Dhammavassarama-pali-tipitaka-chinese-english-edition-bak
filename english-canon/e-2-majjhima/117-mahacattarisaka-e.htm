  <p><b>Notes.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 There is right view with desires to share merit, which matures as substratum <em>&#145;atthi
    bhikkhve sammaadi.t.thi saasavaa pu~n~aabhaagiyaa upadhivepakkaa&#146; </em>Right view
    that is worldly is merit, there is a possibility that the merit accurred has to be
    enjoyed, before extinguishng. Therefore it is said, that merit accumulates and gets
    mature. </p>
    <p>2. The logically applied reasoning thoughts which focus attention to fix verbal
    determinations in the noble path mind without desires, are noble right thoughts
    transcending this world and they are a feature of the path. <em>&#145;Yo kho bhikkhave,
    ariyacittassa anaasavacittassa ariyamaggassa sama.ngino ariyamagga.m bhaavayato takko
    vitakko sa.mkappo appanaavyappanaa cetaso abhiniropanaa vaacaa sa.mkhaaro aya.m bhikkhave
    sammaasa.mkappo ariyo anaasavo lokuttaro magga.ngo&#146;</em> Here we see, that to
    whatever extent a person&#146;s thoughts are developped in the direction of the noble
    path, to that extent his words are developped in the direction of the noble path. ie he
    thoughtfully brings out words. </p>
