  (128)-The minor Defilements</strong></font></p>
  <p>I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived in Gosita&#146;s monastery in Kosambi. At that time
  the bhikkhus of Kosambi had aroused a quarrel, and were quarrelling and disputing using
  rough words to each other. Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, worshipped
  the Blessed One and standing said thus. &#145;Venerable sir, the bhikkhus of Kosambi have
  aroused a quarrel, and are quarrelling and disputing using rough words to each other. Good
  if the Blessed One approaches those bhikkhus out of compassion.&#146; The Blessed One
  accepted in silence, approached those bhikkhus and said. &#145;Bhikkhus, give up
  quarrelling, using rough words and have no disputes.&#146; </p>
  <p>When said thus, a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One. &#145;Venerable sir, the
  lord of the Teaching, be unconcerned, keep away! May the Blessed One abide in pleasantness
  here and now! It&#146;s we that will be known in this quarrel, dispute and using rough
  words.&#146; </p>
  <p>.For the second time the Blessed One said&#145;Bhikkhus, give up quarrelling, using
  rough words and have no disputes.&#146; </p>
  <p>When this was said for the second time that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One.
  &#145;Venerable sir, the lord of the Teaching, be unconcerned, keep away! May the Blessed
  One abide in pleasantness here and now! It&#146;s we that will be known in this quarrel,
  dispute and using rough words.&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>For the third time the Blessed One said&#145;Bhikkhus, give up quarrelling, using rough
  words and have no disputes.&#146; </p>
  <p>When this was said for the third time that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One.
  &#145;Venerable sir, the lord of the Teaching, be unconcerned, keep away! May the Blessed
  One abide in pleasantness here and now! It&#146;s we that will be known in this quarrel,
  dispute and using rough words.&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Then the Blessed One putting on robes in the morning, taking bowl and robes, went the
  alms round in Kosambi. Gone the alms round and when the meal was over, arranged the
  dwelling and taking bowl and robes, while standing said these verses </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The foolish do not consider the general opinion, <br>
    The fact, there will be nothing, when the Community is split.. <br>
    Forgetful of the main aim and carried beyond&nbsp; <br>
    They do not listen to the words of the wise. <br>
    I&#146;m scolded, beaten, defeated and carried away, <br>
    The hatred of those that bear such grudges are never appeased.&nbsp; <br>
    I&#146;m scolded, beaten, defeated and carried away, <br>
    The hatred of those that do not bear such grudges are appeased.&nbsp; <br>
    In this world hatred never ceases with hatred <br>
    With non hatred it ceases, this is the ancient lore. <br>
    Some do not know that we have to go from this world. <br>
    They that know it, appease their misapprehensions <br>
    Those that cut limbs, destroy life, carry away horses, cattle and wealth <br>
    And even ruin the country, they too turn round <br>
    Why shouldn&#146;t it happen to you? <br>
    If you gain a clever friend, a wise co-associate, <br>
    Overcoming all troubles, live with him mindfully. <br>
    If you do not gain a clever, wise co-associate, <br>
    Like the king that leaves behind his rulership and country <br>
    Go alone like an elephant to the Maatanga remote. <br>
    Living alone is superb, there should be no association with fools <br>
    Living alone, unconcerned no evil&#146;s done. <br>
    Like the elephant living in the Maatanga remote. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Blessed One while standing said these verses, and approached the village
  Baalakalonakaara. At that time venerable Bhagu livedin that village. Seeing the Blessed
  One approaching in the distance, venerable bhagu prepared a seat and placed water to wash
  the feet. The Blessed One sat on the prepared seat and washed his feet. Venerable Bhagu
  too worshipped the Blessed One and sat on a side. Then the Blessed One said,
  &#145;Bhikkhu, are you alright, do you have any fatigue owing to want of morsel
  food?&#146;&#145;Venerable sir, I&#146;m alright, I have no fatigue owing to lack of
  morsel food&#146; Then the Blessed One advised, instructed and made the heart of venerable
  Bhagu light with a talk on the Teaching and getting up from the seat approached the
  eastern royal park. </p>
  <p>At that time venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya and Kimbilawere abiding in the royal eastern
  park.The grove keeper saw the Blessed One coming in the distance and said. &#145;Recluse,
  do not enter this forest. There are three sons of clansmen abiding here seeking their own
  good, do not inconvenience them.&#146; Venerable Anuruddha heard this conversation between
  the grove keeper and the Blessed One and told the grove keeper. &#145;Do not obstruct the
  Blessed One, it is our Teacher, the Blessed One&#146;. Venerable Anuruddha addressed
  venerables Nandiya and Kimbila. &#145;Come! Venerable ones, our Teacher has arrived.&#146;
  Then Venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila approached the Blessed One, accepted bowl
  and robes from the Blessed One. One prepared a seat and another administered water to wash
  the feet. The Blessed One sat on the prepared seat and washed his feet. Those venerable
  ones worshipped the Blessed One and sat on a side. </p>
  <p>The Blessed One addressed venerable Anuruddha: &#145;Anuruddha, are you alright, do you
  have any fatigue owing to want of morsel food?&#146;&#145;Venerable sir, we are alright,
  we have no fatigue owing to lack of morsel food&#146;. &#145;Anuruddha, are you united and
  friendly without a dispute, like milk and water and do you abide seeing each other with
  friendly eyes?&#146; &#145;Venerable sir, we are united like milk and water, friendly,
  without a dispute and abide seeing each other with friendly eyes.&#146; &#145;Anuruddha,
  how do you abide united like milk and water, friendly, without a dispute seeing each other
  with friendly eyes?&#146; &#145;Venerable sir, this thought occurs to me It is gain for me
  that I live with such co-associates in the holy life. So I abide with bodily actions of
  loving kindness towards these venerable ones openly and secretly. With verbal actions of
  lovingkindnesstowards these venerable ones openly and secretly. With mental actions of
  loving kindness towards these venerable ones openly and secretly Sometimes it occurs to me
  what ifI discard my thoughts and concede to the thoughts of these venerable ones. So I
  discard my thoughts and concede to the thoughts of these venerable ones. Venerable sir, we
  are various in bodies, and one in mind.&#146; </p>
  <p>Venerable Nandiyaand venerable Kimbila too said to the Blessed One. &#145;Venerable
  sir, this thought occurs to me. It is gain for me, that I live with such co-associates in
  the holy life. So I abide, with bodily actions of loving kindness towards these venerable
  ones openly and secretly. With verbal actions of loving kindness openly and secretly. With
  mental actions of loving kindness openly and secretly Sometimes it occurs to me, what if I
  discard my thoughts and concede to the thoughts of these venerable ones. So I discard my
  thoughts and concede to the thoughts of these venerable ones. Venerable sir, we are
  various in bodies and single in mind... </p>
  <p>Venerable sir, in this manner we abide united like milk and water, friendly, without a
  dispute, seeing each other with friendly eyes. Good, Anuruddha, do you live diligently for
  dispelling? Venerable sir, indeed we abide diligently for dispelling. Anuruddha, how do
  you abide diligently for dispelling? Venerable sir, whoever comes from the village first,
  after collecting morsel food, prepares the seats administers water for drinking and
  washing and places the spittoons. Whoever comes last from the village, partakes of what is
  left over if he desires, if he does not, throws it to a place where nothing grows, or puts
  it into some water where there isnolife. He puts away the seats, andthe vessels of water,
  washes the spittoons and sweeps the refectory, Whoever seesthe water vessels for drinking,
  washing or toilets empty,fills them up. If he finds it not in his capacity to carry it,
  would call another with the wave of the hand. Would not utter a word on account of it. On
  every fifth day we would sit throughout the night discussing a topic on the Teaching.
  Venerable sir, thus we abide diligently for dispelling. Good, Anuruddha, you abide
  diligently for dispellingHave you attained some distinctive knowledge,a pleasant abiding
  above human?&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, when abiding diligent to dispel we perceived effulgence and
  beautiful forms. The effulgence and beautiful forms disappeared in no time and we did not
  understand that sign&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Anuruddha, that sign should be understood. Earlier when I was a seeker of
  enlightenment, I too perceived effulgence and beautiful forms, and they disappeared in no
  time. Then it occurred to me. Why did my effulgence and beautiful forms disappear? I knew,

  beautiful forms disappear? I knew, that too much aroused effort had arisen to me. On
  account of too much effort my concentration faded. When the concentration faded, the
  effulgence and beautiful forms disappeared. Like a man who holds a hand cart firmly with

  aroused little effort. On account of too little effort my concentration faded. When the

  and beautiful forms disappear? I knew, that various perceptions had arisen to me. On
  account of various perceptions my concentration faded. When the concentration faded, the
  effulgence and beautiful forms disappeared. I attended to it in such a manner, so that

  <p>When abiding diligent to dispel I perceived effulgence and beautiful forms. The
  effulgence and beautiful forms disappeared in no time Then it occurred to me. Why did my
  effulgence and beautiful forms disappear? I knew, that thinking too much about forms it
  hadhappened. On account of thinking too much about forms my concentration faded. When the
  concentration faded, the effulgence and beautiful forms disappeared. I attended to it in

  that thinking too much about forms is a minor defilement of the mind and dispelled
  it&nbsp; </p>
  <p>When I was abiding diligent to dispel, throughout the night, throughout the day and
  throughout the night and day,I perceived limited effulgence and saw limited forms. I
  perceived limitless effulgence and saw limitless forms It occurred to me. What is the
  reason, that .throughout the night, throughout the day and throughout the night and day,I
  perceive limited effulgence and see limited forms. I perceive limitless effulgence and see
  limitless forms? Anuruddha it occurred to me, when my concentration is limited, my
  knowledge is limited. With limited knowledge I perceive limited effulgence and see limited
  forms. When my concentration is limitless, my knowledge is limitless. With limitless
  knowledge I perceive limitless effulgences and see limitlessforms,throughout the night,
  throughout the day and throughout the night and day. </p>

  torpor, fear, jubilation, wickedness, too much aroused effort, too little effort, various
  perceptions, thinking too much about forms were dispelled, it occurred to me, now these
  minor defilements are dispelled and I should develop concentration in a threefold manner.
  Then I developped concentration with thoughts and discursive thoughts. Developped
  concentration without thoughts, thinking discursively. Developped concentration without
  thoughts and without discursive thoughtsDevelopped concentration with joy and without joy.
  Developped concentration which is equanimity. Then knowledge and vision arose and I knew
  that my release is unshakeable. This is my last birth. There is no more rebirth. </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said thus and venerable Anuruddha delighted in the words of the Blessed
  One. </p>
