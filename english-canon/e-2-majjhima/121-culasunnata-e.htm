  (121)-The shorter Discourse on Voidity</strong></font></p>
  <p>I heard thus. </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the Pubba monastery, the palace of Migaara&#146;s
  mother in Saavatthi. Venerabe Aananda, getting up from his seclusion in the evening,
  approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said thus. &#145;Venerable sir,
  once when the Blessed One was living with the Sakyas in the hamlet Naagaraka, I heard
  these acknowledged words from the Blessed One himself: &#147;Aananda, at present I abide
  much in voidity.&#148; How could I, hearing it, grasp it thoroughly bear it?&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Then Aananda, listen, hear, grasp thoroughly and bear it. Aananda, in the past as
  well as now, I abide much in voidity. Just as the palace of Migaara&#146;s mother is void
  of elephants, cattle, mares, raw gold, sovereign gold and assemblies of women and men and
  is not void of the community, on account of this there is a single perception. In the same
  manner the bhikkhu not attending to the perception of village or humans.attends to the
  single perception of remoteness. (*1) With the perception of remoteness, the mind springs,
  gets settled and is released. (*2) Whatever anxiety there&#146;s on account of the
  perception of village, is not evident here. Whatever anxiety there&#146;s on account of
  the perception of humans, is not evident here There is this anxiety of the perception of
  remoteness. He knows, this is void of the perception of village and the perception of
  humans. He knows it is not void of the perception of remoteness. Thus on account of
  whatever is not there, voidity is perceived, whatever remains is perceived as peaceful.
  Aananda, as it is enjoyed, thus comes about the unperverted, pure ascend to voidity. </p>
  <p>Again, Aananda, the bhikkhu not attending to the perception ofhumans or the perception
  of remoteness, attends to the single perception of earth.With the perception of earth the
  mind springs, gets settled and is released. Like the bull beaten with the goad, is no more
  in his own power In the same manner the bhikkhu disregarding the irregular features such
  as highlands, lowlands, river valleys and ridges attends to the single perception of
  earthTo him with the perception of earth the mind springs, gets settled and is released.
  He knows, whatever anxiety there&#146;s on account of the perception of humans and the
  perception of remoteness, they&#146;re not evident here.There is non voidity on account of
  the single perception of earth. Thus on account of whatever is not there, voidity is
  perceived, whatever remains is perceived as peaceful. Aananda, as it is enjoyed, thus
  comes about the unperverted, pure ascend to voidity. </p>
  <p>Again, Aananda, the bhikkhu not attending to the perception of remoteness or the
  perception of earth, attends to the single perception of the sphere of space.With the
  perception of the sphere of space the mind springs, gets settled and is released. He
  knows, whatever anxiety there&#146;s on account of the perception of remoteness and the
  perception of earth, they&#146;re not evident here.There is non voidity on account of the
  single perception of the sphere of space. Thus on account of whatever is not there,
  voidity is perceived, whatever remains is perceived as peaceful. Aananda, as it&#146;s
  enjoyed, thus comes about the unperverted, pure ascend to voidity. </p>
  <p>Again, Aananda, the bhikkhu not attending to the perception of earth or the perception
  of the sphere of space, attends to the single perception of the sphere of
  consciousness.With the perception of the sphere of consciousness the mind springs, gets
  settled and is released. He knows, whatever anxiety there&#146;s on account of the
  perception of earth and the perception of the sphere of space, they&#146;re not evident
  here.There is non voidity on account of the single perception of the sphere of
  consciousness.Thus on account of whatever is not there, voidity is perceived, whatever
  remains is perceived as peaceful. Aananda, as it&#146;s enjoyed, thus comes about the
  unperverted, pure ascend to voidity. </p>
  <p>Again, Aananda, the bhikkhu not attending to the perception of the sphere of space or
  the perception of the sphere of consciousness, attends to the single perception of the
  sphere of nothingness.With the perception of the sphere of nothingness the mind springs,
  gets settled and is released. He knows, whatever anxiety there&#146;s on account of the
  perception of the sphere of space and the perception of the sphere of consciousness, are
  not evident here.There is non voidity on account of the single perception of the sphere of
  nothingness.Thus on account of whatever is not there, voidity is perceived, whatever
  remains is perceived as peaceful. Aananda, as it&#146;s enjoyed, thus comes about the
  unperverted, pure ascend to voidity. </p>
  <p>Again, Aananda, the bhikkhu not attending to the perception of the sphere of
  consciousness or the perception of the sphere of nothingness, attends to the single
  perception on account of neither perception nor non perception With neither perception nor
  non perception the mind springs, gets settled and is released. He knows, whatever anxiety
  there&#146;s on account of the perception of the sphere of consciousness and the
  perception of the sphere of nothingness, they&#146;re not evident here.There is anxiety on
  account of the single perception of neither perception nor non perception.Thus on account
  of whatever is not there, voidity is perceived, whatever remains there, is perceived as
  peaceful. Aananda, as it is enjoyed, thus comes about the unperverted, pure ascend to
  voidity. </p>
  <p>Again, Aananda, the bhikkhu not attending to the perception of the sphere of
  nothingness or the perception of neither perception nor non perception, attends to the
  single signless concentration of the mind. With the signless concentration, the mind
  springs, gets settled and is released. He knows, whatever anxiety there&#146;s on account
  of the perception of the sphere of nothingness and the perception of the sphere of neither
  perception nor non perception they&#146;re not evident here.There is anxiety on account of
  life and the body of six mental spheres.Thus on account of whatever is not there, voidity
  is perceived, whatever remains there, is perceived as peaceful. Aananda, as it is enjoyed,
  thus comes about the unperverted, pure ascend to voidity. </p>
  <p>Again, Aananda, the bhikkhu not attending to the perception of the sphere of
  nothingness or the perception of neither perception nor non perception, attends to the
  single signless concentration of the mind. With the signless concentration, the mind
  springs, gets settled and is released. He knows, even this signless concentration is
  compounded and mentally thought out. Whatever is compounded and mentally thought out, is
  impermanent and it ceases.When he knows and sees this, his mind finds release, from
  sensual desires, from desires &#145;to be,&#146; and from ignorant desires. When released
  knowledge arises, I&#146;m released. Birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived, what
  should be done is done. He knows, there is nothing to wish. He knows, whatever anxiety
  there&#146;s on account of sensual desires, they&#146;re not evident.On account of desires
  &#145;to be&#146; they&#146;re not evident. On account of ignorant desires, they&#146;re
  not evident.There is anxiety on account of life and the body of six mental spheres. He
  knows this is void of sensual desires, void of desires &#145;to be&#146; and void of
  ignorant desires. There is non voidity on account of life and the body of six mental
  spheres Thus on account of whatever is not there, voidity is perceived whatever remains is
  perceived as peaceful. Aananda, as it is enjoyed, thus comes about the most noble
  unperverted, pure ascend to voidityAananda, whoever recluses or brahmins abode in voidity,
  they all abode in this most noble and pure voidity. Whoever recluses or brahmins will
  abide in voidity, they all will abide in this most noble and pure voidity.Whoever recluses
  or brahmins now abide in voidity, they all abide in this most noble and pure voidity.
  Therefore Aananda, you should train, we should abide in this most noble pure
  voidity.&#146; </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said thus and venerable Aananda delighted in the words of the Blessed
  One.&nbsp; </p>
