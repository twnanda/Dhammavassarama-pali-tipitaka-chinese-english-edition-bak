  <b>(98) To the Brahmin Vasettha.</b></font></p>
  <p>Thus I heard.</p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the forest of Icchaanakala near the
  villageIcchaanakala. At that time many well known brahmin householders lived in
  Icchaanakala, such as the brahmins Chanki, Taarukkha, Pokkharasaati, Jaanussoni,
  Todeyyaand other well known brahmin householders. </p>
  <p>To the two young brahmins Vaase.t.tha and Bhaaradvaaja while walking and wandering for
  exercise, this dispute arose. &#147; Friend, how does one become a brahmin&#148;. The
  young man Bhaaradvaaja said &#147;If some one is unsoiled and undisturbed, on both the
  mother&#146;s and father&#146;s side as far back as seven generations he becomes a
  brahmin. Young Vaase.t.tha said, &#147;If some one becomes virtuous and endowed with good
  conduct, he becomes a brahmin&#148;. Neither of them could convince the other on this
  dispute, and young Vaase.t.thasaid to the young man Bhaaradvaaja &#147;Friend,
  Bhaaradvaaja, there is the recluse Gotama the son of the Saakyas, gone forth from the
  Saakya clan, his fame is spread in this manner. He is worthy, all knowing, endowed with
  knowledge and conduct, well gone, knower of the worlds, incomparable tamer of those to be
  tamed, Teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed. Let us approach him and ask this
  question, and as he explains it, let us both accept it. Young Bhaaradvaaja agreed to the
  young man Vaase.t.tha&#146;s suggestion. Then the two young men approached the Blessed
  One, exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side and the young man Vaase.t.tha addressed
  the Blessed One in verses. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>594. The two of us accept and acknowledge that we are learned in the three Vedas, <br>
    I am a pupil of Pokkharasaati, and this young man of Taarukkha. </p>
    <p>595. We both can recite the three Vedas completely, <br>
    In explaining the meanings of words and grammar, we are like our teachers. </p>
    <p>596. O! Gotama, we have a dispute on birth,. Bhaaradvaaja says &#147;by birth a Brahmin
    ismade&#148; <br>
    And I say &#147;by actions a Brahmin is made.&#148; . </p>
    <p>597. Each of us could not convince the other <br>
    We came to ask about it from the well known all enlightned one </p>
    <p>598. When the moon has gone beyond waning, people encounter it with clasped hands, <br>
    Likewise Gotama is worshipped with clasped hands by the world. </p>
    <p>599. The world is enlightened, we ask Gotama, does one become a brahmin by birth or
    else by actions? <br>
    We do not know this, enlighten us so that we may know the brahmin.&#148; </p>
    <p>600. The Blessed One said: <br>
    &#147;Vase.t.tha I will tell you step by step how it happens, <br>
    The classification of living things in this and other births </p>
    <p>601. Look at the grass and trees, although they are not aware, <br>
    This and the other have attributes peculiar to their births </p>
    <p>602. So also insects, like grasshoppers and ants <br>
    They have attributes peculiar to their births.. </p>
    <p>603. Look at the animals small and large <br>
    They have attributes peculiar to their births. </p>
    <p>604.Look at the serpents with long backs going on their bellies, <br>
    They have attributes peculiar to their births. </p>
    <p>605. Look at the fish too, who find food in the water. <br>
    They have attributes peculiar to their births. </p>
    <p>606. Look at the birds flying through the air. <br>
    They have attributes peculiar to their births. </p>
    <p>607. Although these have various attributes, at birth, <br>
    In humans various attributes are not evident at birth. </p>
    <p>608. They are not in the hair, head, ears or eyes <br>
    Not in the mouth, nose, lips or eye-lashes </p>
    <p>609. Not in the neck, flanks stomach or back, <br>
    Not in the buttocks, chest, pudendum, nor in the sexual intercourse. </p>
    <p>610. Not in the hands, feet, fingers or nails, nor in the knees and calves, <br>
    Not in the hue or voice, by which to know their birth. </p>
    <p>611.In the individual bodies of humans, these are not evident, <br>
    They are designated by the activities of humans. </p>

    Vaase.t.tha, know him as a farmer, not as a brahmin. </p>

    Vaase.t.tha, know he is a robber, not a brahmin. </p>

    Vaase.t.tha, know he is a soldier, not a brahmin. </p>

    andcountry, <br>
    Vaasse.t.ths, know he is the king, not a brahmin. </p>
    <p>620. <![endif]>One born of a brahmin woman&#146;s womb is not a brahmin, <br>
    By address, he is sir, he has defilements, <br>
    When he has no defilements and no seizings, I call him a brahmin. </p>
    <p>621. When all bonds are cut, if one is not worried, <br>

    <p>625. Like water that does not stay on the lotus leaf, the mustard seed that slips from
    the tip of the arrow, <br>
    When not soiled in sensuality, I call him a brahmin. </p>

  <span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><p>When this was said the two young men Vaase.t.tha and
  Bhaaradvaaja said thus to the Blessed One: &#147;Now we know good Gotama. It seems as
  though something overturned is re-installed, something covered is made manifest, As though
  the path is told to someone who has lost his way. It seems as though an oil lamp is
  lighted for the darkness, for those who have eyes to see forms. In various ways good
  Gotama has explained the </p>
  <p>Teaching. Now I take refuge in good Gotama, in the Teaching and the Community of
  bhikkhus.. Good Gotama, remember us as disciples who have taken refuge from today until
  life lasts.&nbsp; </p>

    <p>1. Does not know the movements. <i>&#145;Gati.m na jaananti&#146;</i> This means that
    nobody knows what he thinks. In other words he does not think like a god, a heavenly
    musician or a human, so his thoughts or movements cannotbe traced. </p>
