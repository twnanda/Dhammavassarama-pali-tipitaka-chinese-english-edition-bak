  (131) A single Auspicious Attachment</strong></font></p>
  <p>I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika, in
  Jeta&#146;s grove in Saavatthi. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from
  there.&#146;Bhikkhus, I will teach you the short and detailed expsition of the single
  auspicious attachment, listen attending carefully. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Do not recollect the past, nor desire the future, <br>
    The past is over, the future has not come. <br>
    These things of the present, see them with insight as they arise (*1) <br>
    Not faltering and not moved, think about them. <br>
    Today itself the dispelling should be done <br>
    Tomorrow death might come <br>
    We will not have any associations with Death and his great army (*2) <br>
    You should abide dispelling thus, day and night zealously, <br>
    This is the single auspicious attachment, the appeased sage tells </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Bhikkhus, how do you recollect the past? You think interestedly, I was of such matter
  in the past. I was of such feelings in the past. I was of such perceptions in the past. I
  was of such determinations in the past. I was of such consciousness in the past. Bhikkhus,
  thus you recollect the past. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, how do you not recollect the past? You do not think interestedly, I was of
  such matter in the past. I was of such feelings in the past. I was of such perceptions in
  the past. I was of such determinations in the past. I was of such consciousness in the
  past. Bhikkhus, thus you do not recollect the past. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, how do you not desire the future? You do not desire interestedly, I should be
  of such matter in the future I should be of such feelings in the future I should be of
  such perceptions in the future I should be of such determinations in the future I should
  be of such consciousness in the future Bhikkhus, thus you do not desire the future. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, how do you falter with things of the present? Bhikkhus, the not learned
  ordinary man, who has not seen noble ones and Great Beings, not clever in their Teaching,
  and not trained in their Teaching reflects, matter in self, or a material self, or in self
  matter, or in matter self. Reflects feelings in self, or a feeling self, or in self
  feelings, or in feelings self. Reflects perceptions in self, or a perceiving self, or in
  self perceptions, or in perceptions self. Reflects determinations in self, or a
  determining self, or in self determinations or in determinations self. Reflects
  consciousness in self, or a conscious self, or in self consciousness, or in consciusness
  self. Bhikkhus, thus you falter with things of the present.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, how do you not falter with things of the present? Bhikkhus, the learned noble
  disciple, who has seen noble ones and Great Beings, clever in their Teaching, and trained
  in their Teaching does not reflect, matter in self, or a material self, or in self matter,
  or in matter self. Does not reflect feelings in self, or a feeling self, or in self
  feelings, or in feelings self. Does not reflect perceptions in self, or a perceiving self,
  or in self perceptions, or in perceptions self. Does not reflect determinations in self,
  or a determining self, or in self determinations or in determinations self. Does not
  reflect consciousness in self, or a conscious self, or in self consciousness, or in
  consciusness self. Bhikkhus, thus you do not falter with things of the present.&nbsp; </p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>Bhikkhus, if I said, I will teach the short and detailed exposition of the single
  auspicious attachment, it was said on account of this. </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One.
  </p>
  <p><b>Notes.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. These things of the present, see them with insight as they arise <em>&#145;Paccuppanna~n
    ca yo dhamma.m tattha tattha vipassati.&#146;</em> The things that constanatly arise in
    the present are matter, that is whatever matters at one or the other of the doors of
    mental contact, such as sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches and ideas. Then the
    feelings that arise on account of these sights etcetra and the perceptions and
    determinations and consciousesses that follow. These things have to be seen with right
    insight and the self view should be destroyed. </p>
    <p>2.We will not have any associations with Death and his great army <em>&#145;na hi no
    sa.mgaran tena mahaasenena maccunaa&#146; </em>The army of Death consists of all the
    defiling things that arise in the mind. They are sensuality, aversion, hunger, thirst,
    craving, sloth and tor por, fear, doubts, besmearing, stubornness. Gain, fame and honour
    obtained unrighteously, praising oneself and disparaging others. This is the army of
    Death. </p>
