  <p>I heard thus. </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived with the Sakyas in Nigrodha&#146;s monastery in
  Kapilavatthu. Then the Blessed One put on robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes
  entered Kapilavatthu for alms. After the meal was over and returning from the alms round
  entered the Great forest and sat at the root of a Beluwa shoot to spend the day. The Sakya
  Dandapaani too walking and wandering for exercise entered the Great forest, approached the
  Beluwa shoot where the Blessed One was seated, exchanged friendly greetings and getting to
  a side leaned on a stick and said thus: What view has the recluse and what does he
  teach.&quot; I have no dispute with anyone in this world of gods and men together with its
  Maaras, Brahmaas, the community of recluses and brahmins and I abide unyoked to
  sensuality, duties done, doubts dispelled and without the slightest perception , &#145;to
  be&#146; or &#145;not to be&#146; Friend, I am of this view and teach it&quot; </p>
  <p>When this was said the Sakya Dandapaani shook his head, pulled out his tongue, and
  showing three forks on his forehead went away leaning on his stick. </p>
  <p>Then the Blessed One getting up from his seclusion in the evening approached
  Nigrodha&#146;s monastery, sat on the prepared seat and addressed the
  bhikkhus.&quot;Bhikkhus, I put on robes in the morning, and taking bowl and robes entered
  Kapilavatthu for alms, after the meal was over and returning from the alms round entered
  the Great forest and sat at the root of a Beluwa shoot to spend the day. The Sakya
  Dandapaani too walking and wandering for excise entered the Great forest, approached the
  Beluwa shoot where I was seated, exchanged friendly greetings and getting to a side leaned
  on a stick and said thus: What view has the recluse and what does the recluse teach. Then
  I said, I have no dispute with anyone in this world, of gods and men together with its
  Maaras, Brahmaas, the community of recluses and brahmins and I abide unyoked to
  sensuality, duties done, doubts dispelled and without the slightest perception, &#145;to
  be&#146; and &#145;not to be&#146;. Friend, I am of this view and teach it.. When this was
  said the Sakya Dandapaani shook his head, pulled out his tongue and showing three forks on
  his forehead went away leaning on his stick. </p>
  <p>When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said thus Venerable sir, what is that view, to
  have no dispute with anyone in this world of gods and men, Maaras, Brahmaas, the community
  of recluses and brahmins.and gods and men. And how does the Blessed One abide unyoked from
  sensuality, duties done, doubts dispelled, and without the slightest perception &#145;to
  be&#146; and &#145;not to be&#146;. Bhikkhu, on whatever account there is behaviour in the
  diffusedness of the world, you should not be pleased, or welcome it and appropriate it ,
  then all demeritorious things that rise from the latent tendencies to greed, to averse, to
  hold views, to doubt, to measure, to greed to be, to ignore, to take sticks and weapons,
  to fight, to take sides, to dispute, to slander, to tell lies, all these cease
  remainderlessly. </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said this and getting up from the seat entered the monastery. Soon
  after the Blessed One had gone to the monastery it occured to those bhikkhus. Friends, the
  Blessed One pointed out the Teaching in short to us and entered the monastery &#145;On
  whatever account there is behaviour in the diffusedness of the world, you should not be
  pleased, or welcome it and appropriate it, then all demeritorious things that rise from
  latent tendencies to greed, to averse, to hold views, to doubt, to measure, to greed to
  be, to ignore, to take sticks and weapons, to fight, to take sides, to dispute, to
  slander, to tell lies, all these cease remainderlessly. Now who will explain the meaning
  of this short exposition. Then it occured to those bhikkhus, venerable Mahaakaccaana is
  praised as well developed and wise by the Teacher and also by the co-associates in the
  holy life. It is possible for venerable Mahaakaccaana to explain this short exposition in
  detail. The bhikkhus thought about this and approached venerable Mahaakaccaana. </p>
  <p>Then the bhikkhus approached venerable Mahaakaccaana exchanged friendly greetings sat
  on a side and said: Friend Mahaakaccana, the Blessed One pointed out this short exposition
  and without giving a detailed explanation entered the monastery- &#145;On whatever account
  there is behaviour in the diffusedness of the world, you should not be pleased, welcome it
  and approproiate it, then all demeritorious things that rise from the latent tendencies to
  greed, to averse, to hold views, to doubt, to measure, to greed to be, to ignore, to take
  sticks, and weapons, to fight, to take sides, to dispute, to slander and to tell lies,
  cease remainderlessly&#146;. Soon after the Blessed One had gone to the monastery it
  occured to us, venerable Mahaakaccaana is praised as well developed and wise by the
  Teacher and the co-associates in the holy life. It is possible for venerable Mahaakaccaana
  to explain this short exposition in detail. We ask the meaning of this short exposition,
  explain it to us venerable Mahaakaccaana. </p>
  <p>Friends, this is like a man wandering in search of heartwood, come to a standing huge
  tree ignoring the roots and the trunk, was to search the heartwood in the branches and the
  foliage. This act of the venerable ones, having come to the presence of the Teacher, not
  asking him would come to ask us, is something similar to that. That Blessed One knows what
  should be known, sees what should be seen, is the one with eyes,the one with wisdom, has
  become the Teaching, has become like brahmaa, practises what he preaches, has come to the
  essence and gives the deathless, is master of the Teaching, This is the time to ask its
  meaning from the Blessed One so that we could keep it in our minds. Indeed, venerable
  Kaccaana, the Blessed One knows what should be known, sees what should be seen, is the one
  with eyes, the one with wisdom, has become the Teaching, has become like brahmaa,
  practises what he preaches, has come to the essence and gives the deathless, is master of
  the Teaching. This is the time to ask its meaning from the Blessed One, so that we could
  keep it in our minds Yet venerable Mahaakaccaana is praised as well developed and wise by
  the Teacher and the co-associates in the holy life. It is possible for venerable
  Mahaakaccaana to explain this short exposition in detail. Venerabale Mahaakaccaana explain
  it if you do not mind. -Then friends, listen carefully, I will explain. </p>
  <p>Friends, that which the Blessed One explained in short and went to the monastery,
  &#145;On whatever account there is behaviour in the diffusedness of the world, you should
  not be pleased, or welcome it and approproiate it, then all demeritorious things that rise
  from the latent tendencies to greed, to averse, to hold views, to doubt, to measure, to
  greed to be, to ignore, to take sticks, and weapons, to fight, to take sides, to dispute,
  to slander and to tell lies, cease remainderlessly&#146;.I understand the detailed meaning
  of this short exposition as this: -Friends, on account of eye and forms arise eye
  consciousness. The coincident meeting of the three is contact, on account of contact
  feelings, what is felt is perceived, of what is perceived there is thinking, in thoughts
  there is diffusedness on account of that, diffused perceptive components of forms of the
  past, future and present cognizable by the eye consciousness arise and behave in that man.
  On account of the ear and sounds arise ear consciousness. The coincident meeting of the
  three is contact, on account of contact feelings, what is felt is perceived, of what is
  perceived there is thinking, in thoughts there is diffusedness, on acount of that,
  diffused perceptive components of sounds of the past, future and present cognizable by ear
  consciousness arise and behave in that man On account of the nose and smells arise nose
  consciousness. The coincident meeting of the three is contact, on account of contact
  feelings, what is felt is perceived , of what is perceived there is thinking, in thoughts
  there is diffusedness, on account of that, diffused perceptive components of smells of the
  past, future and present cognizable by nose consciousness arise and behave in that man. On
  account of tongue and tastes arise tongue consciousness. The coincident meeting ot the
  three is contact, on account of contact feelings, what is felt is perceived, of what is
  perceived there is thinking, in thoughts there is diffusedness on account of that diffused
  pereceptive components of tastes of the past, future and present cognizable by tongue
  consciousness arise and behave in that man. On account of body and touches arise body
  consciousness. The coincident meeting of the three is contact, on account of contact
  feelings, what is felt is perceived, of what is perceived, there is thinking, in thoughts
  there is diffusedness, on account of that diffused perceptive components of touches of the
  past, future and present cognizable by body consciousness arise and behave in that man. On
  account of mind and thoughts arise mind consciousness. The coincident meeting of the three
  is contact, on account of contact feelings, what is felt is perceived, of what is
  perceived there is thinking, in thoughts there is diffusedness,on account of the
  diffusedness, perceptive components of thoughts of the past, future and present cognizable
  by mind consciousness arise and behave in that man. </p>
  <p>Friends, when the eye is present, forms are present, eye consciousness is present, the
  notion of a contact is present is possible. When the notion of contact is present, a
  notion of feelings is present is possible, when there is a notion of feeling a notion of
  perception is possible, when there is a notion of perception a notion of thinking is
  possible, when there is a notion of thinking a notion of diffused perceptive components
  arising and behaving is possible, When the ear is pressent, sounds are present, and ear
  consciousness is present- when the nose is present, smells are present, and nose
  consciousness is present- when the tongue is present, tastes are present, and tongue
  consciousness is presesnt- when the body is present, touches are present and body
  consciousness is present, When the mind is present, thoughts are present, mind
  conscioussness is present, the notion of contact is present is possible. When the notion
  of contact is present, a notion of feelings is present is possible, when there is a notion
  of feeling a notion of perception is possible, when there is a notion of perception, a
  notion of thinking is possible, when there is a notion of thinking a notion of diffused
  perceptive components arising and behaving is possible.. </p>
  <p>Friends, when the eye is not present, forms are not present, eye consciousness is not
  present, the notion of a contact is not is possible. When the notion of contact is not
  present, a notion of feelings is not possible, when there is not a notion of feeling a
  notion of perception is not possible, when there is not a notion of perception a notion of
  thinking is not possible, when there is not a notion of thinking a notion of diffused
  perceptive components arising and behaving is not possible, When the ear is not pressent,
  sounds are not present, and ear consciousness is not present- when the nose is not
  present, smells are not present, and nose consciousness is not present- when the is tongue
  is not present, tastes are not present, and tongue consciousness is not presesnt- when the
  body is not present, touches are not present and body consciousness is not present- When
  the mind is not present, thoughts are not present, mind conscioussness is not present, the
  notion of contact is not possible. When the notion of contact is not present, a notion of
  feelings is not possible, when there is not a notion of feeling a notion of perception is
  not possible, when there is not a notion of perception, a notion of thinking is not
  possible, when there is not a notion of thinking a notion of diffused perceptive
  components arising and behaving is not possible. Friends, that which the Blessed One
  explained in short and went to the monastery, &#145;On whatever account there is behaviour
  in the diffusedness of the world, you should not be pleased, or welcome it and
  approproiate it, then all demeritorious things that rise from the latent tendencies to
  greed, to averse, to hold views, to doubt, to measure, to greed to be, to ignore, to take
  sticks, and weapons, to fight, to take sides, to dispute, to slander and to tell lies,
  cease remainderlessly&#146;.I understand the detailed meaning of this short exposition as
  this If you desire approach the Blessed One and ask him as he explains bear it in mind. </p>
  <p>Then those bhikkhus agreeing and delighting in the words of the Blessed One got up from
  their seats and approached the Blessed One worshipped and sat on a side and said Venerable
  sir, the Blessed One pointed out this exposition in short and without giving the.detailed
  explanation got up from the seat and entered the monastery &#145;On whatever account there
  is behaviour in the diffusedness of the world, you should not be pleased, or welcome it
  and approproiate it, then all demeritorious things that rise from the latent tendencies to
  greed, to averse, to hold views, to doubt, to measure, to greed to be, to ignore, to take
  sticks, and weapons, to fight, to take sides, to dispute, to slander and to tell lies,
  cease remainderlessly&#146; Venerable sir, soon after you left it occured to us, The
  Blessed One gave this short exposition and without giving the detailed explanation, got up
  from the seat and went into the monasatery. Who could give a detailed explanation to this
  short exposition. Then it occured to us: Venerable Mahaakaccaana is praised as well
  developed and wise by the Teacher and the co-associates of the holy life. It is possible
  for venerable Mahaakaccaana to explain this exposition in detail. So we approached
  venerable Mahaakaccaana and asked him to explain it to us. Venerable Mahaakaccaana
  explained it to us with these words and these phrases. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, Mahaakaccaana is wise, even if you had asked me, I would have explained it as
  Mahaakaccaaana had done it. That is its meaning, so bear it like that. </p>
  <p>When this was said venerable Aananda said thus to the Blessed One: Like a man hungry
  and weak who had got a honey comb in whatever manner he tasted it, would enjoy its unmixed
  taste in the same manner any clever bhikkhu would penetrate into the meaning of this
  exposition and he would gain joy and satisfaction of mind. Venerable sir, what is the
  meaning of this exposition. Aananda, bear this, as the exposition .of the honey comb. </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said this and venerable Aananda rejoiced in the words of the Blessed
  One. </p>
