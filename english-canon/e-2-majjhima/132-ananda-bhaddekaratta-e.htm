  (132) A single Auspicious Attachment to Venerable Aananda.</strong></font></p>
  <p>I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika in
  Jeta&#146;s grove in Saavatthi. At that time venerable Aananda was in the attendance hall,
  instructing, advising, and making the hearts light of the bhikkhus, with the short and
  detailed exposition of the single auspicious attachment. Then the Blessed One got up from
  his seclusion in the evening approached the attendance hall sat on the prepared seat and
  addressed the bhikkhus. &#145;Bhikkhus, who was instructing, advising, and making the
  hearts light of the bhikkhus in the attendance hall, with the short and detailed
  exposition of the single auspicious attachment?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, venerable Aananda,.was instructing, advising, and making the
  hearts light of the bhikkhus in the attendance hall, with the short and detailed
  exposition of the single auspicious attachment&#146; </p>
  <p>Then the Blessed One addressed venerable Aananda. &#145;Aananda, how did you instruct
  advise and make the hearts light of the bhikkhus in the attendance hall, with the short
  and detailed exposition of the single auspicious attachment?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, I instructed, advised and made the hearts light of the bhikkhus in
  the attendance hall, with the short and detailed exposition of the single auspicious
  attachment, in this manner. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Do not recollect the past, nor desire the future, <br>
    The past is over, the future has not come. <br>
    These things of the present, see them with insight as they arise <br>
    Not faltering and not moved, think about them. <br>
    Today itself the dispelling should be done <br>
    Tomorrow death might come <br>
    We will not have any associations with Death and his great army <br>
    You should abide dispelling thus, day and night zealously, <br>
    This is the single auspicious attachment, the appeased sage tells </p>
