  <b>11. A Minor Lion&#146;s Roar.</b> </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus. </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika in
  Jeta&#146;s grove in Saavatthi. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from there. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, it&#146;s only in this dispensation, that there is a recluse. A second
  recluse. A third recluse and a fourth recluse. Other faiths are devoid of recluses and
  devoid of the perfect. Thus the lion&#146;s roar could be rightfully roared. It might
  happen that adherants of other sects would ask with what conviction and what powers do the
  venerable ones say that here only there is a recluse, a second recluse, a third recluse
  and a fourth recluse. Other faiths are devoid of recluses and devoid of the perfect.
  Bhikkhus, to those adherants of other sects this is our reply. Friends, there are four
  things declared by that Blessed One, who knows and sees is worthy and rightfully
  enlightened we seeing those four things in ourselves say here only there is a recluse, a
  second recluse, a third recluse and a fourth recluse. Other faiths are devoid of recluses
  and the perfect. What four. Friends, we have faith in the Teacher, we have faith in the
  Teaching, we see the completion of our virtues and we have a pleasant and rightful
  relation between the gone forth and the householders. Seeing these in ourselves we say
  here only there is a recluse, a second recluse, a third recluse and a fourth recluse.
  Other faiths are devoid of recluses and the perfect. It might happen that the adherants of
  other sects would say, we too have faith , in our teacher, we too have faith in our
  teaching, we too have a completion in our virtues and we too have a pleasant and rightful
  relation between the gone forth and the housseholders. So what is the difference between
  your teaching and our teaching. To those adherants of other sects who say thus, this is
  our reply. Friends, is the ultimate end a single one or is it manifold. If those adherants
  of other sects reply rightfully, they would say the the ultimate end is a single one, not
  a manifold one. Friends, is that end with greed or without greed. If the adherants of
  other sects reply rightfully, they would say : The ultimate end is without greed. Friends,
  is that ultimate end with anger or without anger. If the adherants of other sects reply
  rightfully, they would say. The ultimate end is without anger. Friends, is that ultimate
  end with delusion or without ddelusion. If the adherants of other sects reply rightfully,
  they would say. The ultimate end is without delusion. Friends, is that ultimate end with
  holdings or without holdings. If the adherants of other sects reply rightfully, they would
  say. The ultimate end is without holdings. Friends, is that ultimate end for the wise or
  for the unwise. If the adherants of other sects reply rightfully, they would say. The
  ultimate end is for the wise. Friends, is that ultimate end for the not rough and not
  averse or for the rough and averse If the adherants of other sects reply rightfully, they
  would say. The ultimate end is for the not rough and not averse. Friends, is that ultimate
  end for those fond of the diffusedness of the world or for the detached from the
  diffusedness of the worald. If the adherants of other sects reply rightfully, they would
  say. The ultimate end is for the detached from the diffusedness of the world. </p>
  <p>Friends, views are twofold. The view &#145;to be&#146; and the view &#145;not to
  be&#146;. Those recluses and brahmins that cling to the view &#145;to be&#146; are
  overcome by that view are averse to the view &#145;not to be&#146;. Those recluses and
  brahmins that cling to the view &#145;not to be&#146; are overcome by that view are averse
  to the view &#145;to be&#146;. Recluse or brahmin who does not know the arising, fading,
  satisfaction, danger, and the escape from these two views as it really is , he is with
  greed, with anger, with delusion, with craving, with holdings, not wise, he is rough and
  averse, is attached to the diffusedness of the world . I say, that he is not released from
  birth, decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasaantness, displeasure and distress. I say, he
  is not released from unpleasantness. Recluse or brahmin who knows the arising, fading,
  satisfaction, danger, and the escape from these two views as it really is, he is without
  greed, without anger, without delusion, without craving, without holdings, wise, not rough
  and averse, not fond of the diffusedness of the world. I say, he is released from birth,
  decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress. I say, he is
  released from unpleasantness. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, fourfold are the holdings, What four. Holding to sensuality, holding to
  views, holding to virtues and holding to the self view. Bhikkhus, there are certain
  recluses and brahmins, who acknowledge they know all holdings but are unable to explain
  all holdings as they really are. They explain the holding to sensuality, but not the
  holding to views not the holding to virtues and not the holding to the self view. What is
  the reason: These good recluses and brahmins do not know three holdings as they really
  are. They explain the holding to sensuality not the holding to views, not the holding to
  virtues and not the holding to the self view. So these good recluses and brahmins who
  acknowledge they know all holdings do not explain all holdings rightfully. Bhikkhus, there
  are certain recluses and brahmins, who acknowledge they know all holdings but are unable
  to explain all holdings as they really are. They explain the holding to sensuality, and
  the holding to views, not the holding to virtues and not the holding to the self view.What
  is the reason. These good recluses and brahmins do not know two holdings as they really
  are,they explain the holding to sensuality and the holding to views, not the holding to
  virtues and not the holding to the self view. So these good recluses and brahmins who
  acknowledge they know all holdings do not explain all holdings rightfully. .Bhikkhus,
  there are certain recluses and brahmins, who acknowledge they know all holdings but are
  unable to explain all holdings as they really are. They explain the holding to sensuality
  the holding to views and the holding to virtues not the holding to the self view. What is
  the reason. These good recluses and brahmins do not know one holding as it really is, they
  explain the holding to sensuality, the holding to views, and the holding to virtues not
  the holding to the self view. So these good recluses and brahmins who acknowledge they
  know all holdlings do not explain all holdings rightfully Bhikkhus, in such a
  dispensation, the faith in the Teacher has not reached the highest point I say. The faith
  in the Teaching has not reached the highest point , I say. The completion of virtues has
  not reached the highest point., I say. And that rightful mutual understanding has not
  reached the highest point. What is the reason: Bhikkhus, it happens in a teaching not well
  proclaimed, not well explained, not leading beyond, not leading to appeasement, and taught
  by one not rightfully enlightened. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, the Thus Gone One worthy, rightfully enlightened, acknowledges the knowledge
  of all holdings and explains all holdings. Explain the holding to sensuality, the holding
  to views, the holding to virtues and the holding to the self view. Bhikkhus, in such a
  dispensation, the faith in the Teacher has reached the highest point. The faith in the
  Teaching has reached the highest point. The completion of virtues has reached the highest
  point. The rightful mutual understanding has reached the highest point. What is the
  reason. Bhikkhus, it happens in a well proclaimed teaching, in a well explained teaching,
  in a teaching leading beyond, in a teaching leading to appeasement, and when taught by one
  rightfully enlightened. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, these four holdings, from what do they originate, from what do they rise,
  from what do they come to birth, and with what do they develop. They originate from
  craving, rise from craving, come to birth from craving, and develop with craving.
  Bhikkhus, this craving, from what does it originate, from what does it rise, from what
  does it come to birth, and with what does it develop. Craving originates from feelings,
  rise from feelings, come to birth from feelings and develop with feelings. Bhikkhus, these
  feelings, from what do they originate, from what do they rise, from what do they come to
  birth, and with what do they develop. Feelings originate from contact, rise from contact,
  come to birth from contact, and develop with contact.Bhikkhus, this contact from what does
  it originate, from what does it rise, from what does it come to birth, and with what does
  it develop. Contact originates from the six spheres, rises from the six spheres, comes to
  birth from the six spheres and develops with the six spheres. Bhikkhus, these six spheres
  from what do they originate, from what do they rise, from what do they come to birth, and
  with what do they develop. The six spheres originate from name and matter, rise from name
  and matter, come to birth from name and matter and develop with name and matter. Bhikkhus,
  this name and matter, from what does it originate, from what does it rise, from what does
  it come to birth and with what does it develop. Name and matter originates from
  consciousness, rises from consciousness, comes to birth from consciousness and develops
  with consciousness. Bhikkhus, this consciousness, from what does it originate, from what
  does it rise, from what does it come to birth, with what does it develop. Consciousness
  originates from determinations, rises from determinations, comes to birth from
  determinations, and develops with determinations. Bhikkhus, these determinations, from
  what do they originate, from what do they rise, from what do they come to birth and with
  what do they develop. Determinations originate from ignorance, rise from ignorance, come
  to birth from ignorance and develop with ignorance. Bhikkhus, when ignorance dispelled and
  turned out science arises, he does not hold to sensuality, does not hold to views, does
  not hold to virtues, and does not hold to the self view. Not holding is not worried, not
  worried, he by himself is extinguished: birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived, what
  should be done is done, there is nothing more to wish. </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One.
