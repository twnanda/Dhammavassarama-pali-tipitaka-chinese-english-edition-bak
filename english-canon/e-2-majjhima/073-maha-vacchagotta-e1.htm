  <b>(73)The Major Discourse to Vacchagotta</b>. </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus. </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One was living in the squirrels&#146; sanctuary in the bamboo
  grove in Rajagaha. Then the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta approached the Blessed One,
  exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side and said, to the Blessed One.
  &#145;It&#146;s a long time since, we could have a conversation with good Gotama. We like
  to know merit and demerit in short.&#146; &#145;Vaccha, I will tell you merit and demerit
  in short and in detail as well. Now listen to it in short, I will tell you&#146;. The
  wandering ascetic Vacchagotta agreed and the Blessed One said thus: </p>
  <p>&#145;Vaccha, greed is demerit, non-greed is merit. Anger is demerit and non-anger is
  merit. Delusion is demerit and non-delusion is merit. Vaccha these three are demerit, and
  the other three are merit. Vaccha, destroying life is demerit, abstaining from destroying
  life is merit. Taking what is not given is demerit, abstaining from taking what is not
  given is merit. Misbehaviour in sexuality is demerit, abstaining from misbehaviour in
  sexuality is merit. Telling lies is demerit, abstaining from telling lies is merit.
  Slandering is demerit, abstaining from slandering is merit. Rough talk is demerit,
  abstaining from rough talk is merit. Frivolous talk is demerit and abstaining from
  frivolous talk is merit. Coveting is demerit, abstaining from coveting is merit. Bearing
  an angry mind is demerit and a not angry mind is merit. Wrong view is demerit and right
  view is merit.Vaccha, these ten are demerit and the other ten are merit. Vaccha, when the
  bhikkhu, dispels craving pulls it out with the roots, makes it a palm stump, and makes it
  a thing that does not grow again, that bhikkhu is perfect..He is with desires destroyed,
  the holy life lived, done what should be done, the weight put down He has come to the
  highest good, with the bond &#145;to be&#146; destroyed He rightfully knowing, is
  released.&#146;. </p>
  <p>&#145;Good, Gotama, wait! Is there a single bhikkhu a disciple of Gotama, who has
  destroyed desires, has released the mind from desires and released through wisdom,
  abiding, here and now?&#146; &#145;Vaccha, not one, not one hundred, not two hundred, not
  three hundred, not four hundred, not five hundred. There are many more bhikkhus, disciples
  of mine, who have destroyed desires, the mind released from desires and released through
  wisdom, here and now abiding.&#146; &#145;Good, Gotama, wait! Let alone bhikkhus. Is there
  a single bhikkhuni a disciple of Gotama, who has destroyed desires has released the mind
  from desires and released through wisdom, here and now, have realised?&#146; &#145;Vaccha,
  not one, not one hundred, not two hundred, not three hundred, not four hundred, not five
  hundred. There are many, more bhikkhunis, disciples of mine, who have destroyed desires,
  the mind released from desires and released through wisdom, here and now realising
  abide&#146;. &#145;Good, Gotama, wait! Other than bhikkhus, and bhikkhunis.Is there a
  single lay disciple of Gotama, who wearing white clothes had led the holy life, has
  destroyed the five lower bonds to the sensual world, and is born spontaneously, not to
  proceed?&#146; &#145;Vaccha, not one, not one hundred, not two hundred, not three hundred,
  not four hundred, not five hundred. There are many more lay disciples of mine, who have
  destroyed the five lower bonds to the sensual world, and born spontaneously would not
  proceed.&#146; &#145;Good, Gotama, wait! Other thanbhikkhus, bhikkhunis and lay disciples
  of Gotama, who wear white clothes and lead the holy life. Is there a single a lay
  disciple, who wears white clothes, leads the holy life, while partaking sensual pleasures,
  and doing the work in the dispensation has dispelled doubts. Has become confident of what
  should and should not be done, and does not need a teacher any more in the dispensation of
  the Teacher. Vaccha, not one, not one hundred, not two hundred, not three hundred, not
  four hundred, not five hundred. There are many more lay disciples of mine, wearing white
  clothes leadingthe holy life, while partaking sensual pleasures and doing the work in the
  dispensation have dispelled doubts Have become confident of what should and should not be
  done and do not need a teacher any more.&#146; &#145;Good, Gotama, wait! Other than the
  bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, the lay disciples who have arisen spontaneously and will not
  proceed, and the ones who have entered the stream of the Teaching and are confident,.is
  there a single female lay disciple of good Gotama. Who wears white clothes leads the holy
  life has destroyed the five lower bonds to the sensual world, and is born spontaneously
  not to proceed&#146; &#145;Vaccha, not one, not one hundred, not two hundred, not three
  hundred, not four hundred, not five hundred. There are many more female lay disciples of
  mine, who have destroyed the five lower bonds to the sensual world, and are born
  spontaneously not to proceed.&#146; &#145;Good, Gotama, wait! Other than the bhikkhus,
  bhikkhunis, lay disciples arisen spontaneously who would not proceed and the ones who have
  entered the stream of the Teaching and are confident and the lay female disciples who have
  arisen apontaneously not to proceed is there is a single female lay disciple. Who wears
  white clothes leads the holy life, while partaking sensual pleasures, anddoing the work in
  the dispensation has dispelled doubts, has become confident, of what should and should not
  be done and does not need a teacher any more.&#146;&#145;Vaccha, not one, not one hundred,
  not two hundred, not three hundred, not four hundred, not five hundred. There are many
  more female lay disciples of mine wearing white clothes lead the holy life, while
  partaking sensual pleasures, doing the work in the dispensation have dispelled doubts.
  Have become confident of what should and should not be done. They do not need a teacher
  any more in the dispensation of the Teacher. </p>
  <p>Good Gotama, if in this Dispensation good Gotama only was perfect and not the bhikkhus,
  by that factor this holy life is incomplete. Since good Gotama, as well the bhikkhus are
  perfcted, this holy life is complete. If in this Dispensation good Gotama andthe bhikkhus
  only were perfected and not the bhikkhunis by that this holy life is incomplete. Since
  good Gotama, the bhikkhus and the bhikkhunis are perfcted, this holy life is complete. If
  in this Teaching good Gotama, the bhikkhus and the bhikkhunis were perfected and not the
  lay disciples who wear white clothes and lead the holy life by that, this holy life is
  incomplete. Since good Gotama, the bhikkhus bhikkhunis and the lay disciples, who wear
  white clothes are also perfcted, this holy life is complete. If in this Dispensation good
  Gotama, the bhikkhus bhikkhunis and the lay disciples who wear white clothes and lead the
  holy lifewere perfected and not the lay disciples who wear white clothes and partake
  sensual pleasures by that,this holy life is incomplete. Since good Gotama, the bhikkhus,
  bhikkhunis and the lay disciples who wear white clothes and lead the holy life and also
  the lay disciples who wear white clothes and partake sensual pleasures are also perfcted,
  this holy life is complete. If in this Teaching good Gotama, the bhikkhus, bhikkhunis,the
  lay disciples who wear white clothes and lead the holy lifeand the lay disciples who wear
  white clothes and partake sensual pleasures, were perfected and not the lay disciples
  female who wear white clothes and lead the holy life by that factor this holy life is
  incomplete. Since good Gotama, the bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, lay disciples who wear white
  clothes and lead the holy life, lay disciple who wear white clothes and partake sensual
  pleasures and also the lay disciple female who wear white clothes and lead the holy life
  are also perfcted, this holy life is complete If in this Teaching good Gotama, the
  bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, lay disciples who wear white clothes and lead the holy life,and lay
  disciples who wear white clothes and partake sensual pleasures and the lay disciples
  female who wear white clothes and lead the holy life, and not the lay disciples who wear
  white clothes and partake sensual pleasures by that this holy life is incomplete. Since
  good Gotama, the bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, lay disciples who wear white clothes and lead the
  holy life, lay disciple who wear white clothes and partake sensual pleasures and lay
  disciple female who wear white clothes and lead the holy life, and also lay disciples
  female who partake sensual pleasures are perfcted, this holy life is complete. </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, like the Ganges, which bends towards the ocean, and flows straight
  into the ocean, likewise the gathering of good Gotama, those gone forth together with the
  householders are bent towards and stand close to extinction. Good Gotama, now I
  understand. It&#146;s like something over turned is reinstalled. As something covered is
  made manifest. As the path is told to someone who had lost his way. As though an oil lamp
  was lighted for the darkness, for those who have sight to see forms.Good Gotama, the
  Teaching is explained in various ways. Now I take refuge in good Gotama, in the Teaching
  and the Community of bhikkhus. May I gain the going forth and the higher ordination in the
  dispensastion of good Gotama.&#146;Vaccha, one of another sect desiring the going forth
  and the higher ordination in this dispensation, should wait four months, as a perid of
  probation. At the end of which time the bhikkhus pleased would give him the going forth
  and the higher ordination. It is to test the personal differences&#146;. &#145;Venerable
  sir, if one of another sect desiring the going forth and the higher ordination have to
  wait four months, on probation. I will be on probation for four years. When, the bhikkhus
  are pleased may they give me the going forth and the higher ordination. The wandering
  ascetic Vacchagotta received the going forth and the higher ordination. </p>
  <p>Two weeks after venerable Vacchagotta receivd the higher ordination, he approached the
  Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said to the Blessed One. &#145;Venerable sir, I
  have gained the knowledge of a trainer. May the Blessed One instruct me further.&#146;
  &#145;Then Vaccha, you should develop two things further.Develop calm and insight. Vaccha,
  when calm and insight is developed, it conduces to experiencing the various elements.. </p>
  <p>Vaccha, when you desire, experience the various super-normal powers. One, becoming many
  and many becoming one. Go unobstructd through walls, embankments and mountains, as going
  through air. Dive, in and come out of earth as in water. Walk, unbroken on water, as on
  earth. Sit with legs crossed, in space, as birds small and large do. Touch the moon and
  sun, as powerful as they are. Wield power with the body as far as the world of brahma.
  That will be the eye -witness for the development of that and other mental faculty. </p>
  <p>Vaccha, when you desire, with the heavenly ear element purified beyond human, hear the
  various sounds, heavenly and human, far or near, to you that mindfulness becomes the
  eye-witness in that mental faculty.. </p>
  <p>Vaccha, if you desire, penetrate and know the mental states of others. Know, the mind
  with greed and without greed, the angry mind and the not angry mind. the deluded mind and
  the non-deluded mind, the attentive mind and the distracted mind, the developed mind and
  the undeveloped mind, the mind with a compare and the mind without a compare, the
  concentrated mind, and the unconcentrated mind, the released mind, and the unreleased
  mind. To you that mindfulness becomes the eye-witness in that mental faculty. </p>
  <p>Vaccha, if you desire, recollect the various manifold previous births. Such as one
  birth, two births, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty births, a hundred
  births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, an innumerable forward cycle of
  births, an innumerable backward cycle of births and an innumerable forward and backward
  cycle of births. There I was of such name, clan, disposition, supports and experiencing
  these pleasant and unpleasant feelings and with such a life span. Disappearing from there
  was born here, with such name, clan, disposition, supports and experiencing, these
  pleasant and unpleasant feelings. With such a life span.. Disappearing from there is born
  here. Thus recollect the various manifold previous births that mindfulness, is the eye
  witness, in that mental faculty. </p>
  <p>Vaccha, if you so desire with the heavenly eye element purified beyond human, see
  beings disappearing and appearing unexalted and exalted, beautiful and ugly, in good and
  bad states. Know beings according their actions. These good beings, misbehaving by body,
  speech and mind, blaming noble ones, with wrong view and with the wrong view of actions,
  after death go to loss, go to decrease and are born in hell.These good beings, with right
  conduct by body, speech and mind, not blaming noble ones, with right view and with the
  right view of actions, after death go to increase and are born in heaven. Thus with the
  heavenly eye element purified beyond human see beings disappearing and appearing according
  their actions, and that mindfulness becomes the eye-witness to you in that mental faculty.
  </p>
  <p>Vaccha, if you so desire, with the destruction of desires, release the mind of desires,
  and be released through wisdom, realising it here and now. That mindfulness becomes eye
  witness, in that mental faculty. </p>
  <p>Then venerable Vacchagotta, delighted with the words of the Blessed One, got up from
  his seat, worshipped and circumambulated the Blessed One and went away.Venerable
  Vacchagotta secluded and withdrawn from the crowd abode diligent for dispelling. For
  whatever reason sons of clansmen leave the household rightfully and go forth as a homeless
  that incomparable end of the holy life he, here and now realised and abode. He knew, birth
  is destroyed, the holy life is lived, what should be done is done, there is nothing more
  to wish. Venerable Vacchagotta became one of the perfect ones.. </p>
  <p>At that time many bhikkhus were going to see the Blessed One, and venerable Vacchagotta
  saw those bhikkhus in the distance, approached them and said to them: &#145;Venerable
  ones, where are you going now?&#146;. &#145;Friend, we are going to see the Blessed
  One&#146;.&#146;If that is so, worship the feet of the Blessed One for me and tell
  &#150;&#145;Venerable sir, the bhikkhu Vacchagotta worships the feet of the Blessed One
  and says, I&#146;m a perfect.one&#146;. The bhikkhus agreed, approached the Blessed One,
  worshipped, sat on side and said. &#145;Venerable sir, venerable Vacchagotta says he
  worships the feet of the Blessed One and says that he is perfected&#146; &#145;Bhikkhus,
  even before, I knew that venerable Vacchagotta is perfect, I knew it by penetrating his
  mind. Bhikkhus, he is very powerful, knows the three knowledges. Even the gods informed me
  about this&#146;. </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said this and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One.
