  <p>I heard thus. </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anathapindika in
  Jeta&#146;s grove in Savatthi. Then the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta approached the
  Blessed One exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side and said to the Blessed One. </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, the world is eternal this only is the truth and all else is false.
  Does good Gotama hold this view?&#146; &#145;No, Vaccha, I&#146;m not of that view, the
  world is eternal, this only is the truth all else is false&#146;. &#145;Good Gotama, the
  world is not eternal, this only is the truth and all else is false Does good Gotama hold
  this view?&#146; &#145;No, Vaccha, I&#146;m not of that view, the world is not eternal,
  this only is the truth all else is false&#146;. &#145;Good Gotama, the world is limited,
  this only is the truth and all else is false. Does good Gotama hold this view?&#146;
  &#145;No, Vaccha, I&#146;m not of that view, the world is limited, this only is the truth
  all else is false.&#146; &#145;Good Gotama, the world is not-limited, this only is the
  truth and all else is false. Does good Gotama hold this view?&#146; &#145;No, Vaccha,
  I&#146;m not of that view, the world is not limited, this only is the truth all else is
  false&#146;.&#146;Good Gotama, the soul is the body, this only is the truth and all else
  is false. Does good Gotama hold this view?&#146; &#145;No, Vaccha, I&#146;m not of that
  view, the soul is the body, this only is the truth all else is false.&#146; &#145;Good
  Gotama, the soul is different from the body, this only is the truth and all else is false.
  Does good Gotama hold this view?&#146; &#145;No, Vaccha, I&#146;m not of that view, the
  soul is different from the body, this only is the truth all else is false.&#146;
  &#145;Good Gotama, the Thus Gone One is after death- this only is the truth all else is
  false. Does good Gotama hold this view?&#146; &#145;No, Vaccha, I&#146;m not of that view,
  the Thus Gone One is after death, this only is the truth all else is false.&#146;
  &#145;Good Gotama, the Thus Gone One is not after death, this only is the truth and all
  else is false. Does good Gotama hold this view?&#146; &#145;No, Vaccha, I&#146;m not of
  that view, the Thus Gone One is not after death, this only is the truth all else is
  false.&#146;&#146;Good Gotama, the Thus Gone One is, and is not, after death, this only is
  the truth, all else is false. Does good Gotama hold this view.&#146; &#145;No, Vaccha,
  I&#146;m not of that view, the Thus Gone One is, and is not after death, this only is the
  truth all else is false.&#146; &#145;Good Gotama, the Thus Gone One neither is, nor is not
  after death, this only is the truth and all else is false. Does good Gotama hold this
  view?&#146; &#145;No, Vaccha, I&#146;m not of that view, the Thus Gone One neither is, nor
  is not after death, this only is the truth all else is false.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, when asked, is good Gotama of the view, the world is eternal, this
  only is the truth, all else is false, it was said you were not of that view. When asked,
  is good Gotama of the view, the world is not eternal, this only is the truth, all else is
  false, it was said, you were not of that view. When asked, is good Gotama of the view, the
  world is limited, this only is the truth, all else is false, it was said you were not of
  that view. When asked, is good Gotama of the view, the world is not limited, this only is
  the truth, all else is false, it was said you were not of that view. When asked, is good
  Gotama of the view, the Thus Gone One is and is not after death, this only is the truth,
  all else is false, it was said you were not of that view. When asked, is good Gotama of
  the view, the Thus Gone One neither is, nor is not after death, this only is the truth,
  all else is false, it was said you were not of that view. Good Gotama, seeing what danger
  has thrown out all these views?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Vaccha, the view, the world is eternal, is a bond of views, is a speculation in
  views, it is with unpleasantness, with trouble, with burning, not leading to giving up, to
  detachment, to appeasement, to knowledge, to enlightenment, to cessation and to
  extinction. The view the world is not eternal,--re - The world is limited,-re- the world
  is not limited ..re..the soul is the body..re..the soul is different from the body, ..re..
  the Thus Gone One is, after death, ..re..the Thus Gone One is not, after death,-re -the
  Thus Gone One is and is not after death&#133;re.. the Thus Gone One neither is, nor is not
  after death is a bond of views, is a speculation in views, it is with unpleasantness, with
  trouble, with burning, not leading to giving up, to detachment, to appesement, to
  knowledge, to enlightenment, to cessation and to extinction.Vaccha, seeing these dangers I
  have thrown out all these views.&#146;. &#145;Does good Gotama hold any other view?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Vaccha, The Thus Gone One has overcome views. This is the view of the Thus Gone
  One. This is matter, this is the arising of matter, and this is the fading of matter. This
  is feeling, this is the arising of feelings and this is the fading of feelings. This is
  perception, this is the arising of perceptions and this is the fading of perceptions.
  These are determinations, this is the arising of determinations and this, the fading of
  determinations. This is consciousness, this is the arising of consciousness and this is
  fading of consciousness. Therefore, I say the Thus Gone One has destroyed, is detached,
  has given up and is released, from all imaginings, recollections, and all latent
  tendencies of me and mine.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, where is the thus released mind born?&#146;&#146;Vaccha, is born
  does not apply&#146;&#146;Then good Gotama, is he not born?&#146;&#146;Vaccha, is not born
  does not apply.&#146; &#145;Gotama, is he born and not born?&#146;&#146;Vaccha, is born
  and is not born does not apply.&#146;&#146;Then Gotama, is he neither born, nor not
  born?&#146;&#146;Vaccha, is neither born, nor is not born, is notapplicable..&#146;. </p>
  <p>&#145;When asked where is the thus released mind born, it was said, is born does not
  apply. When asked is it not born, it was said not born does not apply. When asked is it
  born and not born, it was said, born and not born does not apply. When asked, is it
  neither born, nor is not born, it was said neither born nor not born, does not apply. Good
  Gotama, in this I am completely ignorant and deluded. Whatever little understanding I had
  with the earlier conversation, has now vanished.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Vaccha, your ignorance and delusion is nothing strange. This is deep, difficult
  to understand peaceful and exalted, not for logical thinking. Is clever and shoud be
  experienced by the wise. By one of another sect like you, with some other liking, without
  being yoked in it and living in it, it cannot be understood. So then Vaccha, I will
  question you, on this and you may reply as it pleases you. There is a fire burning in
  front of you, would you know, there is a fire burning in front of me?&#146; &#145;Good
  Gotama, if a fire burns in front of me, I would know, there&#146;s a fire burning in front
  of me.&#146; &#145;Vaccha, if you were asked, this fire burning in front of you, on
  account of what is it burning, how would you reply?&#146;&#146;Good Gotama, if I was
  asked, this fire burning in front of you, on account of what is it burning, I would reply,
  this fire burning in front of me is burning on account of grass and sticks.&#146;
  &#145;Vaccha, if the fire in front of you extinguishes, would you know, this fire in front
  of me has extinguished?&#146;&#146;Good Gotama, if the fire in front of me extinguishes, I
  would know, this fire has extinguished&#146;&#146;Vaccha, if you were asked, this fire
  that has extinguished in which direction did it go, to the east, west, north or
  south?&#146; &#145;Good, Gotama, it does not apply. That fire burnt on account of grass
  and sticks, those supports finished, no other supports were supplied, without supports the
  fire, went out.&#146;. </p>
  <p>&#145;Vaccha, in that same manner, the matter with which the Thus Gone One is pointed
  out, is dispelled, uprooted, made a palm stump, made a thing not to grow again: Vaccha,
  the Thus Gone One is released from the reckonings of matter. It is deep, difficult to
  fathom, like the great ocean. Is born, does not apply, is not born does not apply. Is born
  and is not born does not apply, neither is born, nor is not born does not apply. The
  feelings, with which the Thus Gone One is pointed, are dispelled, uprooted, made palm
  stumps made things not to grow again: Vaccha, the Thus Gone One is released from the
  reckonings of feelings. It is deep, difficult to fathom, like the great ocean. Is born
  does not apply, is not born does not apply. Is born and is not born does not apply.
  Neither is born nor is not born does not apply. The perceptions, with which the Thus Gone
  One is pointed are dispelled, uprooted, made palm stumps, made things not to grow again.
  Vaccha, the Thus Gone One is released from the reckonings of perceptions. It is deep,
  difficult to fathom, like the great ocean. Is born does not apply, is not born does not
  apply, is born and is not born does not apply. Neither is born nor is not born does not
  apply. The determinations with which the Thus Gone One is pointed out, are dispelled,
  uprooted, made palm stumps, made things not to grow again: Vaccha, the Thus Gone One is
  released from the reckonings of deterninations. It is deep, difficult to fathom like the
  great ocean. Is born does not apply, is not born does not apply Is born and is not born
  does not apply. Neither is born nor is not born does not apply. The consciousness with
  which the Thus Gone One is pointed out, is dispelled, uprooted, made a palm stump, made a
  thing not to grow again. Vaccha, the Thus Gone One is released from the reckonings of
  consciousness. It is deep, difficult to fathom like the great ocean. Is born does not
  apply, is not born does not apply. Is born and is not born does not apply. Neither is born
  nor is not born does not apply.&#146; </p>
  <p>When this was said the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta said thus to the Blessed One,
  close to the village or hamlet, there is a huge Sala tree, because of impermanence, its
  leaves, branches, bark, shoots and sapwood fall off and is left with only the heartwood.
  In the same manner, on account of the words of good Gotama, with myleaves and branches
  pulled out, shoots pulled out, the bark removed, the sap removed, I stand as the pure
  heartwood. I understand good Gotama, it is as though something over turned is reinstalled,
  something covered is made manifest. As though the path is shown to someone who had lost
  his way. As though an oil lamp is lighted, for those who have sight to see forms in the
  dark. Now, I take refuge in good Gotama, in the Teaching, in the Community of bhikkhus.
  May the Blessed One bear me as a lay disciple who has taken refuge from today until life
  lasts. </p>
