  <b>(62) Advice to Venerable Rahula - The Longer Discourse.</b> </font> </p>
  <p>I heard thus. </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by anathapindika in
  Jeta&#146;s grove in Savatthi. Then the Blessed One put on robes in the morning and taking
  bowl and robes entered Savatthi for alms. Venerable Rahula too putting on robes, taking
  bowl and robes followed the Blessed One close behind. Then the Blessed One looked back and
  addressed venerable Rahula: &#145;Rahula, whatever matter, in the past, in the future or
  at present, internal or external, coarse or fine, un exalted or exalted, far or near, all
  matter is not mine, that is not me, that is not my self. This has to be seen as it really
  is with right wisdom&#146;. &#145;Blessed One, is it only matter?&#146; &#145;Rahula,
  feelings also, perceptions also, determinations and consciousness too.&#146; </p>
  <p>Then it occurred to venerable Rahula, advised by the Blessed One. What is the use of
  going for alms today? Venerable Rahula, stopped short, and sat with legs crossed at the
  root of a certain tree. The body straight and mindfulness established in front. Venerable
  Sariputta saw venerable Rahula seated cross, legged at the root of a certain tree, the
  body straight and mindfulness established in front of him. He said,&#145;Rahula, develop
  in breathing and out breathing. When, in- and out breathing is developed and made much, it
  brings good results and benefits. In the evening, venerable Rahula got up from his
  seclusion, approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said, &#145;Venerable
  sir developed and made much in which ways do in-breaths and out-breaths bring good results
  and benefits? (* 1) </p>
  <p>Rahula, all that&#146;s in this body.That are hard and rough and thought are yours.Such

  earth element. This internal earth element and the external earth element, all that goes
  as the earth element. </p>
  <p>All this, is not mine, that is not I, it is not my self. This has to be seen as it
  really is, with right wisdom. Seeing it as it really is, the mind should be detached from
  the earth element, and the interest should be cut. </p>
  <p>Rahula, what is the water element: There is internal water element and external water
  element. Raahula, what is the internal water element? All that&#146;s in this body that is
  watery and thought is yours such as bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, oil of the skin,
  tears, fat, saliva, snot, oil of the joints and urine, or anything else. That is internal,

  element. </p>
  <p>All this is not mine, that is not I, that is not, my self. This has to be seen as it

  <p>That is not mine, that is not I and that is not my self. This has to be seen as it
  really is, with right wisdom. Seeing this, as it really is, the mind should be detached
  from the air element, and the interest should be cut. </p>
  <p>Rahula, what is the element of space? There is internal and external space element.
  What is internal space? All internal space such as the spaces in the, ear holes, nostrils,
  mouth, where the food tasted, drunk, enjoyed, is accepted and stored and through which it
  comes out is called internal space. This internal and external, space element goes as the
  element of space. That is not mine, that is not I, that is not my self. This has to be
  seen as it really is, with right wisdom. Seeing it as it really is, the mind should be
  detached from the space element to cut all interests. </p>
  <p>Rahula, develop a mind similar to earth, when you develop a mind similar to earth
  arisen contacts of like and dislike do not take hold of your mind and stay. Rahula on the
  earth is dumped, the pure and the impure, excreta, urine, saliva, pus, blood, the earth
  does not loathe those, in the same manner develop a mind similar to earth. When you
  develop a mind similar to earth, arisen contacts of like and dislike do not take hold of

  hold of the mind and stay. </p>
  <p>Rahula, develop a mind similar to fire, when you develop a mind similar to fire arisen
  contacts of like and dislike do not take hold of your mind and stay. Rahula, fire burns

  made much there are good results and many benefits. Developed and made much in which
  manner does mindfulness of in-breaths and out-breaths bring good results and many
  benefits? Here, Rahula, the bhikkhu gone to the the forest, or to the root of a tree, or
  to an empty house, sits cross legged, with the body erect, and the mind established in
  front of him. He breathes in and out mindfully. Breathing in long knows, I breathe in

  <p>The Blessed One said thus and venerable Rahula rejoiced in the words of the Blessed

  <p><b>Notes:</b> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. In and out breathing developed and made much, in which way brings good results and
    benefits.<em>&#146;kata.m bhaavitaanu kho bhante aanaapaanasati kata.m bahuliikataa
    mahapphalaa hoti mahaanisansaa</em>' In this suttathe Blessed One explains to venerable
    Raahula, how in and out breathing could be developed until extinction. The gradual
    training is explained step by step. Venerable Raahula would have attained extinction at
    the end of the Sutta. </p>
    <p>2. He trains, I breathe in and out appeasing the bodily determination &#145;<i>passambhaya.m
    kaayasankhaara.m assasissaamiiti sikkhati passambhaya.m kaayasankhaara.m passasissaamiiti
    sikkhati&#146;</i> Bodily determination is in and out breaths. It is appeased and pasified
    while one is mindful of the breaths. </p>
    <p>3. He trains I breathe in experiencing the mental determination. I breathe out
    experiencing the mental determination.&#146;<i>cittasankhaara pa.tisanvedi assasissaamiiti
    sikkhati cittasankhaara patisanvedii passasissaamiiti sikkhati</i>&#146; Mental
    determinations are feelings and perceptions. The bhikkhu breathes in and out mindfully and
    becomes aware of his feelings and perceptions, while doing so. </p>
    <p>4. He trains I breathe in calming the mental determination, breathe out calming the
    mental determination &#145;<i>passambhaya.m cittasankhaara.massasissaamiiti sikkhati
    passambhayam cittasankhaara.m passasissaamiiti sikkhati</i>&#146;Calming the mental
    determination is appeasingthe feelings and perceptions that arise when mindful of the in
    and out breaths. </p>
    <p>5. He breathes in experiencing the mental state. Breathes out experiencing the mental
    state.&#146;<i>cittapa.tisanvedii assasissaamiiti sikkhati cittapa.tisanvedii
    passasissaamiiti sikkhaati</i>&#146; Here the bhikkhu becomes aware of the mental
    statewhile he is mindful of his in breaths and out breaths. The mental state is whether
    the mind is with anger or without anger, with greed or without greed, etc. </p>
    <p>6. He trains, I breathe in with a released mind, I breathe out with a released
    mind.&#146;<i>vimocaya.m citta.m assasissaamiiti sikkhati vimocaya.m cittam
    passasissaamiiti sikkhati.</i>&#146; This means that when the mind is released, the in and
    out breaths too become appeased and light.</p>
    <p>7. When mindfulness of in breaths and out breaths are developed and made much in this
    manner, even the last breath leaves with your knowledge.&#146;<i>eva.m bhaavitaaya kho
    Raahula aanaapaanasatiyaa eva.m bahulikataaya yepi te carimakaa assaasapassaasaa te; pi
    viditaava nirujjhanti no aviditaati</i>.When mindfulness of in and out breathing is
    developed in this manner, he becomes mindful of even his last breath, at death. </p>
