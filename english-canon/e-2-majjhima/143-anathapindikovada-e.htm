  <p>I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived in Anathapindika&#146;s monastery in Jeta&#146;s
  grove in Savatthi. The householder Anathapindika was seriously ill and suffering badly at
  that time. He addressed a certain man and said. &#145;Good man approach the Blessed One,
  worship the Blessed One for my sake with your head at his feet, and tell. &quot;Venerable
  sir, the householder Anathapindika is seriously ill. Also approach venerable Sariputta
  worship venerable Sariputta for my sake with your head at his feet and tell. Venerable
  sir, the householder Anathapindika is seriously ill, it is good if venerable Sariputta
  would approach the householder Anathapindika&#146;s house out of compassion.&quot; </p>
  <p>That man agreeing, approached the Blessed One, worshipped the Blessed One, sat on a
  side and said. &quot;Venerable sir, the householder Anathapindika is seriously ill and he
  worships the Blessed One with his head at the feet of the Blessed One. Then he approached
  venerable Saariputta, worshipped him, sat on a side and said. &quot;Venerable sir, the
  householder Anathapindika is seriously ill, he worships venerable Saaariputta with his
  head at the feet of venerable Sariputta and also says, it is good if venerable Sariputta
  would approach the householder Anathapindika&#146;s house out of compassion.&quot; </p>
  <p>Venerable Sariputta accepted the message silently, put on his robes and taking bowl and
  robes, and accompanied by venerable Ananda as the second recluse, approached the house of
  Anathapindika. Sitting on the prepared seats venerable Sariputta said. &#145;Householder,
  how are you feeling? Would you survive? Are the unpleasant feelings decreasing or
  increasing? Do the feelings show the increasing end or the decreasing end? </p>
  <p>Good sir, Sariputta, I do not feel well, will not survive. My unpleasant feelings are
  severe and increasing, not decreasing. The unpleasant feelings are increasing until the
  end. Good sir, Sariputta, my top hurts a lot. I feel as though a strong man was giving me
  a headdress with a strong cloth. I do not feel well and will not survive. My unpleasant
  feelings are severe and increasing, not decreasing. The unpleasant feelings are increasing
  until the end. Good sir, Sariputta, my belly hurts a lot as though a lot of air was
  turning about in my belly. I feel as though a clever butcher or his apprentice was carving
  my belly with a sharp butcher&#146;s knife I do not feel well and will not survive. My
  unpleasant feelings are severe and increasing, not decreasing. The unpleasant feelings are
  increasing until the end. Good sir, Sariputta, there is a lot burning in my body. I feel
  as though two strong men taking me by my hands and feet are pulling me to a pit of burning
  embers and are scorching and burning me. I do not feel well and will not survive. My
  unpleasant feelings are severe and increasing, not decreasing. The unpleasant feelings are
  increasing until the end. </p>

  thoughts of the other world.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Therefore householder, you should train, I will not cling to anything seen, heard,
  known through the scents or pursued discursively thinking. </p>
  <p>Hearing this the householder Anathapindika cried loudly and tears streamed down. Then
  venerable Ananda asked &#145;Householder, do you stick fast or sink?&#146; (*1) </p>
  <p>&#145;Good sir Ananda, not that I stick fast or sink. Yet, I have associated the
  Teacher and bhikkhus who develop the mind, but have not heard such a discourse before
  this.&#146; </p>
  <p>Then venerable Sariputta said. &#145;Householder, a discourse like this is not given to
  a lay person wearing white clothes.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good sir, Sariputta, discourses like this should be given to lay persons wearing
  white clothes. There are clansmen, with few defiling things who deteriorate owing not
  hearing this sort of discourse. Hearing these they would know the Teaching.&#146; </p>
  <p>Then, venerable Sariputta and venerable Ananda having advised the householder
  Anathapindika got up from their seats and went away. Soon after they had gone the
  householder Anathapindika died and was born with the happy ones. (*2) Then Anathapindika,
  the son of gods, when the night was waning, illuminating Jeta&#146;s grove completely with
  a resplendent light, approached the Blessed One, worshipped and stood on a side and said
  to the Blessed One. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&#145;This pleasant Jeta&#146;s grove the home of sages in the Community <br>
    Adorned by the king of the Teaching arouses delight in me. <br>
    Beings that have death are purified by actions, knowledge <br>
    And a righteous, virtuous livelihood, but not by clan or wealth. <br>
    Therefore a wise one, seeing his own good, <br>
    Discriminating the Teaching, purifies himself <br>
    Of the bhikkhus, crossed over, the ones like Sariputta, <br>
    In wisdom, virtues and appeasement are the foremost.&#146; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Saying this, Anathapindika, the son of the gods waited for the Blessed One&#146;s
  approval. Knowing the Teacher approves my words, worshipped the Blessed One and went round
  him with his right towards the Teacher and disappeared from there. Next day the Blessed
  One, addressed the bhikkhus. &#145;Bhikkhus, a certain son of the gods when the night was
  waning, illuminating Jeta&#146;s grove completely with a resplendent light, approached me
  worshipped and stood on a side and said. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&#145;This pleasant Jeta&#146;s grove the home of sages in the Community <br>
    Adorned by the king of the Teaching arouses delight in me. <br>
    Beings that have death are purified by actions, knowledge <br>
    And a righteous, virtuous livelihood, but not by clan or wealth. <br>
    Therefore a wise one, seeing his own good, <br>
    Discriminating the Teaching, purifies himself <br>
    Of the bhikkhus, crossed over, the ones like Sariputta, <br>
    In wisdom, virtues and appeasement are the foremost.&#146; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Saying this, that son of the gods waited for my approval. Knowing that I approved his
  words, worshipped and went round me with his right towards me and disappeared from there. </p>
  <p>Hearing this venerable Ananda said. &#145;Venerable sir, is that Anathapindika, the son
  of the gods? The householder, Anathapindika was made happy by venerable Sariputta.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good! Ananda, you are right. You have attained that much, which could be attained
  through reasoning. </p>
  <p>He is no other, but Anathapindika the son of the gods&#146;. </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said thus and venerable Ananda delighted in the words of the Blessed
  One. </p>
  <p><b>Notes.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Householder, do you stick fast or sink.&#146;<em>oliiyasi kho tva.m, gahapati,
    sa.msiidasi kho tva.m gahapati&#146;</em> To stick fast is to crave for this world and to
    sink is to give up hopes. If either of these happened it is loss for the householder.
    Neither of them happened. </p>
    <p>2. The happy ones.&#146;<em>tusita.m kaaya.m</em>&#146; This is a group of gods who are
    always happy. </p>
