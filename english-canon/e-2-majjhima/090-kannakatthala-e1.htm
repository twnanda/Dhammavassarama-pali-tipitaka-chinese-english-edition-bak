  <strong>(90) At Kannakattala</strong></font></p>
  <p><br>
  I heard thus. </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the Ka.n.nakatthala deer park in Uju~n~naaya. At
  that time, king Pasenadi of Kosala had come to Uju~n~naaya for some purpose. Then the king
  called a certain man, and said. &#145;Come good man, approach, and worship the Blessed
  One, for my sake and ask whether he has few ailments, no troubles and a light living. Also
  tell, king Pasenadi of Kosala will come to see the Blessed One after the mid-day
  meal.&#146; This man agreed, approached, worshipped the Blessed One, and sat on a side.
  Then he said, &#145;Venerable sir, king Pasenadi of Kosala worships, with his head at the
  feet of the Blessed One, and inquires whether the Blessed One is with few ailments,
  without troubles and has a light living. Today king Pasenadi of Kosala will come to see
  the Blessed One after the mid-day meal.&#146; </p>
  <p>The two sisters Soma and Sakulaa heard that the king would go to see the Blessed One
  after his mid-day meal, and they approached him at the time he was taking his meal. They
  said to the king, &#145;Great king, if that is so, worship the feet of the Blessed One for
  the sake of Soma and Sakula and inquire whether the Blessed One is with few ailments,
  without troubles and has a light living.&#146; </p>
  <p>Then king Pasenadi of Kosala, after the meal was over approached the Blessed One,
  worshipped, sat on a side and said to the Blessed One. &#146;Venerable sir, my sisters
  Soma and Sakulaa too worship the Blessed One with their heads at your feet and asks
  whether the Blessed One is with few ailments, without trouble and has a light
  living?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Great king, hasn&#146;t the sisters Soma and Sakula any other messenger?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, my sisters Soma and Sakula heard that I was approaching you, after
  my mid-day meal. They approached me when I was partaking the mid-day meal and said. Great
  king if you approach the Blessed One, worship the feet of the Blessed One for the sake of
  Soma and Sakula and inquire whether the Blessed One is with few ailments, without troubles
  and has a light living.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Great king, may the sisters Soma and Sakula be with pleasantness (* 1).&#146; </p>
  <p>Then king Pasenadi of Kosala said. &#145;Venerable sir, I heard that the recluse Gotama
  said this. There is no possibility that a recluse or Brahmin could acknowledge, knowledge
  and vision of everything without leaving out anything. Venerable sir, those who say, the
  recluse Gotama said, there is no possibility that a recluse or Brahmin couldhave knowledge
  and vision of everything without leaving out anything. How far are they saying the words
  of the Blessed One, and not insulting the Blessed One falsely. How much of it is according
  the Teaching and are they saying the words of the Blessed One?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Great king, those who say, the recluse Gotama said, there is no possibility that
  a recluse or Brahmin could acknowledge, knowledge and vision of everything, without
  leaving out anything, are not saying my words. They insult me falsely.&#146; </p>
  <p>King Pasenadi of Kosala spoke to the general Waduudabha. &#145;General, who was it that
  brought these words to the inner chambers of the palace?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Great king, it was Sanjaya Aakaasagotta.&#146; </p>
  <p>Then king Pasenadi of Kosala called a certain man and said. &#145;Good man, call the
  Brahmin Sanjaya Aakaasagotta in my words, tell him the king wants you.&#146; He agreed,
  approached the Brahmin Sanjaya Aakaasagotta and said. &#145;Sir, king Pasenadi of Kosala
  wants you.&#146; </p>
  <p>Meanwhile king Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One. &#145;Venerable sir, has the
  Blessed One said something else on account of this? Which people may have not understood
  correctly? How does the Blessed One recall saying something pertaining to this?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Great king I remember saying something like this. There is no possibility that a
  recluse or Brahmin, could know and see everything at one and the same time.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, you have said with reasons. There is no possibility that a recluse
  or Brahmin, could know and see everything at one and the same time. Venerable sir, there
  are four castes. They are warrior, Brahmin, one of the common grade and slaves.
  &#145;Great king of these four castes, two are thought to be superior, that is the warrior
  and Brahmin castes, in the matter of revering, paying attention, clasping hands as
  respect, and to associate with respect. </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable, sir, I do not question, about the here and now, it is here after I
  question. Venerable sir, of these four castes of warriors, Brahmins, the common man and
  the slaves is there any difference?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Great king there are these five attributes for exertion. What are the five? The
  bhikkhu places faith in the enlightenment of the Blessed One. The Blessed One is perfect,
  rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, knows the worlds,
  (* 2) is the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, Teacher of gods and men, enlightened
  and blessed. He is one with few ailments, a good digestive system not too cold nor too
  hot. Not crafty and fraudulent, shows his real self to the Teacher, to the wise or
  co-associates in the holy life. Abides with aroused effort, for dispelling demerit and
  becomes firm and strenuously yoked to accumulate merit. Becomes wise, endowed with the
  noble one&#146;s wisdom, to penetrate and see the rising and falling, for the rightful
  destruction of unpleasantness. (* 3) Great king, these are the five attributes for
  exertion. If these four castes of warriors, Brahmins, of ordinary people and slaves, are
  endowed with these five attributes of exertion, it will be for their good and welfare for
  a long time.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, when these four castes of warriors, Brahmins, ordinary people and
  slaves are endowed with these five attributes of exertion, will there be a difference
  among them?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Great king, I will tell you the difference in their exerting. There are two
  elephants, or horses or bulls to be trained, of them one trained and tamed, the other
  untrained and untamed. Of them which one would be trained tamed and come to the category
  of the trained, is it the trained tamed one or the untrained untamed one?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, the trained, tamed one will be trained and tamed, and will come to
  the category of the trained.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Great king in the same manner, whatever could be attained by one with faith, few
  ailments, without craftiness and fraudulence, with aroused effort and wisdom, thatcould be
  attained by one without faith, many ailments, crafty, fraudulent, lazy, without effort
  andnot wise is not a possibility.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, the Blessed One said with reasons&#145;Venerable sir, when these
  four castes of warriors, Brahmins, ordinary people and slaves are endowed with these five
  attributes of exertion, will there be a difference among them here?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Great king, I do not see any difference in the release or the released. Like one
  man would light a fire with dry branches leaves and twigs. Another would light with dry
  Sal wood, another with dry mango wood and yet another with dry wood apple sticks. Great
  king in these fires lighted with different kinds of wood, do you see any difference in the
  flame, colour or the lustre?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;No, venerable sir.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Great king in the same manner, in that fire created by effort, and born out of
  exertion, I do not see any difference in the release or the released. </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, the Blessed One speaks with reasons. Venerable sir, are there
  gods?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Great king, why do you ask? Venerable sir, are there gods?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, are there gods, who would return here, or gods who would not
  return here?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Great king, those gods with a troubled mind return here and the others without a
  troubled mind do not return here.&#146; </p>
  <p>Then the general Widuudabha asked the Blessed One. &#145;Venerable sir, do the gods
  with an untroubled mind chase out or banish the gods with a troubled mind?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;It occurred to venerable Aananda, general Widuudabha is the son of king Pasenadi
  of Kosala, and I&#146;m the son of the Blessed One. The son should speak to the son. Then
  venerable Aananda spoke to the general Widuudabha. &#145;General, I will question you on
  this, answer as it pleases you. Within the kingdom of king Pasenadi of Kosala, where he
  wields power, could he chase out or banish recluses, Brahmins, pure or impure ones, those
  leading the holy life or those not leading the holy life?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Within the kingdom of king Pasenadi of Kosala, where he wields power, it is
  possible for him to chase out or banish recluses, Brahmins, pure or impure ones, those
  leading the holy life or those not leading the holy life.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;General, have you heard of the gods of the thirty three?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;I have heard of the gods of the retinue of thirty three, and also this king
  Pasenadi of Kosala has heard of the gods of the retinue of thirty three.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;General could king of Kosala chase out or banish gods of the thirty three from
  there?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Even gaining a sight of those gods is not possible to king Pasenadi of Kosala.
  How could he chase out or banish them from there?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;General in the same manner, the troubled gods who come here, do not even see the
  untroubled gods who do not come here, so how could they chase them out or banish them from
  there?&#146; </p>
  <p>King Pasenadi of Kosala asked the Blessed One.&#145;Venerable sir, what is the name of
  this bhikkhu?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Great king his name is Aananda.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Indeed, good Aananda has pleasant ways, speaks with reasons. Venerable sir, is
  there Brahmaa?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Great king, why do you ask? &#145;Is there Brahmaa?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Are there Brahmaa who return here and those that do not return here?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Great king the troubled Brahmaas return here and those not troubled do not return
  here.&#146; </p>
  <p>Then a certain man said to king Pasenadi of Kosala. &#145;Great king, the Brahmin
  Sanjaya Aakaasagotta has come.&#146; King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Brahmin Sanjaya
  Aakaasagotta. &#145;Brahmin who brought these words to the inner chambers of the
  palace.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Great king, the general Widuudabha did so.&#146; </p>
  <p>General Widuudabha said.&#146;Great king it is the Brahmin Sanjaya Aakaasagotta.&#146; </p>
  <p>Then a certain man said to king Pasenadi of Kosala. &#145;Great king it is time to
  go.&#146; Then king Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One.&#146;I asked the Blessed
  One, about the knowledge and vision of all. The Blessed One explained it to me. I like the
  reply and I&#146;m satisfied. I asked the Blessed One about the purity of the four
  castesThe Blessed One explained it to me. I like the reply and I&#146;m satisfied. I asked
  the Blessed One about the superior gods. The Blessed One explained it to me. I like the
  reply and I&#146;m satisfied. I asked the Blessed One, about the Great Brahmaas The
  Blessed One explained it to me. I like the reply and I&#146;m satisfied. Whatever
  questions I asked, the Blessed One explained them, now I&#146;m happy and satisfied.
  Venerable sir, now we go. There is much work to do.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Great king if you think it is fit, do so.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Then king Pasenadi of Kosala got up from his seat, worshipped,circumambulated the
  Blessed One and went away. </p>
  <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. May the sisters Soma and Sakula be with pleasantness.&#146;<em>sukhiniyo hontu
    Mahaaraaja Somaa ca bhaagini Sakulaaca bhagini&#146;</em> When the Blessed One says <em>sukhiniyo</em>,
    he means may they be healthy, this is not bodily health, which cannot be obtained. What
    can be gained is the mental health. That is the mind free from greed, hate and delusion.
    Pleasantness is the mind free from greed, hate and delusion. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2. Knows the worlds.&#146;<em>lokaviduu</em>&#146; The world to any person is the data
    collected through six spheres of mental contact. That collected data is different from one
    person to the other, according to the additions made of greed, non-greed, hate, non-hate,
    delusion and non-delusion. So each person differs from the other. The Blessed One declared
    this fact and so he is lokaviduu. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>3. Becomes wise endowed with the noble one&#146;s wisdom to penetrate and see the
    rising and falling for the rightful destruction of unpleasantness. <em>&#145;Pa~n~nvaa
    hoti udayatthagaaminiyaa pa~n~naaya samannaagato ariyaaya nibbedhikaaya sammaadukkhakkhaya
    gaaminiyaa.&#146;</em> To attain enlightenment one has to penetrate and see the rising and
    falling nature of the five holding masses. The five holding masses are the holding masses
    of matter, feelings, perceptions, determinations and consciousness. It is through these
    five that one holds on to a self and a view. So we have to see wisely that they are
    impermanent. We have to see that whatever is impermanent is not pleasant-<em>&#145;dukkha&#146;</em>
    and whatever is impermanent and unpleasant should not be taken as mine. It is in this
    manner we push away &#145;<em>sakkayadi,t,thi</em>&#146; the view about a self. In plain
    words it is thoughts about a self. </p>
