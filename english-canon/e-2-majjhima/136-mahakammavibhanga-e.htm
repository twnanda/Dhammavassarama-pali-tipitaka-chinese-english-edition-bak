  (136)- The detailed classification of actions</strong></font></p>
  <p>I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One was living in the squirrels&#146; sanctuary in the bamboo
  grove in Raajagaha. At that time venerable Samaddhi lived in a remote dwelling. The
  wandering ascetic Potaliyaputta wandering and walking for exercise approached venerable
  Samiddhi, exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side. Then the wandering ascetic
  Potaliyaputta said.&#146;Friend Samiddhi, this I heard from the recluse Gotama and he
  acknowledged it. Bodily actions are valueless, so too verbal actions, only mental actions
  are valuable. Is there an abiding attained to which someone does not feel anything?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Friend, Potaliyaputta, do not talk like that, do not abuse the Blessed One, it is
  not good to abuse the Blessed One. The Blessed One did not say that bodily actions and
  verbal actions are valueless and that only mental actions are valuable There is an abiding
  attained to which someone does not feel anything.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Friend, Samiddhi, how longis it since you have gone forth?&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Friend, not very long, only three rains.&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Now, what shall we think of the elder bhikkhus, when the novices protect their
  Teacher thus? Friend, Samiddhi, doing intentional actions by body, speech and mind how
  does one feel?&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Friend, doing intentional actions by body, speech and mind, one feels
  unpleasant&#146; </p>
  <p>The wandering ascetic Potaliyaputta neither pleased nor scorning the words of venerable
  Samiddhi got up from his seat and went away. </p>
  <p>Soon after the wandering ascetic Potaliyaputta had gone away, venerable Samiddhi
  approached venerable Aananda, exchanged frienly greetings, sat on a side and informed
  venerable Aananda all that conversation that took place between him and the wandering
  ascetic. Venerable Aananda, then said, friend, we have to see the Blessed One on account
  of this conversation. Let us approach the Blessed One, inform about this and as the
  Blessed One explains it, we will bear it in our minds.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Then venerable Samiddhi agreed and venerables Aananda and Samiddhi approached the
  Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side, and venerable Aananda informed the Blessed Oneall
  that conversation that took place between venerable Samiddhi and the wandering ascetic
  Potaliyaputta. </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said to venerable Aananda: &#145;Aananda, I cannot recall even seeing
  the wandering ascetic potaliyaputta, so how could such a conversation have taken place.
  This foolish man Samiddhi has given a one sided reply, to a question that needed an
  explanatory reply.&#146; </p>
  <p>When this was said, venerable Udaayi intrudingly said to the Blessed One:
  &#145;Venerable sir, if venerable Samiddhi had said, whatever is felt is unpleasant on
  account of this.&#146; </p>
  <p>Then the Blessed One addressed venerable Aananda: &#145;Aananda, do you see the side
  track of this foolish man Udaayi? From the beginning I knew that foolish Udaayi would
  intrude unwisely. Aananda, the wandering ascetic Potaliyaputta had earlier asked about the
  three feelings. If this foolish man Samiddhi had explained to the wandering ascetic thus.
  Friend Potaliyaputta, doing intentional actions with pleasant feelings, by body, speech
  and mind, he feels pleasant. Doing intentional actions with unpleasant feelings, by body,
  speech and mind, he feels unpleasant. Doing intentional actions with neither unpleasant
  nor pleasant feelings, by body, speech and mind, he feels neither unpleasant nor pleasant.
  If he had explained it thus, he would have explained it correctly. Yet Aananda, how are
  these foolish wandering ascetics of other sects to understand the Thus Gone One&#146;s
  detailed classification of actions. If you would listen to it I will explain.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, this is the right time to explain the Detailed classification of
  actions, the bhikkhus hearing it from the Blessed One would bear it in their minds.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Then Aananda listen and attend carefully I will tell. Aananda, there are four
  kinds of people evident in the world. What are the four? Aananda, a certain person
  destroys living things, takes the not given, misbehaves sexually, tells lies and malicious
  things, talks roughly and frivolously, covets, is with angry mind and wrong view, at the
  break up of the body, after death, he goes to decrease, is born in hell. . </p>
  <p>Aananda, a certain person destroys living things, takes the not given,
  misbehavessexually, tells lies and malicious things, talks roughly and frivolously,
  covets, is with angry mind and wrong view, at the break up of the body, after death, he
  increases, is born in heaven.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Aananda, a certain person abstains from, destroying living things, takingthe not given,
  misbehaving sexually, telling lies and malicious things, talking roughly and frivolously.
  Does not covet, is without an angry mind and has right view, at the break up of the body,
  after death, he increases, is born in heaven. </p>

  <p>Aananda, a certain recluse or brahmin through exertion, making endeavour, yoking
  diligence and right attention attains to a certain concentration of mind through which he
  purifies the heavenly eye beyond human. Then he sees this person that destroyed living
  things, took the not given, misbehaved sexually, told lies and malicious things, talked
  roughly and frivolously, coveted, was with angry mind and wrong views at the break up of
  the body, after death, decreased, born in hell. .He says, indeed there is demerit, there
  are results for misconduct. I saw this person who destroyed living things, took the not
  given, misbehaved sexually, told lies and malicious things, talked roughly and
  frivolously, coveted, was with angry mind and wrong views at the break up of the body,
  after death, gone to decrease, born in hell. Then he says, all thosewho destroyed living
  things, took the not given, misbehaved sexually, told lies and malicious things, talked
  roughly and frivolously, coveted, was with angry mind and wrong views at the break up of
  the body, after death, decrease are born in hell. Those who know this, know it rightly,
  those who know it in another way have wrong knowledge. Thus, he tenaciously holds to what
  he himself has known, seen and experienced, and defines it as, this only is the truth, all
  else is false. </p>

  <p>There Aananda, if a recluse or brahmin was to say, &#145;Indeed there is demerit, there
  are results for misconduct&#146;. I allow him that.&#146;If he says I too saw this person
  who destroyed living things, took the not given, misbehaved sexually, told lies and

  <p>Thus Aananda, there is impossible action, impossible to shine forth,there is impossible
  action, possible to shine forth,there is possible action, possible to shine forth andthere
  is possible action, impossible to shine forth (*1) </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said thus and venerable Aananda delighted in the words of the Blessed
  One </p>
  <p><b>Notes.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Thus Aananda, there is impossible action, impossible to shine forth,there is
    impossible action, possible to shine forth,there is possible action, possible to shine
    forth andthere is possible action, impossible to shine forth <em>&#145;Iti kho Aananda,
    atthi kamma.m abhabba.m abhabbaabhaasa.m; atthi kamma.m abhabba.m bhabbaabhaasa.m; atthi
    kamma.m bhabba.mc&#146;eva bhabbaabhaasa.m; atthi kamma.m bhabba.m abhabbaabhaasa.m
    ti&#146;</em> The most important point in the Detailed Classification of actions is, that
    intention matters everything to one&#146;s actions, and much of the results of actions are
    experienced here and now, or in the next birth or in a subsequent birthSince intention is
    so very important, we should know that mere intending would not carry us across.eg We may
    aspire extinction, but without that effort and endeavour and without turning our foot
    steps towards it, it is not possible. These are impossible actions, impossible to shine
    forth. There are times when these impossible actions shine forth, when the necessary
    effort and endeavour are put into it. Then there are actions that begin at the six doors
    of mental contact, which we could.handle efficiently and arrive at the results here and
    now. Thus there are possible actions, possible to shine forth. These same are sometimes
    unable to shine forth, as it happened to venerable Angulimaala. He did not experience the
    results of his evil actions, as he over rode them, and extinguished.&nbsp; </p>
