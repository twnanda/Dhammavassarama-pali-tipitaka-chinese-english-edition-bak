At that time the retreat during the rainy season had not yet been instituted

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">2. People were annoyed, murmured, and became

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">`Let no one, O bhikkhus, who has entered upon

who wished that the vassa period might be postponed, sent a messenger to
the bhikkhus: `What if their reverences were to enter upon vassa on the
next full moon day?'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

at R&agrave;jagaha as long as He thought fit, went forth to S&agrave;vatthi.
Wandering from place to place He came to S&agrave;vatthi. There, at S&agrave;vatthi,
the Blessed One dwelt in the Jetavana, the garden of An&agrave;thapindika.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">At that time an up&agrave;saka (lay devotee)
named Udena, in the Kosala country, had a vih&agrave;ra built for the sa&iuml;gha.
He sent a messenger to the bhikkhus (saying), `Might their reverences come
hither; I desire to bestow gifts (on the sa&iuml;gha) and to hear the Dhamma
and to see the bhikkhus.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">2. The bhikkhus replied: `The Blessed One has
prescribed, friend, that no one who has entered upon vassa, may go on a
journey before he has kept vassa during the earlier or during the later
three months. Let the up&agrave;saka Udena wait so long as the bhikkhus
keep their vassa residence; when they have finished vassa, they will go.
But if there is any urgent necessity, let him dedicate the vih&agrave;ra
in presence of the bhikkhus who reside there.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">3. The up&agrave;saka Udena was annoyed, murmured,
and became angry (saying), `How can their reverences, when I send for them,
refuse to come? I am a giver and a doer (of good works), and do service
to the fraternity.' Some bhikkhus heard the up&agrave;saka Udena, who was
annoyed, &amp;c. These bhikkhus told the thing to the Blessed One.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

Very probably this double period stands in connection with the double period
prescribed in the Br&agrave;hma&otilde;as and S&aring;tras for most of
the Vedic festivals. Thus the sacrifice of the varu&otilde;apr&agrave;gh&agrave;s&agrave;s,
with which the Brahmans began the rainy season, was to be held either on
the full moon day of &acirc;sh&agrave;dha or on the full moon day of the
following month, &uacute;r&agrave;va&otilde;a, quite in accordance with
the Buddhistical rules about the vassupan&agrave;yik&agrave;. The Br&agrave;hma&otilde;a
texts begin the year with the full moon day of the (utter) Ph&agrave;lgun&atilde;;
the sutras mention, besides the Ph&agrave;lgun&atilde;, another new year's
day, the Caitr&atilde; paurnam&agrave;s&atilde;, which falls one month
later. It was in connection with this dislocation of the beginning of the
year that the annual festivals could be postponed accordingly. See Weber,

The enumeration of edifices is identical with that given in sect.6, but
in the cases beginning with that of the sisterhood of bhikkhunis (according
to Buddhaghosa; we believe that the two cases referring to s&agrave;maneras
ought to be excepted) three of the edifices are left viz. The privy the
gant&agrave;ghara and the gant&agrave;ghara room, the use of which is forbidden
to nuns; see Cullavagga x, 27 3, 4,</font></font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

There is no pariv&agrave;sa discipline for the bhikkhunis. When a bhikkhuni
has committed a sa&iuml;gh&agrave;disesa offence, no matter whether she
has concealed it or not she is sentenced to m&agrave;natta discipline for
a fortnight. See Cullavagga X, 1, 4; 25, 3.</font></font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

The phrases, `or I will propose the resolution to the assembly, or I will
help to complete the quorum' (see sect.6 seq.), Of course are omitted here,
because, if the proceeding is directed against a bhikkhuni, this is to
be done. By a bhikkhuni and not by a bhikkhu. See Cullavagga X, 6, 3.</font></font>

See sects. 6-9. Instead of `a number of bhikkhus' in these paragraphs,
the subject is ` a number of bhikkhunis.' instead of friends' or ` Sirs,'
the address is ` Sisters.' in sects. 11, 13 read: `those bhikkhunis are
not friends of mine, but their (female) or friends of mine, &amp;c.'</font></font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

Vis&agrave;kh&agrave; was the most distinguished among the up&agrave;sik&agrave;s,
and occupied a place among them similar to that which An&agrave;thapindika,

Here follows an exact repetition of all the cases given in sects. 5-7 ;
the only difference is, that in the former cases it was said: `When going
to that district, he holds Uposatha outside,' instead of which it is said
now having gone to that district, lie holds Uposatha there.'</font></font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

The cases given in sects. 5-10 are repeated here ; instead of `earlier
period,' it is said here `later period;' instead of before the pav&agrave;ran&agrave;'
(sect. 7), `before the komudi c&agrave;tum&agrave;sin&atilde;.' The komudi
c&agrave;tum&agrave;sin&atilde; is the full moon day in the month Kattika,
which is frequently called Kaumuda in the epic literature ; the epithet
c&agrave;tum&agrave;sin&atilde; refers to the Vedic C&agrave;turm&agrave;sya
festival, which falls upon that day (K&agrave;ty&agrave;yana, &uacute;rautas&aring;tra
V, 6, 1). For those who entered upon vassa at the later period (in the
&uacute;r&agrave;vana month), the end of vassa fell on the komudi day.</font></font>
