came travelling on the road from Ukkala (Orissa) to that place. Then a
deity who had been (in a former life) a blood-relation of the merchants
Tapussa and Bhallika, thus spoke to the merchants [\q 82/] Tapussa and
Bhallika: `Here, my noble friends, at the foot of the R&agrave;j&agrave;yatana
tree, is staying the Blessed One, who has just become Sambuddha. Go and

rice-cakes and lumps of honey, and went to the place where the Blessed

they stationed themselves near Him; standing near Him, the merchants Tapussa
and Bhallika thus addressed the Blessed One: `May, O Lord, the Blessed
One accept from us these rice-cakes and lumps of honey, that that may long
be to us for a good and for a blessing!'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">4. Then the Blessed One thought: `The Tath&agrave;gatas<sup><a href="#N_12_">(12)</a></sup>
do not accept (food) with their hands. Now [\q 83/] with what shall I accept
the rice-cakes and lumps of honey?' then the four Mah&agrave;r&agrave;ja
gods<sup><a href="#N_13_">(13)</a></sup>, understanding by the power of
their minds the reflection which had arisen in the mind of the Blessed
One, offered to the Blessed One from the four quarters (of the horizon)
four bowls made of stone (saying), `May, O Lord, the Blessed One accept
herewith the rice-cakes and the lumps of honey!' the Blessed One accepted
those new stone bowls; and therein He received the rice-cakes and honey
lumps, and those, when He had received, He ate.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">5. And Tapussa and Bhallika, the merchants,
when they saw that the Blessed One had cleansed<sup><a href="#N_14_">(14)</a></sup>
His bowl and His hands, bowed down in reverence [\q 84/] at the feet of
the Blessed One and thus addressed the Blessed One: `We take our refuge,
Lord, in the Blessed One and in the Dhamma; may the Blessed One receive
us as disciples who, from this day forth while our life lasts, have taken
their refuge (in Him).' These were the first in the world to become lay-disciples

seven days, arose from that state of meditation, and went from the foot
of the R&agrave;j&agrave;yatana tree to the Ajap&agrave;la Banyan tree.
And when He had reached it, the Blessed One stayed there at the foot of
the Ajap&agrave;la Banyan tree.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">2. Then in the mind of the Blessed One, who
was alone, and had retired into solitude, the following thought arose:
`I have penetrated this Doctrine which is profound, difficult to perceive
and to understand, which brings quietude of heart, which is exalted, which
is unattainable by reasoning, abstruse, intelligible (only) to the wise.
This people, on the other hand, is given to desire, intent upon desire,
delighting in desire. To this people, therefore, who [\q 85/] are given,
to desire, intent upon desire, delighting in desire, the law of causality
and the chain of causation will be a matter difficult to understand; most
difficult for them to understand will be also the extinction of all sa&iuml;kharas,
the getting rid of all the substrata (of existence<sup><a href="#N_16_">(16)</a></sup>),
the destruction of desire, the absence of passion, quietude of heart, Nirv&agrave;na!
Now if I proclaim the Doctrine, and other men are not able to understand
my preaching, there would result but weariness and annoyance to me.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">3. And then the following . . .<sup><a href="#N_17_">(17)</a></sup>
stanzas, unheard before, occurred to the Blessed One: `With great pains
have I acquired it. Enough! Why should I now proclaim it? This Doctrine
will not be easy to understand to beings that are lost in lust and hatred.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">`Given to lust, surrounded with thick darkness,
they will not see what is repugnant (to their minds), abstruse, profound,
difficult to perceive, and subtle.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">4. When the Blessed One pondered over this matter,
His mind became inclined to remain in quiet, and not to preach the Doctrine.
Then Brahm&agrave; [\q 86/] Sahampati<sup><a href="#N_18_">(18)</a></sup>,
understanding by the power of his mind the reflection which had arisen
in the mind of the Blessed One, thought: `Alas! The world perishes! Alas!
The world is destroyed! If the mind of the Tath&agrave;gata, of the Holy,
of the Absolute Sambuddha inclines itself to remain in quiet, and not to
preach the Doctrine.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">5. Then Brahm&agrave; Sahampati disappeared
from Brahm&agrave;'s world, and appeared before the Blessed One (as quickly)
as a strong man might stretch his bent arm out, or draw back his out-stretched
arm.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">6. And Brahm&agrave; Sahampati adjusted his
upper robe so as to cover one shoulder, and putting his right knee on the
ground, raised his joined hands towards the Blessed One, and said to the
Blessed One: `Lord, may the Blessed One preach the Doctrine! May the perfect
one preach the Doctrine! There are beings whose mental eyes are darkened
by scarcely any dust; but if they do not hear the Doctrine, they cannot
attain salvation. These will understand the Doctrine.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">7. Thus spoke Brahm&agrave; Sahampati; and when
he had thus spoken, he further said: `The Dhamma hitherto manifested in
the country of Magadha has been impure, thought out by contaminated men.
But do Thou now open the door of the Immortal<sup><a href="#N_19_">(19)</a></sup>;
let them hear the Doctrine discovered by the Spotless One!</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">`As a man standing on a rock, on mountain's
[\q 87/] top, might overlook the people all around, thus, O Wise One, ascending
to the highest palace of Truth, look down, all-seeing one, upon the people
lost in suffering, overcome by birth and decay, Thou, who hast freed Thyself
from suffering!</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">`Arise, O Hero; O Victorious One! Wander through

May the Blessed One preach the Doctrine; there will be people who can understand
it!'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">8. When he had spoken thus, the Blessed One
said to Brahm&agrave; Sahampati: `The following thought, Brahm&agrave;,
has occurred to me: "I have penetrated this Doctrine (&amp;c., down to
end of sect.2)." And also, Brahm&agrave;, the following . . .<sup><a href="#N_20_">(20)</a></sup>
stanzas have presented themselves to my mind, which had not been heard
(by me) before: "With great pains (&amp;c., down to end of sect.3)." When
I pondered over this matter, Brahm&agrave;, my mind became inclined to
remain in quiet, and not to preach the Doctrine.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">9. And a second time Brahm&agrave; Sahampati
said to the Blessed One: `Lord, may the Blessed One preach the Doctrine
(&amp;c., as in sects. 6, 7).' and for the second time the Blessed One
said to Brahm&agrave; Sahampati: `The following thought (&amp;c., as before).'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">10. And a third time Brahm&agrave; Sahampati
said to the Blessed One: `Lord, may the Blessed One preach the Doctrine
(&amp;c., as before).'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Then the Blessed One, when He had heard Brahm&agrave;'s
solicitation, looked, full of compassion towards sentient beings, over
the world, with His (all-perceiving) eye of a Buddha. And the Blessed One,
looking over the world with His eye of a Buddha, [\q 88/] saw beings whose
mental eyes were darkened by scarcely any dust, and beings whose eyes were
covered by much dust, beings sharp of sense and blunt of sense, of good
disposition and of bad disposition, easy to instruct and difficult to instruct,
some of them seeing the dangers of future life and of sin.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">11<b>. </b>As, in a pond of blue lotuses, or
water-roses, or white lotuses, some blue lotuses, or water-roses, or white
lotuses, born in the water, grown up in the water, do not emerge over the
water, but thrive hidden under the water; and other blue lotuses, or water-roses,
or white lotuses, born in the water, grown up in the water, reach to the
surface of the water; and other blue lotuses, or water-roses, or white
lotuses, born in the water, grown up in<b> </b>the water, stand emerging
out of the water, and the water does not touch them,-</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">12<b>. </b>Thus the Blessed One, looking over
the world with His eye of a Buddha, saw beings whose mental eyes were darkened
(&amp;c., the text repeats sect.10) ; and when He had thus seen them, He
addressed Brahm&agrave; Sahampati in the following stanza: `Wide opened
is the door of the Immortal to all who have ears to hear; let them send
forth faith to meet it. The Dhamma sweet and good I spake not, Brahm&agrave;,
despairing of the weary task, to men.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">13. Then Brahm&agrave; Sahampati understood:
`The Blessed One grants my request that He should preach the Doctrine.'
And he bowed down before the Blessed One, and passed round Him with his
right side towards Him; and then he straightway disappeared.</font>

And the Blessed One, after having remained at Uruvel&agrave; as long as
He thought fit, went forth to Benares.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">7. Now Upaka, a man belonging, to the &acirc;j&atilde;vaka
sect (i.e. the sect of naked ascetics), saw the Blessed One travelling
on the road, between Gay&agrave; and the Bodhi tree; and when he saw Him,
he said to the Blessed One: `Your countenance, friend, is serene; your
complexion is pure and bright. In whose [\q 91/] name, friend, have you
retired from the world? Who is your teacher? Whose Doctrine do you profess?'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">8. When Upaka the &acirc;j&atilde;vaka had spoken
thus, the Blessed One addressed him in the following stanzas: `I have overcome
all foes; I am all-wise; I am free from stains in every way; I have left
everything; and have obtained emancipation by the destruction of desire.
Having myself gained knowledge, whom should I call my master? I have no
teacher; no one is equal to me; in the world of men and of gods no being
is like me. I am the holy one in this world, I am the highest Teacher,
I alone am the absolute Sambuddha; I have gained coolness (by the extinction
of all passion) and have obtained Nirv&agrave;na. To found the kingdom
of Truth I go to the city of the Kasis (Benares); I will beat the drum
of the Immortal in the darkness of this world.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">9. (Upaka replied): `You profess then, friend,
to be the holy, absolute Jina.' <sup><a href="#N_25_">(25)</a></sup></font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">(The Buddha said): `Like me are all jinas who
have reached extinction of the &agrave;savas<sup><a href="#N_26_">(26)</a></sup>;
I have overcome (gita me) all states of sinfulness'; therefore, Upaka,
am I the Jina.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">When He had spoken thus, Upaka the &acirc;j&atilde;vaka
replied: `It may be so, friend;' shook his head, took another road, and
went away.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">10. And the Blessed One, wandering from place
to place, came to Benares, to the deer park Isipatana, to the place where
the five bhikkhus were. And [\q 92/] the five bhikkhus saw the Blessed
One coming from afar; when they saw Him, they concerted with each other,
saying, `Friends, there comes the sama&otilde;a Gotama, who lives in abundance,
who has given up his exertions, and who has turned to an abundant life.
Let us not salute him; nor rise from our seats when he approaches; nor
take his bowl and his robe from his hands. But let us put there a seat;
if he likes, let him sit down.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">11. But when the Blessed One gradually approached
near unto those five bhikkhus, the five bhikkhus kept not their agreement.
They went forth to meet the Blessed One; one took His bowl and His robe,
another prepared a seat, a third one brought water for the washing of the
feet, a foot-stool, and a towel<sup><a href="#N_27_">(27)</a></sup>. Then
the Blessed One sat down on the seat they had prepared; and when He was
seated, the Blessed One washed His feet. Now they addressed the Blessed
One by His name, and with the appellation `Friend.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">12<b>. </b>When they spoke to Him thus, the
Blessed One said to the five bhikkhus: `Do not address, O bhikkhus, the
Tath&agrave;gata by His name, and with the appellation "Friend." The Tath&agrave;gata,
O bhikkhus, is the Holy, Absolute Sambuddha. Give ear, O bhikkhus! The
Immortal (amata) has been won (by me); I will teach you; to you I preach
the Doctrine. If you walk in the way I show you, you will, ere long, have
penetrated to the Truth, having yourselves known it and seen it face to
face; and you [\q 93/] will live in the possession of that highest goal
of the holy life, for the sake of which noble youths fully give up the
world and go forth into the houseless state.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">13. When He had spoken thus, the five monks
said to the Blessed One: `By those observances, friend Gotama, by those
practices, by those austerities, you have not been able to obtain power
surpassing that of men, nor the superiority of full and holy knowledge
and insight. How will you now, living in abundance, having given up your
exertions, having turned to an abundant life, be able to obtain power surpassing
that of men, and the superiority of full and holy knowledge and insight?'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">14. When they had spoken thus, the Blessed One
said to the five bhikkhus: `The Tath&agrave;gata, O bhikkhus, does not
live in abundance, he has not given up exertion, he has not turned to an
abundant life. The Tath&agrave;gata, O bhikkhus, is the Holy, Absolute
Sambuddha. Give car, O bhikkhus; the Immortal has been won (by me); I will
teach you, to you I will preach the Doctrine. If you walk in the way I
show you, you will, ere long, have penetrated to the Truth, having yourselves
known it and seen it face to face; and you will live in the possession
of that highest goal of the holy life, for the sake of which noble youths
fully give up the world and go forth into the houseless state.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">15. And the five bhikkhus said to the Blessed
One a second time (as above). And the Blessed One said to the five bhikkhus
a second time (as above). And the five bhikkhus said to the Blessed One
a third time (as above).</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">16. When they had spoken thus, the Blessed One
[\q 94/] said to the five bhikkhus: `Do you admit, O bhikkhus, that I have
never spoken to you in this way before this day?'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">You have never spoken so, Lord.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">The Tath&agrave;gata, O bhikkhus, is the holy,
absolute Sambuddha. Give ear, O bhikkhus, &amp;c. (as above).'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">And the Blessed One was able to convince the
five bhikkhus; and the five bhikkhus again<sup><a href="#N_28_">(28)</a></sup>
listened willingly to the Blessed One; they gave ear, and fixed their mind
on the knowledge (which the Buddha imparted to them).</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">17. And the Blessed One thus addressed the five
bhikkhus<sup><a href="#N_29_">(29)</a></sup>: `There are two extremes,
O bhikkhus, which he who has given up the world, ought to avoid. What are
these two extremes? A life given to pleasures, devoted to pleasures and
lusts: this is degrading, sensual, vulgar, ignoble, and profitless; and
a life given to mortification: this is painful, ignoble, and profitless.
By avoiding these two<i> </i>extremes, O bhikkhus, the Tath&agrave;gata
has gained the knowledge of the middle path which leads to insight, which
leads to wisdom, which conduces to calm, to knowledge, to the Sambodhi,
to Nirv&agrave;na.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">18<b>. `</b>Which, O bhikkhus, is this middle
path the knowledge of which the Tath&agrave;gata has gained, which leads
to insight, which leads to wisdom which [\q 95/] conduces to calm, to knowledge,
to the Sambodhi, to Nirv&agrave;na? It is the holy eightfold path, namely,
right belief, right aspiration, right speech, right conduct, right means
of livelihood, right endeavour, right memory, right meditation. This, O
bhikkhus, is the middle path the knowledge of which the Tath&agrave;gata
has gained, which leads to insight, which leads to wisdom, which conduces
to calm, to knowledge, to the Sambodhi, to Nirv&agrave;na.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">19. `This, O bhikkhus, is the Noble Truth of
Suffering: birth is suffering; decay is suffering; illness is suffering;
death is suffering. Presence of objects we hate, is suffering; separation
from objects we love, is suffering; not to obtain what we desire, is suffering.
Briefly, the fivefold clinging to existence<sup><a href="#N_30_">(30)</a></sup>
is suffering.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">20. `This, O bhikkhus, is the Noble Truth of
the Cause of Suffering: thirst, that leads to re-birth, accompanied by
pleasure and lust, finding its delight here; and there. (this thirst is
threefold), namely, thirst for pleasure, thirst for existence, thirst for
prosperity.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">21. `This, O bhikkhus, is the Noble Truth of
the Cessation of Suffering: (it ceases with) the complete cessation of
this thirst -- a cessation which consists in the absence of every passion
-- with the abandoning of this thirst, with the doing-away with it, with
the deliverance from it, with the destruction of desire.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">22. `This, O bhikkhus, is the Noble Truth of
the Path Which Leads to the Cessation of Suffering: [\q 96/] that holy
eightfold path, that is to say, right belief, right aspiration, right speech,
right conduct, right means of livelihood, right endeavour, right memory
, right meditation.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">23.<b> `"</b>This is the Noble Truth of Suffering."
Thus, O bhikkhus, of this Doctrine, which formerly had not been heard of,
have I obtained insight, knowledge, understanding, wisdom, intuition. "This
Noble Truth of Suffering must be understood," thus, O bhikkhus, of this
Doctrine (&amp;c., down to intuition). "This Noble Truth of Suffering I
have understood," thus, O bhikkhus, of this Doctrine (&amp;c., down to

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">24. `"This is the Noble Truth of the Cause of
Suffering." Thus, O bhikkhus, (&amp;c.) "This Noble Truth of the Cause
of Suffering must be abandoned<sup><a href="#N_31_">(31)</a></sup>. . .

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">27. `As long, O bhikkhus, as I did not possess
with perfect purity this true knowledge and insight into these Four Noble
Truths, with its three [\q 97/] modifications and its twelve constituent
parts<sup><a href="#N_32_">(32)</a></sup>; so long, O bhikkhus, I knew
that I had not yet obtained the highest, absolute Sambodhi in the world
of men and gods, in M&agrave;ra's and Brahm&agrave;'s world, among all
beings, sama&otilde;as and br&agrave;hma&otilde;as, gods and men.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">28.`But since I possessed, O bhikkhus, with
perfect purity this true knowledge and insight into these four noble Truths,

O bhikkhus, that I had obtained the highest, universal Sambodhi in the
world of men and gods (&amp;c., as in sect.27).</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">29<b>. `</b>And this knowledge and insight arose
in my mind: "The emancipation of my mind cannot be lost; this is my last

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Thus the Blessed One spoke. The five bhikkhus
were delighted, and they rejoiced at the words of the Blessed One. And
when this exposition was propounded, the Venerable Konda&curren;&curren;a
obtained the pure and spotless eye of the Truth (that is to say, the following
knowledge): `Whatsoever is subject to the condition of origination, is
subject also to the condition of cessation.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">30. And as the Blessed One had founded the kingdom
of Truth (by propounding the four noble Truths), the earth-inhabiting devas
shouted: `Truly the Blessed One has founded at Benares, in the deer park
Isipatana, the highest kingdom of Truth, which may be opposed neither by
a sama&otilde;a nor by a br&agrave;hma&otilde;a, neither by a deva, nor

Hearing the shout of the C&agrave;tumah&agrave;r&agrave;jika devas, the

that second the shout reached the Brahm&agrave; world; and this whole system

can be produced by the divine power of the devas.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">And the Blessed One pronounced this solemn utterance:
`Truly Konda&curren;&curren;a has perceived it ("a&curren;&curren;&agrave;si"),

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">32. And the Venerable A&curren;&curren;&agrave;takonda&curren;&curren;a,
having seen the Truth, having mastered the Truth, having understood the
Truth, having penetrated the Truth, having overcome uncertainty, having
dispelled all doubts, having gained full knowledge, dependent on nobody

One: `Lord, let [\q 99/] me receive the pabbajj&agrave; and upasampad&agrave;
ordinations from the Blessed One.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">`Come, O bhikkhu,' said the Blessed One, `Well

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">33. And the Blessed One administered to the
other bhikkhus exhortation and instruction by discourses relating to the

received from the Blessed One such exhortation and instruction by discourses
relating to the Dhamma, obtained the pure and spotless eye of the Truth

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">35. And the Blessed One, living on what the
bhikkhus brought Him, administered to the other bhikkhus exhortation and

O bhikkhus, were the self, the body would not be subject to disease, and
we should be able to say: "Let my body be such and such a one, let my body
not be such and such a one." But since the body, O bhikkhus, is not the
self, therefore the body is subject to disease, and we are not able to
say: "Let my body be such and such one, let my body not be such and such

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">39-41. `Sensation (vedan&agrave;), O bhikkhus,

body permanent or perishable?'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">[\q 101/] `It is perishable, Lord.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">1.<b> </b>At that time there was in Benares
a noble youth, Yasa by name, the son of a se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;i (or
treasurer<sup><a href="#N_43_">(43)</a></sup>) and delicately nurtured.
He had three palaces, one for winter, one for summer, one for the rainy
season. In the palace for the rainy season he lived during the four months
(of that season), surrounded with female musicians among whom no [\q 103/]
man was, and he did not descend from that palace (all that time). Now one
day Yasa, the noble youth, who was endowed with, and possessed of the five
pleasures of sense<sup><a href="#N_44_">(44)</a></sup>, while he was attended
(by those female musicians), fell asleep sooner than usual; and after him
his attendants also fell asleep. Now an oil lamp was burning through the
whole night.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">2. And Yasa, the noble youth, awoke sooner than
usual; and he saw his attendants sleeping; one had her lute leaning against
her arm-pit; one had her tabor leaning against her neck; one had her drum
leaning against her arm-pit; one had dishevelled hair; one had saliva flowing
from her mouth; and they were muttering in their sleep. One would think
it was a cemetery one had fallen into<sup><a href="#N_45_">(45)</a></sup>.
When he saw that, the evils (of the life he led) manifested themselves
to him; his mind became weary (of worldly pleasures). And Yasa,, the noble
youth, gave utterance to this solemn exclamation: `Alas! What distress;
alas! What danger!'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">3. And Yasa, the noble youth, put on his gilt
slippers, and went to the gate of his house. Non-human beings opened the
gate, in order that no being might prevent Yasa the noble youth's leaving
the world, and going forth into the houseless state. And Yasa, the noble
youth, went to the gate of the city. Non-human beings opened the gate,
in order that no being might prevent Yasa the noble youth's leaving the
world, and going forth into the houseless state. And Yasa, the noble youth,
went to. The deer park Isipatana.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">[\q 104/]</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">4. At that time the Blessed One, having arisen
in the night, at dawn was walking up and down in the open air. And the
Blessed One saw Yasa, the noble youth, coming from afar. And when He saw
him, He left the place where He was walking, and sat down on a seat laid
out (for Him). And Yasa, the noble youth, gave utterance near the Blessed
One to that solemn exclamation: `Alas! What distress; alas! What danger!'
and the Blessed One said to Yasa, the noble youth: `Here is no distress,
Yasa, here is no danger. Come here, Yasa, sit down, I will teach you the
Truth (Dhamma).'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">5. And Yasa, the noble youth, when he heard
that there was no distress, and that there was no danger, became glad and
joyful; and he put off his gilt slippers, and went to the place where the
Blessed One was; having approached Him and having respectfully saluted
the Blessed One, he sat down near Him. When Yasa, the noble youth, was
sitting near Him, the Blessed One preached to him in due course: that is
to say, he talked about the merits obtained by alms-giving, about the duties
of morality, about heaven, about the evils, the vanity, and the sinfulness
of desires, and about the blessings of the abandonment of desire<sup><a href="#N_46_">(46)</a></sup>.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">6. When the Blessed One saw that the mind of
Yasa, the noble youth, was prepared, impressible, free from obstacles (to
understanding the Truth), elated, and believing, then He preached what
is the principal Doctrine of the Buddhas, namely, suffering, [\q 105/]
the cause of suffering, the cessation of suffering the path. Just as a
clean cloth free from black specks properly takes the dye, thus Yasa, the
noble youth, even while sitting there, obtained the pure and spotless eye
of the Truth (that is, the knowledge): `Whatsoever is subject to the condition

the householder: `Your son Yasa, O householder, has disappeared.' then
the se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;i, the householder, sent messengers on horseback

the ground the marks of the gilt slippers; and when he saw them, he followed
them up.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

the householder, sitting here, should not see Yasa, the noble youth, who
is sitting here also.' And the Blessed One effected such an exercise of
His miraculous power.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

householder, having seen the Truth, having mastered the Truth, having penetrated
the Truth, having overcome uncertainty, having dispelled all doubts, having
gained full knowledge, dependent on nobody else for the knowledge of the
Doctrine of the Teacher, said to the Blessed One: `Glorious, Lord ! Glorious,
Lord! Just as if one should set up, Lord, what had been overturned, or
should reveal what had been hidden, or should point out the way to one
who had lost his way, or should bring a lamp into the darkness, in order
that those who had eyes might see visible things, thus has the Blessed
One preached the Doctrine in many ways. I take my refuge, Lord, in the

became free from attachment to the world, and was [\q 107/] released from
the &agrave;savas. Then the Blessed One thought: `Yasa, the noble youth,
while instruction was administered to his father, has contemplated the
stage of knowledge which he had seen with his mind and understood; and
his mind has become free from attachment to the world, and has become released
from the &agrave;savas. It is impossible that Yasa, the noble youth, should
return to the world and enjoy pleasures, as he did before, when he lived
in his house. What if I were now to put an end to that exertion of my miraculous

rather he was contemplating the stage of knowledge which he had seen with

it then be possible, O householder, that Yasa should return to the world

Kassapa, Nad&atilde; Kassapa (Kassapa of the river, i.e. The Nera&curren;jar&agrave;,),

of [\q 119/] the Ja&ntilde;ila Uruvel&agrave; Kassapa; having gone there,
He said to the Ja&ntilde;ila Uruvel&agrave; Kassapa: `If it is not disagreeable
to you, Kassapa, let me spend one night in the room where your (sacred)
fire is kept.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">`It is not disagreeable to me, Great Sama&otilde;a,

And the n&agrave;ga saw that the Blessed One had entered; when he saw that,
he became annoyed, and irritated, and sent forth a cloud of smoke. Then
the Blessed One thought: `What if I were to leave intact the skin, and
hide, and flesh, and ligaments, and bones, [\q 120/] and marrow of this
n&agrave;ga; but were to conquer the fire, which he will send forth, by

sent forth flames. And the Blessed One, converting His body into fire<sup><a href="#N_58_">(58)</a></sup>,
sent forth flames. When they both shone forth with their flames, the fire
room looked as if it were burning and blazing, as if it were all in flames,
and the Ja&ntilde;ilas, surrounding the fire room, said: `Truly the countenance

venomous serpent. He is not, however, holy (arahat) as I am.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

Kassapa, allow me a place in your fire room.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">When He saw that Kassapa had given his permission,
fearlessly He, who had overcome all fear, entered. When the chief of serpents
saw that the sage had entered, he became irritated, and sent forth a cloud
of smoke. Then the chief of men<sup><a href="#N_61_">(61)</a></sup>, joyful
and unperplexed, also sent forth a cloud of smoke. Unable to master his
rage, the chief of serpents sent forth flames like a burning fire. Then
the chief of men, the perfect master of the element of fire, also sent
forth flames. When they shone forth both with their flames, the Ja&ntilde;ilas
looked at the fire room saying `Truly the countenance of the Great Sama&otilde;a
is beautiful, but the n&agrave;ga will do harm to him.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">7. And when that night had elapsed, the flames
of the n&agrave;ga were extinguished, but the various coloured flames of
Him who is possessed of magical powers remained. Dark blue and red, light
red, yellow, and crystal-coloured flames of various colours [\q 122/] appeared
on the Angiras's<sup><a href="#N_62_">(62)</a></sup> body. Having put the
chief of serpents into His alms-bowl, He showed him to the br&agrave;hma&otilde;a
(saying), `Here you see the n&agrave;ga, Kassapa; his fire has been conquered
by my fire.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">And the Ja&ntilde;ila Uruvel&agrave; Kassapa,

and a great inundation arose. The place where the Blessed One lived was
covered with water. Then [\q 131/] the Blessed One thought: `What if I
were to cause the water to recede round about, and if I were to walk up
and down in the midst of the water on a dust-covered spot.' And the Blessed

Blessed One, who had caused the water to recede round about, walking up

in the Lacchivana pleasure garden, near the sacred shrine of Supaticcha.
Of Him, the blessed Gotama such a glorious fame is spread abroad: "Truly
He is the Blessed, Holy, Absolute Sambuddha, endowed with knowledge and
conduct, the most Happy One, Who understands all worlds, the Highest One,
Who guides men as a driver curbs a bullock, the Teacher of gods and men,

respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near Him. And of those
twelve myriads of Magadha br&agrave;hma&otilde;as and householders some
also respectfully saluted the Blessed One and sat down near Him; some exchanged
greetings with the Blessed One, having exchanged with Him greeting and
complaisant words, they sat down near Him; some bent their clasped hands
towards the Blessed One and sat down near Him; some shouted out their name
and their family name before the Blessed One and sat down near Him; some
silently sat down near Him.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

or has Uruvel&agrave; Kassapa placed himself under the spiritual direction

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">And the Blessed One, who understood in His mind
the reflection which had arisen in the minds of those twelve myriads of

have you gained, O inhabitant of Uruvel&agrave;, that has induced you,
who were renowned for your penances<sup><a href="#N_77_">(77)</a></sup>,

it that your fire sacrifice has become deserted?'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

sounds, and also tastes, pleasures and woman that the sacrifices speak
of<sup><a href="#N_78_">(78)</a></sup> ; because I understood that whatever
belongs to existence<sup><a href="#N_79_">(79)</a></sup> is filth, therefore

Kassapa, now finds delight? Tell me that.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

a clean cloth free from black specks properly takes the dye, thus eleven
myriads of those Magadha br&agrave;hma<i>&otilde;</i>as and householders
with Bimbis&agrave;ra at their head, while sitting there, obtained the
pure and spotless eye of the Truth (that is, the knowledge): `Whatsoever

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">And the Venerable Assaji, having finished his

where the Venerable Assaji was; having, approached him, he exchanged greeting
with the Venerable Assaji; having exchanged with him greeting and complaisant
words, he stationed himself at his side; standing at his side the paribb&agrave;jaka
S&agrave;riputta said to the Venerable Assaji: `Your countenance, friend,
is serene; your complexion is pure and bright. In whose name, friend, have
you retired from the world? Who is your teacher? Whose Doctrine do you

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Then the paribb&agrave;jaka S&agrave;riputta

(And he said): `If this alone be the Doctrine (the Dhamma), now you have
reached up to the state where all sorrow ceases (i.e. Nirv&agrave;na),

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">But S&agrave;riputta and Moggall&agrave;na took
with them those two hundred and fifty paribb&agrave;jakas and went to the

spot, to vomit hot blood from his mouth<sup><a href="#N_95_">(95)</a></sup>.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">And the Blessed One saw them, S&agrave;riputta

went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached Him, they
prostrated themselves, inclining their heads to the feet of the Blessed

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">`Come, O bhikkhus,' said the Blessed One, `Well

ordination.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">5. At that time many distinguished young Magadha
noblemen led a religious life under the direction of the Blessed One. The
people were annoyed, murmured, and became angry (saying), `The sama&otilde;a
Gotama causes fathers to beget no sons; the sama&otilde;a Gotama causes
wives to become widows; the sama&otilde;a Gotama causes families to become
extinct. Now He has ordained one Thousand Ja&ntilde;ilas, and He has ordained
these two hundred and fifty paribb&agrave;jakas who were followers of Sa&iuml;jaya;
and these many distinguished young Magadha noblemen are now leading a religious
life under the direction of the sama&otilde;a Gotama. And moreover, when
they saw the bhikkhus, they reviled them in the following stanza: `The
Great Sama&otilde;a has come to Giribbaja, R&agrave;jagaha) of the Magadha
people, leading with him all the followers of Sa&iuml;jaya; who will be
the next to be led by him?'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">6. Some bhikkhus heard those people that were
[\q 151/] annoyed, murmured, and had become angry; these bhikkhus told
this thing to the Blessed One. (He replied): `This noise, O bhikkhus, will
not last long; it will last only seven days; after seven days it will be
over. And if they revile you, O bhikkhus, in this stanza: "The Great Sama&otilde;a
has come, &amp;c.," you should reply to the revilers in the following stanza:
"It is by means of the true Doctrine that the great heroes, the Tath&agrave;gatas,
lead men. Who will murmur at the wise, who lead men by the power of the
Truth?"'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">7. At that time the people, when seeing the

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">25<sup><a href="#N_98_">(98)</a></sup>.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">1. At that time some bhikkhus, as they had no
upajjh&agrave;yas (preceptors) and received no exhortation [\q 152/] and
instruction, went on their rounds for alms wearing improper under and upper
garments (or, wearing their under and upper garments improperly), and in
an improper attire. While people were eating, they held out their alms-bowls
in which were leavings of food<sup><a href="#N_99_">(99)</a></sup>, over
the hard food (which the people were eating), and held them out over soft
food, and held them out over savoury food, and held them out over drinks.
They asked for soup and boiled rice themselves, and ate it; in the dining
halls they made a great and loud noise.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">2. The people were annoyed, murmured, and became
angry (saying), `How can the Sakyaputtiya sama&otilde;as go on their rounds
for alms wearing improper under and upper garments (&amp;c., as in sect.1,
down to drinks)? How can they make so great and loud a noise in the dining
halls? They behave like br&agrave;hma&otilde;as at the dinners given to
them.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">3. Some bhikkhus heard those people that were
annoyed, murmured, and had become angry. Those bhikkhus who were moderate,
frugal, modest, conscientious, [\q 153/] anxious for training, were annoyed,
murmured, and became angry: `How can the bhikkhus go on their rounds for
alms wearing improper under and upper garments, &amp;c.? How can they make
so great and loud a noise in the dining halls?'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">4. These bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed
One.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">In consequence of that and on this occasion
the Blessed One, having ordered the fraternity of bhikkhus to assemble,
questioned the bhikkhus: `Is it true, O bhikkhus, that some bhikkhus go
on their rounds (&amp;c., down to), that they make a great and loud noise
in the dining halls?'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">`It is true, Lord.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">5. Then the Blessed Buddha rebuked those bhikkhus:
`It is improper, O bhikkhus, what these foolish persons are doing, it is
unbecoming, indecent, unworthy of sama&otilde;as, unallowable, and to be
avoided. How can these foolish persons, O bhikkhus, go on their rounds,
&amp;c.? How can they make so great and loud a noise in the dining halls?
This will not do, O bhikkhus, for converting the unconverted, and for augmenting
the number of the converted; but it will result, O bhikkhus, in the unconverted
being repulsed (from the faith), and in many of the converted being estranged.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">6. And the Blessed One rebuked those bhikkhus
in many ways, spoke against unfrugality, ill-nature, immoderation, insatiableness,
delighting in society, and indolence; spoke in many ways in praise of frugality,
good-nature, of the moderate, contented, who have eradicated (sin), who
have shaken off (sin), of the gracious, of the reverent, and of the energetic.
And having delivered before the bhikkhus a religious [\q 154/] discourse
in accordance to, and in conformity with. These subjects, He thus addressed
the bhikkhus: `I prescribe, O bhikkhus, (that young bhikkhus choose) an
upajjh&agrave;ya (or preceptor).</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">`The upajjh&agrave;ya, O bhikkhus, ought to
consider the saddhivih&agrave;rika (i.e. pupil)<sup><a href="#N_100_">(100)</a></sup>
as a son; the saddhivih&agrave;rika ought to consider the upajjh&agrave;ya
as a father. Thus these two, united by mutual reverence, confidence, and
communion of life, will progress, advance, and reach a high stage in this
Doctrine and discipline.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

upajjh&agrave;ya), sit down squatting, raise his joined hands, and say:

Venerable Sir, be my upajjh&agrave;ya." (If the other answer):"Well," or,
"Certainly," or, "Good," or, "All right," or, "Carry on (your work) with
friendliness (towards me)," or should he express this by gesture (lit.

at R&agrave;jagaha that the bhikkhus were to receive excellent meals successively
(in the houses of different rich up&agrave;sakas). Now (one day) a certain
br&agrave;hma&otilde;a thought: `Indeed the precepts which these Sakyaputtiya
sama&otilde;as keep and the life they live are commodious; they have good
meals and lie down on beds protected from the wind<sup><a href="#N_132_">(132)</a></sup>.
What if I were to embrace the religious life among the Sakyaputtiya sama&otilde;as?'
Then this br&agrave;hma&otilde;a went to the bhikkhus and asked them for
the pabbajj&agrave; ordination; the bhikkhus conferred the pabbajj&agrave;
and upasampad&agrave; ordinations on him.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">2. When he had been ordained, the arrangement
of successive meals (with the rich up&agrave;sakas) came to an end. The
bhikkhus said to him: `Come, friend, let us now go on our rounds for alms.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">He replied: `I have not embraced the religious
life for that purpose to going about for alms; if you give me (food), I
will eat; if you do not, I will return to the world.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">(The bhikkhus said): `What, friend! Have you
indeed embraced the religious life for your belly's sake?'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">`Yes, friends.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">3. The moderate bhikkhus were annoyed, murmured,

a Doctrine and discipline for his belly's sake?' [\q 173/]</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">These bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed
One. (The Buddha said): `Is it true, O bhikkhu, that you have embraced
the religious life for your belly's sake?'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">(He replied): `It is true, Lord.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Then the Blessed Buddha rebuked that bhikkhu:
`How can you, foolish person that you are embrace the religious life in

not do, O foolish one, for converting the unconverted and for augmenting

bhikkhus and asked them to be ordained. The bhikkhus told him the (four)
resources before his ordination. Then He said: `If you had told me the
resources, Venerable Sirs, after my ordination, I should have persisted
(in the religious life); but now, Venerable Sirs, I will not be ordained;
the, resources are repulsive and loathsome to me.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">The bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed
One.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">`You ought not, O bhikkhus, to tell the resources,
(to the candidates) before their ordination. He who does is guilty of a

[\q 175/]</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">2. At that time some bhikkhus performed the
upasampad&agrave; service with a chapter of two or three bhikkhus</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

upasampad&agrave; services with a chapter of ten bhikkhus or more than
ten.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">3. At that time some bhikkhus conferred the
upasampad&agrave; ordination on their saddhivih&agrave;rikas one or two
years after their own upasampad&agrave;.<sup><a href="#N_135_">(135)</a></sup>
Thus also the Venerable Upasena Va&iuml;gantaputta conferred the upasampad&agrave;
ordination on a saddhivih&agrave;rika of his one year after his own upasampad&agrave;.
When he had concluded the vassa residence, after two years from his own
upasampad&agrave; had elapsed, he went with his saddhivih&agrave;rika,
who had completed the first year after his upasampad&agrave;, to the place
where the Blessed One was; having approached, Him and respectfully saluted
the Blessed One, he sat down near Him.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">4. Now it is the custom of the Blessed Buddhas
to exchange greeting with incoming bhikkhus. And the Blessed One said to
the Venerable Upasena Va&iuml;gantaputta: do things go well with you, bhikkhu?
Do you get enough to support your life? Have you made your journey with
not too great fatigue?'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">`Things go pretty well with us Lord; we get
[\q 176/] enough, Lord, to support our life, and we have made our journey,
Lord, with not too great fatigue.' The Tath&agrave;gatas sometimes ask
about what they know; sometimes they do not ask about what they know. They
understand the right time when to ask and they understand the right time
when not to ask. The Tath&agrave;gatas put questions full of sense, not
void of sense; to what is void of sense the bridge is pulled down for the
Tath&agrave;gatas. For two purposes the Blessed Buddhas put questions to
the bhikkhus, when they intend to preach the Doctrine or when they intend
to institute a rule of conduct to their disciples.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">5. And the blessed One said to the Venerable
Upananda Va&iuml;gantaputta: `How many year have you completed, O bhikkhu,
since your upasampad&agrave;?</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">`Two years, Lord.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">`And how many years has this bhikkhu completed?'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">`One year, Lord.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">`He is my saddhivih&agrave;rika, Lord.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Then the Blessed Buddha rebuked him: `This is
improper, O foolish one, unbecoming, unsuitable, unworthy of a sama&otilde;a,
unallowable, and to be avoided. How can you, O foolish one, who ought to
receive exhortation and instruction from others, think yourself fit for
administering exhortation and instruction to another bhikkhu? Too quickly
O foolish one, have you abandoned yourself to the ambition of collecting
followers. This will not do (&amp;c., as in chap.30.3). Let no one, O bhikkhus,
confer the upasampad&agrave; ordination who has not [\q 177/] completed
ten years. He who does, is guilty of a dukka&ntilde;a offence. I prescribe,
O bhikkhus, that only he who has completed ten, years, or more than ten
years, may confer the upasampad&agrave; ordination.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">6. At that time ignorant, unlearned bhikkhus
(who said), `We have completed ten years (since our upasampad&agrave;),
we have completed ten years, conferred the upasampad&agrave; ordination.
(Thus) ignorant upajjh&agrave;ya's were found and clever saddhivih&agrave;rikas;
unlearned upajjh&agrave;yas were found and learned saddhivih&agrave;rikas;
upajjh&agrave;yas were found who had small knowledge, and saddhivih&agrave;rikas
who had great knowledge; foolish upajjh&agrave;yas were found and wise
saddhivih&agrave;rikas. And a certain bhikkhu who had formerly belonged
to a titthiya<sup><a href="#N_136_">(136)</a></sup> school, when his upajjh&agrave;ya
remonstrated with him (on certain offences) according to the Dhamma, brought
his upajjh&agrave;ya (by reasoning) to silence and went back to that same
titthiya school<sup><a href="#N_137_">(137)</a></sup>.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">7. The moderate bhikkhus were annoyed, murmured,

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">1. At that time these five diseases prevailed
among the people of Magadha: leprosy, boils, dry leprosy, consumption,
and fits. The people who were affected with these five diseases went to
J&atilde;vaka Kom&agrave;rabhacca<sup><a href="#N_153_">(153)</a></sup>
and said: `Pray, doctor, cure us.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">`I have too many duties, Sirs, and am too occupied.
I have to treat the Magadha King Seniya Bimbis&agrave;ra, and the royal

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">2. Now those people thought: `Indeed the precepts
which these Sakyaputtiya sama&otilde;as keep and [\q 192/] the life they
live are commodious; they have good meals and lie down on beds protected
from the wind. What if we were to embrace the religious life among the
Sakyaputtiya sama&otilde;as: then the bhikkhus will nurse us, and J&atilde;vaka
Kom&agrave;rabhacca will cure us.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Thus these persons went to the bhikkhus and
asked them for the pabbajj&agrave; ordination; the bhikkhus conferred on
them the pabbajj&agrave; and upasampad&agrave; ordinations; and the bhikkhus
nursed them, and J&atilde;vaka Kom&agrave;rabhacca cured them.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">3. At that time the bhikkhus, who had to nurse
many sick bhikkhus, began to solicit (lay people) with many demands and
many requests: `Give us food for the sick; give us food for the tenders
of the sick; give us medicine for the sick.' And also J&atilde;vaka Kom&agrave;rabhacca,
who had to treat many sick bhikkhus, neglected some of his duties to the
king.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">4. Now one day a man who was affected with the
five diseases went to J&atilde;vaka Kom&agrave;rabhacca and said: `Pray,
doctor, cure me.' `I have too many duties, Sir, and am too occupied; I
have to treat the Magadha King Seniya Bimbis&agrave;ra, and the royal seraglio,

bhikkhus will nurse me, and J&atilde;vaka Kom&agrave;rabhacca will cure
me. When I have become free from sickness, then I will return to the world.'
Thus that man went to the bhikkhus and asked them for the pabbajj&agrave;
ordination; the bhikkhus, [\q 193/] conferred on him the pabbajj&agrave;
and upasampad&agrave; ordinations; and the bhikkhus nursed him, and J&atilde;vaka
Kom&agrave;rabhacca cured him. When he had become free from sickness, he
returned to the world. Now J&atilde;vaka Kom&agrave;rabhacca saw this person
that had returned to the world; and when he saw him he asked that person:
`Had you not embraced the religious life, Sir, among the bhikkhus?' `Yes,
doctor.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

Then that man told J&atilde;vaka Kom&agrave;rabhacca the whole matter.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">6. Then J&atilde;vaka Kom&agrave;rabhacca was
annoyed, murmured, and became angry: `How can the Venerable brethren confer
the pabbajj&agrave; ordination on a person affected with the five diseases?'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">And J&atilde;vaka Kom&agrave;rabhacca went to
the place where the Blessed One was; having approached Him and having respectfully

Kom&agrave;rabhacca said to the Blessed One: `Pray, Lord, let their reverences
not confer the pabbajj&agrave; ordination on persons affected with the
five diseases.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">7. Then the Blessed One taught, incited, animated

by the Blessed One by religious discourse, rose from his seat, respectfully
saluted the Blessed One, and passing round Him with his right side towards
Him, went away.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">In consequence of that and on this occasion
the Blessed One, after having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed
the bhikkhus.. `Let no one, [\q 194/] O bhikkhus, who is affected with

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">The officers who were at the head of the army
told the thing to the Magadha King Seniya Bimbis&agrave;ra. And the Magadha

Then Up&agrave;li's father and mother said to themselves: `If Up&agrave;li

learn money changing<sup><a href="#N_159_">(159)</a></sup>, he would after

Up&agrave;li's father and mother said to themselves: `If Up&agrave;li learns
money-changing, his eyes will suffer. Now here are the Sakyaputtiya sama&otilde;as,
who keep commodious precepts and live a commodious life; they have good
meals and lie down on beds protected from the wind. If Up&agrave;li could

ordained, Sir, we will be ordained also.' Then those boys went each to
his father and mother and said to them: `Give me your consent for leaving
the world and going forth into the houseless state.' Then the parents of
those boys, who thought, `It is a good thing what all these boys are wishing
so unanimously for,' gave their consent. They went to the bhikkhus and
asked them for the pabbajj&agrave; ordination. The bhikkhus conferred the
pabbajj&agrave; and upasampad&agrave; ordinations on them.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">4. In the night at dawn, they rose and began
to cry: `Give us rice-milk, give us soft food, give us hard food!' The
bhikkhus said: `Wait, friends, till day-time. If there is rice-milk, you
shall drink; if there is food, soft or hard, you shall eat; if there is
no rice-milk and no food, soft or hard, you must go out for alms, and then
you will eat.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

to the Venerable Ananda: `Now, Ananda, what noise of boys is that?'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

at R&agrave;jagaha as long as He thought fit, went forth to [\q 208/] Kapilavatthu.
Wandering from place to place He came to Kapilavatthu. There the Blessed

(Banyan grove).</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">And in the forenoon the Blessed One, having

down on a seat laid out for Him.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Then the princess, who was the mother of R&agrave;hula<sup><a href="#N_167_">(167)</a></sup>

ask Him for your inheritance.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

before the Blessed One (and said): your shadow, sama&otilde;a, is a place
of bliss.' Then the Blessed One rose from His seat and went away, and young
R&agrave;hula followed the Blessed One from behind and said: `Give me my
inheritance, sama&otilde;a; give me my inheritance, sama&otilde;a.' Then
the Blessed One said to the Venerable S&agrave;riputta: `Well, S&agrave;riputta,
confer the pabbajj&agrave; ordination on young R&agrave;hula.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">3. In consequence of that and on this occasion
the Blessed One, after having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed

one shoulder, salute the feet of the bhikkhus (with his head), and sit
down squatting; then let him raise his joined hands and tell him to say:
"I take my refuge in the Buddha, I take my refuge in the Dhamma, I take
my refuge in the Sa&iuml;gha. And for the second time, &amp;c. And for

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">4. Then the Sakka Suddhodana went to the place
where the Blessed One was; having approached Him and having respectfully
saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near Him. Sitting near Him the Sakka
Suddhodana said to the Blessed One: `Lord, I ask one boon of the Blessed
One.' (The Buddha replied): `The perfect ones, Gotama, are above granting
boons (before they know what they are<sup><a href="#N_168_">(168)</a></sup>).'

B. Horner as `monk', <i>Book of the Discipline</i>, Vol. IV, p. vi</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><a NAME="N_2_"></a><font face="Times_CSX+">2. To this book is prefixed,
as<b> </b>introduction, an account of the first events after Gotama's attaining<b>
</b>Buddhahood, down to the conversion of his two chief disciples, S&agrave;riputta
and Moggall&agrave;na (chaps. 1-24). Among the elements of historical or
legendary character with which, in the Vinaya Pi<i>&ntilde;</i>aka, the
discussion of the monastic discipline is interwoven, this account occupies
by far the first place, both in extent and in importance. For it contains
the oldest version accessible to us now and, most probably, for ever, of
what the Buddhist fraternity deemed to be the history of their master's
life in its most important period.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">The connection in which this legendary narration
stands with the main subject of the first Khandhaka is not difficult to
account for. The regulations regarding the admission to the fraternity,
which are discussed in this Khandhaka, could not but present themselves
to the redactors of the Pi&ntilde;aka as being the very basis of their
religious discipline and monastic life. It was possible to fancy the existence
of the Sa&iuml;gha without the P&agrave;timokkha rules, or without the
regulations about the pav&agrave;ran&agrave; festival, but it was impossible
to realise the idea of a sa&iuml;gha without rules showing who was to be
regarded as a duly admitted member of the fraternity, and who was not.
It is quite natural, therefore, that the stories or legends concerning,
the ordination of bhikkhus were put in connection with the record of the
very first events of the history of the Sa&iuml;gha<b>.</b></font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Nor is it difficult to account for the theory
formulated by the historians of the Buddhist ecclesiastical law, of different
successive forms in which the ordination of bhikkhus had been performed.
In the beginning, of course, there was nobody but the Buddha himself who
could ordain bhikkhus; to him those who desired to be received, expressed.
Their wish, and he conferred on them the pabbajj&agrave; and upasampad&agrave;
ordinations by the formula: ` ehi bhikkhu,' &amp;c.(see i,6,32,34,&amp;c.)
It was a very natural conception that afterwards, as the sa&iuml;gha grew
larger, the Buddha should have transferred the power of admitting new members
to the bhikkhus themselves, and should have instituted that form of ordination
which the redactors of the Pi&ntilde;aka found valid at their own time.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">The transition, however, from the supposed oldest
form of ordination (the so-called ehi-bhikkhu-upasampad&agrave;) to that
latter form is in the Vinaya legends not represented as immediate. There
is described an intermediate stage between the two, the ordination <i>by
</i>the three saranagamanas, or by the candidate's three times repeated
declaration of his taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sa&iuml;gha
(see Mah&agrave;vagga I, 12). The reason which has led the redactors of
the Vinaya Pi&ntilde;aka to this construction, was most probably the important
part which in the upasampad&agrave; service of the later time devolved
upon the preceptor (upajjh&agrave;ya) of the candidate. As only learned
bhikkhus, who had completed the tenth year after their own upasampad&agrave;,
could perform the function of upajjh&agrave;ya at the upasampad&agrave;
ordination of other bhikkhus (Mah&agrave;vagga 1, 31, 8), it was natural
that the redactors of the Vinaya found it impossible to ascribe this form
of upasampad&agrave; service to the first times of Buddha's teaching. For
these times, therefore, they recorded another form, the upasampad&agrave;
by the three saranagamanas, the introduction of which they assigned, very
naturally, to the time soon after the conversion of Yasa's friends, by
which event the number of bhikkhus had been augmented at once from seven
to sixty-one.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

<p><a NAME="N_4_"></a><font face="Times_CSX+"><font size=-1>4.After having
reached the Sambodhi and before preaching to the world the Truth he has
acquired, the Buddha remains, according to the tradition, during some weeks
at Uruvel&agrave;, (enjoying the bliss of emancipation). The Mah&agrave;vagga,
which contains these legends in their oldest forms, assigns to this stay
a period of four times seven days; the later tradition is unanimous in
extending it to seven times seven days (Buddhaghosa in the commentary on
the Mah&agrave;vagga; J&agrave;taka Atthav. vol.i. p.77 seq.; D&atilde;pava&uuml;sa

<p><a NAME="N_5_"></a><font face="Times_CSX+"><font size=-1>5. The chain
of causation, or the doctrine of the twelve nid&agrave;nas (causes of existence),
contains, as has often been observed, in a more developed form an answer
to the same problem to which the second and third of the four noble Truths
(ariyasacca) also try to give a solution, viz. The problem of the origin
and destruction of suffering. The noble Truths simply reduce the origin
of suffering to thirst, or desire (tanh&agrave;), in its threefold form,
thirst for pleasure, thirst for existence, thirst for prosperity (see I,
6, 20).<b> </b>In the system of the twelve nid&agrave;nas thirst also has
found its place among the causes of suffering, but it is not considered
as the immediate cause. A concatenation of other categories is inserted
between tanh&agrave; and its ultimate effect; and on the other hand, the
investigation of causes is carried on further beyond tanh&agrave;. The
question is here asked, what does tanh&agrave; come from? And thus the
series of causes and effects is led back to avijj&agrave; (ignorance),
as its deepest root. We may add that the redactors of the Pi&ntilde;akas,
who of course could not but observe this parallelity between the second
and third ariyasakkas and the system of the twelve nid&agrave;nas, go so
far, in one instance (Anguttara Nik&agrave;ya, Tika-Nip&agrave;ta, fol.
ke of the Phayre MS.), As to directly replace, in giving the text of the
four ariyasakkas, the second and third of them by the twelve nid&agrave;nas,
in direct and reverse order respectively. Professor Childers has furnished
a valuable note on the nid&agrave;nas; see Colebrooke, miscellaneous essays
(second edition), ii, 453 seq.</font></font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><a NAME="N_6_"></a><font face="Times_CSX+"><font size=-1>6. In the Samm&agrave;ditthisuttanta
(Majjhima-Nik&agrave;ya, fol. kh&aring; of Turnour's MS.) We find the following
explanation of what ignorance is: ` not to know suffering, not to know
the cause of suffering, not to know the cessation of suffering, not to
know the path which leads to the cessation of suffering, this is called
ignorance.' the same is repeated in the explanation or the nid&agrave;na
formula, which is given in the Vibha&iuml;ga (Abhidhamma Pi&ntilde;aka,
Paticcasamuppadavibha&iuml;ga fol. ki of the Phayre MS.), And we must accept
it, therefore, as the authentic expression of Buddhistical belief. It is
obvious, however, that this explanation leaves room for another question.
Ignorance, we are told, is the source of all evil and of all suffering,
and the subject ignored is stated to be the four Truths. But who is the
subject that ignores them? All attributes (as the vi&curren;&curren;&agrave;na,
&amp;c.), That constitute sentient beings and enable them to know or to
ignore, are said to be first produced by ignorance, and we should conclude,
therefore, that they cannot exist before ignorance has begun to act. Or
are we to understand that it is the ignorance incurred by a sentient being
in a preceding existence, that causes the sa&iuml;kharas and consciousness,
the connecting links between the different existences, to act and to bring
about the birth of a new being?</font></font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+"><font size=-1>As is well known, this ignorance
(avijj&agrave;) plays a great part also in the Brahmanical philosophy of
the Upanishads; and the Buddhist belief is, no doubt, founded to a considerable
extent on older theories. But we cannot venture in a note to touch upon
one of the most difficult and interesting questions which await the research
of Indianists.</font></font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><a NAME="N_7_"></a><font face="Times_CSX+"><font size=-1>7.&nbsp; It
is very frequently stated that there are three sa&iuml;kharas or productions:
k&agrave;yasa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra, vac&atilde;sa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra, and cittasa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra,
or, productions of body, of speech, and of thought (see, for instance,
the Samm&agrave;ditthisuttanta, Majjhima Nik&agrave;ya, fol. kh&aring;
of Turnour's MS.) The k&agrave;yasa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra consists, according
to the Sa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra Yamaka (Abhidhamma Pi&ntilde;aka), in inhalation
and expiration (ass&agrave;sapass&agrave;s&agrave;); the vac&atilde;sa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra
in attention and investigation (vitakkavic&agrave;r&agrave;); the cittasa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra
in ideas, sensations, and all attributes of mind except attention and investigation
(sa&curren;&curren;&agrave; ca vedan&agrave; ca thapetv&agrave; vitakkavik&agrave;re
sabbe pi cittasampayuttak&agrave; dhamm&agrave;). The Vibha&iuml;ga (Abhidhamma
Pi&ntilde;aka, Paticcasamuppadavibha&iuml;ga, 1.1.) Gives, when discussing
the sa&iuml;kharas, six categories instead of the three: ` now which are
the sa&iuml;kharas that are produced by ignorance? Sa&iuml;kharas (or,
productions) that lead to righteousness, sa&iuml;kharas that lead to sinfulness,
sa&iuml;kharas that lead to immovability, productions of body, of speech,
and of thought.' the P&agrave;li words are: `Tattha katame avijj&agrave;
paccay&agrave; sa&iuml;kh&agrave;r&agrave;? Pu&curren;&curren;&agrave;bhisa&iuml;kh&agrave;ro
apu&curren;&curren;&agrave;bhisa&iuml;kh&agrave;ro &agrave;&otilde;a&curren;g&agrave;bhisa&iuml;kh&agrave;ro
k&agrave;yasa&iuml;kh&agrave;ro vac&atilde;sa&iuml;kharo cittasa&iuml;kh&agrave;ro.'
the list of fifty-five categories belonging to the sa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra
khandha, which sp. Hardy gives in his Manual (p. 404 seq.; Comp. Also Rh.
D., `Buddhism,' p. 91 seq., And `Buddhist suttas from the P&agrave;li,'

<p><a NAME="N_12_"></a><font face="Times_CSX+"><font size=-1>12. The term
Tath&agrave;gata is, in the Buddhistical literature, exclusively applied
to Samm&agrave;sambuddhas, and it is more especially used in the Pi&ntilde;akas
when the Buddha is represented as speaking of himself in the third person
as `The Tath&agrave;gata'. The meaning `Sentient being,' which is given
to the word in the Abhidh&agrave;nappad&atilde;pik&agrave;, and in Childers's
dictionary, is not confirmed, as far as we know, by any passage of the
Pi&ntilde;akas. This translation of the word is very possibly based merely
on a misunderstanding of the phrase often repeated in the Sutta Pi&ntilde;aka:
hoti Tath&agrave;gata par M&agrave;ra, which means, of course, ` does a
Buddha exist after death?' in the Jaina books we sometimes find the term
tatthagaya (tatragata), `he who has attained that world, i.e. emancipation,'
applied to the jinas as opposed to other beings who are called Inageya
(idhagata), living in this world.' see, for instance, the Jinacaritra,
#16. Considering the close relation in which most of the dogmatical terms
of the Jainas stand to those of the Bauddhas, it is difficult to believe
that Tath&agrave;gata and tatthagaya should not originally have conveyed
very similar ideas. We think that on the long way from the original M&agrave;gadh&atilde;
to the P&agrave;li and Sanskrit, the term tatthagata or tatth&agrave;gata
(tatra+agata), `He who has arrived there, i.e. At emancipation,' may very
easily have undergone the change into Tath&agrave;gata, which would have
made it unintelligible, were we not able to compare its unaltered form
as preserved by the Jainas.</font></font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

Onitapattap&agrave;ni, which is said very frequently of a person who has
finished his meal, is translated by Childers, ` whose hand is removed from
the bowl' (comp. Also Trenckner, P&agrave;li miscellany, p. 66). We do
not think this explanation right, though it agrees with, or probably is
based on, a note of Buddhaghosa ('pattato ca apan&atilde;tap&agrave;&otilde;i&uuml;').
Onita, i.e. avan&atilde;ta, is not apan&atilde;ta, and the end of the dinner
was marked, not by the bhikkhu's removing his hand from the bowl, but by
his washing the bowl (see Cullavagga VIII, 4,. 6), and, of course, his
hands. In Sanskrit the, meaning of ava-n&atilde; is, to pour (water) upon
something; see the Petersburg dictionary. We have translated, therefore,
on&atilde;tapattap&agrave;&otilde;i accordingly.</font></font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

Because there was no Sa&iuml;gha at that time, their declaration of taking

This was a position of honour among the merchants. In the later literature
we hear of an office of se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;i (se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;i-&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;ana)
in a city, to which any one with the requisite wealth and talent was eligible
(J&agrave;taka I, 120-122); and, according to the Mah&agrave;va&uuml;sa,
the king appointed to an office called se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;ita, apparently
at his court(Mah.p.69). The gahapati, or treasurer, one of the seven jewels
of a king, is explained by Buddhaghosa to be se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;igahapati
(see Rh. D.'s note on Mah&agrave;sudassana Sutta I, 41). `The se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;i,'
standing alone, or `the mah&agrave;-se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;i,' means
An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika (J&agrave;taka I, 95, 227-230; Dhammapada
commentary, p. 395). Below, in chapter 9, sect. x, it would seem that the
rank of se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;i was hereditary, and this is confirmed
by the later literature; but this applies to the social rank only, and
not to the office.</font></font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

The ten ariyav&agrave;sas. Buddhaghosa says: dasasu ariyav&agrave;sesu

follows: 1. Being free from the five bad qualities (pa&iuml;ca&iuml;ga),
2. Being possessed of the six good qualities (chala&iuml;ga), 3. Being
guarded in the one thing (ek&agrave;rakkha), 4. Observing four things (catur&agrave;passena),
5. Rejecting each of the four false Truths (panunna pacceka-sacca), 6.
Seeking right things (samavayasa- dhesana),,7. Having pure aims (an&agrave;vila-sa&iuml;kappa),
8. Being full of ease (passaddhak&agrave;ya-sa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra), 9. Being
emancipated in heart (suvimuttacitta), 10. Being emancipated in ideas (suvimuttapa&curren;&curren;a).

extraordinary grammatical construction of the first seven words. Compare

instance, sect. 4). After the &curren;atti follows the question put to
the bhikkhus present if they approve the resolution. This question is put
either once or three times; in the first case we leave a &curren;attidutiya
kamma (see, for instance, ii chap. 6); in the second case, a &curren;atticatuttha

&acirc;cariya as well as upajjh&agrave;ya means `Teacher,' or preceptor.'
it is very difficult or rather impossible to draw a sharp line of distinction
between &agrave;cariya and upajjh&agrave;ya. The duties of an &agrave;cariya
towards his antev&agrave;sika, and of an antev&agrave;sika towards his
&agrave;cariya, as indicated in chaps. 32, 33 (Cullavagga VIII, 13, 14),
are exactly the same as those of an upajjh&agrave;ya towards his saddhivih&agrave;rika
and vice versa (chaps. 25, 26 Cullavagga VIII, 11, 1 2). The position of
an upajjh&agrave;ya however was considered as the more important of the
two; at the upasampad&agrave; service the upajjh&agrave;ya had a more prominent
part than the &agrave;cariya, as we may infer from chaps. 28, 29, and from
the explanations on the 65th p&agrave;cittiya rule which are given in the
Sutta Vibha&iuml;ga. There it is said that, if the upasampad&agrave; ordination
had been conferred, against the rule, on a person that has not yet attained
his twentieth year, the upajjh&agrave;ya has made himself guilty of a p&agrave;cittiya
offence, the &agrave;cariya and the other present bhikkhus only of a dukka&ntilde;a
offence. We may add that the succession of Vinaya teachers from Up&agrave;li
down to Mahinda, which is given in the D&atilde;pava&uuml;sa (Bh&agrave;nav&agrave;ra
iv and v), is a succession of upajjh&agrave;yas and saddhivih&agrave;rikas
(see iv, 36, 42, 43, &amp;c.), Not of &agrave;cariyas and antev&agrave;sikas;
the duty of instructing the young bhikkhus in the holy doctrines and ordinances
seems, therefore, to belong to the upajjh&agrave;ya rather than to the
&agrave;cariya; compare also D&atilde;pava&uuml;sa vii, 26. So among the
br&agrave;hma&otilde;as, on the contrary, the &agrave;cariya is estimated
higher than the upajjh&agrave;ya; see Manu II, 145; Y&agrave;j&curren;avalkya
I, 35. Compare also chap. 36,1 (end of the paragraph), and Buddhaghosa's

Nissaya (i.e. dependence) is the relation between &agrave;cariya and antev&agrave;sika.
The antev&agrave;sika lives `niss&agrave;ya' with regard to the &agrave;cariya,
i.e. dependent on him; the &agrave;cariya gives his nissaya to the antev&agrave;sika,
i.e. he receives him into his protection and care. At chap. 36. 1, `Nissaya'

cessation of the nissaya (towards the &agrave;cariya) is the consequence.

Here follow some &uacute;lokas, probably written in Ceylon, and an elaborate
table of contents, both of which we leave untranslated. The &uacute;lokas
are introductory to the table of contents (udd&agrave;na) and belong to
