<p><font face="Times_CSX+">1. At that time the Blessed Buddha dwelt near
R&agrave;jagaha, on the Gigghak&aring;&ntilde;a mountain (`the vulture's
peak'). At that time the paribb&agrave;jakas belonging to titthiya schools
assembled or the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth day of each half month<sup><a href="#N_1_">(1)</a></sup>
and recited their Dhamma. The people went to them in order to hear the
Dhamma. They were filled with favour towards, and were filled with faith
in the paribb&agrave;jakas belonging to titthiya schools; the paribb&agrave;jakas
belonging to titthiya schools gained adherents.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">2. Now when the Magadha King Seniya Bimbis&agrave;ra
was alone, and had retired into solitude, the following consideration presented
itself to his mind: `The paribb&agrave;jakas belonging to titthiya schools

month and recite their Dhamma. The people go to them in order to hear the
Dhamma. They are filled with favour towards, and are filled with faith
in, the paribb&agrave;jakas who belong to titthiya [\q 240/] schools; the
paribb&agrave;jakas who belong to titthiya schools gain adherents. What
if the Reverend ones (the Buddhist bhikkhus) were to assemble also on the
fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth day of each half month.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">3. Then the Magadha King Seniya Bimbis&agrave;ra
went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached Him and
having respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near Him. Sitting
near Him the Magadha King Seniya Bimbis&agrave;ra said to the Blessed One:
`Lord, when I was alone and had retired into solitude the following, consideration
presented itself to my mind: "The paribb&agrave;jakas, &amp;c.; what if
the Reverend ones were to assemble also on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and
eighth day of each half month." Well, Lord, let the Reverend ones assemble
also on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth day of each half month.'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">4. Then the Blessed One taught, incited, animated,
and gladdened the Magadha King Seniya Bimbis&agrave;ra by religious discourse;
and the Magadha King Seniya Bimbis&agrave;ra, having been taught . . .
and gladdened by the Blessed One by religious discourse, rose from his
seat, respectfully saluted the Blessed One, passed round Him with his right
side towards Him, and went away.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">In consequence of that and on this occasion
the Blessed One, after having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed
the bhikkhus: `I prescribe, O bhikkhus, that you assemble on the fourteenth,
fifteenth, and eighth day of each month.</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">At that time the bhikkhus, considering that
the Blessed One had ordered them to assemble on the fourteenth &amp;c.
day of each half month, assembled on the fourteenth &amp;c. day of each
half month and sat there silent. The people went to them in order to hear
the dhamma. They were annoyed, murmured, and became angry: `How can the
Sakyaputtiya sama&otilde;as, when they have assembled on the fourteenth
&amp;c. day of each half month, sit there silent, like the dumb, or like
hogs? Ought they not, to recite the Dhamma, when they have assembled?'
Some bhikkhus heard those people that were annoyed, murmured, and had become
angry; these bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One. In consequence
of that and on this occasion the Blessed One, after having delivered a
religious discourse, thus addressed the bhikkhus: `I prescribe, O bhikkhus,
that you recite the Dhamma, when you have assembled on the fourteenth &amp;c.

I have promulgated to [\q 242/] them; this will be their Uposatha service
(service of the fast-day).'</font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">2. And the Blessed One, having left the solitude
in the evening, in consequence of that and on this occasion, after having
delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the bhikkhus: `When I was

is the matter if before an [\q 243/] assembly like this a question has
been solemnly proclaimed three times: if a bhikkhu, after a threefold proclamation,
does not confess an existing offence which he remembers, he commits an
intentional falsehood. Now, Reverend brethren, an intentional falsehood
has been declared an impediment<sup><a href="#N_5_">(5)</a></sup> by the

Buddhaghosa's note on this passage contains some details regarding the
way which Mah&agrave; Kassapa went. Andhakavinda is three g&agrave;vuta
distant from R&agrave;jagaha. There were eighteen (?the MS. Reads: a&ntilde;&ntilde;h&agrave;ra
mah&agrave;vih&agrave;ra) great vih&agrave;ras around R&agrave;jagaha included
by the same boundary which Buddha himself had consecrated. The Uposatha
service for this whole district was performed in the Veluvana monastery.
The river which Mah&agrave; Kassapa crossed on his way to the Veluvana
was the Sappin&atilde;, which rises in the Gijjhak&aring;&ntilde;a mountain.</font></font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><a NAME="N_18_"></a><font face="Times_CSX+"><font size=-1>18.&nbsp;
Tic&atilde;varena avippav&agrave;sa means not parting with the three robes
which belong to the usual `parikkh&agrave;r&agrave;' (requisites) of a
bhikkhu. Bhikkhus were not allowed to part with their civaras, excepting
under special circumstances and for a limited time (see the P&agrave;timokkha,
29th nissaggiya dhamma). Conferring the character of ticivarena avippav&agrave;sa
on a boundary means, we believe, to determine that it should be free td
bhikkhus residing within this boundary, to keep a set of robes wherever
they liked within the same boundary (excepting in a village, sect. 3),
and that such an act should not be considered as parting with the robes.</font></font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
<p><a NAME="N_19_"></a><font face="Times_CSX+"><font size=-1>19.&nbsp;
Buddhaghosa observes that this rule applies to bhikkhus only and not to
bhikkhunis. For bhikkhunis reside only in villages; there would be no civaraparih&agrave;ra
at all for bhikkhunis, if they were to use the kammav&agrave;c&agrave;
given in sect. 4. Buddhaghosa also observes at this occasion that the boundaries
of the bhikkhusa&iuml;gha and of the bhikkhunisa&iuml;gha are quite independent
from each other and that the rules given in chap. 13 do not refer to boundaries
the one of which belongs to the bhikkhusa&iuml;gha, the other to the bhikkhunisa&iuml;gha.</font></font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

Enumeration's of terms indicating the different cases that come under a
Vinaya rule or a dogmatical proposition are called m&agrave;tik&agrave;
for instance, in discussing the first p&agrave;r&agrave;jika rule the Vibha&iuml;ga
gives the following m&agrave;tik&agrave;pad&agrave;ni: tisso itthiyo manussitthi
amanussitthi tiracch&agrave;nagatitthi, tayo ubhatovya&curren;janak&agrave;
manussubhatovya&curren;janako amanussubh tiracch&agrave;nagatubh., &amp;c.

P&agrave;risuddhi, literally, means, purely. He declares that he is pure

We have no doubt that this is the correct translation of vibbhamati (see
I, 39, 5). The difference between vibbhamati (he returns to the world)
and sikkha&uuml; paccakk&agrave;ti (he abandons the precepts) seems to
be that the former is an informal, and the latter a formal, renunciation
of the order.</font></font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

The precepts are abandoned (sikkh&agrave; paccakkh&agrave;t&agrave; hoti)
by declaring that one abandons the Buddha, or the Dhamma, or the Sa&iuml;gha,
or the Vinaya, &amp;c. By such a declaration a bhikkhu who wishes to return
to a layman's life, or to go over to a titthiya sect gives up his character
as a member of the Buddhist fraternity. The rules about the sikkh&agrave;paccakkh&agrave;na
are given in the Vibha&iuml;ga, in the explanation of the first p&agrave;r&agrave;jika
rule (chap. 8, sect. a).</font></font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

The same three cases are distinguished here as in 3, according as the number
of bhikkhus who are late, is greater, the same, or smaller than that of
the other bhikkhus. The first case is decided by Buddha as above; in the
decision of the second and third cases, instead of `let those (who have
arrived late) hear the rest' read: I let those (who have arrived late)
proclaim their p&agrave;risuddhi in the presence (of the other brethren)!</font></font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

Remarks like this, which indicate the rules for supplying abbreviated passages,
do not belong, strictly speaking, to the text of the Vinaya itself, but
form a posterior addition, as is shown also by grammatical peculiarities.
In chaps. 28-32 we have seventy-five cases, or twenty-five triads ; all
of these triads contain the words: `they know that there are other resident
bhikkhus absent.' by successively varying these words six times, as is
indicated in chap. 33, we obtain a hundred and seventy-five triads.</font></font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

Buddhaghosa: `They who count the day as the fifteenth, arrive from a distant
kingdom, or they have held the preceding Uposatha on the fourteenth.' it
seems to follow from this remark of Buddhaghosa that after an Uposatha
on the fourteenth invariably an Uposatha on the fifteenth must follow,
i.e. the Uposatha may not he held on the fourteenth ad libitum, but only
in the second pakkha of the short months. Compare chap. 4 and the note
on chap. I. 1.</font></font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>

In the bhikkhunikhandhaka (Cullav. X, 1, 4) we are told that Buddha, when
admitting women to the order of mendicants, prescribed for them a probationary
course of instruction, which should last two years, after which time they
were to ask for the upasampad&agrave; ordination. During these two years
the candidates were called sikkham&agrave;n&agrave;s. Childers (Dict. s.v.
sikkhati) has misunderstood the Mah&agrave;va&uuml;sa (p. 37), when he
states that in the case of Asoka's daughter Samghamitt&agrave; the training
prescribed for the sikkham&agrave;n&agrave;s was absolved in a single day.</font></font><font face="Times_CSX+"></font>
