<H1 align=center>The Questions of King Milinda</H1>

<P>This is a translation of a series of dialogues between King Milinda and 
Nagasena, a Buddhist scholar. <CITE>The Questions of King Milinda</CITE> deals 
with some of the thorniest questions of Buddhism, religion and existence. The 
narrative proceeds in a cyclical fashion as the King proposes a difficult 
question of Nagasena, who responds typically with either a tale about the Buddha 
in some previous life, or an analogy. The book represents Southern Buddhism at 
an advanced stage of development. While difficult questions are addressed here, 
<CITE>Milinda</CITE> makes fascinating reading, as many of the issues are common 
to all religions. </P>
<P>These volumes were reprinted by Dover publications in 1963; unfortunately the 
Dover edition is now out of print; you may be able to find used copies, however.
