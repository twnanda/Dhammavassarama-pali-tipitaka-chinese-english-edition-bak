<P><EM>ON FEARS</EM></P>

<P><EM></EM>(1)	Fears (a)</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>BRETHREN, there are these four kinds of fear. What four ? Fear of self-censure, fear
of censure by others, fear of punishment and fear of rebirth in states of woe.</P>

<P>Brethren, what is fear of self-censure ? Herein, brethren, a certain person thus
considers `Were I indeed to commit misconduct by body, by word or by thought, how
can I not morally blame myself for such act ?' Thus frightened by self-censure, he
eschews misconduct by body and promotes good conduct by body and so forth and
leads a pure life. Brethren, this is said to be fear of self-censure (conscience).</P>

<P>Brethren, what is fear of censure by others ? Herein, brethren, a certain person
considers thus : 1 Were 1 indeed to commit misconduct by body, by word or by
thought, how can others not morally blame me for such act ?' Thus, frightened of
censure by others, he eschews misconduct by body and the like, and promotes good
conduct by body and so forth, and leads a pure life. Brethren, this is said to be fear of
censure by others.'</P>

<P>1These first two states are summed up in the word <EM>Itiri-ottappam.</EM></P>

<P>Brethren, what is fear of punishment ? Herein, brethren, a certain person sees a thief
guilty of a crime being taken by the king* and subjected to various kinds of
punishments such as : lashing with whips and canes, beating with split sticks," cutting
off of arm or leg, both arms and logs, ear or nose, both ear and nose, ripping skull and
applying a red-hot iron,' skimming the scalp [and applying gravel till it becomes
white as a chank].4</P>

<P>Burning the inside of the mouth,* the body and the band. Flaying the skin off from
throat to ankle, from neck to waist and from waist to ankle. Fixing the elbows and
knees to iron piles and nailing them, and lighting fires around. Flaying the skin, flesh
and veins with a sharp edge, tearing the body and smearing the wounds with salt
water.</P>

<P>Fixing the body on the ground by laying it prostrate on one side and planting an iron
rod through the ears on the ground, then whirling the body round. Crushing and
softening the body like a bunch of straw.' Pouring boiling oil on the body ; making it
a prey to hungry dogs. Impaling it whilst alive and severing the head with a sword.</P>

<P>Then he considers thus : ` Were I to commit a similar crime, I should also be taken up
by the king, who would</P>

torture seems doubtful. (Things like these were done in the late Great War.)</P>

<P>punish me in various ways such as the above, oven as an offending thief in
consequence of a crime is apprehended by the king and punished in various ways,
such as the above mentioned.' Thus frightened of punishment, he lives without
stealing others' property.</P>

<P>Brethren, this is said to be the fear of punishment.</P>

<P>Brethren, what is the fear of states of woe Herein, brethren, a certain person considers
thus:` Verily, there is the bad result of misconduct by body, word and thought, in the
world to come ; were I to commit misconduct by body, word and thought, how should
1, on the dissolution of the body after death, be not reborn in a state of woo, suffering
punishment and in the hells ? '</P>

<P>Thus frightened by the states of woe he eschews misconduct by body, word and
thought and promotes good conduct by body, word and thought and leads a pure life.</P>

<P>Brethren, this is said to be fear of states of woe.</P>

<P>Verily, brethren, there are these four (kinds of) fear.</P>

<P>(2)	' Fears (b)</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Brethren, there are these four kinds of fear that should be expected by the person who
descends into water. What four ? Fear of waves, fear of crocodiles, fear of whirlpools
and fear of fierce fishes. Brethren, he wh descends into water should expect these
four (kinds of) fear.</P>

<P>Likewise, brethren, here in this doctrine and discipline when a certain clansman
wanders forth out of the home</P>

<P>into the homeless state, he should expect four (kinds of) fear. What four ? Fear of
waves, of crocodiles, of whirlpools and of fierce fishes.</P>

<P>Brethren, what is fear of waves ? Herein, brethren, a certain clansman through faith
wanders forth out of the home into the homeless state (and thinks thus) :I am a victim
to birth, decay, death, grief, wailing, pain, distress and tribulation, and am overcome
by pain. Good indeed if I could see the ending of this whole mass of pain.' His co-mates in the holy life then exhort and instruct him who has so gone forth as follows:
'Thus should you go forward, thus should you go backward, thus should you look
forward, thus should you look backward, thus should you draw in or stretch out (your
limbs) and thus should you bear robe, mantle and bowl.'</P>

<P>Then he thus considers:` Indeed. when at home formerly we ourselves exhorted and
instructed others, but now we are like unto our sons and grandsons, and they think we
should be exhorted and instructed.' Thus angered and offended he altogether
abandons the training and takes again to the layman's life.</P>

<P>Brethren, this brother frightened by the tear of waves is said to abandon the training
and to take again to the layman's life. Indeed, brethren, fear of waves is a simile of
the state of being pervaded by anger.</P>

<P>Brethren, this is said to be the fear of waves.</P>

<P>Brethren, what is the fear of crocodiles? Heroin, brethren, a certain clansman <EM>[as</EM>
<EM>before].</EM> His co-mates in the holy life then exhort and instruct him who has so gone
forth as follows Thus should you eat and thus should</P>

<P>you not eat food solid or soft ; thus should you taste and not taste; thus should you
drink and not drink ; you should eat proper and not improper food, solid or soft. You
should taste what is proper and not what is improper ; you should drink what is
proper and not what is improper; you should drink at the right time and not at the
wrong time. You should eat solid or soft food at the right time not the wrong time.'</P>

<P>Then he considers thus: ` When indeed we wore formerly in the home we ate what we
wished, we tasted what we wished, we drank what we wished; what we wished not
we did not eat, taste or drink ; we ate, tasted and drank both what is proper and
improper, also at the right time and after proper hours.</P>

<P>Whenever faithful householders during the day after proper hours do not offer
delicious food hard or soft, he thinks that they are imposing (upon him) a prohibition
against eating. So he abandons the training and falls back into the layman's life.</P>

<P>Brethren, thus a brother frightened of crocodiles is said to fall back into the layman's
life, abandoning the training. Verily, brethren, the fear of crocodiles is a simile of
gluttony. Brethren, this is said to be the fear of crocodiles.</P>

<P>Brethren, what is the fear of whirlpools ?</P>

<P>Herein, brothren, a certain clansman owing to faith leaves the life. of home and
wanders forth into the homeless state and thinks thus: ` I am a victim [as before].'
Having thus gone forth, at dawn he dresses himself, and taking bowl and robe enters a
town or a village, unguarded in body, word and thought, with attention unfixed and</P>

<P>xiii. § 122]                                                   <EM>On Fears</EM>                                            159</P>

<P>senses uncontrolled. There he sees a householder or his son possessed of, and
gratified by, the five pleasures of sense. Then he thinks thus:</P>

<P>` We indeed formerly when at home were possessed of, and gratified by, the five
pleasures of sense. We had the wealth of the family and could enjoy it and do acts of
merit. Let me now forsake the training, go back to the layman's life, enjoy my
possessions and do acts of merit.' He thus forsakes the training and falls back into the
layman's life.</P>

<P>Brethren, thus a brother frightened by the fear of whirlpools is said to fall back to the
layman's life. Verily, brethren, fear of whirlpools is a metaphor for the five pleasures
of sense. This is said to be the fear of whirlpools.</P>

<P>Brethren, what is the fear of fierce fishes ?</P>

<P>Herein, brethren, a certain clansman through faith leaves the family life and wanders
forth into the homeless state and thinks thus I am a victim [as above]'........ with
senses uncontrolled.</P>

<P>There he sees a woman not properly clad or covered, and lust fastens on his heart. So
degraded by lust he forsakes the training and falls back into the layman's life.</P>

<P>Brethren, a brother frightened by the fear of fierce fishes is thus said to abandon the
training and to fall back into the layman's life. Verily, brethren, fear of fierce fishes
is a simile of woman. This is said to. be the fear of fierce fishes.</P>

<P>In sooth, brethren, these are the four (kinds of) fear, which certain clansman, who,
through faith in this doctrine and discipline, wander forth from the life of home to the
homeless life, should expect.</P>

<P>(3)	The Raptures (a)</P>

<P>There are these four persons to be found existing in the world. What four?</P>

<P>Herein, brethren, a certain person abstaining from sensual desires and from sinful acts
enters on and remains in the First Rapture,! wherein there is ecstasy and serenity
resulting from seclusion. He longs for it, tastes and enters into the joy of it, he takes
his stand thereon, applies applies himself to it, dwells incessantly on it, and without
falling away from it departs from this life and is reborn among the Brahma-K&agrave;yika
Devas." ' Brethren, the span of lifetime of the Brahma-Kflyika Devas is an aeon.</P>

<P>There, if a worldling, he lives as long as life lasts, and having spent the whole span of
life of such Devas, passes on either to purgatory, animal life, or the state of ghosts.</P>

<P>But the disciples of the Exalted One indeed live therein as long as life lasts, and
having spent the whole span of life of such Devas, in that state itself pass away to
Nibb&agrave;na."</P>

<P>'Verily, brethren, this is the difference, this is the distinction, and this is the
peculiarity of the learned Ariyan disciple and the ignorant worldling. This is their
quality and nature.</P>

<P>And again, brethren, herein a certain person, freeing the wind from reflection and
investigation and having it concentrated, retaining the joy consequent on the
tranquillity</P>

<P>1 Jh&agrave;na. These four j&agrave;nas are frequently described in the Canon. Cf. D, ii, 69-`
ecstatic tranees.'</P>

<P>3 Perfection in jh&agrave;na way make a person an&agrave;g&agrave;mi, non -returner. The question is
discussed at (Points of Cotroversy, p. 278) Kath&agrave; vatthu, XIII, 7. But this delight in
jh&agrave;na is not an essential of perf ection,</P>

<P>xiii. § 123]                                     <EM>On Fears</EM>                                                           161</P>

<P>of mind enters on and abides in the Second Rapture, which is freed alike from
reflection and investigation. He longs for it, tastes and enters into the joy of it, he
takes his stand thereon, applies himself to it, dwells incessantly on it, and without
falling away from it, departs from this life and is reborn among the Abhassara Devas.</P>

<P>Brethren, the span of life-time of the Abhassara Devas is two aeons. There if a
worldling he lives as long as life lasts, and having spent the whole span of life of such
Devas passes on either to purgatory, to animal life or to the states of the ghosts.</P>

<P>The disciples of the Exalted One indeed live therein as long as life lasts, and having
spent the whole span of life of such Devas in that state itself pass away to Nibbana.</P>

<P>Verily, brethren, this is the difference, this is the distinction and this is the peculiarity
of the learned Arian disciple and the ignorant worldling. This is their quality and
nature.</P>

<P>And again, brethren, a certain person dwells in joy,, passionlessness and equanimity,
and thoughtful and conscious, enjoys felicity of body. The holy ones declare this
thoughtful person dwelling at ease in equanimity to have entered on the Third
Rapture. He longs for it, tastes and enters into the joy of it, he takes his stand thereon,
applies himself  to it, dwells incessantly on it, and without falling away from it
departs from this life and is reborn among the Subhaki&otilde;ha Devas.* The life-span of
the Subhaki&otilde;ha gods is four aeons. There if a worldling he lives as long as life lasts,
and having spent the whole life-span of such Devas,</P>

<P>passes on either to purgatory, to animal life or to the state of the ghosts.</P>

<P>The disciples of the Exalted One indeed live therein as long as life lasts and having
spent the whole span of life of such Devas in that state itself pass away to Nibbana.</P>

<P>Verily, brethren, this the difference, this is the distinction and this the peculiarity of
the learned Ariyan disciple and the ignorant worldling. This is their quality and
nature.</P>

<P>And again, brethren, a certain person, divesting himself of pleasure and pain and
primarily freeing himself from happiness and sorrow arrives at and remains in the
Fourth Raptur- a state of mind indifferent alike to all emotion. He longs for it, tastes
and enters into the joy of it, he takes his stand thereon, applies himself to it, dwells
incessantly on it and without falling away from it departs from this life and is reborn
among the Vehapphala gods.*</P>

<P>Brethren, the life-span of the Vehapphala Devas is five hundred aeons. There if a
worldling he lives as long as life lasts, and having spent the whole span of life of such
Devas, passes on either to purgatory, to animal life, or the state of the ghosts. The
disciples of the Exalted One........... to Nibbana.</P>

<P>Verily, brethren, this is the difference, this is,the distinction and this the peculiarity of
the learned Ariyan disciple and the ignorant worldling. This is their quality and
nature.</P>

<P>Heroin, brethren, a certain person abstaining from sensual pleasures (as above) enters
on and abides in the First Rapture. Then indeed he thinks here there is form, feeling,
perception, conformations, consciousness and he perceives them as transitory,
painful, subject to disease ; as an imposthume, a dart, suffering, illness ; and as
something alien, subject to decay, empty and soulless. Upon the dissolution of the
body, after death, he is reborn among the Suddh&agrave;vasa * Devas. Brethren, this kind of
rebirth is not shared by the worldlings.</P>

<P>[Similarly, with regard to the Second, Third, and Fourth Raptures, the person who
enters them is reborn in the Suddh&agrave;vasa abodes.]</P>

world, including all sentient beings, with thoughts of compassion, with thoughts of
