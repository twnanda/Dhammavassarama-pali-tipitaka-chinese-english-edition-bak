<P>CHAPTER XI</P>

<P>ON CLOUDS</P>

<P><EM>   Different Kinds of Clouds* (a)</EM></P>

<P><EM></EM>Thus have 1 heard. At one time the Exalted One stayed in An&agrave;thapinika's pleasure-grove in the Jeta Wood near S&agrave;vatthi. Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren
thus: " 0 brethren ! " They responded Yea, Lord ! " and the Exalted One spake thus</P>

<P>"Brethren, there are these four (kinds of) clouds. What four ? That which produces
thunder but not rain. That which produces rain but not thunder. That which produces
neither thunder nor rain. And that which produces both thunder and rain. These,
brethren, are the four clouds.</P>

<P>Likewise, brethren, there are to be found existing in the world these four persons who
can be compared to these clouds. What four ? He who produces thunder but not rain.
He who produces rain but not thunder. He who produces neither thunder nor rain.
And he who produces both thunder and rain.</P>

<P>Brethren, who is the person that produces thunder but not rain ?' Herein, brethren, a
certain person is a talker</P>

<P><EM>Cf. Pugg., </EM>Pa¤¤. IV, 8 (where Comy. says this section is spoken by a d&agrave;yaka.')</P>

<P>xi. &uuml; 108]                                   On  Clouds                                                           135</P>

<P>but not a doer.*Indeed, brethren, this is the person who produces thunder but not rain.
Just as, brethren, the cloud produces thunderbut not rain, so do I speak of this person</P>

<P>in this simile of the cloud." [The rest of this discourse may be understood mutatis
mutandis.]</P>

<P><EM>(2) Clouds (b)</EM></P>

<P><EM>[Repeat the same </EM>as in <EM>the previous discourse and add :]</EM>Who is the person, brethren,
that produces thunder but not rain ? Herein, brethren, a certain person masters the
Norm comprising <EM>Suttam, Geyyam</EM>. and so forth.* But he does not know, as they
really are, Ill, the origin of Ill, the ceasing of Ill and the Path leading to the cessation
of Ill. Indeed, brethren, this person produces thunder but not rain. Just as, brethren,
the cloud produces thunder but not rain, I speak, brethren, of this person in this simile
of the cloud.</P>

<P><EM>[The rest of this discourse may be understood  mutatis mutandis.]</EM></P>

<P><EM>(3)The  Jars</EM></P>

<P><EM></EM>Brethren, there are four (kinds of) jars. What four ? The empty and closed, the full
and open' the empty and open, and the full and closed. These., brethren, are the four.</P>

<P>Likewise brethren, there are to be found existing in the world these four persons, who
may be compared to these jars. What four&gt; He who is empty and closed. He who</P>

<P>136                                    The Numerical Sayings                                      [TEXT ii,
105</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>is full and open, he who is empty and open and he who is full and closed.</P>

<P>Brethren, who is the person that is empty and closed?Herein, brethren, a certain
person in going forward, coming backward, looking backward, drawing in and
stretching out (his limbs), and in bearing alms-bowl and robes is (all) pleasant (to the
sight). But he does not know as they really are: This is Ill, this is the Origin of Ill, this
is the ceasing of Ill, and this is the Path leading to the cessation of Ill." This indeed,
brethren, is the person who is empty and closed. Just as, brethren, the jar is empty and
closed, likewise, brethren, I speak of such a person in this simile.</P>

<P><EM>[The rest of this discourse may be understood mutatiy mutandiv.]</EM></P>

<P><EM>(4)The Pools of Water (a)</EM></P>

<P><EM></EM>Brethren, there are these four (kinds of) pools of water. What four ? The shallow* but
deep-seeming, the deep but shallow-seeming, the shallow and shallow-seeming, and
the deep and deep-seeming.</P>

<P>Brethren, there are these four (kinds of) pools of water.*</P>

<P>(5)Pools of Water (b).</P>

<P>[Repeat for the same four persons as in the above and continue :] There are indeed,
brethren, these four persons</P>

<P>1 <EM>Utt&agrave;no</EM> means ` clear,' also shallow'. Here the context demands the latter meaning.</P>

<P>2 This discourse is not in any of the MSS. but the <EM>Udd&agrave;na</EM> shows there ought to be
two discourses on` Pools of Water'. So P. T. 8. Ed. has included this discourse.</P>

<P>xi. § 106]                                  On Clouds                                                           137</P>

the same four persons.] </EM>Brethren, who is the person that is shallow but deepseeming <EM>?

four persons to be found existing in the world who may be compared to these
mangoes. What four ? The unripe that looks ripe, the ripe that looks unripe, the
unripe that looks unripe and the ripe that looks ripe.</P>

<P>Brethren, who is the person that is unripe but looks ripe ? <EM>[Repeat mutatis </EM>mutandi.9

does not live in it, the one that lives without digging (its own hole), the one that
neither digs: a hole nor lives in it, and the one that both digs a hole and lives in it.
Indeed, brethren, there are</P>

against the cows of its own herd but not against the cows of another's herd. The one
that is violent against the cows of another's herd but not against the cows of its own
herd. The one that is violent against the cows of both herds. And the one that is not
violent against the cows of either herd, Indeed, brethren, there are these four (kinds

persons, who may be compared to these oxen. What four ?.<EM> [Repeat the same as

terrifies his own companions but not another's companions. <EM>[-The rest may be

<P>Brethren, here a certain person often gets angry, his anger, however, does not last for
a long time. This indeed, brethren, is the person possessed of poison but who is not
fierce. Just as, brethren, a snake has poison but is not fierce, so do I speak of this
person in terms of this simile.</P>
