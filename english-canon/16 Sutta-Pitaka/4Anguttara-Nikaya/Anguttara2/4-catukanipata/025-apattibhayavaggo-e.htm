<P>ON FEAR OF OFFENCE</P>

<P><EM>(1) Causes of -Disunion</EM></P>

<P><EM></EM>Once, the Exalted One dwelt at Kosambi in Ghosita Park.  Then the venerable
&acirc;nanda came to the Exalted One.....	To the venerable &acirc;nanda so seated the Exalted
One	spake thus:</P>

<P>"How now &acirc;nanda ? Is that dispute settled ?</P>

<P>"Lord, how can that dispute be settled?  Lord, the venerable Anuruddha's co-resident,
by name Bahiya,* is bent upon causing disunion in the Order in all manner of ways. 
Now the venerable Anuruddha does not think he should speak even one word."*</P>

<P>&acirc;nanda, when did the venerable Anuruddha ever give rise to any disputes in the
midst of the assembly ? Is it not the case that, when disputes arise, you and S&agrave;riputta
and Moggall&agrave;na settle* them all ? &acirc;nanda, a sinful brother seeing these four causes
delights in causing disunion in the Order.  What four ?</P>

<P>1 At Kh, P. <EM>Comy. </EM>115 he is called B&agrave;hiko.  For B&agrave;hiya see <EM>Ud&agrave;na i</EM>,10.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Herein, &acirc;nanda, a sinful brother is immoral, wicked, unclean, of suspicious*
behaviour ; conceals his actions, is not a true recluse but pretends to be a recluse ; is
unchaste but pretends to be chaste, is putrid within, wet with the rain of lusts, a
rubbish heap of impurity.  To him this thought occurs : ` Now then, the brethren will
know me as immoral and so forth..... and full of impurity.  If united they will ruin me,
but divided they will not ruin me.' &acirc;nanda, seeing this first result the sinful brother
delights in causing disunion in the Order.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Again, &acirc;nanda, a sinful brother holds false views and clings to extreme (heretical)
views.  To him this thought occurs `Now the brethren will know me as one who
holds. false views and clings to heretical views.  United they will ruin me, but divided
they will not ruin me." ,&acirc;nanda, seeing this second consequence the sinful brother
delights in causing disunion in the Order.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Again, &acirc;nanda, a sinful brother is one who earns a wrong livelihood and gains his
living by wrong means.  To him this thought occurs: 'Now the brethren will know me
as one who earns a wrong livelihood and gains a living by wrong means.  United they
will ruin me, but disunited they will not ruin me.' &acirc;nanda, seeing this third
consequence the sinful brother delights in causing disunion in the Order.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Again, &acirc;nanda, a sinful brother is desirous of gain, honour and praise.  To him this
thought occurs : 'Now indeed the brethren will know me as one desirous of gain,</P>

&acirc;nanda, seeing this fourth result the sinful brother delights in causing disunion in the
Order.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Verily, &acirc;nanda, seeing these four results a sinful brother delights in causing disunion
in the Order.'</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT><EM>(2) Fear of 0ffence</EM></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><EM></EM></FONT><EM></EM>Brethren, there are these four fears of offence.  What four ?</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Just as, brethren, if the King's officers' were to seize an offending thief and produce
him before the King (saying) `Your majesty, this is a thief who has offended thee. 
May your majesty inflict such punishment upon him as is desired.'</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Then the King says to them: `Go ye, my men, and having tightly tied this man's
hands to his back with a strong rope, having closely shaven him, having led him to
the beat of a harsh-sounding drum from street to street and from road-junction to
road-junction, and having taken him out of the southren gate of the city, cut his head
off.'</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Then, if the King's men, having done so, were to cut his head off, such a thought
occurs to a person standing by : `Forsooth, friends, this fellow has committed an evil
deed, contemptible and deserving of punishment by decapitation, inasmuch as the
King's men having tightly tied..... cut off his head.  Now, if 1 were he, I would not
commit such a wicked deed, contemptible and deserving of decapitation.'</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Do we not see cases of this in our daily life ?</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Cf.  Sam.  Nik., ii, 128.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Just so, brethren, when an intense fear overtakes a brother or a sister as regards
serious offences,* he or she must look for one of two courses-either not to fall into
serious offence, if he be guiltless of such ; or, if guilty, to make fit and proper amends
for such offence.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Just as if, brethren, a man having put on a black cloth, with hair dishevelled and
bearing a club* on his shoulder, should appear before a large body of people and say
Sirs, 1 have committed a wicked deed, contemptible and punishable with clubs. 
`Sirs, I will do what your worships please.'</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Then this thought occurs to a person standing close by :Forsooth, friends, this fellow
has committed a wicked deed..........  inasmuch as he, having put on a black cloth,
with hair dishevelled and bearing a club on his shoulder, appears before a large body
of people and makes confession <EM>(as above).  </EM>Surely, if 1 were he, I would not commit
such a wicked deed . . .' In like manner brethren, whenever an intense sense of fear
overtakes a brother or a sister as regards the secondary offences,' it is to be expected
that he or she, <EM>(as before).............*</EM> Again, just as if a man should don black clothes,
dishevel his hair and put a knapsack* on his shoulder, come to a large body</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT><EM>1 Par&agrave;dik&agrave;</EM> offences merited expulsion from the Order.</P>

with a bundle of hot ash !' Both here and at D.N. i, 98, such an explanation is
fanciful, and the etymology is wrong.  See <EM>Poli Dict. s.v. </EM>where it is shown to mean a
knapsack, a&uuml;sa-putant.  The Burmese MSS. not understanding, and following Comy.
read bhasma-putan&uuml;, 'ash-bag'.</P>

implication.  The idea to be conveyed is that in</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>of people and say: " <EM>Sirs, (as before).............</EM> Just so, wenever an intense sense of fear
overtakes a brother or a sister as regards the commission of the minor offences,' (as
<EM>before).</EM></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Just as if, brethren, a person having put on a black cloth with hair dishevelled appear
before a large body of people and say <EM>(as before).............</EM>Just so, brethren,whenever
an intense sense of fear overtakes a brother or a sister as regards the commission of
trivial*' offences, he or she must look for one of two courses-either not to offend at
all, if not already guilty, or, if guilty, to make fit and proper amends for such
offence.'</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>"Verily, brethren, there are these four fears of offence."</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>(3) The holy Life</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Brethren, this holy life is lived for the benefit of the training, for the higher wisdom,
for the sake of the reality of emancipation and for the mastery of mindfulness.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Brethren, what is the benefit of the training ?</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Herein, brethren, the lesser practices have been ordained by me for disciples with a
view to gladden the hearts of</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>the first instance the offence should be severely dealt with; in the second instance,
that the offence may be dropped like a bag from the shoulder.-[ED.]</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>1 There are ninety-two Pacittiya (` to be expiated') offences requiring confession and
absolution. <EM>-Sangh&agrave;dises&agrave; </EM>were thirteen offences only less serious than P&agrave;r&agrave;jik&agrave;, and
required suspension and penance, but not expulsion from the Order.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>2 P&agrave;tidesaniya were four offences which required only confession pointing out').</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>3 Thus the offences were <EM>grave, secondary, minor </EM>and trivial.  <EM>All </EM>these may be read
in Vinaya.Pi&ntilde;aka.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>the faithless and to confirm the faithful.  Brethren, inasmuch as the lesser practices
have been ordained by me for this purpose, so a brother becomes one who fulfils the
whole training, consistent, unblemished, unvaried, and, having undertaken the rules
of the training, keeps them.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Again, brethren, the practices leading to the highest purity of life have been ordained
by me for disciples for the proper and entire ending of sorrow.  Brethren, inasmuch as
the practices have been ordained by me for this purpose so a brother becomes one
who fulfils the whole of the training. . . . This is the benefit of the training.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Brethren, what is the higher wisdom ?</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Herein, brethren, the Norm* has been proclaimed by me to the disciples for the
proper and entire ending of sorrow.  Inasmuch as, brethren, the Norm has been so
ordained by me, a brother sees the Norm with the eye of wisdom.  Verily, brethren,
this is the higher wisdom.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Brethren, what is the reality of emancipation ?</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Herein, brethren, the Norm was proclaimed by me to the disciples for the entire and
complete ending of sorrow.  Inasmuch as the Norm has been so ordained by me <EM>(as
above)</EM>..... a brother has attained to the realisation of the Norm through emancipation.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Verily, brethren, this is the reality of emancipation.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Brethren what is the mastery of mindfulness ? (Saying)`Thus shall I fulfil the
unfulfilled lesser practices, and the fulfilled lesser practices shall I now safeguard
with wisdom' -so personal mindfulness is well established. `Thus shall I fulfil the
unfulfilled practices leading to the highest purity of life, and the fulfilled practices
leading to the highest</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>purity of life shall I now safeguard with wisdom,--so is personal mindfulness well-established. `Thus shall I see with the eye of wisdom the Norm that has not been so
seen, and the Norm seen with the eye of wisdom shall I now safeguard with wisdom'-so personal mindfulness is well established. `Thus shall I realise through
emancipation the unattained Norm, and the Norm attained through emancipation
shall I now safeguard with wisdom,'-so personal mindfulness is well established. 
Verily, brethren, this is the mastery of mindfulness.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Brethren, this holy life is lived for the benefit of the training, for the higher wisdom,
for the sake of the reality of emancipation and for the mastery of mindfulness. 
Whatsoever has been thus spoken, this is the reason why it was so spoken.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT><EM>(4) Postures</EM></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><EM></EM></FONT><EM></EM>Brethren, there are these four postures.  What four ?</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>The posture of the peta (ghost), the posture of the sensual person, the lion-like
posture and the posture of the Accomplished One.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Brethren, what is the posture of the peta ?</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Brethren, usually the petas lie down supine.* This is said to be the posture of the
petas.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Brethren, what is the posture of the sensual person ?</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>As a rule the sensual person lies down on his left side.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>This is said to be the posture of the sensual person.*</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Brethren, what is the lion-like posture ?</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>The lion, king of beasts, lies down on his right side, having placed one leg on another
and inserted his tail between the thighs.  When he awakes, he raises the upper part of
the body and looks round at the lower part of the body.  Then, brethren, if he sees any
part of the body displaced or out of order,*' the lion, king of beasts, is displeased at
it.  But if, brethren, the lion, king of beasts, does not see any part of the body
displaced or out of order, then he is pleased at it.  Brethren, this is said to be the lion-like posture.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Brethren, what is the posture of the'Accomplished One ?</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Herein,  brethren, a brother aloof from sensual pleasures (i.e., sitting with body erect
and breathing in and out regularly) attains to and abides in the Fourth Rapture.  This
is said to be the posture of the Accomplished One.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Verily, brethren, there are these four postures.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>(5) Monuments*</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Brethren, there are these four persons worthy of a monument.  What four?</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>The Accomplished One, the Arahant, the Supremely Enlightened, is worthy of a
monument, a Pacceka Buddha is so worthy, a disciple of the Accomplished One is so
worthy, likewise a universal monarch.  Verily, brethren, these four persons are
worthy of a monument.</P>
