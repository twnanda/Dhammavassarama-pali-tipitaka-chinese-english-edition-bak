<P>ON DEEDS'</P>

<P>(1) -Dark and Bright (a)</P>

<P>BRETHREN, there are these four (kinds of) deeds,* which I myself have realised
from personal experience and made known. What four?</P>

<P>Brethren, there is a dark deed with a dark result.* There is a bright deed with a bright
result. There is a dark and bright deed with a dark and bright result. There is also a
deed that is neither dark nor bright, with a result that is neither dark nor bright,,
which leads to the cessation of deeds.*</P>

<P>Verily, brethren, there are these four (kinds of) deeds,which I have myself realised
from personal experience and made known.</P>

<P><EM></EM>Brethren, there are these four (kinds of) deeds, which I have myself realised from
personal experience and made</P>

<P>1 Kamma: perhaps it is better to retain the P&agrave;li word.</P>

<P>2 Comy., <EM>i.e. k&agrave;laka&uuml;, </EM>the ten demeritorious deeds, leading to rebirth in ap&agrave;yas. See
D. N. iii, 230.</P>

<P>3 The latter is the indifferent action of the Arahant, which has no result to himself,
because it is freed from the pairs of opposites <EM>(lobha-dosa-moha.)</EM></P>

<P><EM>known. What four? [Repeat the same four as in Discourse (1) above.]</EM></P>

<P><EM></EM>Brethren, what is the dark deed with a dark result ?</P>

<P>Herein, brethren, a certain one stores up bodily action accompanied by malevolence,
vocal action and work of mind accompanied by malevolence. Having so stored up
action, he is reborn into a world full of malevolence. Being so born, he meets with
painful contacts. Having met with painful contacts, he feels exceedingly painful
feelings, such as the creatures in purgatory feel. Brethren, this is said to be the dark
deed.with the dark result.</P>

<P>Brethren, what is the bright deed with the bright result ?</P>

<P>Herein, brethren <EM>[repeat the converse of the above]. </EM>. . . Such as the Subhaki&otilde;ha
devas feel. Brethren, this is said to be the bright deed with the bright result.</P>

<P>Brethren what is the dark and bright deed with the dark and bright result ?</P>

<P>Herein, brethren, a certain one stores up bodily action through both malevolence and
kindness, vocal action and work of thought..... Having met with both painful and
pleasant contacts, he feels feelings which are beset and mixed with both pain and
pleasure, such as human beings, certain of the devas and certain beings in the states
of woe feel.* Brethren, this is said to be the dark and bright deed with the dark and
bright result.</P>

<P>Brethren, what is the deed that is neither dark nor bright, with a result that is neither
dark nor bright, which leads to the cessation of deeds ?</P>

<P>Herein, brethren, whatsoever dark deed with dark result there be, accompanied by the
will to abandon such deed</P>

<P>1 E.g., abodes of <EM>petas, </EM>which oscillate between two worlds.</P>

<P>xxiv. § 232] 			On <EM>Deeds						</EM>
293</P>

<P>whatsoever bright deed with bright result there be, accompanied by the will to
abandon such deed ; whatsoever dark and bright deed with dark and bright result
there be, accompanied by the will to abandon such deed:-this, brethren, is said to be
the deed that is neither dark nor bright, with a result that is neither dark nor bright,
which leads to the cessation of deed.*</P>

<P>Verily, brethren, there are these four kinds of deeds which I myself have realised
from personal experience and made known.</P>

<P><EM>(3) Inefectiveness of  Deed &copy;</EM></P>

<P><EM></EM>Once Sikha (the top-knot) Moggall&agrave;na, a br&agrave;hmin, came to the Exalted One..... and
said thus to Him:</P>

<P>"Master Gotama, yesterday or the day before yesterday So&otilde;ak&agrave;yana' (dog-fancier), a
youth, came to where I was. Having come he told me thus: ` Gotama the recluse
doclares the ineffectiveness * of all deeds. In sooth he who so declares thereby
declares the annihilation of the world."</P>

<P>" Indeed, br&agrave;hmin, I am not aware of having even seen the youth So&otilde;ak&agrave;yana ; much
less do I know of such talk.</P>

<P>Br&agrave;hmin, there are these four kinds of deed, which I myself have realised from
personal experience  and made known. What four ?</P>

<P><EM>[Repeat the same as in -Discourse (2) above.]</EM></P>

<P><EM></EM>1 [Comy. Here the Path-will leading to release from the Round is to be understood.
This conduces to destruction of kamma.]</P>

<P>2 He was a pupil of Sikha Moggall&agrave;na. Comy.</P>

<P>3 Futility of Kamma'-the theory of Makkhali Gos&agrave;1a. Cf. A. i, 286; D. i, 53.</P>

four ? <EM>[Repeat the same four as above.]</EM></P>

<P>Brethren, what is the dark deed with a dark result ?Herein a certain one takes life,
steals and so forth. This is said to be the dark deed with a dark result.</P>

<P>Brethren, what is the bright deed with bright result ? Brethren, herein a certain one
abstains from so doing. This is said to be the bright deed with bright result.</P>

<P>Brethren, what is the dark and bright deed with a.dark and bright result ? Brethren,
herein a certain (one) stores up, through both ill-will and kindness, action by deed, by
word and by thought <EM>[continue as in -Discourse (2) above.]</EM></P>

<P><EM></EM>Brethren, what is the deed that is neither dark nor bright, with a result that is neither
dark nor bright and which leads to the cessation of deeds ? Brethren, herein
whatsoever dark deed with dark result there be, if there be also the will to eliminate it
[continue <EM>as in -Discourse (2) above,]</EM>.....</P>

<P>Verily, brethren, there are these four kinds of deed, which I myself have realised from
personal experience and made known.</P>
