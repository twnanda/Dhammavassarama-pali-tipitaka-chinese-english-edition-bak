<P><EM></EM>BRETHREN, there are these four things.  What four ? Things to be known by higher

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Herein, brethren, a certain one, being himself subject to growing old, seeks after
growing old; himself subject to disease, seeks after disease ; himself subject to death,
seeks after death ; himself subject to the depravities, seeks after them.  These are the
four quests that are un-Ariyan.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Brethren, there are these four Ariyan quests.  What four ?</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Herein, a certain one, himself subject to growing old and seeing loss therein, seeks
for the imperishable, incomparable security of Nibb&agrave;na : himself subject to disease
and seeing loss therein, he seeks for the wholly sane, incomparable security of
Nibb&agrave;na : himself subject to death and seeing loss therein, he seeks after the
deathless, incomparable security of Nibb&agrave;na himself subject to the depravities and
seeing loss therein, he seeks the untainted, incomparable security of Nibb&agrave;na.  These
are the four Ariyan quests.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT><EM>(3) Popularity</EM></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><EM></EM></FONT><EM></EM>Brethren, there are these four grounds for popularity.  What four ? Liberality, kindly

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT><EM>(4) Instruction in Brief*2</EM></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><EM></EM></FONT><EM></EM>Once the venerable M&agrave;lunkyaputta* came to the Exalted One..... and said :</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>"Good were it, Lord, if the Exalted One declare to me the Norm in brief, so that,
having heard the Norm from the Exalted One, I may abide alone, secluded, earnest,
zealous and master of myself."</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Now herein, M&agrave;lunkyaputta, what is the use of my teaching young brothers, if (as in
your case) when you are old, decrepit and aged, you ask the Accomplished One for
instruction in brief ? " *</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>" Lord, may the Exalted One declare to me the Norm in brief, may the Blessed One
declare the Norm in brief.  Good if I know the meaning of the Exalted One's word. 
Good indeed if I become an heir to the Exalted One's word."</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT><EM>" </EM>Now, M&agrave;lunkyaputta, there are these four grounds for the arising of craving,
whence craving usually arises in the mind of a brother.  What four?  Craving arises in
the mind of a brother owing to robes, alms-food and so forth, and owing to eternalist
or annihilationist views.  Verily, M&agrave;lunkyaputta, there are these four grounds for the
arising of craving.....</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>But verily, M&agrave;lunkyaputta, whenever in a brother craving has been abandoned and
cut off at the root like a palm tree with its base destroyed, rendered unable to sprout
out again, then such a brother is said to have destroyed craving, broken the fetters,
and by full understanding of false pride is said to have ended sorrow."</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Then the venerable M&agrave;lunkyaputta, thus exhorted by the Exalted One with this
instruction, rose from his seat, made</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>1 The Master said this (according to Comy)to depreciate the old thera and to
encourage him.  It is also said that in his youth he had neglected the detailed teaching
and fallen back.  Now he asks for a comprehensive view of it.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>obeisance, walked round the Exalted One by the right and departed thence.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Thereafter the venerable M&agrave;lunkyaputta, abiding alone, secluded, earnest, zealous
and master of himself, even in a short time, having himself for himself in this life
itself realised. it, dwelt in the incomparable perfection of the religious life, to win
which clansmen duly wander forth from the home to the homeless life. Having
conquered birth, led the holy life and done that which was to be done, he realised
there was no more existence for him beyond this life.* Thus did the venerable
M&agrave;lunkyaputta become yet another of the Arahants of the Exalted One.</P>
