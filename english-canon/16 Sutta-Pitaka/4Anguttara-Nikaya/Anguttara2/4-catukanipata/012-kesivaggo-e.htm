<P>0nce a trainer of horses, (by name) Kesi, came to where the Exalted One was. Having
come he made obeisance to the Exalted One and took a seat at one side. To the horse-trainer Kesi so seated the Exalted One spake thus:</P>

<P>"Indeed, Kesi, you are a skilled' horse-trainer. Kesi, how do you then train a horse that is
to be tamed ? "</P>

<P>"Indeed, Lord, I train a horse that is to he trained by gentleness, I train by severity and I
train both by gentleness and severity."</P>

<P>Then, Kesi, if the horse that is to be tamed does not yield to your training, either by
gentleness, or severity, or both gentleness and severity, what do you do to him ?</P>

<P>Then, Lord, if the horse does not yield to' my training, either by gentleness or severity,
or both gentleness and severity, Lord, I destroy him. What is the reason therefor ? In
order that it may not be a reproach unto the lineage of my teacher. Lord, the Exalted One
is indeed</P>

human to be, tamed ?</P>

<P>"I also, Kesi, train the human that is to be tamed by gentleness, I train by severity and I
train by both gentleness and severity. Kesi, this is how (it is done(,) by gentleness Thus is
good done by the body, thus is the fruit of such good; thus is good done by words, thus is
the fruit of such good and thus is good done by mind and thus is the fruit of such good:
thus are the gods and thus men.' ]</P>

<P>Kesi, this is how (it is done) by severity: Thus is bodily evil, thus is the fruit of bodily
evil ; thus is evil by words, thus is the fruit of evil by words; thus <EM>is </EM>evil by mind and
thus is the fruit of evil by mind; thus is purgatory, thus is birth into animal life and thus <EM>is

<P>Then, Lord, what does the Exalted On(, do to him if the, human to be tamed does not
yield to-the training, either ,by gentleness or by severity or by both gentleness and
severity ?</P>

<P>"Well, Kesi, if the human to be tamed does not yield either to gentleness or severity or
both gentleness and severity, I destroy him."</P>

<P>"Surely, Lord, the Exalted One does not destroy life! "destroy him, Kesi." i</P>

<P>True it is, Kesi, the, Tath&agrave;gata does not destroy life, if the human to be tamed yield not
to training by gentleness and so forth, as stated, the Tath&agrave;gata does not regard him as
deserving of being told or admonished, neither do</P>

<P>Brethren, the royal elephant, when endowed with four qualities, becomes worthy of the
king, is a royal property, and is reckoned as an asset to the king. With what four ?</P>

<P>Brethren, how does the royal elephant become an attentive hearer ?</P>

<P>Brethren, herein when the elephant-trainer imposes upon him a task, whether done
before or not, the royal elephant, making that his object and applying his mind thereto,
with thoughts collected, listens to it with ready ear. Thus indeed, brethren, the royal
elephant becomes an attentive hearer.</P>

<P>Brethren, how does the royal elephant become a killer ?</P>

<P>Brethren, herein the royal elephant having entered into battle kills elephants and
elephant-riders, also horses and horse-riders, and destroys chariot-riders and foot-soldiers. Thus, brethren, does the royal elephant become a killer.</P>

<P>Brethren, how does the royal elephant become an endurer ?</P>

<P>Brethren, herein the royal elephant having entered into battle endures * blows with
spears, swords, arrows, and axes, also the sounds of drums, kettledrums, conches,
tamtams and other kinds of din. Thus, brethren, the royal elephant becomes an endurer.</P>

<P>Brethren, how does the royal elephant become a goer ?</P>

<P>Brethren, herein the royal elephant, when the elephant trainer sends him in a certain
direction, whether he has gone before or not, quickly goes. Thus, brethren, does the royal
elephant become a goer.</P>

<P>Verily, brethren, the royal elephant, when endowed with these four qualities becomes
worthy of the king, is a royal property, and is reckoned as an asset to the king.</P>

<P>Herein, brethren, a brother, when the Norm-discipline set forth by the Tath&agrave;gata is
preached, makes that his ohject, and applying his mind thereto listens to the Doctrine
with all his heart, attentively, with ready ear. Thus, brethren, a brother is a hearer.</P>

<P>And how, brethren, is a brother a slayer ? Herein, brethren, a brother does not welcome a
vague lustful thought that has arisen : he rejects it, banishes it, makes an end of it, makes
it cease to exist......... So also with regard to a vague thought of harming that has arisen,
and any evil unprofitable state of mind that arises from time to time : he rejects it,
banishes it, makes an end of it, makes it cease to exist. Even so, brethren, is a brother a
slayer.</P>

<P>And how, brethren, is a brother an endurer ? Herein, brethren, a brother is patient of cold,
heat, hunger, thirst, the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind and sun and creeping things ; of
abuse that oversteps the bounds of speech ; of feelings that affect the body when they
arise, painful, sharp, harsh, bitter, unpleasant, offensive pains that sap one's life-[all
these] he endures. Thus, brethren, is a brother an endurer.</P>

<P>And how, brethren, is a brother a goer ? Herein, brethren, a brother quickly goes thither-in directions where in this long long journey he has never gone before-to wit : to the
calming of all the activities, to the leaving of all basis (for rebirth), to the destruction of
craving, to disgust, to cessation, to Nibbana. Thus, brethren, is a brother a goer.</P>

<P>So, brethren, with these four properties endowed, a brother is worshipful..... a boundless
field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</P>

<P><EM>(5)Foitr Things</EM></P>

<P><EM></EM>Brethren, there are these four things.' What four ? There is a thing, brethren, which is
unpleasant to be done, and when done it leads to loss. There is a thing, brethren, which is
unpleasant to be done, but when done it leads to gain. There is a thing, brethren, which is
pleasant to be done but when done it leads to loss. And there is also a thing, brethren,
which is pleasant to be done and when done leads to gain.</P>

<P>Among these, brethren, whatsoever thing is unpleasant to be done, which when done
leads to loss, such a thing brethren, is in both ways regarded as not to be done.</P>

<P>Whatsoever thing is regarded as unpleasant to be done, on that ground it should be
regarded as not to be done. Whatsoever thing when done leads to loss on that ground also
it should be regarded as not to be done. This thing, brethren, is in both ways regarded as
not to be done.</P>

<P>Among these, brethren, whatsoever thing is unpleasant to be done but when done loads
to gain, from this thing, brethren, the fool and the wise man should be known, in point of
manly strength, manly vigour and manly energy.</P>

<P>Brethren, the fool does not think` This thing, though in a way unpleasant to be done,
nevertheless when done leads to gain,' and he does not do it. Such, a thing left undone
leads to his loss. But, brethren, the wise man considers thus `This thing, though
unpleasant to be done, nevertheless when done leads to gain.' He does such a thing. Such
a thing when done leads to his gain.</P>

<P>1 Th&agrave;n&agrave;ni is literally,` places' or `things,' hence stations, `occasions' (not a deed but a
possibility of Karma).</P>

<P>Among these, brethren, whatsoever thing is pleasant to be done, but when done leads to
loss, from this thing, brethren, the fool and the wise man should be known, in point of
manly strength, manly vigour and manly energy.</P>

<P>Brethren, the fool does not think: ` This thing though pleasant to be done nevertheless
when done leads to loss.' He does it. Such a thing when done leads to loss.</P>

<P>The wise man however thinks thus:` This thing though pleasant to be done nevertheless
when done leads to loss.' He does not do it. Such a thing left undone leads to gain.</P>

<P>Among these, brethren, whatsoever thing is pleasant to be done and when done leads to
gain, such a thing, brethren, is to be regarded in both ways as worthy to be done: because
such a thing is pleasant to be done, on this ground it is regarded as fit to be done ; and,
because such a thing when done leads to gain, on this ground also it is to be regarded as
fit to be done. Such a thing therefore, brethren, is regarded in both ways as fit to be done.</P>

<P>Brethren, what is fear of punishment ? Herein, brethren, a certain person sees a thief
guilty of a crime being taken by the king* and subjected to various kinds of punishments
such as : lashing with whips and canes, beating with split sticks," cutting off of arm or
leg, both arms and logs, ear or nose, both ear and nose, ripping skull and applying a red-hot iron,' skimming the scalp [and applying gravel till it becomes white as a chank].4</P>

<P>Burning the inside of the mouth,* the body and the band. Flaying the skin off from throat
to ankle, from neck to waist and from waist to ankle. Fixing the elbows and knees to iron
piles and nailing them, and lighting fires around. Flaying the skin, flesh and veins with a
sharp edge, tearing the body and smearing the wounds with salt water.</P>

<P>Fixing the body on the ground by laying it prostrate on one side and planting an iron rod
through the ears on the ground, then whirling the body round. Crushing and softening the
body like a bunch of straw.' Pouring boiling oil on the body ; making it a prey to hungry
dogs. Impaling it whilst alive and severing the head with a sword.</P>

<P>Then he considers thus : ` Were I to commit a similar crime, I should also be taken up by

<P>Brethren, this is said to be the fear of punishment.</P>

<P>Brethren, what is the fear of states of woe Herein, brethren, a certain person considers

punishment and in the hells ? '</P>

<P>Thus frightened by the states of woe he eschews misconduct by body, word and thought

of crocodiles, of whirlpools and of fierce fishes.</P>

<P>Brethren, what is fear of waves ? Herein, brethren, a certain clansman through faith
wanders forth out of the home into the homeless state (and thinks thus) :I am a victim to
birth, decay, death, grief, wailing, pain, distress and tribulation, and am overcome by
pain. Good indeed if I could see the ending of this whole mass of pain.' His co-mates in
the holy life then exhort and instruct him who has so gone forth as follows: 'Thus should
you go forward, thus should you go backward, thus should you look forward, thus should
you look backward, thus should you draw in or stretch out (your limbs) and thus should
you bear robe, mantle and bowl.'</P>

<P>Then he thus considers:` Indeed. when at home formerly we ourselves exhorted and
instructed others, but now we are like unto our sons and grandsons, and they think we
should be exhorted and instructed.' Thus angered and offended he altogether abandons
the training and takes again to the layman's life.</P>

<P>Brethren, this brother frightened by the tear of waves is said to abandon the training and
to take again to the layman's life. Indeed, brethren, fear of waves is a simile of the state
of being pervaded by anger.</P>

food hard or soft, he thinks that they are imposing (upon him) a prohibition against

possessions and do acts of merit.' He thus forsakes the training and falls back into the
layman's life.</P>

<P>Brethren, thus a brother frightened by the fear of whirlpools is said to fall back to the

degraded by lust he forsakes the training and falls back into the layman's life.</P>

departs from this life and is reborn among the Abhassara Devas.</P>

<P>Brethren, the span of life-time of the Abhassara Devas is two aeons. There if a worldling
he lives as long as life lasts, and having spent the whole span of life of such Devas passes

the learned Arian disciple and the ignorant worldling. This is their quality and nature.</P>

<P>And again, brethren, a certain person dwells in joy,, passionlessness and equanimity, and
thoughtful and conscious, enjoys felicity of body. The holy ones declare this thoughtful
person dwelling at ease in equanimity to have entered on the Third Rapture. He longs for
it, tastes and enters into the joy of it, he takes his stand thereon, applies himself  to it,
dwells incessantly on it, and without falling away from it departs from this life and is
reborn among the Subhaki&otilde;ha Devas.* The life-span of the Subhaki&otilde;ha gods is four

<P>And again, brethren, a certain person, divesting himself of pleasure and pain and
primarily freeing himself from happiness and sorrow arrives at and remains in the Fourth
Raptur- a state of mind indifferent alike to all emotion. He longs for it, tastes and enters
into the joy of it, he takes his stand thereon, applies himself to it, dwells incessantly on it
and without falling away from it departs from this life and is reborn among the
Vehapphala gods.*</P>

<P>Brethren, the life-span of the Vehapphala Devas is five hundred aeons. There if a
worldling he lives as long as life lasts, and having spent the whole span of life of such
Devas, passes on either to purgatory, to animal life, or the state of the ghosts. The
