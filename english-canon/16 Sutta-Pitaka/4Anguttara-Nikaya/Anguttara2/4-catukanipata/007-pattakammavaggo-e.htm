householder An&agrave;thapindika, so seated, the Exalted One spake thus: "Householder, in
the world there are these four things,	which are welcome, pleasant, agreeable, but
hard to gain. What are the four? [One wishes thus:] `May I acquire wealth lawfully.'
This is, the first thing in the world which is welcome, pleasant, agreeable but hard to
gain.</P>

<P>`Having acquired wealth lawfully and together with my relations and preceptors
having lived long and reached great  age, when the body falls asunder may I be
reborn to theliss of the heaven-world ?' This is the fourth thing in the world, which is
welcome, pleasant, agreeable, but hard to	gain.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Householder, these indeed are the four things, which in the world are welcome,
pleasant, agreeable but hard to gain.</P>

<P>Of a truth, householder, for the attainment of these four things, which in the world are
welcome, pleasant, agreeable but hard to gain, there are also four conditions. What
are the four ? The blessing of faith, the blessing of virtuous conduct, the blessing of
liberality and the blessing of wisdom.</P>

<P>Householder, what is the blessing of faith ? Herein, householder, the Ariyan disciple
is full of faith and believes in the supreme knowledge of the Tath&agrave;gata, thus: 'This is
He, the Exalted One, the Holy One, the Supremely Awakened One, the Perfect in
Knowledge and in Conduct, the Auspicious, the Knower of all the worlds, the
Incomparable Trainer of men, the Teacher of dev'as and men, the Awakened, Exalted
One.' This, householder, is said to be the blessing of faith.</P>

<P>Householder, what is the blessing of virtuous conduct ? Herein, householder, the
Ariyan disciple abstains from taking life, thieving, unchastity, lying and partaking of
fermented liquor. This, householder, is said to be blessing of virtuous conduct.</P>

<P>Householder, what is the blessing of liberality ? Herein, householder, the Ariyan
disciple lives the household life, with mind freed from -the taint of avarice generous,
openhanded, delighting in gifts, a good one to be asked and</P>

<P>devoted to the distribution of gifts. Householder, this is said to be the blessing of
liberality.</P>

<P>Householder, what is the  blessing of wisdom ? Householder, he who dwells with
mind overcome by greed, avarice, ill-will, sloth, drowsiness, distraction and flurry,
and also doubt, commits wrongful deeds and neglects that which ought to be done,
and by so doing is deprived of happiness, and honour.</P>

<P>Of a truth, householder, such an Ariyan disciple, seeing that greed and avarice, ill-will, sloth and drowsiness, distraction and flurry and doubt are stains of the mind,
gets rid of such stains of the mind. Because indeed, householder, the Ariyan disciple
sees that greed and avarice, ill-will, sloth and drowsiness, distraction and flurry and
doubt are defilements of the mind, he removes such defilements. Householder, such
an Ariyan disciple is said to be of great wisdom, abundant wisdom, clear vision and
perfect wisdom. This, householder, is said to be the blessing of wisdom.</P>

<P>Indeed, householder, for the attainment of these four things which are welcome,
pleasant, agreeable, but lead to gain, there are in the world these four conditions.</P>

<P>Of a truth, householder, by means of wealth legitimately and justly acquired, earned
by great industry, amassed by strength of the arm and gained by sweat (of the brow),</P>

<P>the Ariyan disciple becomes the doer of four acts. Of what four ?</P>

<P>Householder, here (in the world) by means of wealth legitimately and justly acquired,
earned by great industry, amassed by strength of the arm and gained by sweat (of the
brow), the Ariyan disciple makes himself happy and cheerful</P>

<P>and preserves himself full of happiness ; also makes his parents, wife and children,
servants and labourers, friends and companions happy and cheerful, and preserves
them full of happiness. This is the first stage he reaches, attains and enjoys owing to
his own exertions.*</P>

<P>Then again, householder, as regards wealth legitimately and justly acquired, earned
by great industry, amassed by strength of the arm and gained by sweat (of the brow),
if any misfortune happen, owing either to fire, water, the rajah, thief, enemy, or
(expectant) heirs, the Ariyan disciple (saying) it is my duty* to defend my property
against such misfortunes,' saves himself from danger. This is the second stage he
reaches, attains and enjoys owing to his own exertions.</P>

<P>Then again, householder, with wealth legitimately and justly acquired, earned by
great industry, amassed by strength of the arm and gained by sweat (of the brow), the
Ariyan disciple makes the five oblations, namely ; gifts to relatives, presents to
guests, offerings to departed spirits, taxes to rajahs and oblations to devas. This is the
third stage he reaches, attains and enjoys owing to his own exertions.</P>

<P>Then again, householder, if there are recluses and brahmins, who are free from
intoxication and negligence, have attained to gentleness and forbearance, have tamed,
calmed and purified themselves, and to such recluses and br&agrave;hmins the Ariyan
disciple makes beneficial gifts, which result in heavenly bliss and lead to heavenly
life, by means of wealth legitimately and justly acquired, earned by great</P>

<P>industry, amassed by strength of the arm and gained by sweat (of the brow),-this is
the fourth stage he reaches, attains and enjoys owing to his own exertions.</P>

<P>Verily, householder, by means of wealth legitimately and justly acquired, earned by
great industry, amassed by strength of the arm and gained by sweat (of the brow), the
Ariyan disciple becomes the master of four attainments. Householder, if the wealth of
any one go to waste owing to lack of these four attainments, such wealth,
householder, is said to have been not reached, attained or enjoyed owing to his own
exertions. Householder, if the wealth of any one becomes diminished, it is owing to
these four causes.</P>

<P>I have enjoyed my wealth. I have fed those</P>

<P>Dependent on me, and these have escaped</P>

<P>From dangers.' I have made the best of gifts</P>

<P>Householder, what is the happiness of possession? Herein, householder a clansman is

satisfaction. Householder, this is said to be the happiness of enjoyment.</P>

<P>Householder, what is the happiness of freedom from debt ? Herein, householder, a

near S&agrave;vatihi.  At that time in `S&agrave;vatthi a certain brother had died, bitten by a snake.
Then many brethren came to where the Exalted One was. Having come they made

<P>What are the four royal families of snakes ? The royal family of snakes called

<P>(9) Four Exertions*</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Brethren, there are these four Exertions. What four ? The Exertion to control, the
Exertion to destroy, the Exertion to develop and the Exertion to preserve.</P>

<P>And what, brethren, is the exertion to control ? Brethren, herein a brother begets a
desire, exerts himself, puts forth endeavour and strenuously applies his mind to
prevent from arising sinful conditions that have not arisen, to put away sinful
conditions that have arisen, to produce meritorious conditions that have not arisen
and to promote, increase, develop, perfect and preserve meritorious conditions,,that
have arisen. These indeed, brethren, are the four exertions.</P>

<P>Control, destruction, practice, guarding well: these four</P>

<P>Exertions, by a Kinsman of the Sun proclaimed,</P>

<P>Are they by which an ardent brother sorrow ends.</P>

<P>ministers and officers, brethren, being unrighteous, br&agrave;hmin and householders also
become unrighteous. The br&agrave;hmins and householders, brethren, being unrighteous,
the townsfolk and villagers become unrighteous. The townsfolk and villagers
brethren, being unrighteous, the sun and the moon turn about and desert their course ;
sun and moon so turning, the constellations and planetary bodies turn about from
their course.; in like manner the day and night are out of joint; thus the months and
fortnights, the seasons and the years being out of joint, the winds blow wrong the
deities are annoyed. The deities becoming annoyed bestow not rain at proper time.
The rains not falling at proper times, the crops are not properly produced. Brothren,
when crops are not properly produced, men who live on such crops also become
short-lived, ill-favoured, weak and sickly.</P>

<P>But whenever, brethren, kings are righteous, then kings' ministers and officers also
become righteous. Whenever kings' ministers and officers become righteous the
br&agrave;hmins and householders also become righteous. Whenever br&agrave;hmins and
householders become righteous, the townsfolk and villagers also become righteous.
Whenever the townsfolk and villagers become righteous, the sun and the moon run
smoothly on their course. Whenever the sun and the moon turn evenly, the fixed stars
and planets run evenly. When this is so, the day-time and the night-time become
regular. The day-time and the night-time becoming regular, the,month and the
fortnight become regular. The months and the fortnights becoming regular, the
seasons and the years also become regular. The seasons and the years becoming

When the deities become pleased, they bestow rain at proper times. When it rains at
proper times, the crops become ripe in order due. Brethren, men who live on the
crops, which ripen duly, become long-lived, well-favoured, powerful and healthy.</P>
