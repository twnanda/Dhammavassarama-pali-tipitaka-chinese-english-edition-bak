thought or a cruel thought, and if the brother yields to such (thought), does not reject
or expel it, nor frees himself from it, nor causes it to perish, then, brethren, such a
brother, walking, standing or sitting, who is always inactive and devoid of zeal, is
said to be an indolent and slothful person. If, brethren, there arise in (the mind of) a
brother, who is lying down but awake, either a sensual thought, an angry thought or a
cruel thought, and if the brother yields to such (thought), does not reject or expel it,
nor frees himself from it, nor causes it to perish, then such a brother, lying down but
awake, who is always inactive and devoid of zeal, is said to be an indolent and
slothful person.</P>

world) a brother begets a desire, exerts himself, puts forth endeavour and strenuously
applies his mind to prevent the arising of sinful conditions not yet. arisen, to put away
sinful conditions that have arisen, to produce meritorious conditions that have not yet
arisen, and to promote, increase, preserve, develop*	and perfect meritorious
conditions that have arisen. These, brethren, are the four proper Exertions.</P>

<P><EM></EM><EM>4 Exertions (b)</EM></P>

<P><EM></EM>Brethren, there are these four Exertions. Which four ? The Exertion to control, the
Exertion to put away, the Exertion to develop and the Exertion to preserve.</P>

<P>Brethren, what is the Exertion to control ? Here (in the world) a brother seeing a
bodily form is not entranced by the general appearance or the details of it. Because,
in him who dwells with the eye uncontrolled, sinful conditions of covetousness or
discontent may come into being, therefore he watches, guards and brings the eye into
subjection. Hearing a sound with the ear, smelling an odour with the nose, feeling a
taste with the tongue or a contact with the body, or thinking a thought with the mind,
he is not entranced by the general qualities or the details of it. Because, in him who
dwells with the mind controlled, sinful conditions of covetousness or discontent may
come into being, he watches, guards and brings the mind into subjection. Brethren,
this is said to be the Exertion to control.</P>

<P>Brethren, what is the Exertion to put away ? Here (in the world) a brother yields not
to a sensual thought, an angry thought or a cruel thought that has arisen, but rejects,
expels or frees himself from them or causes them to perish. Brethren, this is said to be
the Exertion to put away.</P>

<P>Brethren, what is the Exertion to develop ? Here (in the world) a brother develops the
Factor of Knowledge (called) Recollection, which results in peace, passionlessness
and cessation and leads to the extinction of lust. He also develops the Factors of
Knowledge (called) Investigation, Energy, Serenity, Rapture, Concentration and
Equanimity,'</P>

<P>which result in peace, passionlessness and cessation, and also lead to the extinction of
lust. Brethren, this is said to be the Exertion to develop.</P>

<P>Brethren, what is the Exertion to preserve ? Here (in the world) a brother carefully
guards the auspicious mental reflex of concentration' and meditates upon the ideas of
a skeleton, a worm-infested corpse, a discoloured or festering corpse, a corpse with
cracked skin, or a bloated corpse. This, brethren, is said to be the Exertion to
preserve.</P>

<P>Restraint, Rejection, Practice, Preservation-</P>

dispositions, he neither seeks nor aims at any higher or more excellent form of
Subtilty of the body, the sensations, the perceptions or the dispositions. These,
brethren, are the four Subtilties.</P>
