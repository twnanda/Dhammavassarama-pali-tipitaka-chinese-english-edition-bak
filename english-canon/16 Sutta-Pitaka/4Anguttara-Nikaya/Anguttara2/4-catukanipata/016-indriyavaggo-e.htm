applies and exerts himself and strives to acquire respect and consideration, and to
find gain, honours and fame. Seeking popularity, he visits families, accepts a. seat,
preaches the Norm and even represses the calls of nature. Verily, brethren, there are
these four kinds of ailment in the recluse.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Therefore, brethren, you should thus train yourselves:` Let us not be greedy, being
vexed and displeased as to whatsoever robes, alms-food, dwelling, medicines and
refreshments for the sick we may get ; let us not put forth evil desire to acquire
respect and consideration ; let us not apply and exert ourselves and strive to acquire
gains, honours and fame. Let us endure cold, heat, hunger, thirst, gad-flies,
mosquitoes and the touch of wind and sun and creeping things ; let us have patience
towards unwelcome and abusive speech, ard towards any bodily sensation that arises
which is painful, acute, sharp, disagreeable, unpleasant and destructive of life itself.'
Brethren, thus should you therefore train yourselves.</P>

says Good indeed were it, reverend sir, if Master &acirc;nanda out of compassion would

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>So the man answering: ` Yes, Madame,' to that sister went to the venerable &acirc;,nanda.
Having come there he made obeisance to 'him and sat down at one side. So seated,
that man said to the venerable &acirc;nanda:</P>

sister's dwelling. Now the sister saw the venerable &acirc;nanda coming at a distant.
Seeing him she covered her  head and laid herself down on the bed. So the venerable
&acirc;,nanda came to the sister, and having come took the seat prepared for him. So
seated the venerable knanda spake thus to that sister:</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Sister, 'this body is sprung from food, is dependent on food, food must be put away'.
So was it said ; and why was it so said ? Sister, herein a brother with proper reflection
takes food, not for the sake of sport, enjoyment, adornment, or decoration, but to
maintain body while life lasts, to satisfy hunger and as an aid to lead the holy life
(saying)</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>`Thus do I get rid of old painful feelings and shall not beget new feelings. My
livelihood shall be faultless and comfortable.' He thereafter, though dependent on
bodily food, puts away food.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>As to food, whatever was thus said, was said in this connexion.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Sister, ` this body is sprung from craving, is dependent on craving, this craving [for
continued existence] must be put away '-thus indeed it was said ; and why was it so
said ?</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Sister, herein a brother comes to hear A brother of such and such a name having won
emancipation of heart through insight, which follows upon the destruction of the
intoxicants, himself in this very life having attained supreme knowledge abides
therein.' He considers thus:</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>`When shall I also, having won emancipation of heart, thus abide therein ?</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Thereupon that sister rose from her bed, arranged her upper robe over one shoulder,
put her head at the foot of the venerable &acirc;nanda and said thus to the venerable

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Indeed, sister, a fault has overcome thee : even so, foolish, misguided, and unskilful
one, thou didst thus. Yet, sister inasmuch as thou dost thus recognise thy fault as such
and make amends for it, we do pardon thee. Indeed, sister, it marks a growth in the
discipline of the Holy Ones for one to recognise a fault as such and make amends for
it and attain to restraint in the future."</P>
