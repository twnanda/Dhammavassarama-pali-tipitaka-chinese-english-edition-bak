<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Brethren, there is a way of getting individual existence, in which one's own volition*

<P>Herein, S&agrave;riputta, if a certain person's fetters of the lower (sensual) world are not
broken, in this life itself he attains to and abides in the realm of neither-pereeption
nor-non-pereeption. He longs for it, tastes and enters into the joy of it .Taking his
stand thereon he applies himself to it, dwells incessantly on it and, without falling
away from it, departs from this life and is reborn among the devas of the realm of
neither-pereeption-nor-non-perception. Deceasing therefrom he returns and comes
back to this existence.</P>

<P>But if, S&agrave;riputta, a person's fetters of the lower (sensual) world are severed, in this

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><EM></EM></FONT><EM></EM>Once the Exalted One dwelt at &acirc;nanda Shrine' in the city called Bhoga. Then the
Exalted One said to the brethren: "0, brethrenl" "Yea, Lord," responded the brethren
to the Exalted One. The Exalted One spake thus:</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Brethren, these four great topics *(of argument) I shall proclaim. Give ear and ponder
over them. I shall speak." Yea, Lord," the brethren responded to the Exalted One. The
Exalted One spake thus:</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>" Brethren, what are the four great topics (of argument)? Herein, brethren, if a brother
says Friend, thus have I heard in the presence of the Exalted One and learnt in His
presence ; this is the doctrine, this is the discipline and this is the message of the
Master,'-brethren, such a brother should neither be applauded nor set aside. Without
either applauding or setting him aside, when they have well learnt the words and the
letters they should put them side by side with the Discourses and compare them with
the Rules of Discipline ; and if they do not fall in with the Discourses</P>
