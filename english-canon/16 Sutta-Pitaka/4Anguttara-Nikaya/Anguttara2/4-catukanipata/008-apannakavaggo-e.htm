<P><EM>(1) Four Virtues</EM></P>

<P><EM></EM>BRETHREN, the brother who is endowed with four qualities follows the perfect
way,* and his knowledge is bent* on the destruction of the intoxicants. With what
four? Brethren, herein a brother is virtuous, well-versed, strenuous in endeavour and
possessed of insight. Of a truth, brethren, the brother who is endowed with these four
qualities follows the perfect way of conduct and his knowledge is directed to
destroying the intoxicants.</P>

<P><EM>(2) Four Virtues (b)</EM></P>

<P><EM></EM>Brethren, the brother who is endowed with four qualities follows the perfect way of

<P><EM>(3) The Wicked Man</EM></P>

<P><EM></EM>Brethren, he who is possessed of four qualities should be known as a wicked One.
What four ? Brethren, herein a wicked one shows up the faults of another even when
unasked, not to say when asked. Being indeed asked and plied with questions, he
speaks ill of another without suppressing or concealing,' but with full detail.
Brethren, such an one should be known as a wicked one.</P>

<P>Then again, brethren, he is a wicked one who, being asked, does not point out the
good qualities of another, not to say when unasked. Being indeed asked and plied
with questions, he speaks well of another, but suppresses and conceals and does not
mention his good qualities in full detail. Such an one should be known as a wicked
one.</P>

<P>Then again, brethren, he is a wicked one who, being asked, does not disclose his own
bad qualities, not to say when unasked. Being indeed asked and plied with questions,
he points out his own bad qualities, but suppresses and conceals them and does not
give full details. Brethren, such an one should be known as a wicked one.</P>

<P>Then again, brethren, he is a wicked one who, even unasked, discloses his good
qualities, not to say when asked. Brethren, being asked and plied with questions, he
points out his own good qualities without suppressing or concealing them and giving
full details. Brethren such an one should be known as a wicked one.</P>

<P>Verily brethren, the brother who is possessed of these four qualities should be known
as a wicked one.</P>

<P><EM>   The Good Man</EM></P>

<P><EM>[The good man is he who is endowed wiih the four qualities opposed to those of the
wicked </EM>man as <EM>given above.] </EM>Just as brethren, when a bride is first led home either by
day or night, she at first shows exceeding great fear and bashfulness towards father-in-law, mother-in-law, husband and even' to servants and labourers but soon
afterwards, owing to living together and intimacy,, she begins to talk even to her
father-in-law, mother-in-law and husband thus: " Away with you! what do you
know?" Even so also, brethren, herein a certain brother, some day or night, leaves the
household life, becomes homeless and enters the Order. He at first shows exceeding
great fear and shyness towards the brethren, the sisters, the lay-disciples both male
and female, and even to the novices and attendants of the monastery ; but afterwards
owing to living together and intimacy he begins to say even to teachers and
preceptors thus:" Away with you! what do you know ? " Therefore, brethren, thus
must ye train yourselves-, `like a bride newly led home will I dwell in
thought'Brethren, you should thus train yourselves.</P>

<P><EM>(4) Four Excellences</EM></P>

<P><EM></EM>Brethren, there are these four excellent things.*What four ? The highest virtue, the
highest self-concentration, the highest insight and the highest emancipation. Of a
truth, brethren, there are these four excellent things.</P>

<P><EM></EM><EM>(5) Four Highest Things</EM></P>

<P><EM></EM>Brethren, there are these four highest things.* What four? The highest form,the
highest feeling,the highest perception and the highest existence. Of a truth, brethren,
there are these four highest things.</P>

<P><EM>(6) Removal. of Doubts*</EM></P>

<P><EM></EM>At one tme, the Exalted One, about the time of the final passing away, dwelt between
the twin S&agrave;la trees in the S&agrave;la-park of the Mallas. Then the Exalted One addressed the
brethren: "Brethren!" They responded:"Yea, Lord!" The Exalted One spake thus
Brethren, if there is one single brother, who is affected with doubt or uncertainty as
regards the Exalted One, the Norm or the Order, the Path or the Practice, let him
question. Brethren, do not become remorseful afterwards (saying):"We met the
Master face to face: having met the Exalted One face to face we did not question
Him.'"</P>

<P>When He spake thus the Brethren observed silence. A second time the Exalted One
addressed the brethren "Indeed, brethren, if there is even one single brother, who is
affected with doubt or uncertainty as regards the Exalted One, the Norm or the Order,
the Path or the Practice, let him question. Brethren, do not become remorseful
afterwards (saying) 'We met the Master face to face:having</P>

meditation. leading to Arahantship. <EM>Bhavaggan</EM> is the last life wherein Arahantship,is
won.</P>

<P>2 This discourse also occurs in <EM>Mah&agrave;-parinibbana Sutta </EM>of D<EM>igha Nik&agrave;ya, i,155.</EM> 
viii.$.76] 			On <EM>the Perfect Way</EM> 					107
met the Exalted One face to face we did not question Him.'"</P>

<P>When He spake thus, the Brethren were silent for the second time. Then for the third
time the Exalted One addressed the brethren Indeed, brethren, if there is even one
single brother who is affected with doubt or uncertainty as regards the Exalted One,
the Norm or the Order, the Path or the Practice, let him question. Brethren, do not
afterwards become remorseful saying "We met the Master face to face: having met
the Exalted One we did not question Him."' When He spake thus the brethren were
silent for the third time also.</P>

<P>Then indeed the Exalted One addressed the brethren thus "If indeed, brethren, ye
question not out of regard for the Master, let a friend speak to his friends ". When He
spake thus, the brethren were still silent.</P>

<P>Then the venerable &acirc;nanda said to the Exalted One:</P>

<P>"Wonderful, 0 Lord, marvellous, 0 Lord!I am well pleased, 0 Lord, with this Order of
the brethren. There is not in this Order of the brethren one single brother who is
affected with doubt or uncertainty as regards the Exalted One, the Norm or the Order,
the Path or the Practice."</P>

<P>&acirc;nanda, you indeed say so out of faith; but it is in the knowledge of the
Accomplished One that there is not one single brother in this whole Order of the
brethren who is affected with doubt or uncertainty as regards the Exalted One, the
Norm or the Order, the Path or the Practice. Of a truth, &acirc;nanda, among these five
hundred brethren, even the brother who is lowest in virtue is a Streamwinner he is not
liable to fall away and is destined to finlenlightenment,"</P>

<P><EM>    (7) Unthinkables</EM></P>

<P><EM></EM>Brethren, there are these four unthinkables, which should not be pondered over. He
who ponders over them becomes insane and ends in grief. What are the four ?
Brethren, the nature of the Exalted Ones is unthinkable and should not be pondered
over. He who ponders over it becomes insane and ends in grief. Brethren, the range of
ecstasy of one who practises ecstasy is unthinkable and should not be pondered over.
He who ponders over it becomes insane and ends in grief. Brethren, the fruits of
Kamma are unthinkable and should not be pondered over. He who ponders over them
becomes insane and ends in grief. Brethren, the origin of the world is unthinkable and
should not be pondered over. He who ponders over it becomes insane and ends in
grief. Of a truth, brethren, there are these four unthinkables, which should not be
pondered over. He who ponders over them becomes insane and ends in grief.</P>

<P><EM>(8) Purities of a Gift</EM></P>

<P><EM></EM>Brethren, there are these four purities of a gift. What are the four ? Brethren, there is
a gift which is purified by the donor and not by the recipient. Brethren, there is a gift
which is purified by the recipient and not by the donor. Brethren, there is a gift which
is not purified either by the donor or by the recipient. Brethren, there is also a gift
which is purified both by the donor and by the recipient.</P>

<P>Brethren, what is the gift that is purified by the donor and not by the recipient ?
Brethren, here is a donor who</P>

<P>viii. § 80] 			On <EM>the Perfect Way</EM> 				109</P>

<P>is virtuous and of good conduct, but the recipients are sinful and of ill-conduct.
Verily, brethren, even thus does a gift become purified by donor and not by receiver.</P>

<P>Brethren, how does a gift  become purified by the recipient and not by the donor ?
Brethren, here is a donor who is sinful and of evil conduct but the recipients are
virtuous and of good conduct. Verily, brethren, even thus does a gift become purified
by the recipient and not by the donor.</P>

<P>Brethren, how is a gift not purified either by the donor or by the recipient ? Brethren,
here is a donor who is sinful and of evil conduct and the recipients are also sinful and
of evil conduct. Verily, brethren, even thus is a gift not purified either by the donor or
by the recipient.</P>

<P>Brethren, how is a gift purified both by the donor and by the recipient ? Brethren,
here is a donor who is virtuous and of good conduct and the recipients are also
virtuous and of good conduct. Verily, brethren, even thus does a gift become purified
both by the donor and by the recipient.</P>

<P>Verily, brethren, there are these four purities of a gift.</P>

<P><EM>(9) Failure and Success in Trade</EM></P>

<P><EM></EM>Once the venerable Sariputta came to where the Exalted</P>

<P>One, was. Having come he made obeisance to the Exalted</P>

<P>One and took a seat at one side. So seated the venerable,</P>

<P><EM>1 Cf. Digha N., III, 231: Majjh., iii, 256. The order differs here.</EM>At <EM>Kath&agrave;. </EM>Vatthu (Bk.
xvii) the matter is argued thus by the dissentient . 'If a gift may be sanctified by the
receiver, does he not become the agent (of kamma) for a different person ? <EM>(A&iuml;&iuml;o
a&iuml;&iuml;assa k&agrave;rako). </EM>Does not one cause the weal or woe of another ? Does not one sow,
another reap ?' The answer is given by the Theravadin in the words of the Buddha. <EM>cf.
Points of Controversy, </EM>p. 322.</P>

<P>110 			The Numerical Sayings			TEXT ii, 81</P>

<P>Sariputta said thus to the Exalted One. ,What is the reason, Lord, what is the cause,
that such and such a trade-venture undertaken by some person should fail ? What is
the reason, Lord, what is the cause, that such and such a trade-venture undertaken by
some person should not succeed as intended?</P>

<P>What is the reason, Lord, what is the cause that such and such a trade-venture
undertaken by some person should succeed even as intended ? What is the reason,
Lord, what is the cause, that such and such a trade-venture undertaken by some
person, should succeed even beyond his intention?"</P>

<P>Sariputta, herein a certain person approaches a recluse or a br&agrave;hmin and invites him
saying Pray, Sir, order any requisites.' He offers but gives them not. Then he departs
from that life and is reborn. He starts a certain trade, but it goes to ruin.</P>

<P>On the other hand, Sariputta, herein a certain person approaches a recluse or a
brahmin and invites him saying Pray, Sir, order any requisites.' He offers but does
not give them as intended. He departs from that life and is reborn. He starts a trade
but it succeeds not to his wish.</P>

<P>Again, Sariputta, in this connexion-a certain person approaches a recluse or a
br&agrave;hmin and invites him saying `Pray, Sir, order any requisites.' He both offers and
supplies them even as intended. Then he departs from that life and is reborn. He starts
a trade and it succeeds even as intended.</P>

<P>Lastly, Sariputta, in this connexion a certain person approaches a recluse or a
br&agrave;hmin and invites him saying `Pray, Sir, order any requisites.' He both offers and
supplies them even beyond his intention. Then he departs</P>

<P>viii. § 82]			 On the Perfect Way				 111</P>

<P>from that life and is reborn. He starts a trade and it succeeds even beyond his
expectation.</P>

<P>Verily, Sariputta, these are the reasons, these are the causes, why a trade-venture
undertaken by a certain person should fail, not succeed as intended, succeed as
intended and also succeed even beyond expectation."</P>

<P><EM>(10) Disabilities of Women</EM></P>

<P><EM></EM>Once the Exalted One dwelt in Ghosita-park at Kosambi. Then the venerable &acirc;nanda
came to where the Exalted One was. Having so come he made obeisance to the
Exalted One and took a seat at one side. So seated the venerable &acirc;nanda said thus to
the Exalted One</P>

<P>"What is the reason, Lord, what is the cause that womenfolk do not preside in a court
of justice,' nor engage in an occupation, nor go to a foreign* country ?</P>

<P>&acirc;nanda, a woman is given to anger. &acirc;nanda, woman is envious. &acirc;nanda, a woman is
greedy. &acirc;nanda, woman is poor in wisdom. This is the reason, &acirc;nanda, this is the
cause, why women-folk do not preside in a court of justice, nor engage in an
occupation, nor go to a foreign country."</P>
