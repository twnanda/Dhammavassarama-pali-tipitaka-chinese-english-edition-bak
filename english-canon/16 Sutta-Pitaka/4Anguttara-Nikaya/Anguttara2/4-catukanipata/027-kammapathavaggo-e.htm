<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>(11) Lust</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Brethren, for the purpose of comprehending lust, four things must be developed.  What
four ?</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Herein, brethren, let a brother, as to body, continue so to look upon body that he remains
ardent, self-possessed and mindful, having overcome both the hankering and the
dejection common in the world.  And in the same way as to feelings, thoughts and ideas,
let him so look upon each, that he remains ardent, self-possessed and mindful, having
overcome both the hankering and the dejection common in the world.*</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Brethren, for the purpose of comprehending lust, four (other) things must be developed. 
What four ?</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Herein, brethren, a brother produces a desire, strives, makes an effort, applies and exerts
his mind to prevent the arising of evil and sinful conditions that have not yet arisen; so
does he strive to put away evil and sinful conditions that have arisen ; for the coming
into existence of good and virtuous conditions that have not arisen ; for the continuance
of good and virtuous conditions that have arisen, for the absence of confusion, for the
growth,</P>

applies and exerts himself.  Brethren, for the purpose of comprehending lust these four
things must be developed.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Brethren, for the purpose of comprehending lust these four (other) things must be
developed.  What four ?</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Herein, a brother develops the four bases of psychic powers,* to wit : the making
determination in respect of concentration on purpose, on will, on thoughts and on
investigation.  Brethren, for the purpose of comprehending lust these four things must be
developed.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Brethren, for the purpose of well understanding, for the ending, the putting away, the
extinction, the passing away, the detachment and cessation from, the forsaking and
renunciation of lust,--these four things must be developed.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>For the purpose of comprehending, understanding, ending . . . ignorance, hatred, enmity,
ill-feeling malice, envy, avarice,* deceit, craft, hypocrisy, pride, arrogance, conceit and
negligence-these four things must be developed.'</P>
