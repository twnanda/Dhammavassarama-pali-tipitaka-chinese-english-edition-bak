<P>To live in a suitable country, to associate with good and righteous people, to possess
a rightly-resolved mind, and to have done good deeds in a former life. Indeed,
brethren, whosoever among devas and men is endowed with this lucky tetrad ere long
attains to fullness and greatness in worldly possessions.</P>

<P>With goodly friends around,</P>

<P>With right-aspiring mind</P>

<P>(2)Kindly Feeling</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>0 brethren, there are these four bases of kindly feeling.* What are the four ?
Liberality, pleasant words, doing a good turn, and equal treatment.* These indeed,
brethren, are the four bases of kindly feeling.</P>

<P>A generous hand, kind words, doing good turns,</P>

<P>Being on equal terms in season due-</P>

<P>Such acts of kindly feeling in this world</P>

<P>Are like the linch-pin of a moving car.</P>

<P>But if those acts be wanting, mother who bore</P>

<P>And father who begat will not receive</P>

<P>The honour and respect that are their due.</P>

<P>Wherever wise men fear these acts in mind,</P>

<P>They win great influence, and praise is theirs</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">

come forth he shakes off sluggishness. Having so done he looks around in the four
directions. Then he roars thrice. Having so roared he</P>

<P>goes forth in search of food. And then, brethren, whatsoever animals hear the roar of
the lion, king of beasts, they tremble with exceeding fear, terror and alarm. Animals
living in holes flee to their holes, aquatic animals rush into the water. Those living in
the jungles run away to the jungles. Birds fly into the sky. Brethren, even the royal
elephants, whether in village, market-town or royal city, well-secured with strong
ropes, do split and break their bonds, and stricken with fear begin to void their
excrements and flee wheresoever they can flee. Brethren, the lion, king of beasts, is
therefore the lord of animals and is possessed of great majesty.</P>

<P>In the self-same way, brethren, when an Accomplished One appears in the world, an
Exalted One, a Supremely Enlightened One, Perfect in knowledge and conduct, an
Auspicious One, a Knower of all the worlds, an Incomparable One, a Teacher of
devas and men, an Awakened One, a Blessed One,--He thus proclaims the Norm: "
Thus is body-bood," thus is the arising of body-hood, thus is the ceasing of body-hood and thus is the path leading to the cessation of body-hood.'</P>

<P>Brethren, whatsoever devas are long-lived, of comely appearance, enjoying much
happiness and in long possession of splendid mansions, when they hear the Norm
declared by the Accomplished One, they become stricken with exceeding fear, terror
and alarm (and exclaim):" Of a truth, friends, being impermanent we fancied
ourselves permanent: being unstable we fancied ourselves stable, and being
temporary we fancied ourselves eternal. Indeed, friends, we are confined by body-hood, which is impermanent,</P>

longing for continued existence and has ended the desire for the holy life.* Thus
indeed, brethren, is a,brother one who has done with all foolish longings.</FONT></P>

Brethren, a brother has given up happiness, has given up pain, has ended happiness
and pain in the past also, and having perfected equanimity (which is removed alike
from both happiness and pain) and mindfulness, he dwells having attained the Fourth
Ecstasy. Thus indeed, brethren, is a brother one whose bodycomplex is calmed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Brethren, how does a brother become a solitary one ? Brethren, a brother has
destroyed egoism, with roots cut out, like a palm tree with its base destroyed and
rendered unable to sprout again, so that in future it does not again come into
existence. Thus indeed, brethren, does a brother become a solitary one.</FONT></P>
