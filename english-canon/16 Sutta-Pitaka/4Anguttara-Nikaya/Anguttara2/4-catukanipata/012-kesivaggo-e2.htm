<P>0nce a trainer of horses, (by name) Kesi, came to where the Exalted One was. Having
come he made obeisance to the Exalted One and took a seat at one side. To the horse-trainer Kesi so seated the Exalted One spake thus:</P>

<P>"Indeed, Kesi, you are a skilled' horse-trainer. Kesi, how do you then train a horse
that is to be tamed ? "</P>

<P>"Indeed, Lord, I train a horse that is to he trained by gentleness, I train by severity
and I train both by gentleness and severity."</P>

<P>Then, Kesi, if the horse that is to be tamed does not yield to your training, either by
gentleness, or severity, or both gentleness and severity, what do you do to him ?</P>

<P>Then, Lord, if the horse does not yield to' my training, either by gentleness or
severity, or both gentleness and severity, Lord, I destroy him. What is the reason
therefor ? In order that it may not be a reproach unto the lineage of my teacher. Lord,

I train by both gentleness and severity. Kesi, this is how (it is done(,) by gentleness

evil ; thus is evil by words, thus is the fruit of evil by words; thus <EM>is </EM>evil by mind and
thus is the fruit of evil by mind; thus is purgatory, thus is birth into animal life and

yield to-the training, either ,by gentleness or by severity or by both gentleness and

<P>"Well, Kesi, if the human to be tamed does not yield either to gentleness or severity
or both gentleness and severity, I destroy him."</P>

<P>"Surely, Lord, the Exalted One does not destroy life! "destroy him, Kesi." i</P>

<P>True it is, Kesi, the, Tath&agrave;gata does not destroy life, if the human to be tamed yield
not to training by gentleness and so forth, as stated, the Tath&agrave;gata does not regard
him as deserving of being told or admonished, neither do</P>

<P>Brethren, how does the royal elephant become an attentive hearer ?</P>

<P>Brethren, herein when the elephant-trainer imposes upon him a task, whether done
before or not, the royal elephant, making that his object and applying his mind
thereto, with thoughts collected, listens to it with ready ear. Thus indeed, brethren,
the royal elephant becomes an attentive hearer.</P>

<P>Brethren, how does the royal elephant become a killer ?</P>

<P>Brethren, herein the royal elephant having entered into battle kills elephants and
elephant-riders, also horses and horse-riders, and destroys chariot-riders and foot-soldiers. Thus, brethren, does the royal elephant become a killer.</P>

<P>Brethren, how does the royal elephant become an endurer ?</P>

<P>Brethren, herein the royal elephant having entered into battle endures * blows with
spears, swords, arrows, and axes, also the sounds of drums, kettledrums, conches,
tamtams and other kinds of din. Thus, brethren, the royal elephant becomes an
endurer.</P>

<P>Brethren, how does the royal elephant become a goer ?</P>

<P>Brethren, herein the royal elephant, when the elephant trainer sends him in a certain
direction, whether he has gone before or not, quickly goes. Thus, brethren, does the
royal elephant become a goer.</P>

<P>Verily, brethren, the royal elephant, when endowed with these four qualities becomes
worthy of the king, is a royal property, and is reckoned as an asset to the king.</P>

<P>Herein, brethren, a brother, when the Norm-discipline set forth by the Tath&agrave;gata is
preached, makes that his ohject, and applying his mind thereto listens to the Doctrine
with all his heart, attentively, with ready ear. Thus, brethren, a brother is a hearer.</P>

<P>And how, brethren, is a brother a slayer ? Herein, brethren, a brother does not
welcome a vague lustful thought that has arisen : he rejects it, banishes it, makes an
end of it, makes it cease to exist......... So also with regard to a vague thought of
harming that has arisen, and any evil unprofitable state of mind that arises from time
to time : he rejects it, banishes it, makes an end of it, makes it cease to exist. Even so,
brethren, is a brother a slayer.</P>

<P>And how, brethren, is a brother an endurer ? Herein, brethren, a brother is patient of
cold, heat, hunger, thirst, the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind and sun and creeping
things ; of abuse that oversteps the bounds of speech ; of feelings that affect the body
when they arise, painful, sharp, harsh, bitter, unpleasant, offensive pains that sap
one's life-[all these] he endures. Thus, brethren, is a brother an endurer.</P>

<P>And how, brethren, is a brother a goer ? Herein, brethren, a brother quickly goes
thither-in directions where in this long long journey he has never gone before-to wit :
to the calming of all the activities, to the leaving of all basis (for rebirth), to the
destruction of craving, to disgust, to cessation, to Nibbana. Thus, brethren, is a
brother a goer.</P>

<P>So, brethren, with these four properties endowed, a brother is worshipful..... a
boundless field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</P>

<P><EM>(5)Foitr Things</EM></P>

<P><EM></EM>Brethren, there are these four things.' What four ? There is a thing, brethren, which is
unpleasant to be done, and when done it leads to loss. There is a thing, brethren,
which is unpleasant to be done, but when done it leads to gain. There is a thing,
brethren, which is pleasant to be done but when done it leads to loss. And there is
also a thing, brethren, which is pleasant to be done and when done leads to gain.</P>

<P>Among these, brethren, whatsoever thing is unpleasant to be done, which when done
leads to loss, such a thing brethren, is in both ways regarded as not to be done.</P>

<P>Whatsoever thing is regarded as unpleasant to be done, on that ground it should be
regarded as not to be done. Whatsoever thing when done leads to loss on that ground
also it should be regarded as not to be done. This thing, brethren, is in both ways
regarded as not to be done.</P>

<P>Among these, brethren, whatsoever thing is unpleasant to be done but when done
loads to gain, from this thing, brethren, the fool and the wise man should be known,
in point of manly strength, manly vigour and manly energy.</P>

<P>Brethren, the fool does not think` This thing, though in a way unpleasant to be done,
nevertheless when done leads to gain,' and he does not do it. Such, a thing left
undone leads to his loss. But, brethren, the wise man considers thus `This thing,
though unpleasant to be done, nevertheless when done leads to gain.' He does such a
thing. Such a thing when done leads to his gain.</P>

<P>1 Th&agrave;n&agrave;ni is literally,` places' or `things,' hence stations, `occasions' (not a deed but
a possibility of Karma).</P>

<P>Among these, brethren, whatsoever thing is pleasant to be done, but when done leads
to loss, from this thing, brethren, the fool and the wise man should be known, in point
of manly strength, manly vigour and manly energy.</P>

<P>Brethren, the fool does not think: ` This thing though pleasant to be done nevertheless
when done leads to loss.' He does it. Such a thing when done leads to loss.</P>

<P>The wise man however thinks thus:` This thing though pleasant to be done
nevertheless when done leads to loss.' He does not do it. Such a thing left undone
leads to gain.</P>

<P>Among these, brethren, whatsoever thing is pleasant to be done and when done leads
to gain, such a thing, brethren, is to be regarded in both ways as worthy to be done:
because such a thing is pleasant to be done, on this ground it is regarded as fit to be
done ; and, because such a thing when done leads to gain, on this ground also it is to
be regarded as fit to be done. Such a thing therefore, brethren, is regarded in both
ways as fit to be done.</P>

<P>Brethren, in four ways should earnestness, mindfulness and guard of thoughts be

earnestness, mindfulness and guard of thoughts be promoted by oneself.</P>
