<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Brethren, how does a brother become an archer who shoots far ?</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Herein, brethren, a brother sees things with the eye of insight as they really are, and
regards them thus:`This indeed is not my body, feelings, perception, activities or
consciousness. This I am not, and this is not my soul, whether all such body (and so
forth) be past, present or future, subjective or objective, gross or subtle, low or high,
far or near.' Verily, brethren, such a brother is like unto an archer who shoots far.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Brethren, how does a brother become an archer who shoots as quick as lightning ?
Herein, brethren, a brother knows as it really is : ` This is Ill, this is Ill's cause, this is
Ill's Cessation and this is the Path leading to Ill's Cessation.' Verily, brethren, such a
brother is one who shoots as quick as lightning.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Brethren, how does a brother become an archer who pierces huge objects ? Herein,
brethren, a brother pierces the huge mass of ignorance. Verily, brethren, such a
brother is an archer who pierces huge objects.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Truly a brother who is possessed of these four qualities becomes worthy of offerings
(and so forth) a supreme field of merit to the world.</P>

subject to death, fears not and trembles not at death ?</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>"Nay ! br&agrave;hmin, there is one who, being subject to death, fears and trembles at death.
Also there is one who, subject to death, fears not and trembles not at death.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Brahmin, who is he that being subject to death fears and trembles at death ?</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Herein, br&agrave;hmin, a certain one has not rid himself of clinging to sensual desires nor
dispelled desire, affection, thirst, burning and craving ; he is then stricken by a certain
dire disease. To him thus stricken by a dire disease this thought occurs `Pleasant
sensual enjoyments will now indeed forsake me, and I shall have to forsake pleasant
sensual enjoyments.' Thus he mourns, is troubled, wails and weeps, beating his
breast, and so becomes bewildered. Verily, brahmin, this is he who, being subject to
death, fears and trembles at death.</P>

protected those who are in fear, but has done sinful acts, cruelties and wrongs. This
man is stricken by a certain dire disease. To him thus stricken by a dire disease this
thought occurs` Alas ! I have done no good and meritorious deeds, nor protected
those who are in fear, but have done sinful acts, cruelties and wrongs, My friend,
whatsoever may be the fate of those who have done no good and meritorious deeds,
nor protected those who are in fear, and have done sinful acts, cruelties and wrongs, I
shall hereafter go to that state.' Thus he mourns, is troubled, wails and weeps, beating

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Again, br&agrave;hmin, a certain one is wavering and doubting and has not attained to
perfection in the Norm ; he is then stricken by a certain dire disease. To him so

attain to perfection in the Norm.' Thus he mourns, is troubled, wails and weeps,
beating his breast and so becomes bewildered. Verily, br&agrave;hmin, this is he who, being

wanderers.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Then at eventide the Exalted One, rising from His solitude, came to the Wanderers'
Park on the banks of Sappini. Now at that time among these wanderers of other
views, as they sat together in assembly, this conversation arose:" The standard *
truths are these. The standard truths are these."</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Just then the Exalted One came to where the wanderers were. Having so come He sat
down on the seat prepared for Him. So seated the Exalted One spake thus to the
wanderers:</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>"On what talk, wanderers, are ye here and now engaged us ye sit together, and what
talk between you have I interrupted ?"</P>

deeds, make great pronouncements and master deep meanings."</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>" Then, my good friend, it is because the recluse R&agrave;maputta is wiser than the wise
King Eleyya and more pre-eminent among those who do great deeds, make great
pronouncements and master deep meanings, that King Eleyya having a great faith in
the recluse R&agrave;maputta shows him such excessive obedience, to wit : devotion,
reverence, respectful salutation, and due observance.</P>

Yamaka, Moggalla, Ugga, N&agrave;vindaki, Gandhabba and Aggivessa, wise and pre-eminent among those who do great deeds, make great pronouncements and master
deep meanings ?</P>

assembly is pure and established in the Reality. Such an Order of brethren, such an
assembly as this is hard to find in the world. Such an Order of brethren, such an
assembly as this is worthy of offerings, hospitality, gifts, respectful salutation as unto
the supreme field of merit to the world. To such an Order of brethren, to such an
assembly as this even a little that is given becomes great, and much that is given
becomes still greater. Brethren, such an Order of brethren, such an assembly as this is
well worth a journey of countless stages,*, even if one had to carry his food in a bag
to do it.' Just such an Order of brethren is this.</P>

consciousness. Having in all respects gone beyond the sphere of infinity of
consciousness, he attains to and abides in the sphere of nothingness. Having in all
