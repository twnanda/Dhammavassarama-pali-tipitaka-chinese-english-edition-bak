<P>Brethren, a brother, whilst wearing a robe given by any one, dwells in the attainment

<P>Brethren, a brother, whilst using the requisites for medicine and support for the sick
offered by any one, dwells in the attainment of boundless concentration of the mind.
To him accrues a yield in merit and virtue which brings about happiness, heavenly
bliss, good results and leads to heavenly life, conducting to good, to welfare, benefit,
delight and blessing.</P>

<P>Indeed, brethren, the merit of the Ariyan disciple, who is endowed with these four
yields in merit and virtue, is not easy to measure. Such a yield in merit and virtue
brings about happiness, heavenly bliss, good results and leads to heavenly life,
conducting to good, welfare, benefit, delight and blessing. Indeed, such is reckoned a
great factor of immeasurable and boundless merit.</P>

<P>Just as, brethren, it is not easy to measure the water of the great ocean (saying) `there
are so many measures of water, so many hundreds of measures of water, so many
thousands of measures of water, so many hundreds of thousands of measures of water
'-for it is reckoned as a huge, immeasurable and boundless quantity of water ;
likewise, brethren, the merit of the Ariyan disciple who is endowed with these four
yields in merit and virtue is not easy to calculate. Such a yield in merit and virtue
brings about happiness, heavenly bliss, good results, leads to heavenly life,
conducting to good, welfare, benefit and blessing. Indeed it is reckoned as a great
factor of immeasurable and boundless merit.</P>

<P>Brethren, there are these four yields in merit and virtue, which bring about happiness,
heavenly bliss, good results and lead to heavenly life, conducting to good, welfare,
benefit, delight and blessing. What four ?</P>

<P>Brethren, herein the Ariyan disciple is endowed with perfect faith in the Exalted One
thus:`He the Exalted One is an Arahant, Supremely Enlightened, full of wisdom and
goodness, a Blessed One, a World-knower, a peerless Tamer of men, the Teacher of
devas and men, an Awakened One, an Exalted One.' Brethren, this is the first yield in
merit and virtue, which brings about happiness, heavenly bliss, good results and leads
to heavenly life, conducing to good, welfare, benefit, delight and blessing.</P>

<P>Brethren, the Ariyan disciple is also endowed with perfeet faith in the Norm, thus
`Well-proclaimed by the Exalted One is the Norm, to be realised in this life and
without delay, bidding us come and see, leading us onward, to be known by the wise
as a personal experience.' Brethren, this is the second yield in merit and virtue,</P>

<P>78                                          <EM>The Numerical Saying                                    </EM> [TEXT ii,
57</P>

<P>which brings about happiness, heavenly bliss, good results, and leads to heavenly life,
conducing to good, welfare, benefit, delight and blessing.</P>

<P>Brethren, the Ariyan disciple is also endowed with perfect ' faith in the Order, thus
Well-practised is the Order of the Exalted One's disciples, also, in uprightness,
method and propriety ; namely, the four pairs of persons, the eight classes of
individuals. Such is the Order of the Exalted One's disciples, to whom offering and
duty should be done and gifts and reverent greeting given, for they are 4 the supreme
field of merit in the world.' Brethren, this is the third yield in merit and virtue, which
brings about happiness, heavenly bliss, good results, leads to heavenly life,
conducting to good, welfare, benefit, delight and blessing.</P>

<P>Brethren, the Ariyan disciple is also endowed with virtues lovely to the holy Ones,
unbroken and flawless, consistently practised, unblemished, making men free,
commended by the wise, unperverted and conducing to rapt concentration. Brethren,
this is the fourth yield in merit and virtue, which brings about happiness heavenly
bliss, good results, and leads to heavenly life, conducting to good, welfare, benefit,
delight and blessing.</P>

<P>These indeed, brethren, are the four yields in merit and virtue, which bring about
happiness, heavenly bliss, good results, and leads to heavenly life, conducing to good,
welfare, benefit, delight and blessing.</P>

<P>At one time, the Exalted One had entered the high road between Madhura and
Veranj&agrave;. Also many householders and their wives had joined the high road between
Madhura and Veranj&agrave;. Then the Exalted One having left the road took a seat under a
certain tree, and these householders and their wives saw the Exalted One seated under
a certain tree. So seeing they came to where the Exalted One was. Having come they
made obeisance to the Exalted One and sat at one side. 	To the householders and
their wives so seated at one side the Exalted One spake thus:</P>

<P>Householders, there are these four ways of living together. What are the four ? A vile
man ! lives with a vile woman, a vile man lives with a goddess, a god lives with a vile

<P><EM>(5) Happy Couple</EM></P>

<P><EM></EM>At one time the Exalted One dwelt in the Deer-park of the Bhesak&agrave;la-grove at
Crocodile Haunt, in the country of the Bhagg&agrave;. Now the Exalted One in the forenoon
having put on His under-garment, taking bowl and outer-robe proceeded to the
residence of the householder Nakula-pit&agrave; l (Nakula's father). Having arrived He sat
down on the seat prepared for Him. Then both Nakula's father and mother came to
where the Exalted One was. Having come they made obeisance to the Exalted One,
and sat at one side. So seated the householder Nakulapit&agrave; spoke thus to the Exalted
One: "Lord, ever since Nakulam&agrave;t&agrave; as a girl was brought home to me, when a youth, I
know not of any misbehaviour ' on her part even by thought, much less in deed. Lord,
we desire in this life to rejoice with each other and also to rejoice with each other in
the next world."</P>

<P>Also the wife Nakulam&agrave;t&agrave; said thus to the Exalted One: "Lord, ever since I as a girl
was taken home to Nakulapit&agrave; when a youth, I know not of any misbehaviour on his
part even in thought, much less in deed. Lord, we desire in this life to rejoice with
each other and also to rejoice with each other in the next world."</P>

desire to rejoice with each other in this life and also to rejoice with each other in the
next world.</P>

of the Koliyans. Having arrived He sat down on the seat made ready for Him. Then
indeed Suppav&agrave;s&agrave;, the daughter of the Kol.iyans, waiting on Him with her own hands
