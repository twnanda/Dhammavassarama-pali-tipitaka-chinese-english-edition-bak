<P><EM>(1) Concentration</EM></P>

<P><EM></EM>BRETHERN, there are these four ways of self-concentration. What are the four ?
First, there is a way of self-concontration, which, well-practised and developed,
results in a happy condition in this life. Then, brethren, there is a way of self-concentration which, well-practised and developed, results in the attainment of
perfect knowledge. Then, brethren, there is a way of self-concentration, which, well
practised and developed, results in mindfulness and intelligence. Lastly, brethren,
there is also a way of self-concentration, which, well-practised and developed, results
in the extinction of the intoxicants.</P>

<P>Brethren, what is the way of self-concentration which, well-practised and developed,
results in a happy condition in this life ? Brethren, herein a brother, separating
himself from passions and sins, with reflection and investigation, enters and remains
in the First Ecstasy (Jhana), where there is joy and ease born of seclusion.</P>

<P>Freeing his mind from reflection and investigation, and having it concentrated, and
retaining the joy and case consequent on the tranquillity of mind, he enters and
remains in the Second Ecstasy.</P>

<P>v. § 41]                                          To Rohitassa                                                        63</P>

<P>Freeing his mind from joy he obtains indifference to pain and pleasure. He lives
enjoying bodily felicity; the saints pronounce this indifference to pain and pleasure as
the Third Ecstasy.</P>

<P>Then divesting himself of happiness and sorrow and primarily freeing himself of
pleasure and pain, he arrives at and remains in the Fourth Eestasy-a state of mind
indifferent to all emotions alike. Brethren, this is said to be the way to self-concentration, which, well-practised and developed, results in a happy condition in
this life.</P>

<P>Brethren, what is the way of self-concentration, which, well-practised and developed,
results in the attainment of perfect knowledge ?.Brethren, herein a brother exercises
the faculty of perfection by day, perceives clearly by day as well as by night : thus by
open and clear mind he develops the radiant faculty of perfection. Brethren, this is
said to be the way of self-concentration, which, well practised and developed results
in the attainment of perfeet knowledge.</P>

<P>Brethren, what is the way of self-concentration, which, well-practised and developed,
results in mindfulness and intelligence ? Brethren, herein a brother clearly
understands sensation, perception and conception as each of them arises, presents
itself. to the mind and passes away. Brethren, this is said to be the way of self-cocentration, which, well-practised and developed, results in mindfulness and
intelligence.</P>

<P>Brethren, what is the way of self-concentration, which, well-practised and developed,
results in the extinction of the intoxicants ? Brethren, herein a brother dwells in the
observance of the arising and passing away of the factors</P>

<P>of the fivefold clinging to existence` thus is body, thus is the arising of body, thus is
the passing away of body, thus is sensation, perception, mental coefficients and
consciousness, thus is the arising and the passing away thereof.' Brethren, this is said
to be the way of self-concentration, which, well-practised and developed, results in
the extinction of the intoxicants. Indeed, brethren, these are the four ways of self-concentration. This also was uttered by one in connexion with the Questions of
Punnaka in the <EM>Chapter on Destiny.*</EM></P>

<P>At one time the Exalted One dwelt at An&agrave;thapindika's Park in the Jeta Grove at

<P>At that time .Rohitassa,son of a deva, of surpassing beauty, at the waning of the night,
illuminating the whole of the Jeta Grove, came to where the Exalted One was.
Having so come he made obeisance to the Exalted One, and stood ' at one side.
Standing at one- side, Rohitassa, son of a deva, said thus to the Exalted One "Lord, is
there any world wherein. there is no birth, death, decay or repeated births and deaths,
the end whereof (such world) it is possible to know  <EM>see </EM>or reach by going ?"</P>

<P>" Indeed, friend, I do declare that there is no world, where there is no birth, death,
decay or repeated births and deaths, the end whereof it is possible to know, see or
reach by going to it."</P>

<P>" How wonderful and marvellous, 0 Lord! This is indeed well said by the Exalted
One:-, Indeed, friend, I do declare that there is no world, wherein there is no birth,
death, decay or repeated births and deaths, the end whereof it is possible to know, see
or reach by going.' 0 Lord, long ago I was a seer called Rohitassa, son of Bhoja,
possessed of psychic powers and able to go through the air. Lord, I had then
command of such a speed, even as a skilled, trained, well-practised and dexterous
archer  easily shoots a light arrow far beyond (ground covered by)the shadow of a

attending to the calls of  nature, sleeping and resting though 1 had one hundred years
length of life, and though 1 walked for a hundred years, yet 1 died on the way, not
having reached the end of the world. How wonderful and marvellous 0 Lord ! This is
indeed, Lord, well said by the Exalted One."</P>

<P>Indeed, friend, I declare there is no world wherein there is no birth, death, decay or
repeated deaths and rebirtlis. the end whereof it is possible to know, see or reach by
walking. But, friend, 1 do not declare that without reaching the end of the world one
can make an end of sorrow. My friend, I do proclaim that in this very fathom-long
body, with its feelings and mind, is the world, the world's arising, the world's ceasing

assembly hall, teaching, rousing, stirring and gladdening the brethren by means of a
religious discourse, couched in courteous language, distinct and clearly enunciated,
unfolding the meaning, full of doctrinal meaning and transcendental.' Then the
Exalted One at eventide, having risen from His solitude, proceeded to where the
assembly hall was. Having arrived He sat down on the seat prepared for Him. So

happiness in sorrow is a hallucination of peraception, of thinking and of views.
Brethren, to say that there is a soul in soullessness is a hallucination of perception, of
thinking and of views. Brethren, to say that there is purity in impurity is a
hallucination of perception, of thinking and of views. These indeed, brethren, are.the
