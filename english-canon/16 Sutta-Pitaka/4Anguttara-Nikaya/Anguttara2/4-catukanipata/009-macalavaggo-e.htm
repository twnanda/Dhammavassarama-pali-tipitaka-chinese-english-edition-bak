<P>Brethren, who is the one that is in darkness and goes on into darkness ?</P>

<P>Herein, brethren, a certain one is born into a low caste, either as a ca&otilde;&oacute;&agrave;1a, a hunter,
a basket-weaver, a wheelwright,* a scavenger or as a beggar, destitute of food and
drink, finding it hard to get a livelihood, born where food and clothing are hardly
won. He is then of dark complexion, ugly to look upon, dwarfed, full of sickness, and
either blind of one eye, deformed, and lame or paralysed. Not getting food, drink,
clothes, carriage, bed, dwelling or light,</P>

<P>or perfumes and garlands of flowers, he commits evil deeds with the body, evil deeds
with the lips, and evil deeds with the mind. Thus having done evil acts with the body,
with the lips and with the mind, upon the dissolution of the body, he is after death
reborn into a state of woe and suffering, or into purgatory. Indeed, brethren, this is the
one that is in darkness and goes on into darkness.</P>

<P>Brethren, who is he that is in the light and goes on into darkness ?</P>

<P>Herein, a certain one is born into a high caste, either a wealthy princely clan, a
wealthy br&agrave;hmin clan or a wealthy clan of the householders ; rich, of great wealth and
resources; possessed of much gold and silver, property, money and treasures. He is
also beautiful in person, comely in appearance, amiable, and endowed with the
highest beauty of complexion ; amply supplied with food, drinks, clothes, equipages,
perfumes and garlands of flowers, with bed, dwelling or light. But he commits evil
deeds with the body, evil deeds with the lips and evil deeds with the mind. Thus
having done evil acts with the body, words and thoughts, on the dissolution of the

<P>Brethren, there are these four persons to be found existing in the world. What four ?
The steadfast recluse,* the white lotus-like* recluse, the blue lotus-like* recluse and
the exquisite* among all recluses.</P>

<P>1 <EM>O&otilde;ata-nica, l&agrave;maka</EM>. Comy.</P>

<P>2 <EM>Samanam-acalo</EM>, 'unshaken recluse,' refers to the seven classes of <EM>sekh&agrave;. </EM>He is said
to be , steadfast,' as he is firmly established in the faith.</P>

<P>3 Pundarika is the lotus flower consisting of less than one hundred petals and
here:applies to <EM>sukkha- vipassaka</EM>-Arahant. He is called samana-pundarika as he  
lacks <EM>jh&agrave;na  </EM>and <EM>abhi&iuml;&iuml;a</EM> and is imperfect in virtues. <EM>Pundarika</EM> = white lotus.</P>

<P>4 Paduma is the lotus flower consisting of over a hundred petals and here applies to
the intoxicant-freed Arahant, who has perfected <EM>jh&agrave;ns  </EM>and abi&iuml;&iuml;as. He is thus called
<EM>samana-paduma</EM>, blue lotus.</P>

<P><EM>5 Samana-sukhum&agrave;lo</EM>. Among all these recluses this Samana is absolutely freed in
mind and hence freed from all ills, bodily or mental and refers to Himself and those
like unto Himself only, i.e., all Tath&agrave;gatas-Comy.</P>

<P>Brethren, who is the person called the steadfast recluse ? Brethren, a brother is under
training and discipline and dwells aspiring to attain the supreme emancipation from
the, bonds. Just as, brethren, the eldest son of a royal anointed king, though not yet
himself anointed, is quite certain of the crown. Likewise, brethren, is a brother who is
under training and discipline aspiring to attain the supreme emancipation from the
bonds . he indeed, brethren, is the steadfast recluse.</P>

<P>Brethren, who is the person called the white lotus-like recluse ?</P>

<P>Brethren, herein a brother, having destroyed the intoxicants, is without the
intoxicants, is emancipated in mind and emancipated through insight, and in this life,
having achieved supernormal knowledge, he himself dwells in the attainment thereof,
but without applying his mind to the acquisition of the eight ecstatic conditions.
Indeed, brethren, this is the person called the white lotus-like recluse.</P>

<P>Brethren, who, is the person called the blue lotus-like recluse ?Brethren, herein a
brother having destroyed the intoxicants and go forth, himself lives in the attainment
thereof, and also dwells with his mind applied to the acquisition of the eight ecstatic
meditations. This indeed, brethren, is the person called the blue lotus-like recluse.,</P>

<P>Brethren, who is the person called the exquisite among all reclucs ?</P>

<P>Brethren, herein a brother being oft invited (to almsgiving) enjoys many robes, and
few if uninvited. Being oft invited he enjoys much alms-food and but little if
uninvited. Being Oft invited he enjoys bed and lodging, and few if uninvited. Being
oft invited he enjoys a good store of</P>

<P>1 <EM>Samana-paduma-samatha y&agrave;nika</EM> Arahant.</P>

<P>medical requisites and supports for the sick and the feeble, and but little if uninvited.
If he dwell in the company of some holy ones, many of their deeds of body please
him, but only a few do not please. They do many actions by word and thought that
please him, but only a few that do not please. They make many presents of offerings
which are pleasing and only a few that are not pleasing.</P>

<P>Whatsoever feelings there be, whether arising from bile, phlegm, wind or a
combination of these, or due to change of season, being attacked by adversities, due
to another's agency, or as a result of Kamma, these do not arise unto him in plenty,
and he is free from illness.</P>

<P>He has gained the four pleasure-giving ecstasies easily and without difficulty, and
having destroyed the intoxicants is without the intoxicants, emancipated in heart and
emancipated in intellect, and himself in this very life, having realised the supreme
faculties, dwells in the attainment thereof. Of a truth, brethren, this one among (all)
recluses is the absolutely happy recluse.</P>

<P>Verily, brethren, if one should rightly describe it, among recluses it is Myself whom
he would call the absolutely happy recluse. Brethren, if one should rightly describe it,
among recluses he would call Myself the exquisite recluse, inasmuch as I use many
robes being oft invited . . . <EM>[repeat the same as above set forth].</EM></P>
