<P><EM></EM>BRETHREN, four blessings should be expected from listening to with the ear,
constant recitation with the voice, careful consideration with the mind and
penetration of the Norm through insight*. What four ?</P>

<P>Herein, brethren, a brother masters the Norm consisting of the Suttas..... Vedalla.* He
thus listens to, constantly recites, carefully ponders over and penetrates the Norm.
When he dies bewildered*' in mind and is reborn in a certain assembly of devas,
there the blissful ones recite to him the stanzas of the Norm. Brethren, the arising of
mindfulness is slow, but such a being quickly achieves distinction therein.* Brethren,
this is the first blessing that should be expected from listening to, constant recitation,
careful consideration and penetration of the Norm through insight.</P>

words are perhaps sayers of what has been said by the Exalted One, and do not
misrepresent the Exalted One by saying something that is not (true), and they explain
it according to the truth of the Norm ; so that no one who is of his doctrine and a
sharer of his views would render himself liable to blame (by mis-stating what the
Exalted One says). Indeed, Lord, we ourselves desire not to misrepresent the Exalted

you think it must be right] out of respect, with the thought `one must revere a

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Herein, brethren, an Accomplished One is born in the world, an Exalted One, a
Supremely Enlightened One, Perfect in knowledge and conduct, an Auspicious One,
Knower of the worlds, an Incomparable One, Teacher of devas and men, an
Awakened One, a Blessed One. Having realised it for Himself, He declares the nature

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>268 				The Numerical Sayings			 [TEXT ii, 208</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>proclaims the Norm, lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, and lovely in its
end, both in the spirit and in the letter, and sets forth the pure and holy life fulfilled in
its entirety. Then a householder or son of a householder listens to the Norm and is
reborn in a certain family. Hearing the Norm he acquires confidence in the
Accomplished One.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>He, being endowed with such confidence reflects thus:</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>`The household life is oppressive and a sphere of defilement. The life of a recluse is
in the open air. It is not easy for those yet living the family life to lead the holy life in
its entire fulness and in its entire purity, like unto a polished conch-shell. What if I
shave off hair and beard, don the yellow robe and wander forth from the home to the
homeless ?' Then at some future time giving up his property, whether small or great,
and giving up a circle of relations whether small or great, he shaves off hair and
beard, dons the yellow robe and wanders forth from the home to the homeless.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Thus having wandered forth and leading a well trained life, he gives up killing and
abstains from taking life ; and having laid down stick and sword, being quiet and
showing kindness, he dwells compassionate and full of solicitude for the welfare of
all beings and creatures. Having given up thieving, he abstains from taking what is
not given. Taking only what is given and expecting only what is given, he dwells
without stealing in purity.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Having given up unchastity he becomes chaste, keeps aloof and abstains from the
sexual act-the village-way.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Havimg given up lying, he abstains from falsehood, and being truthful, firm, reliable
and trustworthy, utters not</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>XX. § 198]				 The Great Ohapter

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>words offensive to the world. Having given up malicious speech, he abstains from
slander. Hearing something said here he says it not there, to cause dissension among
some. Not having heard something here he says it not there, to cause dissension
among others. Thus he reconciles those that are at variance and confirms those who
are friendly. Delighting in concord, finding pleasure in concord and seeing joy in
concord, he utters words only tending to bring about harmony.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Having given up rough speech he abstains from harsh words. Whatsoever words are
gentle, pleasant to the ear, amiable, reaching the heart, urbane,* agreeable to the
multitude and pleasing to the many, he utters only such words. Having given up
frivolous talk, he abstains from frivolous words. He speaks in season, speaks the
truth, speaks sense, speaks according to the Norm and speaks according to the rules
of the Discipline. He utters words worthy of remembrance, at the proper time, full of
wise counsel, discriminating and profitable.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>He abstains from injury to seeds and vegetation,* accepts one meal a day, refrains

and silver, from receiving raw grain, from accepting raw flesh, from accepting

him. Just as a bird having wings, wherever it flies, goes with only the weight of its
wings,* so also a brother, protecting his body with the robe and satisfying his hunger
with alms-food, wherever he goes, he goes with only bowl and robe. Possessed of this
noble group of righteous conduct he experiences within himself the happiness of
blamelessness.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Seeing a form with the eye he is not entranced by the general appearance or the
details thereof ; because sinful thoughts of avarice and ill-will may overtake him
who, dwells with the sense of sight uncontrolled, he regulates his life, guards the

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Endowed with this noble group of righteous conduct, endowed with this noble

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>After his meal, having returned from the alms-round, he sits down cross-legged, with
body erect and mindfulness well set. Having cast out covetousness from his mind, he
dwells with mind freed from(covetousness and cleanses the mind therefrom. Having
cast out hatred, he dwells with mind freed from hatred, and being compassionate and
full of solicitude for all living beings and creatures he cleanses his mind from hatred.
Having cast out stolidity and drowsiness, he dwells freed from these and conscious of
insight, mindful and self-possessed, he cleanses the mind of stolidity and drowsiness.
Having cast out flurry, he dwells well balanced (in mind) and with mind calmed he
cleanses the mind of flurry, Having cast out doubt he dwells having overcome doubt,
and being free from doubt he cleanses the mind from doubt as to meritorious
conditions.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT>Having cast out these five hindrances and weakened the depravities of the mind by
the aid of insight and aloof from sensual delights........ he enters on</P>
