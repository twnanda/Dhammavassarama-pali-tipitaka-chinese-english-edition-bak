<P>(1) Need of a Teacher</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>0nce the Exalted One dwelt in the Park of An&agrave;thapindika at Jetavana in (the city of)
S&agrave;vaithi. Then He addressed the brethren, "0 brethren." They replied, " Yea, Lord."
The Exalted One spake thus;</P>

<P>Once, brethren, soon after attaining Enlightenment, I dwelt near the Goat-herd's
Banyan-tree on the banks of the river Neranjar&agrave; in (the village of) Uruvels. When so
alone with thoughts collected, this train of thought arose in my mind "It is indeed
sorrowful to dwell without one to respect or be obedient unto (as teacher). What if I
dwell serving, esteeming and depending upon some recluse or brahmin (as teacher) ?</P>

<P>In my mind brethren, this train of thought also occurred: For the purpose of fulfilling
any virtues, selfconcentration, insight or emancipation still unperfected, in the wo;rld
of gods, M&agrave;ras, Brahm&agrave;s and among all devas and men, I see not another recluse or
br&agrave;hmin, who is superior in virtuous conduct, self-eoncentration, insight or
emaneipation, whom I may live serving, esteeming and depending upon (as teacher).'</P>

<P><EM>11.§ 21]                                          At Uruvel&agrave;                                                          27</EM></P>

<P><EM></EM>Then, brethren, this other train of thought occurred to my mind: ' This Norm was
realised by myself and is it* meet that I should dwell serving, esteeming and
depending upon the Norm (as teacher).' Thereafter, brethren, Brahm&agrave; Sahampati,
knowing, by his mind what was in my mind, even as a powerful man extends his
bended arm or bends his extended arm, vanished from the Brahma realm and
appeared before me. Then, brethren, Btrahm&agrave; Sahampati uncovering his robe from
one shoulder, placing his right knee on the ground. and bending his joined hands
towards me in adoration said thus 'It is even so, Exalted One, it is even so,
Auspicious One ! Indeed for a long time in the past the Enlightened Arahant Buddhas
Supreme dwelt serving, esteeming and depending upon the Norm (as teacher). , For a
long time in the future the Enlightened Arahant Buddhas Supreme will dwell serving,
esteeming and depending upon the Norm (as teacher). Lord, may the 'Enlightened
Arahant, Buddha Supreme also at the present time dwell serving, esteeming and
depending upon the Norm (as teacher).' So said . Brahm&agrave; Sahampati, and having said
so, uttered this further:-</P>

<P>The Perfect Buddhas that are past,</P>

<P>The Perfect Buddhas yet to come,</P>

<P>The Perfect Buddha that is now,</P>

<P>Who hath for many banished woe-</P>

<P>All these did dwell, do dwell and still                       </P>

<P>Shall dwell in reverence for the Norm,</P>

<P>Wherefore let him who wisheth much</P>

<P>Prosperity unto himself</P>

<P>Do reverence to the Perfect Norm,</P>

<P>Remembering the Buddha's word.'</P>

<P>So said Brahm&agrave; Sahampati. Having said so, he did obeisance to me, walked around
me by the right and vanished there and then. Thus indeed, brethren, I yielded to
Brahm&agrave;'s entreaty. This Norm indeed, which is like unto me, was realised by myself.
I shall </P>

<P>therefore dwell serving, esteeming and depending upon this Norm. Whenever,
brethren, the Order becomes endowed with eminence, then shall I have deep regard
for the Order also."</P>

<P>(2)	Who is an Elder ?</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>Brethren, just after Enlightenment, once I dwelt here, near the Goat-herd's Banyan-tree on the banks of the river Neranjar&agrave; in (the village of) Uruvels. Then indeed,
brethren, many decayed, old, frail, decrepit and aged brghmins came to where I was.
Having come they greeted me, held pleasant and reminiscent talk with me and sat
down at one side. Brethren, those br&agrave;hmins so seated said to me:' Thus have we '
heard, Master Gotama, that Gotama the recluse neither greets, gets up from his seat
for, nor offers seats to decayed, old, frail, decrepit and aged br&agrave;hmins. Master
Gotama, it is even so. The worthy Gotama neither greets nor gets up from his seat for,
nor offers seats to decayed, old, frail, decrepit and aged br&agrave;hmins. It is even so
Master Gotama, but it is not proper so to do.'</P>

<P>Then, brethren, this thought came to my mind : ' Of a truth, these venerable ones
know not who an elder * is,</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>-</P>

<P>1 P.T .S. text wrongly has ne for n'etam=no etam.</P>

<P>2 <EM>Thera</EM>- <EM>karana-dhamm&agrave;</EM>, literally thera-making things, the qualifications of an elder.</P>

<P><EM>111 § 22] 				At Uruvel&agrave; 					29</EM></P>

<P><EM></EM>nor the qualifications of an elder. Indeed, brethren, one may be eighty, ninety or a
hundred years old from his birth: yet if he speaks at an improper time, tells lies, utters
useless words and says what is not the Norm and the Discipline, also if he speaks
what deserves not to be remembered, and at inopportune times endlessly talks empty
words which tend not to benefit, then such a person is reckoned as a foolish elder.</P>

<P>Brethren, even though a child or a youth has dark hair, in his happy youth and the
first stage of life, yet if he speaks at the proper time and then only what is true, utters
words useful and in keeping with the Norm and the Discipline and what is deserving
of being remembered, and also at opportune times gives sound and beneficial advice,
even such an one is indeed reckoned among the wise elders.</P>

<P>Brethren, there are these four qualifications of an elder. What are the four? Here (in
the world), brethren, a brother is virtuous, dwells in the observance of P&agrave;timokkha
rules, is endowed with good manners and behaviour, fears even venial sins and taking
the precepts practises them.</P>

<P>Then a brother is well-versed, with good memory well-stored, in that Norm which is
beautiful in the beginning, in the middle and in the end, both in its spirit and in the
letter, fulfilled in its entirety, and which declares the perfect life of purity. 1 say he is
well-versed in such Norm, has memorised and learnt it by rote, pondered over and
seen it with the clear eye of insight. Then, again (a brother) without effort, but easily
and comfortably takes pleasure in (the Four) Ecstasies (Jh&agrave;nas), which are dependent
upon clear consciousness and which result in happiness in this world.</P>

<P>And lastly, by eliminating the Intoxicants a brother dwells here in this life having
attained that emancipation of heart, which is free from the Intoxicants (&acirc;savas), and
the fruition of insight, having fully realised (the same),with clear vision. These
indeed, brethren, are the qualifications of an elder."</P>

<P>He who with muddled head pours forth</P>

<P>Much idle talk, with thoughts devoid</P>

<P>Of all restraint-he is a fool</P>

<P>Who takes no pleasure in the Norm.</P>

<P>Far from the rank of ' elder ' he.'</P>

<P>His view is wrong: he pays no heed.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>But whoso leads an upright life In all its fulness, he--a sage,</P>

<P>A learned man, of ready wit,</P>

<P>Of mind controlled-with wisdom's eye</P>

<P>He sees things as they really are.</P>

<P>Transcending all conditions he,-</P>

<P>Of open mind, of ready wit,</P>

<P>He hath rejected birth and death- He's perfect in the holy life.</P>

day K&agrave;alaka treated his Arahants (i.e., the Acelakas) with a meal at his house. The meal over, he
invited his daughter in-law to enter and do obeisance to his Arahants. As soon as C&aring;lasubhadda, saw

What are the four ? Among robes the refuse-rag is trifling and easily obtainable, it is

<P>faultless. Brethren, among dwellings, the foot of a tree is trifling and easily obtained,
it is also faultless. Brethren, among medicines ammonia is trifling and easily
obtained, it is also faultless. These indeed, brethren, are the four trifling things easily
procurable, they are also faultless. At any time, brethren, if a brother be contented
with anything trifling and easily obtainable, this is a qualification for recluse-ship in
him.* So say I.</P>

<P>Contented with what brings no blame,

Moreover, they are not despised by the wise recluses and br&agrave;hmins. What are the
four? Brethren, herein a brother is contented with any robe and becomes one who
praises contentment with any robe. Owing to robes he falls not into wrong in seeking
robes. He is neither  disappointed with not getting robes, nor does he covet robes that
he receives. He is not elated thereby, nor overcome by greed. Seeing the faults and
knowing the benefits he uses a robe. Owing to such contentment with a certain robe
he does not indeed praise himself, nor does he disparage others. Whoso, brethren, in
these matters is indeed expert, energetic, wise and mindful, such a brother is said to
be established in the ancient and primeval noble lineage.</P>

Owing to such fondness and attachment for meditation an for the purging (of the

<P>Once on a time the Exalted One dwelt at Vulture's Peak, near Rajagaha. There also
then lived, in a dwelling of the Wanderers on the banks of the (river) Sappini, many
well-known wandering ascetics-such as the Wanderers Annabh&agrave;ra, Varadhara and
Sakulud&agrave;yi and other wellknown wandering ascetics. Then the Exalted One at even
tide, having risen from solitude proceeded to where the Wanderers' dwelling was.
Having so come He accepted the seat prepared for Him. So seated, the Exalted One
spake thus to the Wanderers: 0 Wanderers, there are these four primeval,
distinguished, traditional and ancient portions of the Norm which are acceted now

<P>despised by wise recluses and br&agrave;hmins. What are the four ? 0 Wanderers, they are
the four portions of the Norm relating to absence of covetousness, absence of ill-will
right mindfulness and right concentration, which are primeval,distinguished,
traditional and ancient, accepted now and in the past, neither rejected now or in the
future, nor despised by wise recluses and br&agrave;hmins. If indeed, Wanderers, anyone
says thus:</P>

<P>I shall point out a recluse or a br&agrave;hmin, who though he has repudiated the portion of
the Norm relating to absence of covetousness, is still addicted to covetousness and
cleaves</P>

see his power." Of a truth, Wanderers, that he should so point out a recluse or a
br&agrave;hmin, who though he has repudiated that portion of the Norm relating to absence
of covetousness is still covetous and cleaves to worldly possessions-such a thing is
not possible.</P>

<P>If indeed, 0 Wanderers, any one says thus: ' I shall point out a recluse or a br&agrave;hmin,

censure and condemnation. What are the four ? This honourable one finds fault with
