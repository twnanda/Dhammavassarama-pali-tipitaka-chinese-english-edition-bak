nescience as regards the six sense-objects. This, brethren, is called the Bond of
nescience. He who is full of sin, demerit, passions and subject to the painful tortures
of rebirth and also future births, decay and, death is the, one who is not liberated from
the Bonds. Thes,e indeed, brethren, are.the four Bonds.</P>
