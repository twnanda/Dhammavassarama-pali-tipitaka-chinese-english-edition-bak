<p><b>(30) The Shorter Discourse on the</b>
<p><b>Simile of the Heartwood..</b></center>

<p>I heard thus.
<p>At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika
in Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi. Then the brahmin Pingaalakoccha approached
the Blessed One exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side. Seated,
the brahmin said to the Blessed One: Good Gotama, these recluses and brahmins,
with followers and teachers of followers are famous ford makers They are
the highly considered Puraana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosaala, Ajita Kesakambali,
Pakudha Kaccaayana, Sa~n~njaya Bela.t.thaputta and Nigan.tha Naataputta.
Venerable sir, did they all realise their view completely or didn’t they.
Or is it that some realised and some did not realise? Brahmin, whether
they all realised their view completely or did not realise their view completely,
or some realised and some did not realise, leave it alone. I will teach
it listen carefully and attentively. The brahmin Pingaalakoccha agreed
and the Blessed One said:
<p>Brahmin, like a man wandering in search of heartwood, would come to
a standing huge tree with heartwood and he would ignore, the heartwood,
sapwood, bark and shoots and would cut the branches and leaves, and go
away with it thinking it is the heartwood. A wise man seeing him would
say, this good man does not know the heartwood, sapwood, bark, shoots,
branches and leaves. He wandering in search of heartwood, come to a huge
standing tree with heartwood ignoring the heartwood, sapwood, bark and
shoots, has cut the branches and leaves and is carrying them away thinking
it is heartwood. The purpose for which he sought heartwood will not be
served.

<p>Brahmin, like a man wandering in search of heartwood would come to a
standing huge tree with heartwood and he would cut the heartwood itself
and go away with it knowing it is the heartwood. A wise man seeing him
would say. This good man knows the heartwood, sapwood, bark, shoots, branches
and leaves. He wandering in search of heartwood, come to a standing huge
tree with heartwood has cut the heartwood and is carrying it away knowing
it is the heartwood the purpose for which he sought heartwood will be served..
<p>Brahmin, a certain person leaving his household would go forth as a
homeless, out of faith thinking I am submerged in birth, decay, death,
grief lament unpleasantness and distress. It is only a few that declare
the complete ending of unpleasanatness. Gone forth thus, he is reborn in
gain, honour and fame. Satisfied with it and his desires fulfilled, he
would praise himself and disparages others. I am a gainer of hospitality,
these other bhikkhus are impotent and not wise. He does not arouse interest
or effort to realise something more exalted than gain, honour and fame
and abides infatuated and lethargic.

purpose he would not come. Brahmin, I say, this person is comparable to
that.

not praise himself nor disparage others. He arouses interest and makes
effort to realise something more exalted than gain, honour and fame. Not
infatuated nor lethargic takes upon himself the endowment of virtues. Satisfied
with it and his desires fulfilled praises himself and disparages others.
I’m virtuous these other bhikkhus are with evil demerit. He does not arouse
interest nor make effort to realise something more exalted than the endowment
of virtues..

<p>Brahmin, what thing is more noble and exalted than knowledges and vision.
Here brahmin, the bhikkhu, secluded from sensual desires and secluded from
demerit, with thoughts and thought processes and with joy and pleasantness
born of seclusion attained to abides in the first jhaana. Brahmin, this
thing is more noble and exalted than knowledges and vision
<p>Again, brahmin, the bhikkhu overcoming thoughts and thought processes,
the self internally appeased, the mind in one point, with joy and pleasantness
born of concentration attained to abides in the second jhaana. Brahmin,
this thing is more noble and exalted than knowledges and vision.
<p>Again, brahmin, the bhikkhu with equanimity to joy and detachment abides
mindful and aware, experiencing pleasantness with the body, attained to
the third jhaana. The noble ones call this, abiding mindfully in pleasantness
.with equanimity. This thing is more noble and exalted than knowledges
and vision.
<p>Again, brahmin, the bhikkhu dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness,
earlier having dispelled pleasure and displeasure, without unpleasantness
and pleasantness and with mindfulness purified with equanimity, attained
to abides in the fourth jhaana. Brahmin, this thing is more noble and exalted
than knowledges and vision.
<p>Again, brahmin, overcoming all perceptions of matter and all perceptions
of anger not attending to various perceptions, with space is boundless
attained to abides in the sphere of space. Brahmin, this too is more noble
and exalted than knowledges and vision.
<p>Again, brahmin, the bhikkhu overcoming all the sphere of space, with
consciousness is boundless attained to abides in the sphere of consciousness.
Brahmin, this too is more noble and exalted than knowledges and vision.
<p>Again the bhikikhu overcoming all the sphere of consciousness, with
there is no-thing attained to abides in the sphere of no-thingness. Brahmin,
this too is more noble and exalted than knoweldges and vision.
<p>Again the bhikkhu overcoming all the sphere of no-thingness attained
to abides in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. Brahmin,
this is more noble and exalted than knowledges and vision.
<p>Again the bhikkhu overcoming all the sphere of neither-perception –nor
non-perception attained to abides in the cessation of perceptions and feelings.
Seeing this with wisdom, desires are also destroyed. Brahmin, this too
is more noble and exalted than knowledges and vision.
<p>Brahmin, like a man wandering in search of heartwood come to a huge
standing tree with heartwood would cut the heartwood and would carry it
away knowing it is the heartwood, for whatever purpose he sought that heartwood,
to that purpose he would come. I say, this person is comparable to that.
<p>Brahmin, this holy is led not for, gain honour and fame, not for endowment
of virtues, not for endowment of concentration, and not for the endowment
of knowledges and vision. Brahmin, it is for the unshakeable release of
mind. This is the essence of the holy life, it is the heartwood and the
end of the holy life.
<p>When this was said the brahmin Pingaalakocca said to the Blessed One,
I understand good Gotama, it is as though, something overturned is reinstated
something covered is made manifest. As though the path is told to someone
who had lost his way .Or as lighting an oil lamp for those who have eyes
to see forms in the dark. Thus good Gotama has explained the Teaching in
many ways. Now I take refuge in good Gotaama, in the Teaching, and the
Community of bhikkhus. May good Gotama bear me as a lay disciple who has
taken refuge from today until life lasts.
