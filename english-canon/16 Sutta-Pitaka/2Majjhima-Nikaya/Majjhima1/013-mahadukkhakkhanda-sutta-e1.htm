<p><b>2.3 <i>Mahaadukkhakkhandhasutta.m</i></b>
<p><b>(13) The Major Mass of Unpleasantness.</b></center>

<p><b>I </b>heard thus.
<p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monasatery offered by Anaathapindika
in Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi. That morning a large number of bhikkhus put
on robes and taking bowls and robes entered Saavatthi for alms. Then it
occured to those bhikkhus, it is too early to go for alms, what if we went
to the monastery of the wandering ascetics . Then those bhikkhus went to
the monastery of the wandering ascetics, exchanged friendly greetings and
the bhikkhus sat on a side. Then the wandering ascetics said thus to the
bhikkhus. Friends, the recluse Gotama points the accurate comprehension
of sensuality, we too point the accurate comprehension of sensuality. The
recluse Gotama points the accurate comprehension of matter, we too point
the accurate comprehension of matter.The recluse Gotama points the accurate
comprehension of feelings, we too point the accurate comprehension of feelings.
So friends, what is the difference in the teaching and the advice given
by our teacher and the recluse Gotama . Those bhikkhus, not pleased with
those words of the wandering ascetics, and not able to protest, got up
from their seats and went away thinking we will know the meaning of those
words from the Blessed One.
<p>Then those bhikkhus went the alms round in Saavatthi and after the meal
was over and returning from the alms round approached the Blessed One and
said thus: Venerable sir, this morning we put on robes and taking our bowls
and robes entered Saavatthi for alms. Then it occured to us, it is too
early to go the alms round, what if we went to the monastery of the wandering
ascetics. Then we went to the monastery of the wandering ascetics, exchanged
friendly greetings and sat on a side. To us seated the wandering ascetics
said thus: Friends, the recluse Gotama points the accurate comprehension
of sensuality, we too point the accurate comprehension of sensuality. The
recluse Gotama points the accurate comprehension of matter, we too point
the accurate comprehension of matter. The recluse Gotama points the accurate
comprehension of feelings, we too point the accurate comprehension of feelings.
So friends, what is the difference, in the teaching and the advice given
by our teacher and the recluse Gotama. Venerable sir, we were not pleased
with the words of the wandering ascetics, yet unable to protest we got
up from our seats and came away thinking we will know the meaning of those
words from the Blessed One.
<p>Bhikkhus, to the wandering ascetics who say thus this is the reply.
Friends, what is the satisfaction in sensuality, what is the danger in
sensuality, what is the escape from sensuality.What is the satisfaction
in matter, what is the danger in matter, what is the escape from matter.
What is the satisfaction in feelings, what is the danger in feelings and
what is the escape from feelings. Bhikkhus, when asked thus the wandering
ascetics unable to reply become annoyed. What is the reason: Bhikkhus,
it is beyond their range. In this world of gods and men together with the
Maaras and Brahmaas and recluses and brahmins, I do not see anyone who
could explain this other than the Thus Gone One, or a disciple of the Thus
Gone One, or one who heard it here. .
<p>Bhikkhus, what is the satisfaction in sensuality. Bhikkhus, fivefold
are the strands of sensuality. What five: Exciting, agreeable, pleasant
forms, arousing sensual desires, cognizable by eye consciousness. Exciting,
agreeable, pleasant sounds, arousing sensual desires cognizable by ear
consciousness. Exciting , agreeable , pleasant smells, arousing sensual
desires cognizable by nose consciousness. Exciting, agreeable pleasant
tastes, arousing sensual dessires cognizable by tongue consciousness. Exciting
agreeable pleasant touches, arousing sensual desires congizable by body
consciousness Whatever pleasantness and pleasure arises on account of these
five strands of sensuality, that is the satisfaction in sensuality.
<p>Bhikkhus, what is the danger in sensuality Whoever son of a clansman
would have to make a living by some craft either handling money, or counting,
or Mathematics, or farming, or trading, or rearing cattle, or ruling the
country, or serving the king, or doing any other craft would have to under
go cold and heat, the sting of gad flies and yellow flies, the heat of
the air, the touch of creeping things, would have to bear hunger and thirst.
This is the danger of sensuality here and now, the mass of unpleasantness
owing to sensuality. This son of a clansman, strives and puts forth effort
yet wealth does not accrue to him. He grieves and laments beats his breast
and comes to bewilderment of mind. This son of a clansman strives and puts
forth effort and wealth accrues to him, then he comes to unpleasantness
and displeasure administrating ways and means to protect his wealth.What
if the king carries away my wealth, or thieves run away with it, what if
fire burns it or be carried away by water. Or if unwelcome heirs carry
it away. Then his wealth is either carried away by the king or carried
away by thieves, or burnt by fire, or carried away by water, or some unwelcome
heirs carry it away and he grieves and comes to much unpleasantness and
displeasure. Bhikkhus, this is the danger of sensuality here and now, the
mass of unpleasantness owing to sensuality.
<p>Again, bhikkhus, kings dispute with kings, warriors with warriors, brahmins
with brahmins, householders with householders, mother disputes with the
son, the son with the mother, the father with the son, the son with the
father, brother with brother, brother with sister, sister with brother,
friend with friend, They dispute quarrel and approach each other with hands,
clods, sticks, weapons, and even face death, or come to deadly unpleasantness.
This is the danger of sensuality here and now, the mass of unpleasantness
owing to sensuality.
<p>Again on account of sensuality the two parties, take swords and shields,
bows and arrows, and other weapons and approach each other, throw slippery
implements at each other, shoot arrows, swords flickering like lightening,
boiling oil is sprinkled and each other is crushed with superior force,
necks are cut and they face death or deathly unpleasantness. This too is
the danger of sensuality here and now, the mass of unpleasaantness owing
to sensuality. .
<p>Again on account of sensuality, robbers break into houses, plunder,
rob, stay in ambush, go to others’ wives,.. The king metes them punishment
are caned and wipped, flogged with the jungle rope, flogged with the soiled
stick, hands are severed, legs are severed, or both hands and legs are
severed, ears and nose are severed, are put in the boiling gruel pot, shell
tonsured, put in Raahu’s mouth, garlanded with the blazing garland, hands
are scorched, the bark dress is given, put with snakes, putting hooks in
the flesh, cutting pieces of flesh from the body, driving a spike from
ear to ear, beating to make the body like straw, immersing in the boiling
oil, giving to the dogs to be eaten, raising on a spike alive until death,
and cutting the neck with the sword. This too is the danger of sensulaity
here and now, the mass of unpleasantness owing to sensuality.
<p>Again, bhikkhus, on account of sensuality, misbehaving in body, in words
and mentally, after death are born in loss, in decrease are born in hell.
This is the danger of sensuality here after, the mass of unpleasantness
owing to sensuality
<p>Bhikkkhus, what is the escape from sensuality, Whoever bhikkhu gives
up the interest and greed for sensuality, that is the escape from sensuality.
.
<p>Bhikkhus, a recluse or brahmin who does not know the satisfaction of
sensuality as the satisfaction , the danger of sensuality as the danger
and the escape from sensuality as the escape, as it really is, would know
sensuality himself accurately or teach others to attain accurate knowledge
of sensuality is not a possibility. A recluse or brahmin, who knows the
satisfaction of senssuality as the satisfaction, the danger of sensuality
as the danger and the escape from sensuality as the escape, would know
sensuality himself accurately or teach others to attain accurate knowledge
of sensuality is a possibility.
<p>Bhikkhus, what is the satisfaction of matter. Like a young girl of warrior
caste, or brahmin caste, or of householder caste, in her fifteenth or sixteenth
year, not too tall nor too short, not very thin nor very fat, not very
dark nor very fair, that girl at that time has attained the highest pefection
of beauty. Whatever pleasantness and pleasure arises on account of that
perfection of beauty, that is the satisfaction in matter.
<p>Bhikkhus, what is the danger of matter. That same sister with time becomes
eighty years or ninety years or even a hundred years, and is seen decayed,
bent like a rafter, shivering and supported on a stick, miserable all the
youth gone, teeth broken, hair greyed, head bald, the skin wrinkled and
spotted, all her earlier perfection of beauty vanished and the danger appeared.
Bhikkhus, this is the danger of matter. That same sister is seen diseased,
in unpleasantness, badly ill, immersed in her own urine and excreta, raised
and laid by others. All her earlier perfection of beauty vanished and the
danger appeared. Bhikkhus, this too is the danger of matter. Again, that
same sister is seen dead abandoned in the charnel ground. After one, or
two, or three days bloated, turned blue and festering , her earlier perfection
of beauty vanished and danger appeared, this too is the danger of matter.
Again, that same sister is seen abandoned in the charnel ground
<p>devoured by crows, hawks, vultures or by dogs and foxes, or by various
other living things, her earlier pefection of beauty vanished and danger
appeaared, this too is the danger of matter. Again, that same sister would
be seen abandoned in the charnel ground a skeleton with flesh and blood
joined with veins.- Askeleton without flesh or blood joined with veins.
Bones thrown every where, in one place a hand bone, in another a foot bone,
in another a knee bone, in another a thigh bone, in another a hip bone,
in another the back bone and in another the scull , her earlier perfection
of beauty vanished and the danger appeaared.this too is the danger of matter.
Again that sister is seen abandoned in the charnel ground , bones turned
white the colour of shells, bones decayed after three years, -bones turned
to dust. Her earlier perfection of beauty vanished and the danger appeared.
Bhikkhus, this too is the danger of matter.
<p>Bhikkhus, what is the escape from matter. The driving out of interest
and greed, the dispelling of interest and greed for matter. That is the
escape from matter. .
<p>Bhikkhus, a recluse or brahmin who does not know the satisfaction of
matter as the satisfaction , the danger of matter as the danger and the
escape from matter as the escape, as it really is, would know matter himself
accurately or teach others to attain accurate knowledge of matter is not
a possibility. A recluse or brahmin, who knows the satisfaction of matter
as the satisfaction, the danger of matter as the danger and the escape
from matter as the escape, would know matter himself accurately or teach
others to attain accurate knowledge of matter is a possibility.
<p>Bhikkhus, what is the satisfaction in feelings: Here the bhikkhu secluded
from sense desires, secluded.from demeritorious thoughts with thoughts
and thought processes and with joy born of seclusion abides in the first
jhaana. When the bhikkhu secluded from sense desires, secluded from demeritorious
thoughts, with thoughts and thought processes and with joy born of seclusion
abides in the first jhaana, he does not think to hurt himself, nor does
he think to hurt others He does not think to hurt either. At such times
he feels non-hurtful feelings only. Bhikkhus, I say, the satisfaction in
feelings is the highest non-hurtfulness.
<p>Again bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu overcoming thoughts and thought processes,
the mind internally appeased , concentrated and in one point , without
thoughts and thought processes and with joy born of concentration abides
in the second. jhaana-- abides in the third jhaana - abides in the fourth
jhaana. When the bhikkhu dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness, earlier
having dispelled pleasure and displeassure, mindfulness purified with equanimity
abides in the fourth jhaana, he does not think to hurt himself, nor does
he think to hurt others. He does not think to hurt either. At such times
he feels non-hurtful feelings only. Bhikkhus, I say, the satisfaction in
feelings is the highest non-hurtfulness.
<p>Bhikkhus, what is the danger in feelings. That feelings are impermanent,
unpleasant, changing things that is the danger in feelings.
<p>Bhikkhus, what is the escape from feelings. That giving up and dispelling
of interest and greed for feelings that is the escape from feelings.
<p>Bhikkhus, a recluse or brahmin who does not know the satisfaction of
feelings as the satisfaction , the danger of feelings as the danger and
the escape from feelings as the escape, as it really is, would know feelings
himself accurately or teach others to attain accurate knowledge of feelings
is not a possibility. A recluse or brahmin, who knows the satisfaction
of feelings as the satisfaction, the danger of feelings as the danger and
the escape from feelings as the escape, would know feelings himself accurately
or teach others to attain accurate knowledge of feelings is a possibility.
<p>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words
of the Blessed One.
