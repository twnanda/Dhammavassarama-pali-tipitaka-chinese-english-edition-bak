<p><b>4. 9.<i> Mahaassapurasutta.m</i></b>
<p><b>(39) The Longer Discourse in Assapura.</b></center>

<p>I heard thus.
<p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the Anga country, in a hamlet named
Assapura and addressed the bhikkhus from there.
<p>Bhikkhus, people call you recluses, and you too acknowledge we are recluses.
Bhikkhus, you, who have promised to be a recluse, should take upon yourself
to abide by the things that make you a recluse and a brahmin.By that our
recluse-ship becomes true, and our promise is carried out. May it be fruitful
to them that offer us robes, morsel food, dwellings and requisites when
ill.May my going forth be fruitful, and full of results. Bhikkhus, you
should train thus.
<p>Bhikkhus, what are the things that make you a recluse and a brahmin?
We will be endowed with shame and remorse. Bhikkhus, thus you should train.
Bhikkhus, it might occur to you thus;.We are endowed with shame and remorse.
With this much our recluse-ship is done. If you be satisfied, thinking
there is nothing more to do, I inform, entreat, and annonce to you, do
not fall from your recluse-ship, there is something more to do.
<p>Bhikkhus, what further thing has to be done? We will be pure in our
bodily actions manifest, open and without a flaw.Yet on account of that
purity of bodily actions we will not praise ourselves or disparage others.
Bhikkhus, thus you should train. It might occur to you. We are endowed
with shame and remorse and our bodily actions will be pure. When this much
is done, our recluse-ship is done. If you be satisfied, thinking there
is nothing more to do. I inform, entreat and announce to you, do not fall
from your recluse-ship, there is something more to do.
<p>Bhikkhus, what further thing has to be done? We will be pure in verbal
actions manifest, open and without a flaw. Yet on account of that purity
of verbal actions we will not praise ourselves or disparage others.Bhikkhus,
thus you should train. It might occur to you. We are endowed with shame
and remorse, our bodily actions are pure, our verbal actions are pure.
When this much is done, our recluse-ship is done. If you be satisfied,
thinking there is nothing more to do, I inform, entreat and announce to
you, do not fall from your recluse-ship, there is something more to do.
…. . .
<p>Bhikkhus, what further thing has to be done. We will be pure in mental
actions manifest, open and without a flaw. Yet on account of that purity
of mental actions we will not praise ourselves or disparage others. Bhikkhus,
thus you should train. It might occur to you. We are endowed with shame
and remorse, our bodily actions are pure, our verbal actions are pure.
Our mental actions are pure. When this much is done, our recluse-ship is
done. If you be satisfied, thinking there is nothing more to do, I inform,
entreat and announce to you, do not fall from your recluse-ship, there
is something more to do. …
<p>Bhikkhus, what further thing has to be done? We will be pure in our
livelihood manifest, open and without a flaw. Yet on account of that purity
of livelihood we will not praise ourselves or disparage others. Bhikkhus,
thus you should train. It might occur to you We are endowed with shame
and remorse, our bodily actions are pure, our verbal actions are pure.
Our mental actions are pure .and our livelihood is pure. When this much
is done, our recluse-ship is done. If you be satisfied, thinking there
is nothing more to do, I inform, entreat and announce to you, do not fall
from your recluse-ship, there is something more to do.
<p>Bhikkhus, what further thing has to be done? We will be with protected
mental faculties. Seeing a form with the eye we will not take the sign
or the details. To one living with the mental faculty of the eye not protected,
evil demerit of covetousness and displeasure may arise. To control it,
we fall. Hearing a sound with the ear, Cognising a smell with the nose,
Cognising a taste with the tongue, Cognising a touch with the body, Cognising
an idea with the mind will not take the sign or the details. To one living
with the mental faculty of the mind not protected, evil demerit of covetousness
and displeasure may arise. To control it we fall. Thus you should train
It might occur to you. We are endowed with shame and remorse, our bodily
actions are pure, our verbal actions are pure. Our mental actions are pure
.and our livelihood is pure. We are controlled in our mental faculties.
When this much is done, our recluse-ship is done. If you be satisfied,
thinking there is nothing more to do, I inform, entreat and announce to
you, do not fall from your recluse-ship, there is something more to do.
<p>Bhikkhus, what further thing has to be done? We will know the right
amount to partake food. Reflecting we will partake food, not for play,
not for intoxication, not for growth and beauty, for the upkeep of this
body, not to enjoy soups. As support to lead the holy life. Putting an
end to earlier feelings, will not arouse new feelings. It will be without
blame for a pleasant abiding. Thus you should train. It might occur to
you. We are endowed with shame and remorse, pure bodily actions, pure verbal
actions, pure.mental actions and a pure livelihood. We are controlled in
our mental faculties. We know the right amount to partake of food... When
this much is done, our recluse-ship is done. If you be satisfied, thinking
there is nothing more to do. I inform, entreat and announce to you, do
not fall from your recluse-ship. There is something more to do.
<p>Bhikkhus, what further thing has to be done? We should be yoked to wakefulness.
During the day seated in the chankamana, we will clean the mind of obstructing
things. In the first watch of the night seated in the chankamana, we will
clean the mind of obstructing things. In the middle watch of the night,
turning to the right side making the lion’s posture, keeping one foot over
the other, mindful and aware of the time of waking we will lie. In the
last watch of the night .seated in the chankamana we will clean the mind
of obstructing things. Thus you should train. Bhikkhus, . it might occur
to you thus. We are endowed with shame and remorse, our bodily, verbal
and mental actions are pure. Our livelihood is pure. We are controlled
in our mental faculties.We know the right amount to partake of food...We
are yoked to wakefulness..When this much is done, our recluse-ship is done.
If you be satisfied, thinking there is nothing more to do. I inform, entreat
and announce to you, do not fall from your recluse-ship, there is something
more to do.
<p>Bhikkhus, what further thing has to be done?. We will be endowed with
mindful awareness. Coming forward and turning back we will be aware. Looking
on and looking away we will be aware. Bending and stretching we will be
aware, Wearing the three robes and bowl we will be aware. Tasting, drinking,
eating and enjoying we will be aware.Urinating and excreting we will be
aware. Going, standing, sitting, lying, awake, talking or being silent
we will be aware. Thus you should train. Bhikkhus, it might occur to you.
We are endowed with shame and remorse. Our bodily, verbal and mental actions
are pure. Our livelihood is pure. We are controlled in our mental faculties.
We know the right amount to partake of food...We are yoked to wakefulness...We
are mindful and aware. When this much is done, our recluse-ship is done.
If you be satisfied, thinking there is nothing more to do. I inform, entreat
and announce to you, do not fall from your recluse-ship. There is something
more to do.
<p>Bhikkhus, what further thing has to be done. We will abide in a secluded
dwelling a forest, the root of a tree, mountain grotto or cave, a charnel
ground, a forest jungle, an open space, or a heap of straw. Returning from
the alms round, after the meal is over, we will sit in a cross legged posture,
mindfulness established in front. Dispelling covetousness for the world.
Will abide with a mind free of covetousness. Dispelling anger will abide
with a mind free of anger. With the perception of light will abide sloth
and torpor dispelled from the mind. Will abide appeasing the self, dispelling
restlessness and worry. Will abide dispelling doubts, about merit that
should and should not be done
<p>Bhikkhus, like a man would borrow some money to engage in some business.
When that business prospered, he would pay off the debt and would have
some money remaining for his wife and children. So he would reflect, earlier
I borrowed this money and engaged in this business. It prospered. I paid
off the debt and now I have some money remaining to attend to my wife and
children. He gains joy and pleasure on account of it.Or like a man who
was seriously ill, not desiring even to take food, and in the meantime
he would get over the illness Food too will become agreeable to him and
he would regain his bodily strength. So he reflects, earlier I was seriously
ill, food was not agreeable to me. Now I have overcome that illness, food
is agreeable, and now I have regained my bodily strength. Recalling this
he gains joy and pleasure. Or like a man, released from prison. Happy and
without fear and not losing his wealth. He reflects, earlier I was a prisoner,
now am free and happy. I have not lost my wealth and now I live without
fear. Recalling that he gains pleasure and joy. Or like a man who was a
slave under another’s power, not in his own power, not able to go where
he liked. Released he is no more under another’s power, using his power,
freed from slavery would go where he liked. He reflects, earlier, I was
a slave, under another’s power, not in my own power. Now I ‘m free, in
my own power, free to go where I like. On account of that he gains joy
and pleasure. Or like a man in a desert with his wealth. Would safely cross
the desert without loss of wealth. He would reflect, I entered the desert
path with all my wealth and crossed the desert safely without loss of life
or wealth and he gains pleasure and joy on account of it. In the same manner
the bhikkhu sees himself as though in debt, with an illness, in prison,
as a slave, and as in a desert path when the five hindrances are not dispelled,
When they are dispelled he sees himself as the debt paid off, the illness
subsided, released from prison, released from slavery, and as having crossed
the desert path
<p>Dispelling the five hindrances and wisely making less the minor defilements
of the mind, he secludes the mind from sensual thoughts and defiling thoughts.
With thoughts and thought processes, and with joy and pleasantness born
of seclusion, attained to abides in the first jhaana. He pervades this
body, perfects it and fills it up with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion.Does
not leave a single spot untouched with that joy and pleasantness born of
seclusion. Bhikkhus, like a bather or his apprentice, would place some
bathing powder in a bronze vessel, would mix it sprinkling water and turning
it into a ball of lather.He would mix it well, until the lather becomes
a ball and nothing would trickle down from it. In the same manner he would
pervade this body, perfect it and fill it up with the joy and pleasantness
born of seclusion, not leaving a single spot untouched with that joy and
pleasantness.
<p>Again, the bhikkhu overcoming, thoughts and thought processes, would
bring the mind to a single point appeasing it internally. And without thoughts
and thought processes and with joy and pleasantness born of concentration
would attain to abide in the second jhaana. Then he would pervade this
body, perfect it and fill it up with joy and pleasantness born of concentration.
He would not leave a single spot untouched with that joy and pleasantness
born of concentration. Like a deep pond without inlets from the east, west,
north or south, is filled up with cool water springing from the bottom.
Rain water too would not enter it.The cool water coming up, would fill
it flowing all round and completing it, not leaving a single spot untouched
by that cold water. In the same manner he pervades this body, perfects
it and fills it up with joy and pleasantness born of concentration.Would
not leave a single spot untouched with the joy and pleasantness born of
concentration. . .
<p>Again, the bhikkhu, with equanimity to joy and detachment, would abide
mindful and aware, experiencing pleasantness too with the body and abide
attained to the third jhaana.To this the noble ones say abiding in pleasantness
with equanimity.Then he pervades this body, perfects it, fills it up with
pleasantness devoid of joy. Would not leave a single spot untouched with
that pleasantness devoid of joy. Like, of blue, red and white lotuses that
grow in a pond, some are born, grow, develop, nourish and bloom in the
water. Their tops and roots are pervaded with the cold water and they do
not have a place not touched with the cold water. In the same manner he
pervades this body, perfects it, and fills it up with pleasantness devoid
of joy, touching everything with that pleasantness.
<p>Again the bhikkhu, dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness, and earlier
over coming, pleasure and displeasure, with mindfulness purified with equanimity
attained to abides in the fourth jhaana. Then.he sits pervading the whole
body with that pure and clean mind, not leaving out any spot. Like a man
who has covered himself with a white cloth together with the head, without
leaving out anything. In the same manner he sits pervading the whole body
with that pure clean mind, not leaving out any spot untouched with the
pure clean mind. .
<p>When the mind is concentrated, pure, free from minor defilements is
malleable workable not disturbed, he directs the mind for the knowledge
of previous births. Recollects the manifold previous births, one birth,
two births, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred
births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, innumerable forward
cycles of births, innumerable backward cycles of births, innumerable forward
and backward cycles of births. There I was of such name, clan, disposition,
supports, experiencing such pleasant and unpleasant feelings and with such
a life span.Disappearing from there, was born there, with such name, clan,
disposition, supports, experiencing such pleasant and unpleasant feelings,
with such a life span. Disappearing from there, is born here. Thus with
all modes and all details he recollects the manifold previous births.
<p>When the mind is concentrated, pure, free from minor defilements, malleable
workable not disturbed, he directs the mind for the knowledge of the disappearing
and appearing of beings. With the heavenly eye purified beyond human, he
sees beings disappearing and appearing unexalted and exalted, beautiful
and ugly, arising in good and bad states according to their actions: These
good beings misbehaving by body, speech and mind, blaming noble ones, with
the wrong view of actions, after death are born in loss, in decrease, in
hell. As for these good beings, well behaved in body speech and mind, not
blaming noble ones, with the right view of actions after death are born
in heaven. Thus with the heavenly eye purified beyond human he sees beings
disappearing and appearing.
<p>When the mind is concentrated, pure, free from minor defilements, malleable
workable not disturbed, he directs the mind for the destruction of desires..
Knows, this is unpleasant, this is the arising of unpleasantness, this
is the cessation of unpleasantness and this is the path to the cessation
of unpleasantness as it really is.: Knows these are desires, this the arising
of desires, this the cessation of desires and this is the path to the cessation
of desires as it really is. When he knows thus and sees thus his mind is
released from sensual desires, the desires ‘to be’, and desires of ignorance.
Knowledge arises I’m released, birth is destroyed, have done what should
be done. The holy life is lived, there is nothing more to wish. Like a
man standing on the bank of a pond in a mountain glen with pure clear undisturbed
water would clearly see shells, pebbles, stones and gravel and shoals of
fish moving and floating in the water. In the same manner, he knows this
is unpleasant, this is the arising of unpleasantness, this is the cessation
of unpleasantnes and this is the path to the cessation of unpleasantness
as it really is. Knows, these are desires, this the arising of desires
this is the cessation of desires and this is the path to the cessation
of desires as it really is. When he knows thus and sees thus, his mind
is released from sensual desires, from desires ‘to be’ and from desires
of ignorance. Knowledge arises I’m released He knows birth is destroyed,
what should be done, is done.The holy life is lived, there is nothing more
to wish.
<p>Bhikkhus, to this is said the bhikkhu becomes a recluse, a brahmin,
a bather, an authority, one mentally well, a noble one, a perfect one.
Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu become a recluse?. He is arranged with the
defiling things of evil demerit, heavy with future results of birth, decay
and death.*1) Thus the bhikkhu becomes a recluse. How does the bhikkhu
become a brahmin? He has expelled*2) the defiling things of evil demerit,
heavy with future results of birth, decay and death.Thus the bhikkhu becomes
a brahmin.How does the bhikkhu become a bather?.He has washed out*3) the
defiling things of evil demerit, heavy with future results of birth, decay
and death. Thus the bhikkhu becomes a bather. How does the bhikkhu become
an authority?.He becomes the authority*4) of the defiling things of evil
demerit, heavy with future results of birth, decay and death. Thus the
bhikkhu becomes an authority. How does the bhikkhu become mentally well?
He becomes sharp*5) about the defiling things of evil demerit, heavy with
future results of birth, decay death. Thus the bhikkhu becomes sharp.Bhikkhus,
how does the bhikkhu become noble? He moves far away from.the defiling
things of evil demerit, heavy with future results of birth, decay and death.
Thus the bhikkhu becomes noble. Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu become perfect?
He moves far away from the defiling things of evil demerit, heavy with
future results of birth, decay and death. Thus the bhikkhu becomes perfect..
<p>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words
of the Blessed One. .

for himself the defiling things of evil demerit, heavy with future results
