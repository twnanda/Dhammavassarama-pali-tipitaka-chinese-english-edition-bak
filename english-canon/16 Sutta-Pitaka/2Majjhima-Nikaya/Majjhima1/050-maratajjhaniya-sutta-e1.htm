<p><b>(50)-Frightening the Evil One</b>.</center>

<p>I heard thus.
<p>At one time venerable Mahaamoggallaana was living in the Bhagga country,
in the deer park among the Su.msunaara peaks in the Bhesakalaa forest.
At that time venerable Mahaamoggallaana was walking in the open. Death
the Evil One entered venerable Mahaamoggallaana’s stomach through the groins
Then it occurred to venerable Mahaamoggallaana, why is my stomach so heavy,
as though in advanced pregnancy. Then venerable Mahaamoggallaana stepped
out of the walking meditation and entered the monastery and sat on the
seat prepared. .Seated he directed his attention inside. When attending
internally he saw the Evil One in the stomach entered through the groins,
and addressed him: Evil One get out! Do not worry the Thus Gone One and
the disciples of the Thus Gone One. It will be for your unpleasantness
for a long time. Even his Teacher would not know me so quickly, how could
his disciple know me so quickly. Evil One I know you thinking, He does
not know me You are the Evil One. I knowing and seeing you address. Get
out Evil One! Do not worry the Thus Gone One. Do not worry the disciples
of the Thus Gone One. It will be for your unpleasantness for a long time
. Even if it was his Teacher, he would not know me so quickly. How could
his pupil know me so quickly Evil One did it occur to you, even his teacher
would not know me so quickly, how could the pupil know me so quickly? Then
it occurred to Death the Evil One, This recluse knows me and sees me and
says Get out! Evil One. Do not worry the Thus Gone One and do not worry
the disciples of the Thus Gone One. It will be for your unpleasantness
for a long time. Then Death the Evil One came out of the mouth and got
stuck in the throat.
<p>Venerable Mahaamoggallaana saw the Evil One stuck in the throat and
said, I see you there too. You are stuck in the throat. In the past there
was an Evil One named Duusi. To me there was a sister named Kaali. You
were her son. Then you were my nephew. It was at the time of the perfect
rightfully enlightened Blessed One Kakusanda’s time. To the perfect rightfully
Enlightened One, Kakusanada, there were two chief disciples named Vidura
and Sa~njiiva. Out of the disciples of the Enlightened One Kakusanda, there
wasn’t anyone comparable to venerable Vidura in teaching. He was so sharp,
with that meaning he was given the name Vidura. As for venerable Sa~njiiva,
gone to the forest, to the root of a tree or to an empty house, would without
difficulty attain the cessation of peceptions and feelings. It happended
that one day venerable Sa~njiiva attained to the cessation of perceptions
and feelings. Then the cowherds, cattle-herds, farmers and wayfarers saw
venerable Sa~jiiva attained to the cessation of perceptions and feelings,
at the root of a certain tree. Then it occurred to them, it is wonderful,
and surprising this recluse has fulfilled time seated. Then they collected
grass, sticks, cowdung and dirt on top of him and set fire to it, and went
away. Then venerable Sa~njiiva got up from the cessation of perceptions
and feelings at the end of that night. Cleaning up his bowl and robes and
putting on robes and taking bowl and robes entered that village for alms.
The cowherds, cattleherds, farmers and wayfarers seeing venerable Sa~njiiva
going for alms were surprised and said, this recluse had fulfilled time
seated and now he has got up from it, he is alive again. Thus the name
sa~njiiva came to him
<p>Then to the Evil One Duusi it occurred thus: I do not know the comings
and goings*1) of these virtuous bhikkhus, what if I took possession of
the brahmin householders and scolded and abused the virtuous bhikkhus.
Then if we arouse the bhikkhus, we would get a chance to change the minds
of these bhikkhus*2). Then the Evil One Duusi took possession of the brahmin
householders and scolded the bhikkhus and worried them: These are recluse
shavellings, menials, wicked ones, born from the foot of Brahma, saying
we concentrate, muse with drooping heads and face turned down. Reflect
and waste, like owls waiting among branches for mice. These recluse shavellings,
menials, wicked ones, born from the foot of Brahma, saying we concentrate,
muse with drooping heads and face turned down..Reflect and waste, like
jackals on the bank of the river waiting for fish. These recluse shavellings,
menials, wicked ones, born from the foot of Brahma saying we concentrate
muse with drooping heads and face turned down. Reflect and waste, like
a cat waiting for rats on a heap of rubbish. These recluse shavellings,
menials, wicked ones, born from the foot of Brahma, saying we concentrate
muse with drooping heads and face turned down. Reflect and waste, like
a donkey released from its burden standing in a heap of rubbish. O! Evil
One, many humans who died at that time, were born in loss, in hell.
<p>Then the perfect and rightfully enlightened, Blessed One addressed the
bhikkhus: Bhikkhus, the brahmin householders are possessed by the Evil
One Duusi. If they scold and worry these bhikkhus we will get a chance,
when the minds of these bhikkhus change. Come bhikkhus, abide with the
thought of loving kindness pervading one direction, so too the second,
the third, the fourth, above, below and across. In all circumstances, for
all purposes, and towards all, abide with that thought of loving kindness
developed and grown great without anger. Abide with the thought of compassion.
Abide with the thought of intrinsic joy. Abide with the thought of equanimity
pervading one direction, so too the second, the third, the fourth, above,
below, and across. In all circumstances, for all purposes and towards all
abide with the thought of equanimity developed and grown great without
anger. Evil One, those bhikkhus advised by the enlightened one Kakusanda,
gone to the forest, to the root of a tree, or to an empty house, abode
with the thought of loving kindness pervading one direction, so too the
second, the third, the fourth, above, below and across. In all circumstances,
for all purposes, and towards all, abode with that thought of loving kindness
developed and grown great without anger. Abode with the thought of compassion.
Abode with the thought of intrinsic joy. Abode with the thought of equanimity
pervading one direction, so too the second, the third, the fourth, above,
below, and across. In all circumstances, for all purposes and towards all,
abode with the thought of equanimity developed and grown great without
anger.
<p>Then it occurred to Duusi the Evil One, doing this the goings and comings
of the virtuous bhikkhus, are not known. What if I possessed the minds
of these brahmin householders and made them revere, honour and worship
these virtuous bhikkhus. Then we will get a chance, when the minds of these
bhikkhus change. Come, householders, revere, honour, and worship these
virtuous bhikkhus. So the brahmin householders revered, honoured, and worshipped
the virtuous bhikkhus. Most of the humans who died at that time went to
increase, were born in heaven.
<p>Then O! Evil one, the perfect, rightfully enlightened Kakusanda Blessed
One, addressed the bhikkhus. Bhikkhus, the brahmin householders are possessed
by the Evil One Duusi. He says, come, revere, honour and worship these
virtuous bhikkhus. Then we will get a chance, when the minds of these bhikkhus
change Therefore bhikkhus abide developping loathesomeness of the body,
loathesomeness of supports, the perception of detachment from the whole
world. Seeing impermanence in all determinations. Then those bhikkhus,
thus advised by the perfect rightfully enlightened Kakusanda Blessed One
gone to the forest, to the root of a tree or to an empty house would abide
developping loathesomeness of the body, loathesomeness of supports, the
perception of detachment from the whole world and seeing impermanence in
all determinations.
<p>Then the perfect rightfully enlightened Kakusanda Blessed One, putting
on robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes entered the village for
alms with venerable Vidura as second recluse. Then Duusi the Evil One taking
possession of a certain boy taking a stone hit on the head of Venerable
Vidura. The head split and with blood streaming he followed close behind.
The perfect rightfully enlightened Kakusanda Blessed One looked at him
with the elephant’s look thinking this Maara Duusi should know his limits,
and together with that look he was born in the Great Hell. This hell has
three names; The sphere of the six contacts, pulled along with iron spikes,
giver of internal pain. Then I approached the waderers of that hell and
asked, good sirs, from when were your hearts pierced with spikes. They
do not know it, and experience it since a thousand years. O! Evil One,
I have experience of suffering in that hell for a hundred thousand years.
For ten thousand years I suffered in that hell prominently suffering with
a special pain. Evil One in that hell I had the body of a human and the
head of a fish.
<p>How was the hell that Duusi suffered,
<p>Harming the disciple Vidhura and the brahmin Kakusanda.
<p>A hundred iron spikes pierced the heart giving internal pain,
<p>Duusi suffered in such a hell, harming the disciple Vidhura and
<p>The brahmin Kakusanda
<p>If he knew this much, this is a disciple of the enlightened one,
<p>Hurting such a bhikkhu I would go to dark unpleasantness.
<p>In the middle is a mansion which stands for a world cycle
<p>It shines like the lapis gem
<p>Nymphs dance there decked in various colours.
<p>If he knew this much, this is a disciple of the enlightened one,
<p>Hurting such a bhikkhu would go to dark unpleasantness
<p>He who was chosen by the enlightened one, out of the community,
<p>To shake the palace of Migaara’s mother with the toe.
<p>If he knew this much, this is a disciple of the enlightened one,
<p>Hurting such a bhikkhu I would go to dark unpleasantness
<p>He shook the Vejanta palace with his toe,
<p>Full of super normal powers aroused consternation in the gods.
<p>If he knew this much, this is a disciple of the enlightened one,
<p>Hurting such a bhikkhu, I would go to dark unpleasantness,
<p>At the Vejanta palace, he questioned Sakka
<p>Venerable one do you know the release with the destruction of craving.
<p>To him Sakka explained, when the question was asked
<p>The disciple of the enlightened one who could do this much
<p>If he knew this much, this is a disciple of the enlightened one,
<p>Hurting such a bhikkhu, I would go to dark unpleasantness.
<p>He questioned, Brahma fearlessly in the Sudhamma assembly,
<p>Venerable one do you maintain that view, you had earlier,
<p>That we see you, enjoying the pleasures of the brahma world..
<p>Then Brahma explained in stages, that he does not maintain that view
<p>Although I enjoy the pleasures of Brahma
<p>I know it is a mistake to think it is permanent and eternal.
<p>If he knew this much, this is a disciple of the enlightened one,
<p>Hurting such a bhikkhu, I would go to dark unpleasantness
<p>He touched the peak of Mahaameru attained to voidity
<p>Touched the forests of Pubbavidheha and the people sleeping there
<p>If he knew this much, this is a disciple of the enlightened one,
<p>Hurting such a bhikkhu, I would go to dark unpleasantness.
<p>Fire does not think I will not burn the fool,
<p>It burns the fool and also the wrong doer
<p>Thus Evil One, you have hurt the Thus Gone One,
<p>By oneself is one burnt, as the fool who has touched fire.
<p>Evil One you have accumulated demerit, hurting the Thus Gone One
<p>Evil One do you think, results of demerit will not come to me
<p>Evil One, the doer accumulates demerit throughout a long time,
<p>Evil One, go away from the enlightened one, do not worry the bhikkhu.
<p>Thus the Evil One did not hurt the bhikkhu in the Bhesakalaa forest.
<p>The displeased demon, vansihed from there.
