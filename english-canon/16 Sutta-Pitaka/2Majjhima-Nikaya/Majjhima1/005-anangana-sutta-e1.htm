<p>I heard thus.
<br>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika
in Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi.
<p>Venerable Saariputta addressed the bhikkhus:" Friends, bhikkhus," and
those bhikkhus replied "Yes, friend." And venerable Saariputta said: Friends,
there are four persons in the world, what four.
<p>"Here, a certain person with blemish does not know, as it really is,
there is blemish in me. A certain person with blemish knows, as it really
is, there is blemish in me. A certain person without blemish does not know
as it really is, there is no blemish in me. A certain person without blemish
knows as it really is, there is no blemish in me. Of the two persons with
blemish, the one who does not know as it really is, there is blemish in
me is the inferior The one who knows as it really is, there is blemish
in me is the superior one.
<p>Of the two persons without blemish, the one who does not know, as it
really is, there is no blemish is the inferior one. The one who knows as
it really is, there is no blemish in me is the superior.
<p>When this was said, venerable Mahaamoggallaana said , Friend, Saariputta,
what is the reason that of the two with blemish that one should be inferior
and the other superior and of the other two without blemish, what is the
reason that one should be inferior and the other superior.
<p>Here, friend, Moggallaana, this person with blemish, who does not know,
as it really is, there is blemish in me, would not arouse interest, and
make effort to dispel that blemish. So he would die with a defiled mind
with greed, hate and delusion. Just like a bronze bowl bought from a shop
or smithy would be covered with dust and stains, its owner not partaking
food in it would not clean it, would let it lie with dust and as time goes
that bronze bowl would be much more dusty and stained. In the same way
this person with blemish, who would not know, as it really is, there is
blemish in me, would not arouse interest, and make effort to dispel that
blemish. So he would die with a defiled mind with greed, hate and delusion.
<p>Friend, this person with blemish, who knows, as it really is, there
is blemish in me, would arouse interest, and make effort to dispel that
blemish. He would die with a non-defiled mind without greed, hate and delusion.
Just like a bronze bowl bought from a shop or smithy would be covered with
dust and stains. Its owner partaking food in it would clean it. Would not
let it lie with dirt and as time goes the bronze bowl would be more and
more clean. In the same manner this person with blemish, who knows, as
it really is, there is blemish in me, would arouse interest and make effort
to dispel that blemish. So he would die with a non-defiled mind without
greed, hate, and delusion.
<p>Friend, this person without blemish, who does not know, as it really
is, there is no blemish in me, attending to an agreeable sign greed would
overcome his mind, hate and delusion would overcome his mind and he would
die with a defiled mind. Just like a bronze bowl bought from a shop or
smithy clean and pure, the owner would not partake in it, would let it
lie with dirt, then as time goes, that bronze bowl would be more and more
dusty and stained in the same manner this person without blemish, who does
not know, as it really is, there is no blemish in me, attending to an agreeable
sign greed would overcome his mind, hate and delusion would overcome his
mind and he would die with a defiled mind.
<p>Friend, this person without blemish, who knows, as it really is, there
is no blemish in me, attending to an agreeable sign, greed would not overcome
his mind, hate and delusiosn would not overcome his mind. He would die
without greed, hate and delusion, He would die with an undefiled mind.
Just like a bronze bowl bought from a shop or smithy, clean and pure, the
owner would partake in it, would clean it and not let it lie in dirt, and
as time goes that bronze bowl would be more and more clean. In the same
manner this person without blemish, who knows, as it really is, there is
no blemish in me, attending to an agreeable sign, greed,
<p>would not overcome his mind, hate and delusion would not overcome his
mind. He would die without greed, hate and delusion. He would die with
an undefiled mind.
<p>Friend, Moggallaana, this is the reason for the two persons with blemish,
one to be called inferior and the other superior. For the two persons without
blemish, one to be called inferior and the other superior.
<p>Friend, it is called blemish, what is a synonym for blemish. Friend,
blemish is the wanderings of thoughts.

friend, what is it you are carrying, seems to be something delicious. Then

and a desire to eat gets established. Even those not hungry desire to eat
it, what to speak of those hungry. Friend, in the same manner, to whatever
bhikkhu these wanderings of thought in evil demerit are seen and heard
to be dispelled whoever he may be a dweller in the out skirts of the village,

the wanderings of thoughts in evil demerit are seen and heard to be dispelled
in him. .
<p>When this was said venerable Mahaamoggallaana said: Friend, Saariputta,
a comparison occurs to me.Friend, say it. Friend, at one time, I was living
in the mountains of Rajagaha. Then one morning wearing robes and taking
bowl and robes I entered Rajagaha. At that time Samiiti the chariot maker’s
son was bending the circumference of a wheel for an ascetic, the son of
Pandu, the earlier chariot maker, . Then it occured to the ascetic, O!
If Samiiti’s son corrects these crookednesses, slants, and faults and makes
the wheel perfect. Whatever crookedness, slant, or fault that the ascetic
thought of, that and that he corrected and made the circumference of the
wheel perfect. Then the ascetic expressed words of pleasure and said. Its
like he knew the heart with the heart. Friend, Saariputta,. in the same
manner, those making a livelihood without faith, crafty hypocrites, trained
deceivers, unsteady, wavering, with loose talk, mental faculties not restrained,
not knowing the right amount to partake, not yoked to wakefulness and not
desirous of the recluse -ship, not honouring the training, living in abundance
and lethargy, unyoked from seclusion, without effort, not mindful and aware,
not concentrated, those lacking in wisdom deaf and dumb, hearing this discourse
should know the heart with the heart and make repairs.
<p>. As for those sons of clansmen gone forth out of faith, not crafty,
not hypocrites, not trained deceivers, steady, without loose talk, mental
faculties restrained, yoked to wakefulness, desirous of the recluseship,
honouring the training, not living in abundance and lethargy, yoked to
seclusion with effort, mindful and aware, concentrated and wise, they hearing
this discourse of venerable Saariputta, I think should devour the word
and thought of it. Good if the co-associates in the holy life raised themselves
from demerit and got established in merit.
<p>The two great men delighted in each others words.
