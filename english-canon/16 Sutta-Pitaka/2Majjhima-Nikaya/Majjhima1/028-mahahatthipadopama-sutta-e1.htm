<p><b>(28) The Major Disourse on the</b>
<p><b>Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint.</b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<p>I heard thus.
<p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika
in Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi. Then, venerable Saariputta addressed the
bhikkhus "Friends, bhikkhus, just as the foot prints of all moving things
get included in the footprint of the elephant and it becomes the biggest.
Just so all things of merit get included in the four noble truths. What
four? The noble truth of unpleasantness, the noble truth of its arising,
the noble truth of its cessation, and the noble truth of the path, to the
cessation of unpleasantness.
<p>Friends, what is the noble truth of unpleasantness. Birth is unpleasant,
decay, death, grief, lament, displeasure and distress are also unpleasant.
Not to get one’s desires is unpleasant, in short the five holding masses
are unpleasant. Friends, bhikkhus, what are the five holding masses? They
are the holding mass of matter, the holding mass of feelings, the holding
mass of perceptions, the holding mass of determinations and the holding
mass of consciousness? Friends, what is the holding mass of matter: The
four primary elements and the held on body from the four primary elements
is the holding mass of matter. What are the four primary elements: Earth,
water, fire and air are the four primary elements.
<p>Friends, what is the earth element: There is internal earth element
and external earth element. What is internal earth element. Whatever hard
rough matter internally held as mine, such as hair of head and body, nails,
teeth skin, flesh, nerves, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver pleura,
lungs lower intestines, bowels, belly, excreta, and any other hard, rough
internally held matter, all that is internal matter. All this internal
earth element, and external earth element, go as earth element..That is
not mine, am not that, it is not my self. This should be known as it really
is, with right wisdom. Seeing this, as it really is, with right wisdom,
the mind should be detached from the earth element, There comes a time
when the external water element is agitated, at that time the external
earth element is closed up, in it .That shows the agedness and impermanence
of the earth element. So why hold on to this body of three hundred bones
as this is mine, am that, it is my self.. Again others .may revile, blame,
arouse and distress the bhikkhu. Then he knows, these unpleasant feelings
arise with a cause. What is the cause? Contact is the cause He reflects
that contact is impermanent, feelings are impermanent, that perception
is impermanent, determinations are impermanent, and that consciousness
is impermanent. His mind springs forward with the sign and elements, is
pleased, settled, and released..(1) Others may treat that same bhikkhu
in disagreeable, unwelcome, unkind ways, with the contact of hands, clods,
sticks, and weapons. Then he knows, this body should be such, that it endures
the contact of hands, clods, sticks and weapons.
<p>In the Simile of the saw the Blessed One said, even if robbers and bandits
cut limb after limb with a two handled saw, if the mind is defiled on account
of that, he has not done the duty in my dispensation. It will be, my effort
will be aroused repeatedly, unconfused mindfulness established, the body
appeased without anger, the mind concentrated, in one point. Let the body
now endure, the contact of hands, clods, sticks and weapons. Thus the dispensation
of the Enlightened Ones is done.If the mind of the bhikkhu who reflects
the Enlightened One, the Teaching, and the Community of bhikkhus thus,
does not settle in merit with equanimity, he should be remorseful . It
is a loss for me, I have missed a rare chance, that my mind did not settle
in merit with equanimity. Like the daughter –in-law who has seen the mother-in-law
would be remorseful.In the same manner the bhikkhu reflecting the Enlightened
One, the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus, if the mind does not settle
in merit with equanimity, he should be remorseful. It is loss for me, I
have missed a rare chance, that my mind did not settle in merit with equanimity.
<p>Friends, if the mind of the bhikkhu reflecting the Enlightened One,
the Teaching, and the Community of bhikkhus settles in merit with equanimity,
he should be delighted. The bhikkhu who has done this much, has done a
lot.
<p>Friends, what is the water element. There is internal water element
and external water element. What is the internal water element. Whatever
internal personal water, held as bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat and oil
of the skin, tears and oil of the eye, spit and snot, synovial fluid and
urine, whatever any other held cohesiveness is the internal water element.
This internal water element and the external water element, all go as water
element. That is not mine, am not that, its not my self. This should be
seen with right wisdom, as it really is. Thus seeing it with right wisdom,
as it really is, the mind should be detached from the water element.There’s
a time when the external water element agitates, it overflows villages
and hamlets, towns and states, and the whole state. There is a time when
the water in the ocean recedes as far as seven hundred miles, one thousand
four hundred miles, two thousand one hundred miles, two thousand eight
hundred miles, three thousand five hundred miles, four thousand two hundred
miles, and recedes four thousand nine hundred miles. Friends, there is
a time when the water in the ocean stands up to seven palms, six palms,
five palms, four palms, three palms, two palms, a single palm. There’s
a time when the water in the ocean stands up to the height of seven men,
six men, five men, four men, three men, two men, one man. It stands up
to the height of half a man, stands only waist deep, only knee deep, only
up to the ankle. There is a time when the water in the ocean is not enough
to wet the toes. This, is evidence of the agedness and impermanence of
the external water element. So why hold on to this body of three hundred
bones? As this is mine, am that, it’s my self. Again, others .may revile,
blame, arouse and distress the bhikkhu. Then he knows, these unpleasant
feelings arise with a cause.What is the cause? Contact is the cause. He
reflects that contact, those feelings, those perceptions those determinations
and that consciousness is impermanent. His mind springs forward with the
sign and elements, is pleased, settled, and released.(1) Others may treat
that same bhikkhu in disagreeable, unwelcome, unkind ways, with the contact
of hands, clods, sticks, and weapons. Then he knows, this body should be
such, that it endures the contact of hands, clods, sticks, and weapons.
In the Simile of the saw it has been said by the Blessed One. Even if robbers
and bandits cut limb after limb with a two handled saw, if the mind is
defiled on account of that, he has not done the duty in my dispensation.
It will be, my effort will be aroused repeatedly, unconfused mindfulness
established. The body appeased and without anger. The mind concentrated
will be in one point. Let the body now endure, the contact of hands, clods,
sticks and weapons. The dispensation of the Enlightened Ones is done. If
the mind of the bhikkhu who reflects the Enlightened One, the Teaching,
and the Community of bhikkhus thus, does not settle in merit with equanimity,
he should be remorseful. It is a loss for me, I have missed a rare chance,
that my mind did not settle in merit with equanimity. Like the daughter
–in-law who has seen the mother-in-law would be remorseful. In the same
manner if the mind of the bhikkhu reflecting the Enlightened One, the Teaching
and the Community of bhikkhus does not settle in merit with equanimity,
he should be remorseful. It is loss for me, I have missed a rare chance.
That my mind did not settle in merit with equanimity Friends, if the mind
of the bhikkhu reflecting the Enlightened One, the Teaching, and the Community
of bhikkhus, settles in merit with equanimity, he should be delighted.
The bhikkhu who has done this much has done a lot. .
<p>Friends, what is the fire element. There is internal and external fire
element What is internal fire element? Whatever internal personal heat,
the burning that causes decay, the digestion of whatever is enjoyed eaten
and tasted. The internal fire held as mine, and any other firey thing that
is internal is internal fire element. The internal fire element and the
external fire element go as fire element. That is not mine, I’m not that,
it’s not my self. This should be known as it really is, with right wisdom.
Thus the mind should be detached from the fire element. There is a time
when the fire element agitates villages and hamlets, towns and states,
and complete states. It comes to the end of the green, end of the forest,
to the coast, to the water’s end, or to some pleasant stretch of land and
extinguishes, owing to lack of fuel. There is a time when fire originates
in the stem of a cock’s feather or in a lump of veins.
<p>That’s evidence of the agedness and impermanence of the external fire
element So why hold this body of three hundred bones as this is mine, I’m
that, it’s my self? Again, others .may revile, blame, arouse and distress
the bhikkhu. Then he knows, these unpleasant feelings have arisen to me
with a cause. What’s the cause? Contact is the cause He reflects, contact
is impermanent, feelings, perceptions and determinations are impermanent,
and consciousness is impermanent. His mind springs forward with the sign
and elements, is pleased, settled, and released.(1) Others may treat that
same bhikkhu in disagreeable, unwelcome, unkind ways, with the contact
of hands, clods, sticks, and weapons. Then he knows, this body should be
such, that it endures the contact of hands, clods, sticks and weapons.
In the Simile of the saw it has been said by the Blessed. Even when robbers
and bandits cut limb after limb with a two handled saw, if the mind of
the bhikkhu is defiled he has not done the duties in my dispensation. It
will be my effort will be aroused repeatedly, unconfused mindfulness established,
the body appeased without anger, the mind concentrated in one point. Let
the body now endure, the contact of hands, clods, sticks and weapons. thus
the dispensation of the Enlightened Ones is done. If the mind of the bhikkhu
who reflects the Enlightened One, the Teaching, and the Community thus,
does not settle in merit with equanimity, he should be remorseful. It is
a loss for me, I have missed a rare chance. That my mind did not settle
in merit with equanimity. Like the daughter –in-law who has seen the mother-in-law
would be remorseful, in the same manner if the mind of the bhikkhu reflecting
the Enlightened One, the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus does not
settle in merit with equanimity, he should be remorseful. It is loss for
me, I have missed a rare chance. That my mind did not settle in merit with
equanimity. Friends, if the mind of the bhikkhu reflecting the Enlightened
One, the Teaching, and the Community of bhikkhus settles in merit with
equanimity, he should be delighted. The bhikkhu who has done this much
has done a lot.
<p>Friends, what is the air element. There is internal air element and
external air element. What is internal air element The internal personal
airiness that is held, as up going winds, down going winds, winds in the
stomach and bowels. Winds going up and down limbs, in-breaths and out-breaths
and any other airiness held as mine, is internal air element.This internal
and external air element goes as air element. That is not mine, am not
that, it’s not my self. This should be seen with right wisdom, as it really
is and the mind should be detached from the air element.
<p>Friends, there is a time when the external air element is agitated and
it wields power over village and hamlet, town and state and over the complete
state. In the last months of the Summer there is a time when the wind has
to be sought by fanning. Then water does not flow and blades of grass do
not move. That is evidence of agedness and, impermanence of the external
air element. So why hold to this body of three hundred bones as this is
mine, I’m that, it’s my self?. Again, others .may revile, blame, arouse
and distress the bhikkhu, then he knows. These unpleasant feelings arise
with a cause.What is the cause? Contact is the cause. He reflects contact
is impermanent, feelings, perceptions and determinations are impermanent,
and consciousness is impermanent. His mind springs forward with the sign
and elements, is pleased, settled, and released..(1) Others may treat that
same bhikkhu in disagreeable, unwelcome, unkind ways, with the contact
of hands, clods, sticks and weapons. Then he knows, this body should be
such, that it endures the contact of hands, clods, sticks and weapons..
In the Simile of the saw, the Blessed One has said, when robbers and bandits
cut limb after limb with a two handled saw, if the mind is defiled on account
of it, he has not done the duty in my dispensation. It should be, my effort
will be aroused repeatedly, unconfused mindfulness established, the body
appeased without anger and the mind concentrated in one point. Let the
body now endure, the contact of hands, clods, sticks and weapons. Thus
the dispensation of the Enlightened Ones is done.When the bhikkhu reflects
the Enlightened One, the Teaching, and the Community of bhikkhus thus,
if the mind does not settle in merit with equanimity, he should be remorseful
on account of it. It is a loss for me, I have missed a rare chance. That
my mind did not settle in merit with equanimity. Like the daughter –in-law
who has seen the mother-in-law would be remorseful. In the same manner
if the mind of the bhikkhu reflecting the Enlightened One, the Teaching
and the Community of bhikkhus, does not settle in merit with equanimity,
he should be remorseful.. It is loss for me, I have missed a rare chance.
That my mind did not settle in merit with equanimity. Friends, when the
bhikkhu reflected the Enlightened One, the Teaching, and the Community
of bhikkhus if the mind settled in merit with equanimity, he should be
delighted. The bhikkhu who has done this much has done a lot.
<p>Friends, an enclosure made in space with sticks, creepers, grass, and
mud is a house likewise an enclosure made out of bones, nerves and flesh
is matter. When the internal eye is unimpaired, external forms do not come
to the purview, with the complementary coming together, the respective
consciousness does not arise When the internal eye is unimpaired, external
forms come to the purview, without the complementary coming together, the
respective consciousness does not arise. .When the internal eye is unimpaired,
external forms come to the purview, with the complementary coming together,
the respective consciousness arises. Whatever matter arises there from,
goes to the holding mass of matter. Feelings to the holding mass of feelings.
Perceptions to the holding mass of perceptions. Determinations to the holding
mass of determinations and whatever consciousness goes to the holding mass
of consciousness. It is in this manner, that the five holding masses accumulate,
come together and momentarily behave together). The Blessed One has said,
he who sees dependent arising, sees the Teaching, He who sees the Teaching
sees dependent arising*2) Indeed these five holding masses arise dependently.
The interest, settlement, follow up and the appropriation in the five holding
masses is the arising of unpleasantness*3) Dispelling the interest and
greed for the five holding masses, is the cessation of unpleasantness*4)..
When this is done, the bhikkhu has done much. When the internal ear is
unimpaired—the nose is unimpaired, --the tongue is unimpaired,--the body
is unimpaired, When the mind is unimpaired, external ideas do not come
to the purview, with the complementary coming together the respective consciousness
does not arise.When the mind is unimpaired, external ideas come to the
purview, without the complementary coming together, the respective consciousness
does not arise. When the mind is unimpaired, external ideas come to the
purview, and with the complementary coming together the respective consciousness
arises. Whatever matter produced there, goes to the holding mass of matter.
Feelings, to the holding mass of feelings. Perceptions, to the holding
mass of perceptions. Determinations, to the holding mass of determinations.
Consciousness to the holding mass of consciousness. It is in this manner,
that the five holding masses accumulate, come together and momentarily
behave together. The Blessed One has said, he who sees dependent arising.sees
the Teaching. He who sees the Teaching sees dependent arising. Indeed these
five holding masses arise dependently. The interest, settlement, follow
up and the appropriation in the five holding masses is the arising of unpleasantness.
Dispelling the interest and greed for the five holding masses, is the cessation
of unpleasantness, The bhikkhu who has done this much has done a lot.
<p>Venerable Saariputta said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words
of venerable Saariputta,
<p>Notes.
<p>1. His mind springs forward with the sign and elements, is pleased settled
and released. ‘ <i>tassa dhaataarammana.m eva citta.m pakkhandati pasiidati
santiti,t,thati’ </i>This springing of the mind is -always for a change
in the mind, it causes a feeling to arise. Here the bhikkhu has overcome
a disagreeable feeling becomes pleased, gets settled and finds release
of the mind, instead of being disagreeable and averse to that situation
and feeling. This is a development to the bhikkhu. Several such developments
and growths should come to the bhikkhu in his development up to arahanta.The
sign is the thought, or attention and the elements are the things that
mattered at one or the other sense door. ie a sight, a sound etcetra..
<p>2.He who sees dependent arising sees the Teaching. He who sees the Teaching
sees dependent arising.’<i>yo paticcasamuppaada.m passati, so dhamma.m
passati. Yo dhamma.m passati so patticcasamuppaada.m passati</i>’ This
reciprocal statement tells us that we have to understand dependent arising
to understand the Teaching. Dependent arising means anyone born, is subject
to decay, ailments, death, grief, lament and unpleasantness. There are
some other ways of explaining Dependent Arising. Here it is necessary that
we remove the cause; birth. It is not an easy task to remove the intention
‘to be’.
<p>3. The interest, settlement, follow up and the appropriation in the
five holding masses is the arising of unpleasantness.’<i>yo emesu pancupaadaanaskandesu
chando aalayo anusayo ajjhosaana.m, so dukkhasamudayo’</i> Thus we see
that the interested following up of material things external and internal
and thinking they are mine is the holding mass of matter, and is the arising
of unpleasantness. The interested following up of feelings external and
internal and thinking they are mine is the holding mass of feelings, which
is the arising of unpleasantness. External feelings are born on account
of contact at the six doors of mental contact, and internal feelings are
born when the idea gets ingrained that the feeling is mine.The interested
following up of perceptions thinking they are mine is the holding mass
of perceptions, and this too is the arising of unpleasaantness. Perceptions
are born on account of contacts at one or other of the doors of mental
contact. Or they may be born in imagination.The interested following up
of determinations, thinking they are mine is the holding mass of determinations,
this is the arising of unpleasantness. The interested following up of consciousness
through one or the other of the doors orf mentality is the holding mass
of consciousness, this is also unpleasant.
<p>4.Dispelling the interest and greed for the five holding masses is the
cessation of unpleasantness. This is a very slow and tedious process which
has to be done with care and attention..
