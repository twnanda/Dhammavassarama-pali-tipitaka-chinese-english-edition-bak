<p>Venerable Saariputta said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in his words.
.
<p>Notes.
<p>1. Mental cognition is the third,’<i>manos~ncetanaa tatiyo</i>’ These
are the hopes, wishes, desires, and aspirations about the future, intentions
in the present, and recollections of the past. A person is supported on
these and lives on account of them.
<p>2.These three are the beings.’<i>Tayo ‘me aavuso bhavaa</i>’ Being is
the mind’s behaviour in sensual thoughts, thinking about material and maintaining
the mind in immaterial states.
<p>3. These four are the holdings ‘<i>Cattaaro ‘me aavuso upaadaanaa</i>’
This holding is something done with the mind. This fourfold holding consists
of holding to sensuality, holding to views, holding to virtues, and holding
to a self view.. ‘<i>tanhaa paccayaa upaadaana , upaadaana paccayaa bhava</i>’
The three links craving-holding-and being are mental links just before
a birth . It’s a birth of a thought.. Craving starts at one or other of
the mental spheres ie through seeing, hearing, etcetra and then the mental
hold of it and being with it This is a very subtle quick procedure and
very difficult to be observed.
<p>4. With the arising of the six mental spheres arise contact. ‘<i>Salaayatanasamudayaa
phassasamudayo</i>’ The arising of the mental spheres is the arising of
a person who could see, hear, smell, and so and it is this person who is
subjected to a contact.
<p>5. Bodily determination, verbal determination and mental determination.’<i>kaayasankhaaro
vaciisankhaaro cittasankhaaro</i>’ According to the <i>Cuulavedalla</i>
Sutta M 44. Bhikkhuni Dhammadinnaa explains it thus Bodily determinations
are in and out breaths, as they are bound up with the body and without
them the body would not function. Verbal determinations are thinking and
pondering. Words always follow thinking and pondering. So thinking and
pondering are verbal determinations. Mental determinations are perceptions
and feelings, As perceptions and feelings are bound up with the mind, they
are mental determinations .
<p>6. Desires on account of ignorance. ‘<i>Avijjaasavo</i>’ These desires
arise at one or the other of the mental spheres that is by seeing, hearing,
smelling, tasting, touching or cognizing with the mind. The ignorance that
arise is to take those desires as permanent, agreeabale and as mine.To
dispel ignorance we have to dispel the view that these desires are permanent,
agreeable and they are mine.
