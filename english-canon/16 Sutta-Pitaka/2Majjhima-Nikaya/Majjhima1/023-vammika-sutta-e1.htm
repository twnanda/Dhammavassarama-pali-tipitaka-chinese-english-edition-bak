in Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi.. At that time venerable Kumaarakassapa lived
in the Dark forest.When the night was waning a certain deity illuminated
the whole of the Dark forest and approached venerable Kumaarakassapa stood
on a side, and said, Bhikkhu, this ant hill smokes in the night and blazes
in the day. The brahmin said
<p>Wise one, take a tool and dig. When digging with the tool he saw an
obstacle; Good one, an obstacle. The brahmin said remove the obstacle wise
one,and dig with the tool.. Digging with the tool he saw a swollen dead
body. Good one a swollen dead body. The brahmin said, wise one remove the

do not see anyone who could answer this question and convince the mind
except the Thus Gone One, a disciple of the Thus Gone One or one who has
