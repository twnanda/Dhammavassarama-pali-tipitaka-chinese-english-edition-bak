<p><b>(32) The longer Discourse in the Gosinga Forest</b>.</center>

<p>I heard thus.
<p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the Gosinga Saala forest, with
many well versed elder disciples such as venerables Saariputta, Mahaamoggallaana,
Mahaakassapa, Anuruddha, Revata, Aananda and many other well versed elder
disciples. Venerable Mahaamoggallaana getting up from his seclusion in
the evening approached venerable Mahaakassapa and said; Kassapa, let us
go to venerable Saariputta, to hear the Teaching. Venerable Mahaakassapa
agreed and venerable Mahaamoggallaana, venerable Mahaakassapa and venerable
Anuruddha approached venerable Saariputta. Venerable Aananda saw venerables,
Mahaamoggallaana, Mahaakassapa and Anuruddha approaching venerable Saariputta
to hear the Teaching and venerable Aananda approached venerable Revata
and said, friend, Revata, the Great Men are approaching venerable Saariputta
to hear the Teaching, shall we too go to hear the Teaching. Venerable Revata
agreed and venerable Revata and venerable
<p>Aananda approached venerable Saariputta.
<p>Venerable Saariputta saw venerables Revata and Aananda coming in the
distance and said, welcome friend, Aananda, the close and near attendant
of the Blessed One. Friend, Aananda, in the moon light, the Saala forest
is very pleasing the flowers in full bloom, give a heavenly scent. What
kind of bhikkhu would adorn this Saala forest? Friend, Saariputta, a learned
bhikkhu, who bears all the Teaching, treasures that, which is good at the
beginning,in the middle and at the end, and declares the completely pure
holy life. Of that Teaching he should become a bearer by words and practise
and an experiencer of it through penetration. He would teach it to the
fourfold gatherings, with the words coming to him without difficulty, for
the destruction of the latent tendencies of those with sharp mental faculties.
Friend, Saariputta, such a bhikkhu would adorn the Gosinga .Saala forest.
<p>When this was said, venerable Saariputta addressed venerable Revata,
Friend, Revata, venerable Aananda has declared this according to his understanding,
now we ask you: Friend Revata, in the moon light, the Saala forest is very
pleasing, the flowers in full bloom give a heavenly scent. What kind of
bhikkhu would adorn this Saala forest? Friend, Saariputta, a bhikkhu who
is fond of seclusion, yoked to internal appeasement of the mind. He would
not neglect jhaana, endowed with wise reflection, and would develop the
abidings without thoughts and discursive thoughts. Such a bhikkhu would
adorn the Gosinga Saala forest.
<p>When this was said, venerable Saariputta addressed venerable Anuruddha:
Friend, Anuruddha, venerable Revata has declared this according to his
understanding, now we ask you. Anuruddha,. in the moon light, the Saala
forest is very pleasing, the flowers in full bloom give a heavenly scent.
What kind of bhikkhu would adorn this Saala forest? Friend, Saariputta,
the bhikkhu with the heavenly eye purified beyond human would look at the
thousandfold world systems. Like a man who has climbed to the top most
storey of his mansion would be looking at a disc with thousandfold circumferences.
In the same manner the bhikkhu with the heavenly eye purified beyond human
would look at the thousandfold world systems. Such a bhikkhu would adorn
the Gosinga Saala forest.
<p>When this was said, venerable Saariputta addressed venerable Mahaakassapa,
Friend, Kassapa, venerable Anuruddha has declared this according to his
understanding, now we ask you. Kassapa. in the moon light, the Saala forest
is very pleasing, the flowers in full bloom give a heavenly scent. What
kind of bhikkhu would adorn this Saala forest? Friend, Saariputta, the
bhikkhu, a forest dweller praises forest dwelling. A partaker of morsel
food praises the partaking of morsel food. A rag robe wearer, praises wearing
rag-robes. Confined to three robes, praises that. With few desires praises
few desires, and satisfied praises satisfaction Secluded praises seclusion,
withdrawn, praises withdrawal from the crowd. With aroused effort, praises
arousal of effort and virtuous, praises endowment of virtues. Concentrated
praises endowment of concentration and wise praises endowment of wisdom.
Released praises endowment of release and endowed with the knowledge and
vision of release, praises the knowledge and vision of release. Such a
bhikkhu would adorn the Gosinga Saala forest.
<p>When this was said, venerable Saariputta addressed venerable Mahaamoggallaaana
<p>Friend, Moggallaana, venerable Mahaakassapa has declared this according
to his understanding, now we ask you. Friend, Moggallaana, in the moon
light, the Saala forest is very pleasing, the flowers in full bloom give
a heavenly scent. What kind of bhikkhu would adorn this Saala forest? Friend,
Saariputta, two bhikkhus discussing a deep point in the Teaching would
ask questions from each other. Would find replies for each others questions.
They would not fall out with each other, their talk would be timely and
beneficial. Such a bhikkhu would adorn the Gosinga Saala forest.
<p>Then venerable Mahaamoggallaana addressed venerable Saariputta.Friend,
Saariputta we all have declared this according to our understanding. Now
we ask you. Friend, Saariputta, in the moon light, the Saala forest is
very pleasing, the flowers in full bloom give a heavenly scent, what kind
of bhikkhu would adorn this Saala forest. Here, friend, Moggallaana, the
bhikkhu wields power over the mind, and does not abide in the power of
the mind. Whatever abiding he desires to abide in the morning, in that,
he abides in the morning. Whatever abiding he desires to abide in the mid
day, in that he abides in the mid day. Whatever abiding he desires to abide
in the evening, in that he abides in the evening. Like a head anointed
king, or his chief minister who had a casket full of clothes of various
colours, would choose the set of clothes he wanted to wear in the morning,
in the mid day, and in the evening. In the same manner the bhikkhu wields
power over the mind and does not abide in the power of the mind. In whatever
abidings he desires to abide, in the morning, at mid day, and in the evening,
in that respective abiding he abides in the morning, at mid day, and in
the evening. Such a bhikkhu adorns the Gosinga Saala forest.
<p>Then venerable Saariputta said thus to those venerable ones-Let us approach
the Blessed One, and inform all this and as he explains it let us bear
it in mind. Those venerable ones agreed and they approached the Blessed
One, worshipped and sat on a side. Then venerable Saariputta said thus
to the Blessed One: Venerable sir, venerable Revata and venerable Aananda
approached me to hear the Teaching, I seeing venerables Revata and Aananda
coming in the distance, said welcome friend, Aananda, the close and near
attendant of the Blessed One. Friend, Aananda, in the moon light, the Saala
forest is very pleasing the flowers in full bloom give a heavenly scent.
What kind of bhikkhu would adorn this Saala forest.? Venerable sir, then
venerable Aananda said: Friend, Saariputta, a learned bhikkhu, treasures

That Teaching which declares the completely pure holy life. Of that Teaching

now we ask you: Revata, in the moon light, the Saala forest is very pleasing,
the flowers in full bloom give a heavenly scent. What kind of bhikkhu would

to me. Friend, Saariputta, a bhikkhu fond of seclusion, yoked to the internal
appeasement of mind, would not neglect jhaana, endowed with wise reflection*1).
He would develop the abidings overcoming thoughts and discursive thoughts.

and those he would abide respectively...
<p>When this was said venerable Saariputta said thus to the Blessed One
-Venerable sir, Whose words are the best?.Saariputta, all these are good
words, in a certain order, yet listen to what I have to say: Here, Saariputta,
the bhikkhu,. when the meal is over and returning from the alms round sits
in a cross legged posture, keeping his body straight and mindfulness established
in front. The he determines, until my mind is released without desires,
I would not change this posture. Saariputta, such a bhikkhu, adorns the
Gosinga Saala forest.
<p>The Blessed One said thus and the venerable ones delighted in the words
of the Blessed One.
<p>Notes. 1 Would not neglect jhaana endowed with wise reflection.’<i>aniiraakata
jhaano vipassanaaya samannaagato</i>’ When jhaanas are practised, they
should be accompanied with wise reflection. ‘<i>vipassanaa bhaavanaa</i>’
is this wise reflection and it is none other than reflecting that those
pure thought moments are impermanent, changing, so they are unpleasant,
and so it is foolish to appropriate them as me or mine. This helps the
yogi to drop the self view little by little.
