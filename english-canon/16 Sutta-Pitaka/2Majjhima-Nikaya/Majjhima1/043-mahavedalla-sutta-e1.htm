<p>I heard thus.
<p>At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika
in Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi. Then venerable Mahaako.t.thita getting up
from his seclusions in the evening, approached venerable Saariputta, exchanging
friendly greetings, sat on a side and said:
<p>Friend, it is said, lacking in wisdom. What is lacking in wisdom? Friend,
does not know, therefore it is said lacking in wisdom. Does not know what?:
Does not know, this is unpleasant, this is the arising of unpleasantness,
this is the cessation of unpleasantness and this is the path to the cessation
of unpleasantness. Does not know these, therefore it is said lacking in
wisdom. Venerable Mahaako.t.thita agreeing and delighting, with the words
of venerable Saariputta asked another question. It is said wise, for what
is it said wise? Knows, therefore it is said wise. Knows what? Knows this
is unpleasant, this is the arising of unpleasantness, this is the cessation
of unpleasantness and this is the path to the cessation of unpleasantness.
Knows these, therefore it is said wise.It is said consciousness. Friend,
what is consciousness?: Knows, therefore conscious. Knows what? Knows this
is pleasant, this is unpleasant and knows this is neither unpleasant nor
pleasant.Knows therefore it is said conscious. Friend, this knowledge and
this consciousness, are they associated or dissociated? Is there a method
to differentiate them and show them apart? What is known is consciousness
and consciousness is knowledge. Therefore these things are associated and
not dissociated and it is not possible to differentiate them and show them
apart. Friend, of these things that are associated and not dissociated,
what is their difference? Friend, of these things associated and not dissociated
knowledge should be developed and consciousness should be accurately known.
That is their difference.
<p>Friend, it is said feeling? What is feeling? When felt it is said feeling.
What is felt?: Pleasant feeling, unpleasantness feeling and neither unpleasantness
nor pleasant feeling. These feelings are felt. Friend, it is said perception,
what is perception? Perceives therefore it is said perception. What is
perceived? Blue is perceived, yellow is perceived, red is perceived and
white is perceived. Therefore it is said perception..Friend, this feeling,
perception, and this consciousness, are these associated or dissociated?
Is it possible to differenciate them and show them apart?: Friend, feelings,
perceptions and consciousness are associated and not dissociated and it
is not possible to differentiate them and show them apart: Friend, the
felt is perceived, and the perceived is consciously known Therefore these
things are associated and not dissociated and it is not possible to differenciate
them and show them apart.
<p>Friend, when the five sense faculties do not lead, to what is the purified
faculty of the mind led? Friend, when the five sense faculties do not lead,
the purified faculty of the mind leads to space with space is boundless,
leads to conscioussness with consciousness is boundless, leads to the sphere
of no-thing with there is nothing. Friend, how is this leading to be known?
Friend, this leading should be known with the eye of wisdom. Friend, for
what purpose is wisdom? Wisdom is for depth realisation, thorough knowing
and for giving up.
<p>Friend, how many ways are there for the arising of right view? Friend,
there are two ways for the arising of right view. Either hearing it from
an outside source or internally reflecting the root causes. In these two
ways right view arises. Friend, in how many ways does there come about,
the release of mind with right view and the results of the release of mind,
the release through wisdom with right view and the results of the release
through wisdom: Friend, the release of mind with right view and its results
and the release through wisdom with right view and its results, come about
in five ways. Friend, that right view comes with virtues, learning, discussion,
appeasement and wisdom. In these five ways there comes about, the release
of mind through right view and its results, and the release of mind.:through
wisdom and its results. Friend, how many kinds of ‘being’ are there? Friend,
its threefold: Being with sensuality, with matter and with non-matter.*!)Friend,
how does future rebirth come about?. Friend, beings shrouded in ignorance
and bound to craving delight here and there, thus comes about rebirth in
the future*2). Friend, how does future rebirth not come about? When ignorance
is dispelled science arises and craving ceases, thus future rebirth does
not come about*3)
<p>Friend, what is the first jhaana? Here, friend, the bhikkhu secluded
from sensual desires and thoughts of demerit, with thoughts and thought
processes and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion attained to abides
in the first jhaana. Friend, how many factors has the first jhaana? The
first jhaana has five factors.: Here friend, the bhikkhu attained to the
first jhaana maintains thoughts, thought processes, joy, pleasantness and
one pointedness of mind. The first jhaana has these five factors.. Friend,
in the first jhaana how many factors are dispelled, and how many factors
are maintained? One attained to the first jhaana dispels five factors and
maintains five factors. Here, friend, the bhikkhu attained to the first
jhaana has dispelled the interest for sensuality, anger, sloth and torpor,
restlessness and worry and doubts. He maintains, thoughts, thought processes,
joy, pleasantness, and one pointedness of mind. Friend, the first jhana
is devoid of these five and endowed with these five.
<p>Friend, these five mental faculties with varing provinces and pastures
not partaking each others province and pasture such as the faculties of
the eye, ear, nose, tongue and body, where are they restored and who partakes
the pasture commonly?.
<p>Friend, these five mental faculties with varing provinces and pastures
not partaking each others province and pasture such as the faculties of
the eye, ear, nose, tongue and body. They are restored in the mind and
it partakes the pasture commonly.
<p>Friend, these five mental faculties of the eye, ear, nose, tongue and
body, on what do they rely? Friend, these five mental faculties of eye,
ear, nose, tongue, and body rely on life span. Friend, this life span,
on what does it rely? Friend, life span relies on breath. Friend, on what
does breath rely? Breath relies on life.span. Now we understand the words
of venerable Saariputta thus. Life span relies on breath and breath relies
on life span. How could we understand these words of venerable Saariputta?.Then
I will give you an example, for some wise understand when an example is
given. Just as the burning wick of an oil lamp shows a light on account
of the flame and a flame on account of the light. In the same manner life
span relies on breath and breath on life span.
<p>Friend, is life span the same as the field of feelings or else is life
span different from the field of feelings?*4) Friend, life span is not
the field of feelings . If it happened that life span was the field of
feelings a bhikkhu’s rising from the attainment, the cessation of perceptions
and feelings could not be explained. Since the life span is different from
the field of feelings the rising from the attainment, cessation of perceptions
and feelings could be explained..Friend, when this body is forsaken, useless
and lies lifeless like a log, how many things are thrown out of it? Friend,
when three things, life, heat and consciousness, are thrown out, this body
becomes useless and lifeless like a log of wood. Friend, what is the difference
between a dead body and a bhikkhu attained to the cessation of perceptions
and feelings? Friend, in a dead body the bodily determination has ceased
and is appeased The verbal determination has ceased and is appeased The
mental determination has ceased and is appeased*5). Life span has exhausted.
The heat has extinguished, and the mental faculties have broken. up. Of
the bhikkhu attained to the cessation of perceptions and feelings, the
bodily determintion has ceased and is appeased The verbal determination
has ceased and is appeased The mental determination has ceased is appeased.
The life span is not exhausted. The heat is not extinguished. The mental
faculties are very clear. Friend, this is the difference between a dead
body and of one attained to the cessation of perceptions and feelings.
Friend, how many factors are there in the release in neither unpleasant
nor pleasant feelings? The release in neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings
is based on four factors. Here, the bhikkhu dispelling pleasantness and
unpleasantness and earlier having overcome pleasure and displeasure, and
mindfulness purified with equanimity attained to abides in the fourth jhaana.
Based on these four is the release from neither unpleasant nor pleasant
feelings. Friend, based on how many factors is the release of mind in signlessness?.
The release of mind in signlessness is based on two factors. Not attending
to any signs and attending to the no-sign element. Based on these two factors
the release of mind in signlessness is attained. On account of what is
the duration of the release of mind in signlessness? The duration of the
release of mind in signlessness is based on three factors. Not attending
to any signs, attending to the no-sign element, and making a determination
earlier. Friend, based on these three is the duration of the release of
mind in the no-sign element.. Friend, how is the rising from the release
of mind in the no-sign element? Based on two factors is the rising from
the release of mind in the no-sign element: Attending to all signs and
not attending to the no-sign element. Based on these two is the rising
from the attainment, release of mind in the no-sign element.
<p>Friend, the limitless release of mind, the release of mind in no-thingness,
the release of mind in voidity, and the release of mind in the no-sign
element, are they different in meaning and different in words or are they
the same in meaning and different in words? There is a method in which
they are different in meaning and different in words and there is a method
in which they are the same in meaning and different in words.Friend, how
are they different in meaning and different in words. Here the bhikkhu
abides with the thought of loving kindness pervading one direction, so
too the second, third, and fourth directions, above, below and across,
in all circumstances, for all purposes, towards all, this thought grown
great and extensive without anger. The thought of compassiosn—The thought
of intrinsic joy,---The thought of equanimity pervading one direction,
so too the second, the third, the fourth, above, below, and across, in
all circumstances, for all purposes, towards all, this thought grown great
and extensive without anger he abides.This is the limitless release of
mind. Friend, what is the release of mind in no-thingness: Here the bhikkhu
overcoming all the sphere of consciousness attained to abides in the sphere
of no-thingness. To this is said, the release of mind in the sphere of
no-thingness. Friend what is release of mind in voidity? Here the bhikkhu
gone to the forest, to the root of a tree or to an empty house reflects
This is void of a self or the belongings of a self. Friend to this is said
the release of mind in voidity. Friend, what is the release of mind in
the no-sign element: Here the bhikkhu not attending to any sign, attends
to the no-sign element and abides in it. To this is said the release of
mind in the no-sign element. According to this method, these things are
different in meaning and different in words.
<p>Friend, how are these things the same in meaning and different in words.
Here, friend, greed is a limiting factor, hate is a limiting factor, delusion
is a limiting factor,
<p>To the bhikkhu with desires destroyed these things are dispelled, pulled
out with the roots, have the tops cut off, made things that would not grow
again. Of the boundless releases of the mind the immovable release of mind
is the highest, it is said*6). Friend that immovable release of mind is
void of greed, void of hate and void of delusion. Friend, greed is something,
hate is something, delusion is something. To the bhikkhu with desires destroyed
these things are dispelled, pulled out with the roots, have the tops cut
off, made things that would not grow again. Of the release of mind in no-thingness,
the immovable release of mind is the highest it is said. Friend, the immovable
release of mind is void of greed, void of hate and void of delusion. Friend,
greed is a sign, hate is a sign, and delusion is a sign. To the bhikkhu
with desires destroyed , these things are dispelled, pulled out with the
roots, have the tops cut off, made things that would not grow again. Of
the release in signlessness, the immovable release is the highest it is
said. Friend, the immovable release of mind is void of greed, void of anger,
void of delusion. According to this method, these things are the same in
meaning and different in words.
<p>Venerable Saariputta said thus and venerable Mahaako.t.thita delighted
in the words of venerable Saariputta. . .
<p><font size=-1>Note.</font>
<p><font size=-1>1. Being with sensuality, with matter and with non-matter.’kaamabhava
ruupabhava aruupabhava’ Being ‘bhava’ Bava the Pali word translated as
being is the ramblings of the mind in sensual desires, in material things
and in immaterial states such as the jhaanas, and attainments described
in this Sutta.</font>
<p><font size=-1>2. Beings (sattaa) shrouded in ignorance and bound to
craving delight here and there, thus comes about rebirth in the future.’<i>avijjaaniivaranaana.m
kho aavuso sattaana.m tanhasanyojanaana.m eva.m aayati.m punabbhavaanibbanti
hont</i>i’ Rebirth in the future is a result of the mind’s ramblings in
sensuality, matter and non-matter covered by ignorance and bound to craving.</font>
<p><font size=-1>3.When ignorance is dispelled, science arises and craving
ceases, thus future rebirth does not come about.’<i>avijjaaviraagaa kho
aavuso vijjuppaadaa ta.nhaanirodhaa eva.m aayati.m punabbhavaanibbanti
na honti</i>.’ The dispelling of the rambling mind’s interest in sensuality,
matter and non-matter is the dispelling of ignorance and the arsing of
science and that is the cessation of craving..</font>
<p><font size=-1>4. Is life span the same as the field of feelings? ‘ <i>teva
nukho aavuso aayusankhaaaraa teva vedaniiyaa dhammaa udaahu a~n~ne aayusankhaaraa
a~n~ne vedaniiyaa dhammaa</i>?.’ The field of feelings is the sixfold sphere
of mental contact, based on which feelings constantly arise with every
contact at one or the other of the doors of mental contact.</font>
<p><font size=-1>5. In a dead body the bodily determination has ceased
and is appeased. The verbal determination has ceased and is appeased. The
mental determination has ceased and is appeased.’<i>yavaaya.m aavuso mato
kaalakato tassa kaayasankhaaraa niruddhaa pa.tipassaddhaa vaciisankhaaraa
niruddhaa pa.tipassaddhaa cittasankhaaraa niruddhaa pa.tipassaddhaa.</i>’
The bodily, verbal and mental determinations are in and out breaths, thinking
and pondering, and feeling and perceiving. en one is dead, these things
have ceased and are appeased, that is they do not worry him any more.</font>
<p>.<font size=-1>6 Of the boundless releases of the mind the immovable
release of mind is the highest, it is said.</font> ‘<i><font size=-1>yaavataa
kho aavuso appamaana ceto vimuttiyo akuppaa taasa.m ceto vimutti aggamakkhaayaati’</font>The</i>
<p><i>releases of mind</i> <font size=-1>experienced by those free of greed,
hate and delusion is the highest.This in other words is the experience
of arahanta, extinction.</font>
