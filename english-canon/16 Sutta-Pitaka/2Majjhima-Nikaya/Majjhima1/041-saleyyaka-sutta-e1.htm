<p><b>(41) The Discourse Given at Saalaa</b></center>

<p>I heard thus.
<p>At one time the Blessed One was touring the kingdom of Kosala with a
large community of bhikkhus and entered the brahmin village Saalaa. The
householders of Saalaa heard that the good recluse Gotama the son of the
Sakyas, who had gone forth as a homeless was touring the kingdom of Kosala,
with a large community of bhikkhus, has entered the brahmin village of
Saalaa. Such fame had spread of that good Gotama. That blessed One is perfect,
rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone,
knower of worlds, the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, Teacher
of gods and men, enlightened and blessed. To this world of gods and men,
together with its Maaras, Brahmaas, the community of recluses and brahmins
and gods and men, he declares a teaching by himself known and realised.
It is good at the beginning, in the middle and at the end. It is full of
meaning even in the letters proclaiming the pure and complete, holy life.
It is good to see such noble ones. Then the brahmin householders of Saalaa
approached the Blessed One. Some worshipped the Blessed One,some exchanged
friendly greetings with the Blessed One, some clasped hands towards the
Blessed One, some announced their clan and name and some were silent.Then
they all sat on aside.Then those brahmin householders said thus to the
Blessed One: Good Gotama, why do some beings after death go to loss, to
hell and why do some beings go to increase and are born in heaven? O! householders,
owing to misbehaving and not living according to the Teaching some go to
loss, to hell and others conducting themselves well and living according
to the Teaching go to increase and are born in heaven..We do not understand
this short exposition of good Gotama. Good if this short exposition be
explained to us. The Blessed One said, then householders listen and attend
carefully I will explain.
<p>O! householders, threefold is wrong conduct by body, fourfold is wrong
conduct by words, and threefold is wrong conduct by mind. Householders,
what is the threefold wrong conduct by body?. Here, a certain one destroys
living things. Is cruel, with bloody hands. Is engaged in destroying living
things without compassion. In village or forest takes others’ possessions
stealthily. .Misbehaves in sexuality, misbehaving with those protected
by father, mother, mother and father, brother, sister, relations, with
those with a husband, becoming liable to punishment, or even those garlanded
and made to promise. Householders this is the threefold wrong conduct by
body. Householders, what is the fourfold wrong conduct by words. Here,
householders, a certain one tells lies. In an assembly, in a gathering,
amidst relations, in the guild, or in the presence of the royal family,
called upon to stand witness and when asked to tell what he knows. Not
knowing would say I know and knowing would say I do not know. Not seeing
would say I saw and seeing would say, I did not see. Thus for one’s benefit,
for another’s benefit, or for some small gain would tell lies with awareness.
Would slander, hearing here would tell it elsewhere to make a split here
and hearing elsewhere would tell it here to make a split there. Thus would
disunite the united, fond of disuniting would talk words to disunite. Would
talk roughly, saying insolent words that are sharp and cursing. Words bordering
on anger and not conductive to concentration. Would talk frivolous, untimely,
untruthful words, not in keeping with the Teaching and the discipline.
Words that could not be treasured. Householders, this is the fourfold verbal
wrong conduct..Householders, what is the threefold wrong conduct in mind?
Here, householders, one covets*1) others’ possessions, thinks may they
be mine. Is angry with a defiled mind, thinks may they come to destruction
and may they not exist. Is with wrong perverted view, such as there are
no results for a gift and sacrfice, there are no results for pure and impure
actions. There is no this world, other world, no mother, no father, no
spontaneously arisen beings. There are no recluses and brahmins who have
come to the right path and by themselves realising declare this world and
the other world. Householders, this is the threefold mental misbehaviour.
Householders, on account of this wrong conduct and not living according
to the Teaching, a certain one after death is born in loss and go to hell*2).
<p>O! householders, right conduct by body is threefold, by words is fourfold
and by mind is threefold. Householders, what is the threefold right bodily
conduct? Here, a certain one abstains from destroying living things, throwing
away stick and weapon ashamed abides compassionate to all living things
In the village or forest does not take what is not given. Does not take
others’ possessions stealthily. Does not misbehave in sexuality by misbehaving
with those protected by father, mother, mother and father, brother, sister,
relations, with those with a husband becoming liable to punishment, or
even those garlanded and made to promise. Householders this is the threefold
right conduct by body. Householders, what is the fourfold right conduct
by words? Here, householders, a certain one does not tell lies. In an assembly,
a gathering, amidst relations, in the guild, or in the presence of the
royal family, called upon to stand witness when asked to tell what he knows,
not knowing would say, I do not know. Knowing would say I know. Not seeing
would say I did not see, seeing would say, I saw. Thus for his benefit,
or another’s or for some small gain would not tell lies with awareness.Would
not slander, hearing here would not tell it elsewhere to make a split here.
Hearing elsewhere would not tell it here to make a split there. Thus does
not disunite the united, fond of uniting talks words to unite. Does not
talk roughly. Says polite loving words going straight to the heart. Words
pleasing to the populace at large. Does not talk frivolously. Says words
that are timely, truthful and in accordance with the Teaching and discipline.
Words that could be treasured. Householders, this is the fourfold right
conduct in words. Householders, what is the threefold right conduct in
mind? . Here, householders, one does not covet others’ possessions. Does
not think may they be mine. Is not angry, is not with a defiled mind. Thinks
may these beings be well and happy. Is with right view not perverted Thinks
there are results for a gift and sacrifice. There are results for pure
and impure actions. There is this world, the other world, mother, father.
There are spontaneously arisen beings, in the world. There are recluses
and brahmins who have come to the right path and by themselves realising
declare this world and the other world.Householders, this is the threefold
right mental conduct. O! householders, on account of this right conduct
and living according to the Teaching, after death, a certain one is born
in increase in heaven*3).
<p>Householders, if someone living in right conduct, according to the Teaching,
were to wish, may I be born with the warrior householders after death,
there is a possibility that he will be born with the warrior householders,
after death. What is the reason: It happens to him living in right conduct,
according to the Teaching. –may I be born with the brahmin householders
after death,--with the householder stock after death, there is a possibility,
that he will be born with the householder stock after death. .Householders,
if someone living in right conduct, according to the Teaching, were to
wish, may I be born with the retinue of the protecting gods – with the
retinue of the gods of the thirty three,--with the Yaama gods,--with the
gods of happiness, --with the gods attached to creating, -- with the gods
attached to creating others, with gods holding brahma bodies, -- with the
gods of lustre,--with gods of limited lustre,--with gods of limitless lustre,--with
the radiant gods,-- with the gods of pleasantness,--with the gods of limited
pleasantness,-- with the gods of limitless pleasantness,--with the gods
full of happiness,--with the gods wielding power in space,--with the gods
of non-destruction, --with the dissatisfied gods,--with the gods with insight,--with
the gods of the highest heaven,--with the retinue of gods, in the sphere
of space, in the sphere of consciousness, in the sphere of neither -perception
-nor -non -perception, after death, there is a possibility, that they will
be born, with the retinue of the gods in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-
perception. What is the reason. It happens to those living in right conduct,
according to the Teaching. If someone living in right conduct according
to the Teaching were to wish, may I destroying desires, the mind released
and released through wisdom, here and now realise and abide, there is a
possibility that he should destroying desires, the mind released and released
through wisdom, here and now will realise and abide. What is the reason:
It happens to those living in right conduct
<p>When this was said, the brahmin householders of Saalaa said thus to
the Blessed One. Now we understand venerable sir, It is as though good
Gotama has reinstated something over turned. Made manifest something that
was covered. As though the path was told to those who had lost their way,
As though an oil lamp was lighted for those who have sight to see forms.
Thus in many ways the Teaching is explained. Now we take refuge in good
Gotama, in the Teaching and the Community. We are disciples who have taken
refuge from good Gotama, from today until life lasts. .
<p><font size=-1>Notes. 1.To covet-<i>‘abhijjhaalu hoti’</i> This is something
done with the mind. It’s to think greedily of other’s possessions. It is
one of the ten demerits.</font>
<p><font size=-1>2.</font> <font size=-1>On account of this wrong conduct
and not living according to the Teaching, a certain one after death is
born in loss and go to hell ‘<i>eva.m adhammacariyaa visamacariyaa hetu
kho gahapatayo evamidhekacce sattaa kaayassa bedhaa para.m maranaa apaaya.m
duggati.m vinipaata.m niraya.m uppajjanti’</i> The Blessed One here does
not mention that all those who follow the wrong conduct and do not live
according the Teaching, after death, go to loss and hell. So there is an
interrogation. We should make a thorough inquiry into this. 3. On account
of this right conduct and living according to the Teaching, a certain one
after death is born in increase in heaven.’<i>eva.m dhammacariyaa samacariyaa
hetu kho gahapatayo evamidhekacce sattaa kaayassa bedhaa para.m maranaa
sugati.m sagga.m loka.m uppajjanti’ </i>Again the Blessed One here does
not mention, that all those who follow the right conduct and live according
to the Teaching, after death are born in increase, in heaven.The mere following
up of these ten actions of merit –‘<i>dasakusalakammaa</i>’do not lead
one to heaven, there should be some convincement about one’s actions. So
the Blessed One in this Sutta explains that the doer of those actions should
have some aspiration for something higher than what one is now established
in. There should be the nature of building one’s character in all fields,constantly.</font>
