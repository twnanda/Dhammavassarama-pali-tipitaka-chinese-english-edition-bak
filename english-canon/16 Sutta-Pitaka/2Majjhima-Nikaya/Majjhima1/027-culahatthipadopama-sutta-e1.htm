<p><b><i>3.7 Cuulahatthipadopamasutta.m-</i></b>
<p><b>(27)The Minor Discourse of the Simile</b>
<p><b>of the Elephant’s Footprint.</b></center>

<p>I heard thus.
<p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika
in Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi. At that time the brahmin Jaanussoni was travelling
in a chariot completely covered in white and seeing the brahmin Pilotika
walking in the distance. asked him, from where is good Vacchaayana coming
at this time of the day
<p>Friend, I am now come from the presence of the Blessed One. What does
good Vacchaayana think of the recluse Gotama’s accomplishment of wisdom?
Does he think he is wise? Who am I to know the wisdom of the recluse Gotama?
It should be somebody like him to know the level of wisdom of the recluse
Gotama. Indeed good Vacchaayana praises the recluse Gotama much Who am
I to praise the recluse Gotama?. Out of the praiseworthy the recluse Gotama
is one. He is chief among gods and men. Good Vacchaayana, seeing what good
in the recluse Gotama praises him in this manner? Like a clever elephant
hunter, who has entered an elephant grove, seeing the footprint of an elephant
huge in length and breadth would come to the conclusion, indeed this is
the foot print of a huge elephant. In the same manner I seeing these four
characteristics in the recluse Gotama conclude. Indeed the Blessed One
is rightfully enlightened, the Teaching of the Blessed One is well proclaimed
and the Community of bhikkhus are well established: What four?
<p>Friend, I see a certain wise warrior, a clever forceful disputer who
could even split a hair, wandering about, thinking he is wise. Then he
hears that the recluse Gotama had gone to a certain village or hamlet.
Then they build up a question, approach the recluse Gotama and ask this
question from him. Then he replies in this manner and by that they draw
him for a dispute.Then he hears that the recluse Gotama has come to a certain
village or hamlet so forming a question approaches the recluse Gotama.
The recluse Gotama advises, instructs, makes the heart light and pleasant,
He does not even ask the question, so where is a dispute, they become all
round disciples of the recluse Gotama. Seeing this first characteristic
of the recluse Gotama I have come to the conclusion that the recluse Gotama
is rightfully enlightened, the Blessed One’s Teaching is well proclaimed
and the community of bhikkhus have come to the right path.
<p>Again, I see a certain wise brahmin a forceful clever disputer, who
could even split a hair, wandering about, thinking he is wise. Then he
hears that when the recluse Gotama had gone to a certain village or hamlet.
they had built up a question, and approached the recluse Gotama, asked
this question, when asked he had replied in this manner and they had drawn
him to a dispute .Then he hears that the recluse Gotama has come to a certain
village or hamlet and making up a question approaches the recluse Gotama.
The recluse Gotama advises, instructs, makes the heart light and pleasant,
he does not even ask the question, so where is a dispute, they become all
round disciples of the recluse Gotama. Seeing this second characteristic
of the recluse Gotama I have come to the conclusion that the recluse Gotama
is rightfully enlightened. The Blessed One’s Teaching is well proclaimed
and the community of bhikkhus has come to the right path..
<p>Again I see a certain wise householder, a clever forceful disputer who
could even split a hair, wandering about, thinking he is wise. He hears
that the recluse Gotama had gone to a certain village or hamlet.Then they
made up a question, approached the recluse Gotama, asked this question,
and he had replied in this manner had drawn him to a dispute thus. Then
he hears that the recluse Gotama has come to a certain village or hamlet
and making up a question approaches the recluse Gotama. The recluse Gotama
advises, instructs, makes the heart light and pleasant. He does not even
ask the question, so where is a dispute, they become all round disciples
of the recluse Gotama. Seeing this third characteristic of the recluse
Gotama I have come to the conclusion that the recluse Gotama is rightfully
enlightened. The Blessed One’s Teaching is well proclaimed and the community
of bhikkhus have come to the right path..
<p>Again, I see a certain wise recluse, a clever forceful disputer who
could even split a hair, wandering about, thinking he is wise. Then he
hears that when the recluse Gotama had gone to a certain village or hamlet.
they had made up a question, had approached the recluse Gotama and asked
this question. He had replied in this manner and had drawn him to a dispute.
Then he hears that the recluse Gotama has come to a certain village or
hamlet and building up a question approaches the recluse Gotama. The recluse
Gotama advises, instructs, makes the heart light and pleasant, he does
not even ask the question, so where is a dispute, they become all round
disciples of the recluse Gotama. They ask for the going forth, to leave
the household and become homeless. Withdrawn from the crowd would abide
diligent for dispelling. For whatever purpose sons of clansmen leave the
household and become homeless, that highest end of the holy life they here
and now realise, and abide. They say, our mind nearly perished, now it
is happy. Earlier we were not recluses although we thought we were recluses.
Earlier we were not brahmins, yet we thought we were recluses and brahmins.
Not perfect, we acknowledged we were perfect. Now we are perfect. Seeing
this fourth characteristic of the recluse Gotama I have come to the conclusion
that the recluse Gotama is rightfully enlightened, the Blessed One’s Teaching
is well proclaimed and the community of bhikkhus has come to the right
path..
<p>When this was said, the brahmin Jaanussoni got down from his completely
white chariot, arranged his shawl on one shoulder and clasping his hands
towards where the Blessed One was repeated the words ‘I worship that Blessed
One perfect and rightfully enlightened ‘ three times. And said some day
we will see good Gotama and have a conversation on this with him.Then the
brahmin Jaanussoni approached the Blessed One, exchanged friendly greetings
and sat on a side. Seated the brahmin Jaanussoni repeated the complete
conversation between himself and the brahmin Pilotika. Then the Blessed
One said brahmin, the simile of the elephant’s footprint is not complete.
I will explain it to you completely, listen and attend carefully.
<p>Brahmin, like the elephant hunter gone to the elephant grove would see
a footprint of an elephant huge in length and breadth. If he is clever
he would not come to the conclusion, indeed this is the foot- print of
a huge elephant. What is the reason: In the elephant grove there are she
elephants by the name Vaamanikaa, they too have huge footprints like that.
He ignores it and sees the footprint of an elephant huge by the length
and breadth and placed at a high altitude. If he is a clever elephant hunter,
he would not come to the conclusion, indeed this is the foot print of a
huge elephant. What is the reason? In the elephant grove there are she
elephants by the name uccaakaalarikaa, Who also have huge footprints..Ignoring
that, he sees the foot- print of an elephant huge by the length and breadth
placed at a high altitude and also furrows made with the tusk at a high
altitude. If he is clever, he would not come to the conclusion, indeed
this is the footprint of a huge elephant: What is the reason?. In the elephant
grove, there are she elephants, by the name uccaakanerukaa. They too have
huge footprints. Ignoring that he sees the footprint of an elephant placed
at a high altitude and also furrows made with the tusk at a high altitude,
and branches broken from a high altitude and sees the elephant himself
at the root of a tree, in the open, standing, sitting or lying. Then he
comes to the conclusion indeed this is the huge elephant. In the same manner
brahmin, the Thus Gone One arises in the world, perfect, rightfully enlightened,
endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, knower of the worlds, the
incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, Teacher of gods and men, enlightened
and blessed. He declares to the world together with its Maaras, Brahmaas,
the community of recluses and brahmins gods and men, that Teaching good
at the beginning, in the middle and at the end full of meaning even in
the letter, complete in every way stating the pure holy life. Hearing this
a householder or a householder’s son, born to some clan, gains faith in
the Thus Gone One. With that faith he reflects. The life in a household
is full of defilements, going forth is like open space. It is not easy
for one living a household life to lead the holy life complete and pure
without defilements. What if I shave head and beard, don yellow robes and
go forth as a homeless. Later he gives up a little wealth, or much wealth,
a small circle of friends, or a large circle of friends, shaving head and
beard, and donning yellow robes goes forth as a homeless.
<p>Gone forth he becomes a trainer in the life of a bhikkhu, gives up hurting
living things, throwing away stick and weapon, ashamed and compassion aroused,
abides with compassion for all beings. Abstaining from taking what is not
given, desires the given, the self made pure without thieving he abides.
.Abstaining from low sexual intercourse leads the holy life .Abstaining
from telling lies becomes reliable and trustworthy and abides without a
dispute with the world. Giving up slandering, hearing here does not say
it elsewhere, to split these, hearing elsewhere does not say it here to
split those, Thus he unites the split, promotes unity, fond of unity talks
words to unite. Giving up rough talk, says pleasant words pleasing to the
ears, .and words going straight to the heart of the populace at large.
Abstains from frivolous talk. Says appropriate words, that are truthful,
meaningful, in accordance with the Teaching and Discipline, those words
that could be treasured.
<p>Abstains from destroying seed groups and vegetable groups. Partaking
one meal a day, abstains from food at night and at untimely hours. Abstains
from dance, singing, music, decorations, flowers and scents, ointments
and adornments. Abstains from high and stately beds. Abstains from accepting
gold and silver, uncooked rice and uncooked flesh,. Abstains from accepting
women and girls, slaves, men or women, Abstains from accepting goats and
cows, fowl and pigs, elephants, cattle, .horses and mares.
<p>Abstains from accepting fields and wealth, and abstains from doing the
work of a messenger. Abstains from buying and selling. Abstains from unfair
ways of weighing and measuring. Abstains from cutting, severing, destroying,
highway robbery, and wrong ways of obtaining morsel food.
<p>Satisfied, covering the body with robes, and feeding the belly with
morsel food, goes with all the belongings where ever he goes. Like the
birds small and large that go with the weight of their wings. Likewise
satisfied covering the body with robes and feeding the belly with morsel
food, goes with all the belongings where ever he goes. Endowed with this
mass of virtues, he experiences the pleasure of blamelessness internally.
Seeing a form with the eye, does not take the sign or the elements .To
him that abides with the mental faculty of the eye uncontrolled, may trickle
demeritorious things of covetousness and displeasure, he abides protecting
the mental faculty of the eye..Hearing a sound with the ear,- Cognizing
a smell with the nose- tasting a taste with the tongue,- Cognizing a touch
with the body- Cognizing an idea with the mind, does not take the sign
or the element. To him that abides with the mental faculty of the mind
uncontrolled, may trickle demeritorious things of covetousness and displeasure,
he abides protecting the mental faculty of the mind. Endowed with the noble
ones’ control of the mental faculties, he experiences the untouched pleasure
of the mental faculties(1). Coming forward and returning is aware, looking
on and looking aside is aware, bending and stretching is aware, bearing
bowl and the three robes is aware, tasting, drinking, eating and enjoying
is aware, going, standing, sitting, lying, awake, and keeping silence is
aware.
<p>Endowed with this mass of virtues, with this control of the mental faculties
of the noble ones, with the mindful awareness of the noble ones abides
in a secluded dwelling, a forest, the root of a tree, a mountain grotto
or cave, a charnel ground, a jungle forest, an open space, or a heap straw..
Returning from the alms round and after the meal is over, sits in a cross
legged position, the body placed straight and mindfulness established in
front.
<p>Dispelling covetousness for the world he abides, cleaning the mind of
covetousness .Dispelling anger he abides cleaning the mind of anger, compassionate
for all born lives. Dispelling sloth and torpor he abides, mindful and
aware of a perception of light, mindfully cleaning sloth and torpor from
the mind. Dispelling restlessness and worry he abides with a mind internally
appeased and cleans the mind of restlessness and worry. Abides with doubts
dispelled without doubts of meritorious things that should be done
<p>The bhikkhu having dispelled the five hindrances of the mind, making
the minor defilements weak through wisdom, away from sensual thoughts and
away from demeritorious things, with thoughts and thought processes and
with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion attained to abides in the first
jhaana. Brahmin, to this is called the footprint of the Thus Gone One,
the dwelling of the Thus Gone One, the delight of the Thus Gone One. The
noble disciple does not conclude .yet, that the Blessed One is rightfully
enlightened, the Teaching of the Blessed One is well proclaimed, the Community
of bhikkhus have gone the right path. Again brahmin, the bhikkhu overcomimng
thoughts and thought processes, the mind internally appeased, brought to
a single point, without thoughts and thought processes and with joy and
pleasantness born of concentration attained to abides in the second jhaana.
To this is called the footprint of the Thus Gone One, the dwelling of the
Thus Gone One, the delight of the Thus Gone One. The noble disciple does
not conclude yet that the Blessed One is rightfully enlightened, the Teaching
of the Blessed One is well proclaimed, the Community of bhikkhus have gone
the right path. Again, brahmin, the bhikkhu with equanimity to joy and
detachment abides mindful and aware, and experiencing pleasantness with
the body attained to abides in the third jhaana. To this the noble ones
say abiding in pleasanatness mindful of equanimity.This is called the footprint
of the Thus Gone One, the dwelling of the Thus gone One, the delight of
the Thus Gone One. The noble disciple does not conclude yet that the Blessed
One is rightfully enlightened, the Teaching of the Blessed One is well
proclaimed, the community of bhikkhus have gone the right path. Again,
brahmin, the bhikkhu dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness and earlier
having dispelled pleasure and displeasure, without unpleasantness and pleasantness,
and mindfulness purified with equanimity attained to abides in the fourth
jhaana. Brahmin.This also, is called the footprint of the Thus Gone One,
the dwelling of the Thus Gone One, the delight of the Thus Gone One.The
noble disciple does not conclude yet that the Blessed One is rightfully
enlightened, the Teaching of the Blessed One is well proclaimed, the community
of bhikkhus has gone the right path.
<p>When the mind is concentrated, pure, free from minor defilements, is
malleable workable not disturbed, he directs the mind for the knowledge
of previous births. Recollects the manifold previous births, one birth,
two births, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred
births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, innumerable forward
cycles of births, innumerable backward cycles of births, innumerable forward
and backward cycles of births. There, I was of such name, clan, disposition,
supports, experiencing such pleasant and unpleasant feelings and with such
a life span. Disappearing from there was born there with such name, clan,
disposition, supports, experiencing such pleasant and unpleasant feelings,
with such a life span, disappearing from there, is born here. Thus with
all modes and all details manifold previous births are recollected. Brahmin,
this too is called the footprint of the Thus Gone One, the dwelling of
the Thus Gone One, the delight of the Thus Gone One. The noble disciple
does not conclude yet, the Blessed One is rightfully enlightened, the Teaching
of the Blessed One is well proiclaimed, the Community of bhikkhus has gone
the right path.
<p>When the mind is concentrated, pure, free from minor defilements malleable
workable not disturbed, he directs the mind for the knowledge of the disappearing
and appearing of beings. With the heavenly eye purified beyond human, he
sees beings disappearing and appearing unexalted and exalted, beautiful
and ugly. Saw them arising in good and bad states according to their actions:
These good beings misbehaving by body, speech and mind, blaming noble ones,
with the wrong view of actions, after death are born in loss, in decrease,
in hell. As for these good beings, well behaved in body speech and mind
, not blaming noble ones, with the right view of actions after death are
born in heaven. Thus with the heavenly eye purified beyond human he sees
beings disappearing and appearing. Brahmin, this too is called the footprint
of the Thus Gone One, the dwelling of the Thus Gone One, the delight of
the Thus Gone One. The noble disciple does not conclude yet, that the Blessed
One is rightfully enlightened. The Teaching of the Blessed One is well
proclaimed, the Community of bhikkhus has gone the right path.
<p>When the mind is concentrated, pure, free from minor defilements, is
malleable workable not disturbed, he directs the mind for the destruction
of desires. Knows, this is unpleasant, this is the arising of unpleasantness,
this is the cessation of unpleasantness, this is the path to the cessation
of unpleasantness, as it really is. Knows these are desires, these are
the arising of desires, these are the cessation of desires, and this is
the path, to the cessation of desires as it really is. Brahmin, this too
is called the footprint of the Thus Gone One, the home of the Thus Gone
One, the delight of the Thus Gone One. The noble disciple at this point
concludes, the Blessed One is rightfully enlightened. The Teaching of the
Blessed One is well proclaimed, the Community of bhikkhus have gone the
right path. When he knows this and sees this, his mind is released from
sensual desires. It’s released from the desires to be, and from desires
of ignorance (2) When released knows, am released, knowledge arose, birth
is destroyed, the holy life is lived to the end. What should be done is
done, there is nothing more to wish. Brahmin, this too is called the footprint
of the Thus Gone One, the home of the Thus Gone One, the delight of the
Thus Gone One. The noble disciple at this point concludes, the Blessed
One is rightfully enlightened, the Teaching of the Blessed One is well
proclaimed, the Community of bhikkhus have gone the right path..Brahmin,
in this manner, the simile of the footprint of the Blessed One is complete.
<p>Then the brahmin Jaanussoni said, good Gotama, now I know, it is like
something overturned is reinstalled , something covered is made manifest,
it is as the path is told to one who has lost his way, as an oil lamp was
lighted for those who have eyes to see forms. Thus good Gotama has explained
the Teaching in various ways. Now I take refuge in good Gotama, in the
Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. May I
<p>be remembered as a lay disciple from today until life lasts. . . . .

<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=-1>Notes.</font>
<p>Experiences the untouched pleasure of the mental faculties ‘<i> ajjhattam
abyaasekasukha.m pa.tisa.m vedeti’ </i>A person who controls the mental
faculties aims to experience this pleasure, with much pressure, that is
his mind should not change on account of any data that come through the
six spheres of mental contact. When the bhikkhu becomes an ‘arahant ‘ a
perfected one this becomes a constant pleasure to him. Whatever the circumstance
may be his mind does not change on account of a contact at one or the other
door of the mental faculties.
<p>Is released from the desires of ignorance.<i>’avijjaasavaapi citta.m
vimuccati‘ </i>The desires of ignorance always come through the six spheres
of contact. Whatever data we collect through seeing,hearing, smelling,
tasting, touch of the body, and cognizing ideas, we take that data as agreeable,
pleasaant, and mine, and this is called ignorance.
