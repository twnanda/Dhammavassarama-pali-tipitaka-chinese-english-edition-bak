<p><b>11 A Minor Lion’s Roar.</b></center>

<p>I heard thus.
<p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika
in Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from
there.
<p>Bhikkhus, it’s only in this dispensation, that there is a recluse. A
second recluse. A third recluse and a fourth recluse. Other faiths are
devoid of recluses and devoid of the perfect. Thus the lion’s roar could
be rightfully roared. It might happen that adherants of other sects would
ask with what conviction and what powers do the venerable ones say that
here only there is a recluse, a second recluse, a third recluse and a fourth
recluse. Other faiths are devoid of recluses and devoid of the perfect.
Bhikkhus, to those adherants of other sects this is our reply. Friends,
there are four things declared by that Blessed One, who knows and sees
is worthy and rightfully enlightened we seeing those four things in ourselves
say here only there is a recluse, a second recluse, a third recluse and
a fourth recluse. Other faiths are devoid of recluses and the perfect.
What four. Friends, we have faith in the Teacher, we have faith in the
Teaching, we see the completion of our virtues and we have a pleasant and
rightful relation between the gone forth and the householders. Seeing these
in ourselves we say here only there is a recluse, a second recluse, a third
recluse and a fourth recluse. Other faiths are devoid of recluses and the
perfect. It might happen that the adherants of other sects would say, we
too have faith , in our teacher, we too have faith in our teaching, we
too have a completion in our virtues and we too have a pleasant and rightful
relation between the gone forth and the housseholders. So what is the difference
between your teaching and our teaching. To those adherants of other sects
who say thus, this is our reply. Friends, is the ultimate end a single
one or is it manifold. If those adherants of other sects reply rightfully,
they would say the the ultimate end is a single one, not a manifold one.
Friends, is that end with greed or without greed. If the adherants of other
sects reply rightfully, they would say : The ultimate end is without greed.
Friends, is that ultimate end with anger or without anger. If the adherants
of other sects reply rightfully, they would say. The ultimate end is without
anger. Friends, is that ultimate end with delusion or without ddelusion.
If the adherants of other sects reply rightfully, they would say. The ultimate
end is without delusion. Friends, is that ultimate end with holdings or
without holdings. If the adherants of other sects reply rightfully, they
would say. The ultimate end is without holdings. Friends, is that ultimate
end for the wise or for the unwise. If the adherants of other sects reply
rightfully, they would say. The ultimate end is for the wise. Friends,
is that ultimate end for the not rough and not averse or for the rough
and averse If the adherants of other sects reply rightfully, they would
say. The ultimate end is for the not rough and not averse. Friends, is
that ultimate end for those fond of the diffusedness of the world or for
the detached from the diffusedness of the worald. If the adherants of other
sects reply rightfully, they would say. The ultimate end is for the detached
from the diffusedness of the world.
<p>Friends, views are twofold. The view ‘to be’ and the view ‘not to be’.
Those recluses and brahmins that cling to the view ‘to be’ are overcome
by that view are averse to the view ‘not to be’. Those recluses and brahmins
that cling to the view ‘not to be’ are overcome by that view are averse
to the view ‘to be’. Recluse or brahmin who does not know the arising,
fading, satisfaction, danger, and the escape from these two views as it
really is , he is with greed, with anger, with delusion, with craving,
with holdings, not wise, he is rough and averse, is attached to the diffusedness
of the world . I say, that he is not released from birth, decay, death,
grief, lament, unpleasaantness, displeasure and distress. I say, he is
not released from unpleasantness. Recluse or brahmin who knows the arising,
fading, satisfaction, danger, and the escape from these two views as it
really is, he is without greed, without anger, without delusion, without
craving, without holdings, wise, not rough and averse, not fond of the
diffusedness of the world. I say, he is released from birth, decay, death,
grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress. I say, he is released
from unpleasantness.
<p>Bhikkhus, fourfold are the holdings, What four. Holding to sensuality,
holding to views, holding to virtues and holding to the self view. Bhikkhus,
there are certain recluses and brahmins, who acknowledge they know all
holdings but are unable to explain all holdings as they really are. They
explain the holding to sensuality, but not the holding to views not the
holding to virtues and not the holding to the self view. What is the reason:
These good recluses and brahmins do not know three holdings as they really
are. They explain the holding to sensuality not the holding to views, not
the holding to virtues and not the holding to the self view. So these good
recluses and brahmins who acknowledge they know all holdings do not explain
all holdings rightfully. Bhikkhus, there are certain recluses and brahmins,
who acknowledge they know all holdings but are unable to explain all holdings
as they really are. They explain the holding to sensuality, and the holding
to views, not the holding to virtues and not the holding to the self view.What
is the reason. These good recluses and brahmins do not know two holdings
as they really are,they explain the holding to sensuality and the holding
to views, not the holding to virtues and not the holding to the self view.
So these good recluses and brahmins who acknowledge they know all holdings
do not explain all holdings rightfully. .Bhikkhus, there are certain recluses
and brahmins, who acknowledge they know all holdings but are unable to
explain all holdings as they really are. They explain the holding to sensuality
the holding to views and the holding to virtues not the holding to the
self view. What is the reason. These good recluses and brahmins do not
know one holding as it really is, they explain the holding to sensuality,
the holding to views, and the holding to virtues not the holding to the
self view. So these good recluses and brahmins who acknowledge they know
all holdlings do not explain all holdings rightfully Bhikkhus, in such
a dispensation, the faith in the Teacher has not reached the highest point
I say. The faith in the Teaching has not reached the highest point , I
say. The completion of virtues has not reached the highest point., I say.
And that rightful mutual understanding has not reached the highest point.
What is the reason: Bhikkhus, it happens in a teaching not well proclaimed,
not well explained, not leading beyond, not leading to appeasement, and
taught by one not rightfully enlightened.
<p>Bhikkhus, the Thus Gone One worthy, rightfully enlightened, acknowledges
the knowledge of all holdings
<p>and explains all holdings. Explain the holding to sensuality, the holding
to views, the holding to virtues and the holding to the self view. Bhikkhus,
in such a dispensation, the faith in the Teacher has reached the highest
point. The faith in the Teaching has reached the highest point. The completion
of virtues has reached the highest point. The rightful mutual understanding
has reached the highest point. What is the reason. Bhikkhus, it happens
in a well proclaimed teaching, in a well explained teaching, in a teaching
leading beyond, in a teaching leading to appeasement, and when taught by
one rightfully enlightened.
<p>Bhikkhus, these four holdings, from what do they originate, from what
do they rise, from what do they come to birth, and with what do they develop.
They originate from craving, rise from craving, come to birth from craving,
and develop with craving. Bhikkhus, this craving, from what does it originate,
from what does it rise, from what does it come to birth, and with what
does it develop. Craving originates from feelings, rise from feelings,
come to birth from feelings and develop with feelings. Bhikkhus, these
feelings, from what do they originate, from what do they rise, from what
do they come to birth, and with what do they develop. Feelings originate
from contact, rise from contact, come to birth from contact, and develop
with contact.Bhikkhus, this contact from what does it originate, from what
does it rise, from what does it come to birth, and with what does it develop.
Contact originates from the six spheres, rises from the six spheres, comes
to birth from the six spheres and develops with the six spheres. Bhikkhus,
these six spheres from what do they originate, from what do they rise,
from what do they come to birth, and with what do they develop. The six
spheres originate from name and matter, rise from name and matter, come
to birth from name and matter and develop with name and matter. Bhikkhus,
this name and matter, from what does it originate, from what does it rise,
from what does it come to birth and with what does it develop. Name and
matter originates from consciousness, rises from consciousness, comes to
birth from consciousness and develops with consciousness. Bhikkhus, this
consciousness, from what does it originate, from what does it rise, from
what does it come to birth, with what does it develop. Consciousness originates
from determinations, rises from determinations, comes to birth from determinations,
and develops with determinations. Bhikkhus, these determinations, from
what do they originate, from what do they rise, from what do they come
to birth and with what do they develop. Determinations originate from ignorance,
rise from ignorance, come to birth from ignorance and develop with ignorance.
Bhikkhus, when ignorance dispelled and turned out science arises, he does
not hold to sensuality, does not hold to views, does not hold to virtues,
and does not hold to the self view. Not holding is not worried, not worried,
he by himself is extinguished: birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived,
what should be done is done, there is nothing more to wish.
<p>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words
of the Blessed One.
