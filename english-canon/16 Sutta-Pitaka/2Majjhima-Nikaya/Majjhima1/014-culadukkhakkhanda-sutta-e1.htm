<p><b>(14) The Minor Mass of Unpleasantness</b></center>

<p><b>`I</b> heard thus.
<p>At one time the Blessed One was living in Nigrodhaa’s monastery in Kapilavatthu
in the country of the Sakyas. Then the Sakya Mahaanaama approached the
Blessed One worshipped, sat on a side and said: I remember the Blessed
One teaching some time ago that greed is a minor defilement of the mind,
anger is a minor defilement of the mind, and delusion is a minor defilement
of the mind. Venerable sir, I know this teaching well that greed, anger,
and delusion are minor defilements of the mind, yet on some days greed
takes hold of my mind and persists, anger takes hold of my mind and persists
and delusion takes hold of my mind and persists. Then it occurs to me:
Why are these things not dispelled from me internally, that on a day greed
takes hold of me and persists, anger too takes hold of me and persists,
and delusion too takes hold of me and persits.
<p>Mahaanaama, those things are not dispelled in you internally, so one
day greed takes hold of your mind and persist, anger takes hold of your
mind and persist, and delusion takes hold of your mind and persist. .
<p>Mahaanaama, if these things were dispelled in you internally, you would
not live in a household and partake of sensuality
<p>. Mahaanaama, by a noble disciple, with his right wisdom, it is clearly
seen that sensuality has little satisfaction, much unpleasantness, much
trouble and many dangers and if he does not attain a joy and pleasantness
away from sensual desires and away from demeritorious thoughts or something
more appeasing than that until then he falls for sensuality. When the noble
disciple sees as it really is,with right wisdom, there is little satisfaction
in sensuality, much unpleasanness, much trouble and many dangers
<p>he attains a joy and pleasantness away from sensual desires and away
from demeritorious thoughts or something more appeasing than that. Then
he falls no more for sensuality. Mahaanaaama, I too, when a seeker of enlightenment,
saw as it really is, with right wisdom, there is little satisfaction in
sensuality, much unpleasantness, much trouble and many dangers and when
I did not attain a joy and pleasantness away from sensual desires and away
from demeritorious thoughts or something more appeasing than that, I did
not realize of a no fall for sensuality. When I saw as it really is, with
right wisdom, there is little satisfaction in sensuality, much unpleasantness,
much trouble and many danagers and attained a joy and pleasantness away
from sensual desires and away from demeritorious thoughts or something
more appeasing than that, I realized there is no fall for sensuality. .
<p>Mahaanaama, what is the satisfaction in sensuality, Mahaanaama,. fivefold
are the strands of sensuality. What five: Exciting, agreeable, pleasant
forms, arousing sensual desires, cognizable by eye consciousness. Exciting,
agreeable, pleasant sounds, arousing sensual desires cognizable by ear
consciousness. Exciting , agreeable , pleasant smells, arousing sensual
desires cognizable by nose consciousness. Exciting, agreeable pleasant
tastes, arousing sensual desires cognizable by tongue consciousness. Exciting
agreeable pleasant touches, arousing sensual desires congizable by body
consciousness Whatever pleasantness and pleasure arises on account of these
five strands of sensuality, that is the satisfaction in sensuality.
<p>Mahaanaama, what is the danger in sensuality Whoever son of a clansman
would have to make a living by some craft either handling money, or counting,
or Mathematics, or farming, or trading, or rearing cattle, or ruling the
country, or serving the king, or doing any other craft would have to undergo
cold and heat, the sting of gad flies and yellow flies, the heat of the
air, the touch of creeping things, would have to bear hunger and thirst.
This is the danger of sensuality here and now, the mass of unpleasantness
owing to sensuality. This son of a clansman, strives and puts forth effort
yet wealth would not accrue to him. He grieves and laments beats his breast
and comes to bewilderment of mind. This son of a clansman strives and puts
forth effort and wealth accrues to him, then he comes to unpleasantness
and displeasure administrating ways and means to protect his wealth.What
if the king carries away my wealth, or thieves run away with it, what if
fire burns it or be carried away by water. Or if unwelcome heirs carry
it away. Then his wealth is either carried away by the king or carried
away by thieves, or burnt by fire, or carried away by water, or some unwelcome
heirs would carry it away and he grieves and comes to much unpleasantness
and displeasure.Mahaanaama , this is the danger of sensuality here and
now, the mass of unpleasantness owing to sensuality.
<p>Again, Mahaanaama, kings dispute with kings, warriors with warriors,
brahmins with brahmins, householders with householders, mother disputes
with the son, the son with the mother, the father with the son, the son
with the father, brother with brother, brother with sister, sister with
brother, friend with friend, They dispute quarrel and approach each other
with hands, clods, sticks, weapons, and even face death, or come to deadly
unpleasantness. This is the danger of sensuality here and now, the mass
of unpleasantness owing to sensuality.
<p>Again on account of sensuality the two parties, take swords and shields,
bows and arrows, and other weapons and approach each other, throw slippery
implements at each other, shoot arrows, swords flickering like lightening,
boiling oil is sprinkled and each other is crushed with superior force,
necks are cut and they face death or deathly unpleasantness. This too is
the danger of sensuality here and now, the mass of unpleasaantness owing
to sensuality. .
<p>Again on account of sensuality, robbers break into houses, plunder,
rob, stay in ambush, go to others’ wives,.. The king metes them punishment
are caned and wipped, flogged with the jungle rope, flogged with the soiled
stick, hands severed, legs severed, or both hands and legs severed, ears
and nose severed, put in the boiling gruel pot, shell tonsured, put in
Raahu’s mouth, garlanded with the blazing garland, hands are scorched,
the bark dress is given, put with snakes, putting the flesh is hooked,
pieces of flesh are cut from the body, a spike is driven from ear to ear,
the body is made like straw beating, immersed in boiling oil, given to
the dogs to be eaten, raised on a spike alive until death, and the neck
is cut with the sword. This too is the danger of sensulaity here and now,
the mass of unpleasantness owing to sensuality.
<p>Again, Mahaanaama, on account of sensuality, misbehaving in body, in
words and mentally, after death are born in loss, in decrease are born
in hell. This is the danger of sensuality here after, the mass of unpleasantness.
<p>Mahaanaama, at one time I lived in Rajagaha on vultures’ peak at that
time many Nigan.thas were standing errect rejecting seats on the black
rock on the Isigili side. They were feeling sharp rough unpleasant feelings.
When I got up from my seclusion, I approached those Nigan.thas on the black
rock on Isigili side and asked them -Friends, Nigan.thas, why do you stand
errect rejecting seats and feel sharp rough unpleasant feelings. When,
asked they said Friend, Nigan.tha Naathaputta acknowledges remainderless
knowledge and vision is all knowing and all seeing . He said walking or
standing or lying or awake constantly my knowledge and vision is established
. Nigan.thas, you have earlier done demerit, by this difficult performance
finish them; When you are now restrained in body, words and mind, demerit
is not done for the future, the earlier actions are with austerities destroyed.
When new actions are not done, there are no tricklings for the future.
When there are no tricklings for the future, there is destruction of action.
With the destruction of action, there is the destruction of unpleasantness,
with the destruction of unpleasantness there is the destruction of feelings
. With the destruction of feelings all unpleasantness finishes. We like
this teaching and it appeals to us.
<p>Then I asked the Nigan.thas," Nigan.thas, do you know, we were in the
past or we were not in the past" -"No, friend." "Nigan.thas, do you know
we did not do demerit in the past not we did not do demerit in the past".
"No friend." "Do you know, we did not do this demerit and this demerit"
"No friend." "Nigan.thas, do you know , this much unpleasantness is finished,
this much unpleasantness has to be finished, or when this much unpleasantness
is finished all unpleasantness will finish." -"No friend." "Nigan.thas,
do you know the dispelling of demeritorious actions here and now, and the
accumulation of meritorious actions" "No. Friend" " So then, friends Nigan.thas,
you do not know, we were in the past, not we were not in the past. You
do not know we did not do demerit in the past, not we did not do demerit
in the past. You do not know, we did not do this demerit and this demerit.
You do not know, this much unpleasantness is finished, this much unpleasantness
has to be finished, or when this unpleasantness is finished, all unpleasantness
will finish. You do not know the dispelling of demeritorious actions here
and now, and the accumulation of meritorious actions. When this is so,
friends, Nigan.thas, those bloody handed with fierce actions born among
humans go forth as Nigana.thas- Friend, Gotama, from pleasantness, pleasantaness
could not be attained, from unpleasanatness, pleasantness could be attained.
If pleasantness could be attained from pleasantness, king Seniya Bimbisaara
of Magadha would attain more pleasantness than venerable Gotama.
<p>Indeed the Nigan.thas have spoken unreflective words ‘From pleasantness,
pleasantness could not be attained, from unpleasantness, pleasantness could
be attained. If pleasantness could be attained from pleasantness, king
Seniya Bimbisaara of Magadha would attain more pleasanaatness than venerable
Gotama’ This question should have been asked from me, Who has a more pleasant
abiding, king Seniya Bimbisaara of Magadha or venerable Gotama. Indeed
Gotama, we have said those words unreflectively. Now we ask venerable Gotama
this question: Of the two venerable ones who has a more pleasant abiding
, king Seniya Bimbisaara of Magadha or or Gotama. Then Nigan.thas, I will
cross question you on this, as it pleases, you may reply. Can king Seniya
Bimbisaara of Magadha abide in only pleasantness for seven nights and days
without moving the body and without uttering a word. -Friend, it is not
possible. Can king Ssniya Bimbisaara of Magadha abide in only pleasantness
for six nights and days, -five nights and days, -four nights and days,-three
nights and days,- two nights and days,-one night and day without moving
the body and without uttering a word- Friend, it is not possible. Friend,
I can abide in only pleasantness for one night and day without moving the
body and without uttering a word. I can abide in only pleasantness for
two nights and two days without moving the body and without uttering a
word. I can abide in only pleasantness for three nights and three days
without moving the body and without uttering a word. I can abide in only
pleasantness for four nights and four days without moving the body and
without uttering a word. I can abide in only pleasantness for five nights
and five days without moving the body and without uttering a word. I can
abide in only pleasantness for six nights and six days without moving the
body and without uttering a word. I can abide in only pleasantness for
seven nights and seven days without moving the body and without uttering
a word. Nigan.thas, when this is so, who has a more pleasant abiding, king
Seniya Bimbisaara or I. When this is so, venerable Gotama has a more pleasant
abiding than king Seniya Bimbisaara of Magadha.
<p>The Blessed One said thus and the Sakya Mahaanaama delighted in the
words of the Blessed One.
