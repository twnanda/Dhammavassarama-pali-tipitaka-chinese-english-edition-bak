<p>I heard thus.
<p>At one time the Blessed One was living in the Kuru country, in the hamlet
named Kammassadhamma. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from there.
<p>'Bhikkhus, sensuality is impermanent, useless, false, a stupid thing
and a deception. It is prattle and foolish talk. Sensuality here and now
and hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, all these
are the domain of death, the pasture of death. The evil mind with sensuality
is led to greed, anger and quarrels
<p>Bhikkhus. the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality is impermanent, useless,
false, a stupid thing and a deception. It is prattle and foolish talk.
Sensuality here and now and hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now
and hereafter, all these are the domain of death, the pasture of death.
The evil mind with sensuality is led to greed, anger and quarrels. What
if I develop the mind grown great and much, above the material world, then
there will be no greed, anger or quarrels. When these are dispelled my
mind will be significant, limitless and well developed. Fallen to this
method, when developped much, the mind, partakes pleasure in that sphere
or abides in imperturbability here and now, or with wisdom it is released.*1)
After death, there is a possibility that the led on, consciousness should
reach imperturbability. Bhikkhus, I say, this is the first suitability
to reach imperturbability.
<p>Again bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality here and now
and hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, whatever
matter of the four primary elements, is on account of this held on matter.*2)
Fallen to this method, when developped much, the mind, partakes pleasure
in that sphere or abides in imperturbability here and now, or with wisdom
it is released. After death, there is a possibility that the led on, consciousness
should reach imperturbability. Bhikkhus, I say, this is the second suitability
to reach imperturbability.
<p>Again bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality here and now
and hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, whatever
matter, here and now or hereafter, whatever material perceptions here and
now and here after, all these are impermanent. It is not suitable to take
pleasure and appropriate what is impermanent. Fallen to this method, when
developped much, the mind, partakes pleasure in that sphere or abides in
imperturbability here and now, or with wisdom it is released. After death,
there is a possibility that this led on, consciousness should reach imperturbability.
Bhikkhus, this is the third suitability to reach imperturbability, I say.
<p>Again bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality here and now
and hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, whatever
matter, here and now or hereafter, whatever material perceptions here and
now and here after and the perception of imperturbability, all these perceptions
cease in this sphere of nothingness, without a remainder. It is peaceful
and exalted. Fallen to this method, when developped much, the mind, partakes
pleasure in that sphere or abides in imperturbability here and now, or
with wisdom it is released. After death, there is a possibility that this
led on, consciousness should reach imperturbability. Bhikkhus, I say, this
is the first suitability to reach the sphere of nothingness.
<p>Again, bhikkhus, the noble disciple gone to the forest or to the root
of a tree reflects. All these are perceived things, of the self, or of
the belongings of the self.
<p>Fallen to this method, when developped much, the mind, partakes pleasure
in that sphere or abides in imperturbability here and now, or with wisdom
it is released. After death, there is a possibility that this led on, consciousness
should reach imperturbability. Bhikkhus, I say, this is the second suitability
to reach the sphere of nothingness.
<p>Again, bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflects, I have no greed, hate
or delusion for anybody, neither is there greed, hate and delusion to me
from anyone. Fallen to this method, when developped much, the mind, partakes
pleasure in that sphere or abides in imperturbability here and now, or
with wisdom it is released. After death, there is a possibility that this
led on, consciousness should reach imperturbability. Bhikkhus, I say, this
is the third suitability to reach the sphere of nothingness.
<p>Again Aananda, the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality here and now
and hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, whatever
matter, here and now or hereafter, whatever material perceptions here and
now and here after, the perception of imperturbability and the perception
of nothingness, all these perceptions cease in this sphere of neither perception
nor non-perception, without a remainder. It is peaceful and exalted. Fallen
to this method, when developped much, the mind, partakes pleasure in that
sphere or abides in neither perception nor non perception here and now,
or with wisdom it is released. After death, there is a possibility that
this led on, consciousness should reach the sphere of neither perception
nor non perception. Bhikkhus, I say, this is suitability to reach the sphere
of neither perception nor non perception.'
<p>Then venerable Aananda said. 'Venerable sir, the bhikkhu falls to this
method, there is not, there is not to me, there will not be, there will
not be to me, whatever there is, whatever produced, I discard, thus he
gains equanimity. Venerable sir, is that bhikkhu extinguished?'
<p>'Aananda, a certain bhikkhu fallen to this method may extinguish, another
would not.'
<p>'Venerable sir, why should a certain bhikkhu fallen to this method extinguish
and another not extinguish?'
<p>'Ananda, the bhikkhu falls to this method, there is not, there is not
to me, there will not be, there will not be to me, whatever there is, whatever
produced, I discard, thus he gains equanimity. He delights in that equanimity,
welcomes it, tied to it, his consciousness settles in it. Aananda, the
bhikkhu with settlements does not extinguish.'
<p>'Venerable sir, where does the bhikkhu setttle'
<p>'Aananda, in neither-perception-nor-non-perception.'
<p>'Venerable sir, he settles in the highest settlement.'
<p>'Aananda, of settlements neither-perception-nor non-perception, is the
highest settlement Ananda, the bhikkhu falls to this method, there is not,
there is not to me, there will not be, there will not be to me, whatever
there is, whatever produced, I discard, thus he gains equanimity. He does
not delight in that equanimity, does not welcome it, not tied to it his
consciousness does not settle in it. Aananda, the bhikkhu without settlements
is extinguished.'
<p>'Wonderful, venerable sir, the Blessed One has explained the crossing
of the flood supported on higher and higher spheres. Venerable sir, how
is noble release?'
<p>'Again Aananda, the noble disciple reflects. Sensuality here and now
and hereafter, sensual perceptions here and now and hereafter, whatever
matter, here and now or hereafter, whatever material perceptions here and
now and here after, the perception of imperturbability, the perception
of nothingness, and the sphere of neither perception nor non perception,
these are things of the self and are holdings, that mind without holdings
is the mind's release. Aananda, I have taught you the method to attain,
imperturbability, the sphere of nothingness, the sphere of neither perception-nor-non-perception,
the method of crossing the flood supported on higher and higher spheres
and the noble release. Whatever a teacher should do to his disciples out
of compassion, that I have done to you. Aananda, these are the roots of
trees, and these are the empty houses. Aananda, concentrate and do not
have remorse later. This is our advice to you.
<p>The Blessed One said those words and those bhikkhus delighted in the
words of the Blessed One.
