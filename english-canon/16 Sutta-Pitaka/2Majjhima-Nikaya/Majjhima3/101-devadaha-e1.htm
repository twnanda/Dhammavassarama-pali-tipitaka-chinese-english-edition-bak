<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU>I heard thus.At one time the Blessed
One was living in the Sakya hamlet Devadaha. From there the Blessed One
addressed the bhikkhus. ’Bhikkhus, there are recluses and Brahmins, who
hold this view and preach it. “Whatever this person feels, whether pleasant,
unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant, feelings, all those are
the results of earlier actions. These earlier actions are finished off
with austerities, new, are not done, thus there is no accumulation for
the future. Without a future accumulation, there is destruction of actions.
With the destruction of actions, there is destruction of unpleasantness.
With the destruction of unpleasantness, there is destruction of feelings.
With the destruction of feelings all unpleasantness finishes.” Bhikkhus,
Nigan.tas, are of this view. I approached the Nigan.tas of this view and
asked them. ’Friends, Nigan.tas, is it true, that you are of this view
Whatever this person feels, whether pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant
nor pleasant, feelings, all those are the results of earlier actions. These
earlier actions, are finished off with austerities, new are not done, thus
there is no accumulation for the future. Without a future accumulation,
there is destruction of actions. With the destruction of actions, there
is destruction of unpleasantness. With the destruction of unpleasantness,
there is destruction of feelings. With the destruction of feelings all
unpleasantness finishes? Bhikkhus, they acknowledged that it was true.
Then I asked them. ‘Nigan.tas, do you know, whether you were in the past,
or whether you were not in the past?’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

Nigan.tas, if you knew, we were in the past, and not otherwise. We did
demerit in the past and not otherwise. We did this and other demerit in
the past. This much unpleasantness is finished, this much has to be finished
and when this much unpleasantness is finished all unpleasantness finishes.
If you knew how to dispel demerit and accumulate merit here and now, it
is suitable that the venerable Nigan.tas should say. Whatever this person

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

Nigan.tas, it is like a man shot with a poisoned arrow, feels sharp unpleasant
feelings, on account of the shot arrow. His friends, co-associates and
blood relations call a surgeon to attend on him. The surgeon probes into
his open wound with an instrument. On account of that probing, he feels
sharp unpleasant feelings. He removes the arrow probing into the wound.
On account of removing the arrow, he feels sharp unpleasant feelings. The
surgeon administers burning charcoal on the wound as counter medicine.
On account of administering burning charcoal on the open wound he feels
sharp unpleasant feelings. In the meantime his wound heals, he becomes
well, independent and goes where he wishes. Then it occurs to him. I was
shot with a poisoned arrow and felt sharp unpleasant feelings on account
of it. My friends, co-associates and blood relations called a surgeon to
attend on me. He probed into my open wound with an instrument. On account
of that probing I felt sharp unpleasant feelings. Probing he removed the
arrow, on account of removing the arrow, I felt sharp unpleasant feelings.
Then he administered burning charcoal as counter medicine on my wound.
On account of that I felt sharp unpleasant feelings. Now my wound is healed,
I’m well, independent and go where I wish. Friends, Nigan.tas, if you knew,
we were in the past, and not otherwise. We did demerit in the past and
not otherwise. We did this and other demerit in the past. This much unpleasantness
is finished, this much has to be finished and when this much unpleasantness
is finished all unpleasantness finishes. If you knew how to dispel demerit
and accumulate merit here and now, it is suitable that the venerable Nigan.tas
should say. Whatever this person feels, whether pleasant, unpleasant or
neither unpleasant nor pleasant, feelings, all those are the results of
earlier actions. These earlier actions, are finished off with austerities,
new are not done, thus there is no accumulation for the future. Without
a future accumulation, there is destruction of actions. With the destruction
of actions, there is destruction of unpleasantness. With the destruction
of unpleasantness, there is destruction of feelings. With the destruction
of feelings all unpleasantness finishes Friends, Nigan.tas, since you do
not know, whether you were, or were not, in the past. Whether you did or
did not do demerit in the past. You do not know what and what demerit you
did in the past and how much unpleasantness, is finished, how much has
to be finished and when, how much of it is finished, all unpleasantness
finishes. You do not know to dispel demerit and accumulate merit here and
now. When that is so it is not suitable that the venerable Nigan.tas should
say. Whatever this person feels, whether pleasant, unpleasant or neither
unpleasant nor pleasant, feelings, all those are the results of earlier
actions. These earlier actions, are finished off with austerities, new
are not done, thus there is no accumulation for the future. Without a future
accumulation, there is destruction of actions. With the destruction of
actions, there is destruction of unpleasantness. With the destruction of
unpleasantness, there is destruction of feelings. With the destruction
of feelings all unpleasantness finishes.&nbsp;</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>When
this was said, the Nigan.tas said to me.’Friend, Nigan.tanaataputta acknowledges
he has knowledge and vision of everything, whether walking, standing, sleeping
or awake constantly established. He says thus. Nigan.tas, you have demerit
done in the past, finish that with these difficult austerities. Be restrained
in body, words and mind, so that no demerit is done for the future These
earlier actions, are finished off with austerities, new are not done, thus
there is no accumulation for the future. Without a future accumulation,
there is destruction of actions. With the destruction of actions, there
is destruction of unpleasantness. With the destruction of unpleasantness,
there is destruction of feelings. With the destruction of feelings all
unpleasantness finishes. We like these words, and are pleased with these
words.</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>When
this was said, I said to those Nigan.tas. ‘Friends, Nigan.tas, these five
are with twofold results, here and now. What are the five? Faith, liking,
hearsay, careful thinking and forbearance with view, are with twofold results
here and now. In which teacher did the venerable Nigan.tas’ place faith
in the past? What was their liking? What was their hearsay? How was their
careful thinking? With what view did they forbear? Bhikkhus, when I said
that, the Nigan.tas had no rightful thing to say. Then again, I said thus
to the Nigan.tas. ‘Friends, Nigan.tas, when do you feel acute severe pain,
is it when you pursue difficult exertions or when you do not pursue difficult
exertions?’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>‘Friend,
Gotama, when we pursue difficult exertions, we feel acute severe pain.
When we do not pursue difficult exertions, we do not feel acute severe
pain.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>‘So
then Nigan.tas, when you pursue difficult exertions, you feel acute, severe
pain and when you do not pursue difficult exertions, you do not feel acute
severe pain. When this is so, is it suitable that the Nigan.tas explain
it, as whatever this person feels, whether pleasant, unpleasant or neither
unpleasant nor pleasant, feelings, all those are the results of earlier
actions. These earlier actions, are finished off with austerities, new
are not pursued, thus there is no accumulation for the future. Without
a future accumulation, there is destruction of actions. With the destruction
of actions, there is destruction of unpleasantness. With the destruction
of unpleasantness, there is destruction of feelings. With the destruction
of feelings all unpleasantness finishes. If the venerable Nigan.tas feel
severe acute pain, at the time they pursue difficult exertions and at the
time they do not pursue difficult exertions, it is suitable that the venerable
Nigan.tas explain it, as whatever this person feels, whether pleasant,
unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant, feelings, all those are
the results of earlier actions. These earlier actions, are finished off
with austerities, new are not pursued, thus there is no accumulation for
the future. Without a future accumulation, there is destruction of actions.
With the destruction of actions, there is destruction of unpleasantness.
With the destruction of unpleasantness, there is destruction of feelings.
With the destruction of feelings all unpleasantness finishes Nigan.tas,
when you pursue difficult exertions, you feel acute, severe pain and when
you do not pursue difficult exertions, you do not feel acute severe pain.
You, yourself pursue these difficult exertions and work them out owing
to ignorance and delusion. Even when this was pointed out the Nigan.tas
had nothing to say rightfully.</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

again I asked the Nigan.tas. ‘Nigan.tas, actions with feelings here and
now, could they be made actions with feelings hereafter by some method,
or exertion?’&nbsp;</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

then Nigan.tas, it is not possible to change actions with feelings here

how does the method and the exertion become fruitful?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhikkhus,
the bhikkhu does not soil the unsoiled self with unpleasantness, does not
abandon pleasantness rightfully obtained, nor does he indulge in that pleasantness.
He knows, when I exert on determinations that originate unpleasantness,
those determinants separate. When I observe carefully the origin of my
unpleasantness, and develop equanimity, my mind gets detached. In whatever
manner I exert on the determinations that originate unpleasantness, those
determinants separate, there the exertion is on the determinations. In
whatever manner I observe, the origin of my unpleasantness, equanimity
develops in that manner. Thus when the exertion is on determinations that

his unpleasantness finishes. When the origin of this and other unpleasantness
is observed equanimity develops and detachment sets in. In this manner
too unpleasantness finishes.&nbsp;</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

like a man thoroughly attached and bound to a woman, with many desires

demerit decreases and merit increases. Later he does not exert the self
in unpleasantness. What is the reason for that?&nbsp;</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU>For whatever, he exerted the self
in unpleasantness, that cause is fulfilled, so later he does not exert
the self in unpleasantness. Bhikkhus, like the fletcher, that straightens
and makes the arrow workable with the two kinds of torture of burning and
hammering on it. When the arrow is straightened the fletcher does no more
torture of burning and hammering it as it is made workable. Thus the bhikkhu
reflects in this manner. If I abide in pleasantness, demerit increases
and merit decreases. If I exert the self in unpleasantness, demerit decreases
and merit increases. Then he exerts the self in unpleaslantness, and his
demerit decreases and merit increases. Later he does not exert the self
in unpleasantness. What is the reason for that? For whatever, he exerted
the self in unpleasantness, that cause is fulfilled, so later he does not
exert the self in unpleasantness. In this manner too the method and the

the Thus Gone One arises in the world, perfect, rightfully enlightened,
endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, knower of the worlds, the
incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, Teacher of gods and men, enlightened
and blessed. He declares to the world together with its Maaras, Brahmaas,
the community of recluses and brahmins gods and men, that Teaching good
at the beginning, in the middle and at the end, full of meaning even in
the letter, complete in every way stating the pure holy life. Hearing this
a householder or a householder’s son, born to some clan, gains faith in
the Thus Gone One. With that faith he reflects. The life in a household
is full of defilements, going forth is like open space. It is not easy
for one living a household to lead the holy life complete and pure without
defilements. What if I shave head and beard, don yellow robes and go forth
homeless. Later he gives up a little wealth, or much wealth, a small circle
of friends, or a large circle of friends, shaving head and beard, and donning
yellow robes goes forth homeless.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Gone
forth he becomes a trainer in the life of a bhikkhu, gives up hurting living
things, throwing away stick and weapon, ashamed and compassion aroused,
abides with compassion for all beings. Abstaining from taking what is not
given, desires the given, the self made pure without thieving he abides.
Abstaining from low sexual intercourse leads the holy life.Abstaining from
telling lies becomes reliable and trustworthy and abides without a dispute
with the world. Giving up slandering, hearing here does not say it elsewhere,
to split these, hearing elsewhere does not say it here to split those.
Thus he unites the split, promotes unity, fond of unity talks words to
unite. Giving up rough talk, says pleasant words pleasing to the ears,
and words going straight to the heart of the populace at large. Abstains
from frivolous talk. Says appropriate words, that are truthful, meaningful,
in accordance with the Teaching and Discipline, those words that could
be treasured.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

from destroying seed groups and vegetable groups. Partaking one meal a
day, abstains from food at night and at untimely hours. Abstains from dance,

Abstains from high and stately beds. Abstains from accepting gold and silver,
uncooked rice and uncooked flesh,. Abstains from accepting women and girls,
slaves, men or women, Abstains from accepting goats and cows, fowl and

Abstains from cutting, severing, destroying, highway robbery, and wrong
ways of obtaining morsel food.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Satisfied,
covering the body with robes, and feeding the belly with morsel food, goes
with all the belongings wherever he goes. Like the birds small and large
that go with the weight of their wings. Likewise satisfied covering the
body with robes and feeding the belly with morsel food, goes with all the
belongings wherever he goes. Endowed with this mass of virtues, he experiences
the pleasure of blamelessness internally. Seeing a form with the eye, does
not take the sign or the elements .To him that abides with the mental faculty
of the eye uncontrolled, may trickle demeritorious things of covetousness<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>and

he abides protecting the mental faculty of the mind. Endowed with the noble
ones’ control of the mental faculties, he experiences the untouched pleasure
of the mental faculties(1). Coming forward and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>returning

a mountain grotto or cave, a charnel ground, a jungle forest, an open space,
or a heap straw.. Returning from the alms round and after the meal is over,

Dispelling sloth and torpor he abides, mindful and aware of a perception
of light, mindfully cleaning sloth and torpor from the mind. Dispelling
restlessness and worry he abides with a mind internally appeased and cleans
the mind of restlessness and worry. Abides with doubts dispelled without
doubts of meritorious things that should be done

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>The
bhikkhu having dispelled the five hindrances of the mind, making the minor
defilements weak through wisdom, away from sensual thoughts and away from
demeritorious things, with thoughts and thought processes and with joy
and pleasantness<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>born of seclusion
abides in the first jhaana. In this manner too the method and the exertion
becomes fruitful. Again bhikkhus, the bhikkhu overcominng thoughts and
thought processes, the mind internally appeased, brought to a single point,
without thoughts and thought processes and with joy and pleasantness born
of concentration abides in the second jhaana. In this manner too the method
and the exertion becomes fruitful. Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu with equanimity
to joy and detachment abides mindful and aware, experiencing pleasantness
with the body abides in the third jhaana. To this the noble ones say abiding
in pleasanatness mindful of equanimity. In this manner too the method and
exertion becomes fruitful. Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu dispelling pleasantness
and unpleasantness and earlier having dispelled pleasure and displeasure,
and mindfulness purified with equanimity abides in the fourth jhaana. In
this manner too the method and exertion becomes fruitful.

These good beings misbehaving by body, speech and mind, blaming noble ones,
with the wrong view of actions, after death are born in loss, in decrease,
in hell. As for these good beings, well behaved in body speech and mind

The Teaching of the Blessed One is well proclaimed, the Community of bhikkhus
