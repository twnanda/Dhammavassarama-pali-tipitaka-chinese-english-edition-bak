<p><b>(107) III.I. 7. Ganakamoggallaanasutta.m</b>
<p><b>To the brahmin Ganakamoggaallaana</b></center>

<p>I heard thus.
<p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the Pubba monastery of Migaara’s
mother in Saavatthi. The brahmin Ganakamoggallaana approached the Blessed
One exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side and said thus to the Blessed
One. ‘Venerable sir, as it is seen in the palace of Migaara’s mother, right
from the lowest step of the staircase, this gradual, training, work and
method. It is also seen in education and archery. As for me, I train my
pupils, to count in ones, in twos, threes, fours, fives, sixes, sevens,
eights, nines, tens and even in hundreds. Venerable sir, do we find the
same gradual, training, work and method in the Dispensation too?’
<p>‘Brahmin, the gradual, training, work and method could also be shown
in this Dispensation. Like a clever trainer of horses getting a young thoroughbred
to be trained, would first train it in the bit of the bridle and would
give the later training. In the same manner the Thus Gone One training
a person would tell him. Come bhikkhu be virtuous, abiding by the higher
code of rules, practise the right conduct, seeing fear in the slightest
fault.When the bhikkhu practises right conduct, seeing fear in the slightest
fault, the Thus Gone One gives him a further training. Come bhikkhu protect
your doors of mental contact. Seeing a form do not take the sign or details.
To one abiding not protecting the mental faculty of the eye, evil desires
of covetousness and displeasure may arise, fall to its control. Hearing
a sound, ...re..... scenting a smell, ...re....enjoying a taste, ...re....
experiencing a touch with the body,...re.... and cognizing an idea in the.mind.do
not take the sign or details. To one abiding not protecting the mental
contact of the mind, evil desires of covetousness and displeasure may arise,
fall to its control. Brahmin, when the bhikkhu is protected in his doors
of mental contact, the Thus Gone One gives him a further training. Come
bhikkhu, know the right amount to partake of food. Partake food reflecting,
it is not, for play, for intoxication, or to look beautiful, but for the
upkeep of the body. Not for the enjoyment of soups but to lead the holy
life. Reflect I will put an end to earlier feelings, will not arouse new,
for a faultless pleasant abiding. Brahmin, when the bhikkhu knows the right
amount to partake of food, the Thus Gone One gives him a further training.
Come bhikkhu abide wakeful. During the day, sit in the cankamana and clean
the mind of hindering things. .In the first watch of the night sit in the
cankamana and clean the mind of hindering things. In the middle watch of
the night turn to the right, making the lion’s posture, place one foot
over the other and with the perception of waking go to sleep. In the last
watch of the night, sit in the cankamana and clean the mind of hindering
things. When the bhikkhu is yoked to wakefulness, the Thus Gone One gives
him a further training. Come bhikkhu be endowed with mindful awareness.
Be mindful when approaching and receeding, looking on and looking about,
bending and stretching, bearing the three robes and bowl, enjoying, drinking,
eating and tasting, urinating and extreting, when going, standing, sitting
and lying until awake. Be mindful when talking and keeping silence. When
the bhikkhu is endowed with mindful awareess, the Thus Gone One gives a
further training. Come bhikkhu abound a secluded dwelling. Abound a forest,
the root of a tree, a mountain grotto, a charnel ground, a jungle path,
an open space or a leaves hut. Then he abounds a forest, the root of a
tree, a mountain grotto, a charnel ground, a jungle path, an open space
or a leaves hut. After the meal, he sits cross legged, with the body errect
and mindfulness established in front of him. He abides dispelling the coveting
mind and cleans the mind of coveting thoughts. He abides dispelling the
angry mind and cleans the mind of angry thoughts, with compassion for all
living things. Dispelling sloth and torpor he abides mindful and aware
of a perception of light to dispel sloth and torpor. He abides dispelling
restlessness and worry, internally appeased cleans the mind of restlessness
and worry. Abides dispelling doubts about merits that should be done and
should not be done and cleans the mind of doubts.
<p>Dispelling the five hindrances and wisely making the finer defilements
of the mind weak, he secludes the mind from sensual and evil thoughts.
With thoughts and thought processes and with joy and pleasantness born
of seclusion he abides in the first jhaana. Overcoming thoughts and thought
processes, the mind internally appeased and settled in one point, and with
joy and pleasantness born of concentration, he abides in the second jhaana.
Abiding mindful and aware of equanimity to joy and detachment, experiences
pleasantness with the body too,*1) and abides in the third jhaana. To this,
the noble ones say mindfully abiding in pleasantness with equanimity. Dispelling
pleasantness and unpleasantness and earlier havig dispelled pleasure and
displeasure, purifying mindfulness with equanimity attains to the fourth
jhaana. Brahmin, this is our advice to the trainer bhikkhu who is yet to
attain the noble end of the yoke. As for those bhikkhus, who are arahants,
with desires destroyed, the holy life lived, done what should be done,
the weight dismissed, attained to the highest good, the bond ‘to be’ destroyed.are
rightfully released. To them these things, become pleasant abidings here
and now.with mindful awareness.’
<p>The brahmin Ganakamoggallaana then said thus to the Blessed One.’Good
Gotama, thus instructed and advised do all these disciples realize highest
enligtenment or do some realize and others not realize highest enlightenment?’
<p>‘Some of my disciples thus instructed and advised realize highest enlightenment
and others do not.’
<p>‘Good Gotama, when there is enlightenment, the path to enlightenment
and good Gotama, the instructor, of the disciples instructed and advised
why should some realize highest enlightenment and others not realize highest
enlightenment?’
<p>‘Brahmin, I will counter question you on this and reply as it pleases
you. ‘Are you clever in stating the road to Raajagaha?’
<p>‘Yes, good sir, I’m clever in stating the road to Raajagaha.’
<p>‘A man who wants to go to Raajagaha approaches you and asks how could
I get to Raajagaha, may it be explained to me. Then you tell him, good
man, this is the road to Raajagaha, go a while on this road, then you come
to the village of this name, then proceed along the road for a while, then
you come to the hamlet of this name, when you go along that road a while
you will see the pleasant forests, parklands and ponds of Raajagaha. That
man thus instructed and advised by you take the opposite direction. Then
a second man who wants to go to Raajagaha approaches you and asks how could
I get to Raajagaha, may it be explained to me. Then you tell him, good
man, this is the road to Raajagaha, go a while on this road, then you come
to the village of this name, then proceed along the road for a while, then
you come to the hamlet of this name, when you go a while along that road,
you will see the pleasant forests, parklands and ponds of Raajagaha. That
man thus instructed and advised by you, safely reach Raajagaha. Brahmin,
when Raajagaha is there, the road to Raajagaha is there and the adviser
and instructor is there, why should one take the opposite direction and
go the wrong way and the other safely reach Raajagaha?’
<p>‘Good Gotama, I’m only the instructor of the path.’
<p>‘Brahmin, in the same manner, when there is enlightenment, the path
to enlightenment and when I’m there to advise, my disciples thus advised
and instructed by me a certain one realizes highest enlightenment and a
certain one does not realize highest enlightenment. What could be done,
the Thus Gone One is only the instructor of the path..’
<p>Then the brahmin Ganakamoggallaana said to the Blessed One. ‘Good Gotama,
those without faith, have left the household and become homeless for the
purpose of a livelihood, crafty and fraudulent, trained deceivers puffed
up and noisy, not steady and talkative, not controlled in the mental faculties
not knowing the right amount to partake of food, not yoked to wakefulness,
not desirous of the recluseship, not honouring the training, living in
abundance and lethargic, become lazy has given up the yoke to seclusion,
without mindful awareness, not concentrated and not wise should not live
with good Gotama. The sons of clansmen, who have left the household and
become homeless out of faith not crafty and fraudulent, not trained deceivers,
not puffed up and noisy, steady and not talkative, controlled in the mental
faculties knowing the right amount to partake of food, yoked to wakefulness,
desirous of the recluseship, honouring the training, not living in abundance
and not lethargic, with aroused effort for dispelling not given up the
yoke to seclusion, with mindful awareness, concentrated and wise should
live with good Gotama. Of the scent of roots, the Kaalaanusaarikaa is the
foremost, of the scent of heartwoods the red ungent is the foremost and
of the scent of flowers the Vassika is the foremost, in the same way good
Gotama’s advice is the highest of the Teachings of today. Now I understand
good Gotama, it is as something overturned is reinstalled, something covered
is made manifest, as the path was told to someone who has lost his way.
It is as though an oil lamp was lighted, for the darkness, for those who
have sight to see forms. In various.ways the Teaching is explained, now
I take refuge in good Gotama, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus.
May I be remembered as a lay disciple who has taken refuge in good Gotama,
from today until end of life.’
<p>Notes.1..Abiding mindful and aware of equanimity to joy and detachment,
experiences pleasantness with the body too. ‘piitiyaaca viraagaa ca upekhako
viharati sato sampajaano sukha~nca kaayena pa.tisanvedeti’ The bhikkhu
abiding in the third jhaana is mindful and aware of equanimity to all feelings
that rise and fade with data through the six doors of mental contact. So
he develops equanimity to joy and detachment. This is an internal appeasement
enjoyed while in that jhaana. It becomes a pleasantness.enjoyed at all
times by the arahants. . . .
