<p>I heard thus.
<p>At one time the Blessed One lived with the Sakyas in Nigrodha’s monastery
in Kapilavatthu. Then Mahapajaapati Gotamii taking a set of new clothes
approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said. ‘Venerable
sir to make this set of clothes for the Blessed One I spun and wove the
cloth. May the Blessed One accept this set of clothes from me, out of compassion.’
The Blessed One said. ’Gotamii, offer it to the Community. When offered
to the Community, it will be offered to me as well.’ For the second time
Mahapajaapati Gotamii said ‘Venerable sir to make this set of clothes for
the Blessed One, I spun and wove the cloth. May the Blessed One accept
this set of clothes from me, out of compassion.’ For the second time the
Blessed One said. ’Gotamii, offer it to the Community. When offered to
the Community, it will be offered to me as well.’ For the third time Mahapajaapati
Gotamii said ‘Venerable sir to make this set of clothes for the Blessed
One I spun and wove the cloth. May the Blessed One accept this set of clothes
from me, out of compassion.’ For the third time the Blessed One said. ’Gotamii,
offer it to the Community. When offered to the Community, it will be offered
to me as well.’
<p>Hearing this venerable Aananda said to the Blessed One.’Venerable sir,
accept the set of new clothes from Mahapajaapatii Gotami. She was of much
help to you, as stepmother, supporter, the one who fed milk, when the Blessed
One’s mother died. The Blessed One too was of great help to Mahapajaapati
Gotamii Come to the Blessed One she took refuge in the Enlightenment, in
the Teaching and the Community. Come to the Blessed One she abstained from,
taking the life of living things, taking what is not given, misbehaving
sexually, telling lies and taking intoxicating drinks. Come to the Blessed
One Mahapajaapati Gotami got established in unwavering faith in Enlightenment,
in the Teaching and the Community. Come to the Blessed One Mahajaapati
Gotamii dispelled doubts about the truth of unpleasantness, its arising,
its cessation and the path and method leading to its cessation. Thus the
Blessed One was of great help to Mahapajaapati Gotami’
<p>‘That is so. Aananda, if a person come to another person, took refuge
in the Enlightenment, the Teaching and the Community. I say the gratitude
he has to return to that second person, is not repaid by joining hands
in veneration, getting up and offering a seat on arrival, exchanging pleasant
conversation and offering robes, morsel food, dwellings and requisites
when ill. Aananda, if a person come to another person, abstained, from
taking the life of living things, taking what is not given, misbehaving
sexually, telling lies and taking intoxicating drinks. I say the gratitude
he has to return to that second person, is not repaid by joining hands
in veneration, getting up and offering a seat on arrival, exchanging pleasant
conversation and offering robes, morsel food, dwellings and requisites
when ill. Aananda, if a person come to another person, is established in
unwavering faith in the Enlightenment, the Teaching and the Community.
I say the gratitude he has to return to that second person, is not repaid
by joining hands in veneration, getting up and offering a seat on arrival,
exchanging pleasant conversation and offering robes, morsel food, dwellings
and requisites when ill. Aananda, if a person meeting another person, became
virtuous. I say the gratitude he has to return to that second person, is
not repaid by joining hands in veneration, getting up and offering a seat
on arrival, exchanging pleasant conversation and offering robes, morsel
food, dwellings and requisites when ill. Aananda, if a person, met another
person and dispelled his doubts about the Enlightenment, the Teaching and
the Community. I say the gratitude he has to return to that second person,
is not repaid by joining hands in veneration, getting up and offering a
seat on arrival, exchanging pleasant conversation and offering robes, morsel
food, dwellings and requisites when ill.
<p>Aananda, there are fourteen personal offerings that could be made. An
offering made to the Thus Gone One, worthy and rightfully enlightened is
the first personal offering. An offering made to the silent Enlightened
One, is the second personal offering. An offering made to a worthy disciple,*1)
is the third personal offering. An offering made to a person fallen to
the method of realizing worthiness, *2) is the fourth personal offering.
An offering made to a non-returner,*3) is the fifth personal offering.
An offering made to a person fallen to the method of realizing the state
of non-returning is the sixth personal offering. An offering made to one,
returning once,*4) is the seventh personal offering. An offering made to
a person fallen to the method of realizing the state of returning once
is the eighth personal offering. An offering made to one who has entered
the stream of the Teaching is the ninth personal offering. An offering
made to a person fallen to the method of realizing the state of entry into
the stream of the Teaching is the tenth personal offering. An offering
made to one, not greedy and turned away from sensuality is the eleventh
personal offering. An offering made to an ordinary virtuous person is the
twelfth personal offering. An offering made to an ordinary not virtuous
person is the thirteenth personal offering. An offering made to an animal
is the fourteenth personal offering. .
<p>Aananda, of an offering made to an animal the results expected are by
hundreds. Of an offering made to an ordinary not virtuous person the results
expected are by thousands. Of an offering made to an ordinary virtuous
person the results expected are by hundred -thousands Of an offering made
to a not greedy one, turned away from sensuality the results expected are
by hundred thousand millions. Of an offering made to a person fallen to
the method of realizing the state of entry into the stream of the Teaching,
the results expected are innumerable and unlimited. What would be the results
for offering a gift to a stream entrant of the Teaching? Or one fallen
to the method of realizing the state of not returning? Or one who would
not return? Or one fallen to the method of realizing worthiness? Or a worthy
disciple of the Thus Gone One? Or the silent enlightened One? Or the worthy,
rightfully enlightened Thus Gone One?
<p>. Aananda, these seven are the offerings made to the Community. An offering
to both bhikkhus and bhikkhunis headed by the Blessed One. This is the
first offering made to the Community. After the demise of the Blessed One,
an offering made to both bhikkhus and bhikkhunis. This is the second offering
made to the Community. An offering made to the bhikkhus. This is the third
offering to the Community. An offering made to the bhikkhunis. This is
the fourth offering to the Community. An offering made indicating the number
of bhikkhus and bhikkhunis. This is the fifth offering to the Community.
An offering made indicating the number of bhikkhus. This is the sixth offering
to the Community. An offering made indicating the number of bhikkhunis.
This is the seventh offering to the Community.
<p>Aananda, in the future there will be the last bhikkhus in the lineage,
not virtuous with evil things, wearing yellow strings round their necks.
I say, even the results of an offering made to them on account of the Community
is innumerable and limitless. I would not tell you, how an offering made
to the Community is more fruitful than a personal offering.
<p>Aananda, there are four kinds of purity in an offering. An offering
is pure, on the side of the donor, not the receiver. An offering is pure,
on the side of the receiver, not the donor. An offering is neither pure
on the side of the donor, nor the receiver. An offering is pure, on the
side of the donor, as well as the receiver.
<p>Aananda, how is the offering pure, on the side of the donor and not
the receiver? Here the donor is virtuous with good thoughts, the receiver
is not virtuous with evil thoughts. Thus the offering is pure, on the side
of the donor and not the receiver.
<p>Aananda, how is the offering pure, on the side of the receiver and not
the donor? Here the receiver is virtuous with good thoughts, the donor
is not virtuous with evil thoughts. Thus the offering is pure, on the side
of the receiver and not the donor.
<p>Aananda, how is the offering neither pure on the side of the donor nor
the receiver? Here the donor is not virtuous with evil thoughts and the
receiver is not virtuous with evil thoughts. Thus the offering is neither
pure, on the side of the donor nor the receiver
<p>Aananda, how is the offering pure on the side of the donor as well as
the receiver? Here the donor is virtuous with good thoughts and the receiver
is virtuous with good thoughts. Thus the offering is pure, on the side
of the donor as well as the receiver.’
<p>The Blessed One said. ‘These are the four kinds of purity and further
said
<p>A virtuous donor offers to one without virtues, things obtained righteously,
with a pleasant mind,
<p>Believing the results of actions. That offering is purified on the side
of the donor.
<p>A not virtuous donor offers to the virtuous, things not obtained righteously,
with an unpleasant mind,
<p>Disbelieving the results of actions. That offering is purified on the
side of the receiver
<p>A not virtuous donor offers to the not virtuous, things not obtained
righteously, with an unpleasant mind,
<p>Disbelieving the results of actions. That offering is not purified on
either side.
<p>A virtuous donor offers to the virtuous, things obtained righteously,
with a pleasant mind,
<p>Believing the results of actions. I say, that offering brings great
results
<p>One not greedy offers to those not greedy, things obtained righteously,
with a pleasant mind,
<p>Believing the results of actions. I say, that is the highest material
offering ‘
<p>Notes. 1. An offering made to a worthy disciple of the Thus Gone One.
’Tathaagatasaavake arahante daana.m deti’ A worthy disciple of the Thus
Gone One has attained the noble state ‘arahatta’ which he aims to attain
<p>2. A person fallen to the method of realizing worthiness.’Arahattaphalasacchikiriyaaya
pa.tipanne.’ Before attaining worthiness the bhikkhu has to make much effort
to attain worthiness.
<p>3. An offering made to a non-returner. ‘Anaagaamissa daana.m deti.’
A non-returner would not be born in the sensual world, to enjoy the five
strands of sensual pleasures.
<p>4. An offering made to one returning once. ‘Sakadaagaamissa daana.m
deti.’ A certain one is born in this world only once, to fulfil a certain
aspiration.
