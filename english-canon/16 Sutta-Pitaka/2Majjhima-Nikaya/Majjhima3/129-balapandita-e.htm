heard thus.At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by
Anaathapindika in Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi. The Blessed One addressed

these three are the marks, characteristics and attainments of the fool.
What are the three? The fool has foolish thoughts, foolish words and foolish
actions.If the fool was not with foolish thoughts, words and actions, how
are the wise to know this good person is a fool, an unworthy one. Since
the fool thinks, speaks and acts foolishly, the wise know he is a fool.
The fool experiences unpleasantness and displeasure here and now in three
ways. Bhikkhus, if the fool is with a crowd, in the street corner or a
junction, and if the people there were talking some current topic, and
if he destroyed living things, took the not given, misbehaved sexually,
told lies and took intoxicating drinks, it occurs to him. These things
the people are talking are evident in me too. This is the first instance
that the fool experiences unpleasantness and displeasure.<o:p></o:p></span>

style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Again,
bhikkhus, the fool sees an offender taken hold by the king and given various
kinds of torture caned and wipped, flogged with the jungle rope, flogged
with the soiled stick, hands severed, legs severed, or both hands and legs
severed, ears and nose severed, put in the boiling gruel pot, shell tonsured,
put in Raahu’s mouth, garlanded with the blazing garland, hands scorched,
the bark dress given, put with snakes, putting hooks in the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>flesh,
cutting pieces of flesh from the body, driving a spike from ear to ear,
beating to make the body like straw, immersing in the boiling oil, giving
to the dogs to be eaten, raising on a spike alive until death, and cutting
the neck with the sword. Bhikkhus, then it occurs to the fool, for the
reason of doing evil this robber, evil doer is punished. If the king gets
hold of me, I too will be subjected<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>to
these same punishments. This is the second instance that the fool experiences
unpleasantness and displeasure.<o:p></o:p></span>

bhikkhus, when the fool is relaxed on a chair, on the bed or on a cover
on the floor, he thinks of his misbehaviours by body, speech and mind.
At such times they press on him heavily. Like the shadow of a huge mountain
peak, would fall on the earth heavily in the evening..In the same manner<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>when
the fool is relaxed on a chair, on the bed or on a cover on the floor,
he thinks of his misbehaviours by body, speech and mind. At such times
they press on him heavily. Bhikkhus, then it occurs to the fool. I did
not do good and merit. Didn’t dispel the fear of the frightened, did evil
bloody faults and later I will reap their results. He grieves, laments,
beats his breast and comes to bewilderment of mind. Bhikkhus, this is the
third instance that the fool experiences unpleasantness and displeasure.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span>

bhikkhu. An evil doer, a robber is taken hold and shown to the king and
is told. Great king, this is a robber, an evil doer, mete the suitable
punishment to him. Then the king would say.’Good one, whip this person
six thousand times in the morning.’ He is whipped six thousand times in
the morning. In the mid day the king would ask ‘Good one, how is that man?’
‘Great king he is alive as he was.’ Then the king would say.’Good one,
whip this person six thousand times in the mid day.’ He is whipped six
thousand times in the mid day. In the evening the king would ask ‘Good
one, how is that man?’ ‘Great king he is alive as he was.’ Then the king
would say.’Good one, whip this person six thousand times in the evening.’
He is whipped six thousand times in the evening. Bhikkhus. would that man
whipped six thousand times three times a day feel unpleasant and displeased?’<o:p></o:p></span>

as a comparison, not even as a quarter, nor even as a sign for the unpleasantness
and displeasure experienced in hell. The warders of hell give him the fivefold
binding. That is two hot iron spikes are sent through his two palms, and
two other hot spikes are sent through his two feet and the fifth hot iron
spike is sent through his chest. On account of this he experiences sharp
piercing unpleasant feelings. Yet he does not die, until his demerit finishes.
Next the warders of hell conduct him and hammer him<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>On

Yet he does not die, until his demerit finishes. Next the warders of hell
yoke him to a cart and make him go to and fro on a ground that is flaming

feelings. Yet he does not die, until his demerit finishes. Next the warders
of hell make him ascend and descend a rock of burning ambers On account
of this he experiences sharp piercing unpleasant feelings. Yet he does

the warders of hell throw him to the Great Hell. Bhikkhus, the Great Hell
is square and has four gates. It’s divided into two and is enclosed with
an iron wall. The top is closed with an iron lid. The floor spreads upto

the consecrated warrior king on the full moon day washes his hair, bathes

and observes the eight precepts, on the top most storey of his palace,
the heavenly wheel treasure appears to him, with the thousandfold spokes,
axle and nob, complete in every way. Have I become the Universal Monarch?
Then the consecrated warrior king getting up from his seat, takes the golden
water spout in his left hand and the wheel treasure in his right hand sprinkles
water on the good wheel treasure. Bhikkhus, then the wheel treasure goes
to the east even without a word, together with the king and the fourfold
army. In whatever region the wheel treasure stops, there the king and the
fourfold army dwells.The subordinate kings in the east approach the Universal
Monarch and tell him. ‘Welcome great king, you have come at the right time,
advise us’ The Universal Monarch says.’Life should not be destroyed, the
not given should not be taken, sexual misconduct should not be, lies should
not be told and intoxicating drinks should not be taken. Enjoy your kingships
