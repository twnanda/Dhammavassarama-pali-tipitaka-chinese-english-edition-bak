heard thus.At one time the Blessed One was living in the squirrels’ sanctuary
in the bamboo grove in Raajagaha. At that time venerable Samaddhi lived
in a remote dwelling. The wandering ascetic Potaliyaputta wandering and
walking for exercise approached venerable Samiddhi, exchanged friendly
greetings and sat on a side. Then the wandering ascetic Potaliyaputta said.’Friend
Samiddhi, this I heard from the recluse Gotama and he acknowledged it.
Bodily actions are valueless, so too verbal actions, only mental actions
are valuable. Is there an abiding attained to which someone does not feel
anything?’<o:p></o:p></span>

after the wandering ascetic Potaliyaputta had gone away, venerable Samiddhi
approached venerable Aananda, exchanged frienly greetings, sat on a side

have to see the Blessed One on account of this conversation. Let us approach

taken place. This foolish man Samiddhi has given a one sided reply, to
a question that needed an explanatory reply.’<o:p></o:p></span>

the Blessed One addressed venerable Aananda: ‘Aananda, do you see the side
track of this foolish man Udaayi? From the beginning I knew that foolish
Udaayi would intrude unwisely. Aananda, the wandering ascetic Potaliyaputta
had earlier asked about the three feelings. If this foolish man Samiddhi
had explained to the wandering ascetic thus. Friend Potaliyaputta, doing
intentional actions with pleasant feelings, by body, speech and mind, he
feels pleasant. Doing intentional actions with unpleasant feelings, by
body, speech and mind, he feels unpleasant. Doing intentional actions with
neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings, by body, speech and mind, he
feels neither unpleasant nor pleasant. If he had explained it thus, he
would have explained it correctly. Yet Aananda, how are these foolish wandering
ascetics of other sects to understand the Thus Gone One’s detailed classification
of actions. If you would listen to it I will explain.’<o:p></o:p></span>

1. Thus Aananda, there is impossible action, impossible to shine forth,<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>there
is impossible action, possible to shine forth,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>there
is possible action, possible to shine forth and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>there
is possible action, impossible to shine forth ‘Iti kho Aananda, atthi kamma.m
abhabba.m abhabbaabhaasa.m; atthi kamma.m abhabba.m bhabbaabhaasa.m; atthi
kamma.m bhabba.m<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>c’eva bhabbaabhaasa.m;
atthi kamma.m bhabba.m abhabbaabhaasa.m ti’ The most important point in
the Detailed Classification of actions is, that intention matters everything
to one’s actions, and much of the results of actions are experienced here
and now, or in the next birth or in a subsequent birth<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Since
intention is so very important, we should know that mere intending would
not carry us across.eg We may aspire extinction, but without that effort
and endeavour and without turning our foot steps towards it, it is not
possible. These are impossible actions, impossible to shine forth. There
are times when these impossible actions shine forth, when the necessary
effort and endeavour are put into it. Then there are actions that begin
at the six doors of mental contact, which we could.handle efficiently and
arrive at the results here and now. Thus there are possible actions, possible
to shine forth. These same are sometimes unable to shine forth, as it happened
to venerable Angulimaala. He did not experience the results of his evil
actions, as he over rode them, and extinguished.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span>
