heard thus.At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered
by Anaathapindika in Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi. The Blessed One addressed
the bhikkhus from there. ‘Bhikkhus I will give the point by point classification,
listen attentively.’ Those bhikkhus agreed and the Blessed One said thus.
‘Bhikkhus, in whatever manner the bhikkhu examines, he finds his external
consciousness is not scattered, internally is not settled and without a
holding is not worried. Bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu’s external consciousness
is not scattered, internally is not settled and without a holding is not
worried, there would not be to him future arisings of birth, decay, death

and asked this. Then those bhikkhus approached venerable Mahaakaccaana,
exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side and said. ‘Friend, Kaccaana,
the Blessed One gave this short exposition and without giving the detailed
