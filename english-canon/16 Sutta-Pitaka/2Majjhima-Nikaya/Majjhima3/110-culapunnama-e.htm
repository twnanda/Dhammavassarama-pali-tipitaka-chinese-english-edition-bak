<p><b>(110) III.I.10. Cuulapu.n.nmasutta.m</b>
<p><b>The shorter discourse on the full moon night</b></center>

<p>I heard thus.
<p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the Pubba monastery, the palace
of Migaara’s mother, in Saavatthi. On that full moon night of the fifteenth
day the Blessed One sat in the open, attended by the Community of bhikkhus.
Then the Blessed One observed the silent Community of bhikkhus and addressed
them. ‘Bhikkhus, does the unworthy one know the unworthy one, as this good
one is unworthy?’*1)
<p>‘No, venerable sir, he does not know that.’
<p>‘Good! Bhikkhus, it is not possible that the unworthy one should know
the unworthy one, as this good one is unworthy. Bhikkhus, does the unworthy
one know the worthy one, as this good one is worthy?’
<p>‘No, venerable sir, he does not know that.’
<p>‘Good! Bhikkhus, it is not possible that the unworthy one should know
the worthy one, as this good one is worthy. Bhikkhus, the unworthy one
is endowed with unworthy qualities, unworthy devotion, thoughts, musings,
words, actions and views and gives gifts that are unworthy. Bhikkhus, how
is the unworthy one endowed with unworthy qualities? Bhikkhus, the unworthy
one has no faith, shame and remorse. Has learned little, is forgetful and
without wisdom. Thus the unworthy one is endowed with unworthy qualities.Bhikkhus,
how is the unworthy one with unworthy devotion? Bhikkhus, the unworthy
one becomes friendly with those without faith, shame, remorse, with little
learning, forgetful and without wisdom. Thus the unworthy one is with unworthy
devotion. Bhikkhus, how is the unworthy one with unworthy thoughts? Bhikkhus,
the uworthy one thinks to trouble himself, thinks to trouble others and
thinks to trouble both. Thus the unworthy one thinks unworthily. Bhikkhus,
how is the unworthy one with unworthy musings? Bhikkhus, the uworthy one
muses to trouble himself, muses to trouble others and muses to trouble
both. Thus the unworthy one muses unworthily. Bhikkhus, how is the unworthy
one with unworthy words? Bhikkhus, the unworthy one tells lies, talks maliciously,
talks roughly, and talks frivolously. Thus the unworthy one is with unworthy
words.Bhikkhus, how is the unworthy one with unworthy actions? Bhikkhus,
the unworthy one destroys living things, takes what is not given and misbehaves
sexually. Thus the unworthy one is with unworthy actions. Bhikkhus, how
is the unworthy one with unworthy views? Here the unworthy one is with
the view, there are no results for gifts, sacrifices and offerings, there
are no rssults for good and bad actions. There is no this world, no other
world, no mother, no father.There are no beings that arise spontaneously,
no recluses and brahmins in the world, who have come to the right path,
realizing this world and the other world, by themselves, declare it. Thus
the unworthy one is with unworthy view. Bhikkhus, how does the unworthy
one make an unworthy offering? Bhikkhus, the unworthy one gives an offering
disrespectfully, does not give with his own hands, does not give it honourably,
gives it as though throwing it, gives it without faith in results. Thus
bhikkhus, the unworthy one makes unworthy offerings..
<p>Bhikkhus, the unworthy one endowed with unworthy, qualities, devotion,
thoughts, musings, words, actions and views and giving gifts unworthily,
after death is born in unworthy states. Bhikkhus, what are unworthy states?
It is either birth in hell or in an animal womb.
<p>‘Bhikkhus, does the worthy one know the worthy one, as this good one
is worthy?’
<p>‘Yes, venerable sir, he knows that.’
<p>‘Good! Bhikkhus, it is possible that the worthy one should know the
worthy one, as this good one is worthy. Bhikkhus, does the worthy one know
the unworthy one, as this good one is unworthy?’

are births as the noblest of gods or the noblest of men.
<p>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words
of the
<p>Blessed One.
