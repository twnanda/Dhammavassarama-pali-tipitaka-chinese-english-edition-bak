<p><b>143. Advise to Anaathapindika</b></center>

<p>I heard thus.
<p>At one time the Blessed One lived in Anathapindika’s monastery in Jeta’s
grove in Savatthi. The householder Anathapindika was seriously ill and
suffering badly at that time. He addressed a certain man and said. ‘Good
man approach the Blessed One, worship the Blessed One for my sake with
your head at his feet, and tell. "Venerable sir, the householder Anathapindika
is seriously ill. Also approach venerable Sariputta worship venerable Sariputta
for my sake with your head at his feet and tell. Venerable sir, the householder
Anathapindika is seriously ill, it is good if venerable Sariputta would
approach the householder Anathapindika’s house out of compassion."
<p>That man agreeing, approached the Blessed One, worshipped the Blessed
One, sat on a side and said. "Venerable sir, the householder Anathapindika
is seriously ill and he worships the Blessed One with his head at the feet
of the Blessed One. Then he approached venerable Saariputta, worshipped
him, sat on a side and said. "Venerable sir, the householder Anathapindika
is seriously ill, he worships venerable Saaariputta with his head at the
feet of venerable Sariputta and also says, it is good if venerable Sariputta
would approach the householder Anathapindika’s house out of compassion."
<p>Venerable Sariputta accepted the message silently, put on his robes
and taking bowl and robes, and accompanied by venerable Ananda as the second
recluse, approached the house of Anathapindika. Sitting on the prepared
seats venerable Sariputta said. ‘Householder, how are you feeling? Would
you survive? Are the unpleasant feelings decreasing or increasing? Do the
feelings show the increasing end or the decreasing end?
<p>Good sir, Sariputta, I do not feel well, will not survive. My unpleasant
feelings are severe and increasing, not decreasing. The unpleasant feelings
are increasing until the end. Good sir, Sariputta, my top hurts a lot.
I feel as though a strong man was giving me a headdress with a strong cloth.
I do not feel well and will not survive. My unpleasant feelings are severe
and increasing, not decreasing. The unpleasant feelings are increasing
until the end. Good sir, Sariputta, my belly hurts a lot as though a lot
of air was turning about in my belly. I feel as though a clever butcher
or his apprentice was carving my belly with a sharp butcher’s knife I do
not feel well and will not survive. My unpleasant feelings are severe and
increasing, not decreasing. The unpleasant feelings are increasing until
the end. Good sir, Sariputta, there is a lot burning in my body. I feel
as though two strong men taking me by my hands and feet are pulling me
to a pit of burning embers and are scorching and burning me. I do not feel
well and will not survive. My unpleasant feelings are severe and increasing,
not decreasing. The unpleasant feelings are increasing until the end.

<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Therefore householder, you should train, I will not cling to anything
seen, heard, known through the scents or pursued discursively thinking.
<p>Hearing this the householder Anathapindika cried loudly and tears streamed
down. Then venerable Ananda asked ‘Householder, do you stick fast or sink?’*1)
<p>‘Good sir Ananda, not that I stick fast or sink. Yet, I have associated
the Teacher and bhikkhus who develop the mind, but have not heard such
a discourse before this.’
<p>Then venerable Sariputta said. ‘Householder, a discourse like this is
not given to a lay person wearing white clothes.’
<p>‘Good sir, Sariputta, discourses like this should be given to lay persons
wearing white clothes. There are clansmen, with few defiling things who
deteriorate owing not hearing this sort of discourse. Hearing these they
would know the Teaching.’
<p>Then, venerable Sariputta and venerable Ananda having advised the householder
Anathapindika got up from their seats and went away. Soon after they had
gone the householder Anathapindika died and was born with the happy ones.*2)
Then Anathapindika, the son of gods, when the night was waning, illuminating
Jeta’s grove completely with a resplendent light, approached the Blessed
One, worshipped and stood on a side and said to the Blessed One.
<p>‘This pleasant Jeta’s grove the home of sages in the Community
<p>Adorned by the king of the Teaching arouses delight in me.
<p>Beings that have death are purified by actions, knowledge
<p>And a righteous, virtuous livelihood, but not by clan or wealth.
<p>Therefore a wise one, seeing his own good,
<p>Discriminating the Teaching, purifies himself
<p>Of the bhikkhus, crossed over, the ones like Sariputta,
<p>In wisdom, virtues and appeasement are the foremost.’
<p>Saying this, Anathapindika, the son of the gods waited for the Blessed
One’s approval. Knowing the Teacher approves my words, worshipped the Blessed
One and went round him with his right towards the Teacher and disappeared
from there. Next day the Blessed One, addressed the bhikkhus. ‘Bhikkhus,
a certain son of the gods when the night was waning, illuminating Jeta’s
grove completely with a resplendent light, approached me worshipped and
stood on a side and said.
<p>‘This pleasant Jeta’s grove the home of sages in the Community
<p>Adorned by the king of the Teaching arouses delight in me.
<p>Beings that have death are purified by actions, knowledge
<p>And a righteous, virtuous livelihood, but not by clan or wealth.
<p>Therefore a wise one, seeing his own good,
<p>Discriminating the Teaching, purifies himself
<p>Of the bhikkhus, crossed over, the ones like Sariputta,
<p>In wisdom, virtues and appeasement are the foremost.’
<p>Saying this, that son of the gods waited for my approval. Knowing that
I approved his words, worshipped and went round me with his right towards
me and disappeared from there.
<p>Hearing this venerable Ananda said. ‘Venerable sir, is that Anathapindika,
the son of the gods? The householder, Anathapindika was made happy by venerable
Sariputta.’
<p>‘Good! Ananda, you are right. You have attained that much, which could
be attained through reasoning.
<p>He is no other, but Anathapindika the son of the gods’.
<p>The Blessed One said thus and venerable Ananda delighted in the words
of the Blessed One.
<p>Notes. 1. Householder, do you stick fast or sink.’oliiyasi kho tva.m,
gahapati, sa.msiidasi kho tva.m gahapati’ To stick fast is to crave for
this world and to sink is to give up hopes. If either of these happened
it is loss for the householder. Neither of them happened.
<p>2. The happy ones.’tusita.m kaaya.m’ This is a group of gods who are
always happy.
