as Aggivessana, the head annointed warrior king would address the elephant
hunter. Good elephant hunter ascend the royal elephant, enter the elephant
grove, search for a wild elephant and fix it with a rope to the royal elephant’s
neck and let the royal elephant bring it to open ground. Aggivessana, now
the wild elephant is brought to open space. Then the elephant hunter informs
the head annointed warrior king. Lord! the wild elephant is brought to
open space. Next the head annointed warrior king addresses the elephant
tamer. Good friend, elephant tamer, tame the wild elephant, so that it
may get over the wild ways, wild thoughts and the displeasures and worries
of leaving the remote. Make him like the end of the village and the ways
of humans. The elephant tamer agrees and fixes a huge strong post and ties
the wild elephant to the post by his neck, so that it may get over its
wild ways, thoughts and displeasures and worries of leaving the remote
and would get used to the end of the village and the ways of humans. The
elephant tamer speaks words that are pleasing and go straight to the heart,
speaks words that are accepted as polite by many. When the wild elephant
listens to the words of the elephant tamer. He is given grass and water.
If the wild elephant accepts grass and water, the elephant trainer knows
that the elephant would live and not die. Then the elephant trainer gives
him a further training as, good one, take this! Put it down! If he obeys
the elephant trainer, he is given a further training. Good one, go forward!
Recede! If the king’s elephant obeys these orders, he is given a further
training as stand up! and sit down! If the king’s elephant obeys the elephant
trainer’s orders he is given a further training in imperturbability. A
great log is tied to the trunk and a man with an elephant lance climbs
on the elephant’s neck Men with lances stand all round<o:p></o:p></span>

style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>the
elephant trainer too taking a long elephant lance stands in front of the
elephant. He doing imperturbability does not move the front feet nor the
hind feet. Does not move the fore part of the body nor the hind part of
the body. Does not move the head nor ears. Does not move the teeth, tail
or the trunk.The king’s elephant endures the contact of weapons, swords,
and arrows. Endures loud noises of drums, conches and melodious sounds
made by enemies. When all crookednesses, and faults are rectified and is
blameless, he becomes worthy for the king, the property of the king and
gets the mark of royality.<o:p></o:p></span>

style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Aggivessana,
in the same manner the Thus Gone One arises in the world, perfect, rightfully
enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, knower of the
worlds, the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, Teacher of gods and
men, enlightened and blessed. He declares to the world together with its
Maaras, Brahmaas, the community of recluses and brahmins gods and men,
that Teaching good at the beginning, in the middle and at the end full
of meaning even in the letter, complete in every way stating the pure holy
life. Hearing this a householder or a householder’s son, born to some clan,
gains faith in the Thus Gone One. With that faith he reflects. The life
in a household is full of defilements, going forth is like open space.
It is not easy for one living a household life to lead the holy life complete
and pure without defilements. What if I shave head and beard, don yellow
robes and go forth as a homeless. Later he gives up a little wealth, or
much wealth, a small circle of friends, or a large circle of friends, shaving
head and beard, and donning yellow robes goes forth as a homeless. Aggivessana,
when this much is done, the noble disciple comes to open space. Aggivessana,
here the greed of gods and men is for the five strands sense pleasures.
Then the Thus Gone One gives him a further training. Come bhikkhu be virtuous,
abiding by the higher code of rules, practise the right conduct, seeing
fear in the slightest fault.When the bhikkhu practises right conduct, seeing
fear in the slightest fault, the Thus Gone One gives him a further training.
Come bhikkhu protect your doors of mental contact. Seeing a form do not
take the sign or details. To one abiding not protecting the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>mental
faculty of the eye, evil desires of covetousness and<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>displeasure
may arise, fall to its control. Hearing a sound, ...re..... scenting a
smell, ...re....enjoying a taste, ...re.... experiencing a touch with the
body,...re.... and cognizing an idea in the.mind.do not take the sign or
details. To one abiding not protecting the mental contact of the mind,
evil desires of covetousness and displeasure may arise, fall to its control.
Aggivessana, when the bhikkhu is protected in his doors of mental contact,
the Thus Gone One gives him a further training. Come bhikkhu, know<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>the
right amount to partake of food. Partake food reflecting, it is not, for
play, for intoxication, or to look beautiful, but for the upkeep of the
body. Not for the enjoyment of soups but to lead the holy life. Reflect
I will put an end to earlier feelings, will not arouse new, for a faultless
pleasant abiding. Aggivessana, when the bhikkhu knows the right amount
to partake of food, the Thus Gone One gives him a further training. Come
bhikkhu abide wakeful. During the day, sit in the cankamana and clean the
mind of hindering things. In the first watch of the night sit in the cankamana
and clean the mind of hindering things. In the middle watch of the night
turn to the right, making the lion’s posture, place one foot over the other
and with the perception of waking go to sleep. In the last watch of the
night, sit in the cankamana and clean the mind of hindering things. When
the bhikkhu is yoked to wakefulness, the Thus Gone One gives him a further
training. Come bhikkhu be endowed with mindful awareness. Be mindful when
approaching and receeding, looking on and looking about, bending and stretching,
bearing the three robes and bowl, enjoying, drinking, eating and tasting,
urinating and excreting, when going, standing, sitting and lying until
awake. Be mindful when talking and keeping silence. When the bhikkhu is
endowed with mindful awareess, the Thus Gone One gives a further training.
Come bhikkhu abound a secluded dwelling. Abound a forest, the root of a
tree, a mountain grotto, a charnel ground, a jungle path, an open space
or a leaves hut. Then he abounds a forest, the root of a tree, a mountain
grotto, a charnel ground, a jungle path, an open space or a leaves hut.
After the meal, he sits cross legged, with the body errect and mindfulness
established in front of him. He abides dispelling the coveting mind and
cleans the mind of coveting thoughts. He abides dispelling the angry mind
and cleans the mind of angry thoughts, with compassion for all living things.
Dispelling sloth and torpor he abides mindful and aware of a perception
of light to dispel sloth and torpor. He abides dispelling restlessness
and worry, internally appeased cleans the mind of restlessness and worry.
Abides dispelling doubts about merits that should be done and should not
be done and cleans the mind of doubts.<o:p></o:p></span>
