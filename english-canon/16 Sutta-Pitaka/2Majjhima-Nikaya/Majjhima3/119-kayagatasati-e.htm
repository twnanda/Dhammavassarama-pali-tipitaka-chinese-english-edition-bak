it and fills it up with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion.Does not
leave a single spot untouched with that joy and pleasantness born of seclusion.
Bhikkhus, like a bather or his apprentice, would place some bathing powder
in a bronze vessel, would mix it sprinkling water and turning it<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>into
a ball of lather.He would mix it well, until the lather becomes a ball

inlets from the east, west, north or south, is filled up with cool water

1. To whomever bhikkhu mindfulness of the body in the body is not developped
and made much, Death finds access to him. ‘Yassa kassaci bhikkhave, bhikkhuno
kaayagataa sati abhaavitaa abahuliitakaa labhati tassa Maaro otara.m. labhati
tassa Maaro aarammana.m.’ ‘Maara’ though alluded to a supernormal being,
here it means the defilements in the thoughts.of the bhikkhu.<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal">2. Mindfulness of the body in the body developped
and made much, when directed to the realization of whatever higher knowledge,
it becomes the eye witness in that and that sphere.’Yassa kassaci bhikkhave
kaayagataa sati bhaavitaa bahuliikataa, so yassa yassa abhi~n~naa sacchikaraniiyassa
dhammassa citta.m abhininnaameti abhi~n~naasacchikiriyaaya tatra tatr’eva
sakkhibhavyata.m paapunaati sati sati aayatane. The thorough development
of mindfulness of the body in the body, leads the bhikku for the realization
of the higher knowledges. It is said that, that developped mindfulness,
is the eye witness of those higher knowledges. There is no other evidence
of these attainments.
