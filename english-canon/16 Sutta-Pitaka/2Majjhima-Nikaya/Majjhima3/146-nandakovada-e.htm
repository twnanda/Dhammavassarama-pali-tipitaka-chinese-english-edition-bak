<p><b>146. Advice from Venerable Nandaka</b></center>

<p>I heard thus.
<p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anathapindika,
in Jeta’s grove in Savatthi.
<p>Then Mahapajaapati Gotami approached the Blessed One with about five
hundred bhikkhunis. They worshipped the Blessed One and stood on a side,
and Mahapajapati Gotami said to the Blessed One. ‘Venerable sir, advise
the bhikkhunis, give them a talk on the Teaching.’
<p>At that time the elder bhikkhus were advising the bhikkhunis in turns.
Venerable Nandaka did not like to advise the bhikkhunis when his turn came.
The Blessed One then addressed venerable Ananda. ‘Ananda. who will advise
the bhikkhunis today?’ ‘Venerable sir, it is venerable Nandaka’s turn and
he does not like to advise the bhikkhunis.’ The Blessed One then addressed
venerable Nandaka. ‘Nandaka, advise the bhikkhunis. Holy man, give the
bhikkhunis a talk on the Teaching.*1)’ Venerable Nandaka agreed and the
next moring, putting on robes and taking bowl and robes went the alms round
in Savatthi. After collecting alms and when the meal was over, approached
the monastery of the royal women. The bhikkhunis seeing venerable Nandaka
approach prepared a seat and administered water to wash the feet. Venerable
Nandaka sat on the prepared seat and washed his feet. The bhikkhunis too
worshipped venerable Nandaka and sat on a side. Then venerable Nandaka
said to those bhikkhunis. ‘Sisters, there will be a session of asking questions
and replying them. Those who know should say, I know and those who do not
know should say I do not know. When there is doubt or consternation, it
should be asked from me, venerable sir, what is the meaning of this.’
<p>‘Even while hearing this announcement, of venerable Nandaka we are pleased
and happy.’
<p>‘Sisters, is the eye permanent or impermanent?’
<p>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’
<p>‘That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant?’
<p>‘Unpleasant. Venerable sir.’
<p>‘In that unpleasant, changing thing, is it suitable to reflect, it’s
mine, I’m in it, it’s self?’
<p>‘Venerable sir, it is not suitable.’
<p>‘Sisters, is the ear permanent or impermanent?’
<p>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’
<p>‘Sisters, is the nose permanent or impermanent?’
<p>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’
<p>‘Sisters, is the tongue permanent or impermanent?’
<p>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’
<p>‘Sisters, is the body permanent or impermanent?’
<p>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’
<p>‘Sisters, is the mind permanent or impermanent?’
<p>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’
<p>‘That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant?’
<p>‘Unpleasant. Venerable sir.’
<p>‘In that unpleasant, changing thing, is it suitable to reflect, it’s
mine, I’m in it, it’s self?’
<p>‘Venerable sir, it is not suitable, because even before this, we have
seen with right wisdom, as it really is that the six internal spheres are
impermanent.
<p>‘Good! Sisters, that is so. It is the noble disciple that sees this,
as it really is with right wisdom
<p>‘Sisters, are forms permanent or impermanent?’
<p>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’
<p>‘That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant?’
<p>‘Unpleasant. Venerable sir.’
<p>‘In that unpleasant, changing thing, is it suitable to reflect, it’s
me, I’m in it, it’s self?’
<p>‘Venerable sir, it is not suitable.’
<p>‘Sisters, are sounds permanent or impermanent?’
<p>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’
<p>‘Sisters, are scents permanent or impermanent?’
<p>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’
<p>‘Sisters, are tastes permanent or impermanent?’
<p>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’
<p>‘Sisters, are touches permanent or impermanent?’
<p>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’
<p>‘Sisters, are thoughts permanent or impermanent?’
<p>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’
<p>‘That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant?’
<p>‘Unpleasant. Venerable sir.’
<p>‘In that unpleasant, changing thing, is it suitable to reflect, it’s
me, I’m in it, it’s self?’
<p>‘Venerable sir, it is not suitable, because even before this, we have
seen with right wisdom, as it really is that the six external spheres are
impermanent.
<p>‘Good! Sisters, that is so. It is the noble disciple that sees it, as
it really is with right wisdom.’
<p>‘Sisters, is eye-consciousness permanent or impermanent?’
<p>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’
<p>‘That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant?’
<p>‘Unpleasant. Venerable sir.’
<p>‘In that unpleasant, changing thing, is it suitable to reflect, it’s
me, I’m in it, it’s self?’
<p>‘Venerable sir, it is not suitable.’
<p>‘Sisters, is ear consciousness permanent or impermanent?’
<p>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’
<p>‘Sisters, is nose consciousness permanent or impermanent?’
<p>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’
<p>‘Sisters, is tongue consciousness permanent or impermanent?’
<p>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’
<p>‘Sisters, is body consciousness permanent or impermanent?’
<p>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’
<p>‘Sisters, is mind consciousness permanent or impermanent?’
<p>‘Impermanent. Venerable sir.’
<p>‘That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant?’
<p>‘Unpleasant. Venerable sir.’
<p>‘In that unpleasant, changing thing, is it suitable to reflect, it’s
me, I’m in it, it’s self?’
<p>‘Venerable sir, it is not suitable, because even before this, we have
seen with right wisdom, as it really is that the six bodies of consciousness
are impermanent.
<p>‘Good! Sisters, that is so. It is the noble disciple that sees it, as
it really is with right wisdom.’
<p>‘Sisters, of a burning oil flame, the oil is impermanent, a changing
thing. The wick is impermanent, a changing thing. The fire is impermanent,
a changing thing. The flame is impermanent, a changing thing. Sisters,
if someone were to say, of this burning oil flame, the oil is impermanent,
a changing thing. The wick is impermanent, a changing thing. The fire is
impermanent, a changing thing. As for the flame, it’s permanent, eternal
a not changing thing. Is that said correctly?
<p>‘Venerable sir, it is not well said, because, of this burning oil flame,
the oil is impermanent, a changing thing. The wick is impermanent, a changing
thing. The fire is impermanent, a changing thing. So also the flame, is
impermanent, a changing thing.’
<p>‘Sisters, in the same manner, if someone was to say; my six internal
spheres are impermanent and whatever pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant
nor pleasant feelings experienced on account of the six internal spheres
are permanent, eternal, not changing things. Is that said correctly?’
<p>‘Venerable sir, it is not well said, because, on account of this and
other reason, there arises this and other feeling and when that reason
subsides, the respective feeling fades.’
<p>‘Good! Sisters, that is so. It is the noble disciple that sees it, as
it really is with right wisdom.’
<p>‘Sisters, of a standing huge tree full of heartwood, the root is impermanent,
a changing thing. The trunk is impermanent, a changing thing. The branches
and foliage are impermanent, changing things. The shadow is impermanent,
a changing thing. Sisters, if someone were to say, of this standing huge
tree full of heartwood the root is impermanent, a changing thing. The trunk
is impermanent, a changing thing. The branches and foliage are impermanent,
changing things. As for its shadow, it’s permanent, eternal a not changing
thing. Is that said correctly?’
<p>‘Venerable sir, it is not well said, because, of this standing huge
tree full of heartwood the root is impermanent, a changing thing. The trunk
is impermanent, a changing thing. The branches and foliage are impermanent,
changing things, so also its shadow is impermanent a changing thing.’
<p>‘Sisters, in the same manner, if someone was to say; my six external
spheres are impermanent and whatever pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant
nor pleasant feelings experienced on account of the six external spheres
are permanent, eternal, not changing things. Sisters, is that said correctly?’
<p>‘Venerable sir, it is not well said, because, on account of this and
other reason there arises this and other feeling and when that reason subsides,
the respective feeling fades.’
<p>‘Good! Sisters, that is so. It is the noble disciple that sees it, as
it really is with right wisdom.’
<p>‘Sisters, a clever butcher or his apprentice would kill a cow with a
sharp carving knife, and would chop it into small bits without hindering
the internal flesh or the external skin. He would chop all the internal
tissues, veins and ligaments, into small bits, as they stand and would
put the cow together in the outer skin as it was and would say. This is
the same cow complete in that same skin. Sisters, is that said correctly?’
<p>‘Venerable sir, it is not so, because, that clever butcher or his apprentice
would kill a cow with a sharp carving knife, and would chop it into small
bits without hindering the internal flesh or the external skin. He would
chop all the internal tissues, veins and ligaments, into small bits, as
they stand and would put the cow together in the outer skin as it was and
would say. This is the same cow complete in that same skin. Yet, that cow
is unyoked from the skin.’
<p>‘Sisters, this is a comparison to explain the meanings. This is its
meaning. Internal flesh, is a synonym for the six internal spheres.*2)
External skin, is a synonym for the six external spheres.*3) Internal tissues,
veins and ligaments is a synonym for interest and greed. A sharp carving
knife is a synonym for the noble one’s wisdom. With that noble wisdom the
internal impurities, bonds and bindings are cut and chopped again and again.
<p>Sisters, these seven are the enlightenment factors, developing and making
much of them, the bhikkhu destroying desires*4) releases the mind, releases
through wisdom,*5) here and now abides by himself knowing and realizing.*6)
What are the seven? Here, sisters the bhikkhu develops the enlightenment
factor mindfulness, settled in, seclusion, detachment and cessation maturing
in surrender. Develops the enlightenment factor, examining the Teaching,*7)
effort,*8) joy,*9) appeasement and equanimity settled in, seclusion, detachment
and cessation maturing in surrender*10). Sisters, these are the seven enlightenment
factors, developing and making much of which, the bhikkhu, destroying desires
releases the mind, releases through wisdom and here and now abides knowing
by himself and realizing.’
<p>Venerable Nandaka advising the bhikkhunis in this manner said. ‘Sisters,
go now, it’s late.’ And sent them away.
<p>‘Those bhikkhunis, delighting, hearing the words of venerable Nandaka,
got up from their seats, worshipped him, going away respectfully with their
right sides towards venerable Nandaka approached the Blessed One, worshipped
the Blessed One and kept standing. The Blessed One said. ‘Sisters, go now,
it’s late.’ Those bhikkhunis worshipped the Blessed One and went away respectfully
with their right sides towards the Blessed One. When the bhikkhunis had
gone away the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus. ’Bhikkhus, Many people
seeing the moon on the fourteenth day of waxing, do not entertain doubts
such as is the moon incomplete or not, but that it is incomplete. In the
same manner, the bhikkhunis are delighted hearing the Teaching, but their
aims are not fulfilled.
<p>Then the Blessed One addressed venerable Nandaka. ‘Therefore, Nandaka,
advise the bhikkhus, on that same topic again.’
<p>Venerable Nandaka agreed, and at the end of that night, the next morning
putting on robes and taking bowl and robes went the alms round in Savatthi.
After collecting alms and when the meal was over, approached the monastery
of the royal women. The bhikkhunis seeing venerable Nandaka approaching,,
prepared a seat and administered water to wash the feet. Venerable Nandaka
sat on the prepared seat and washed his feet. The bhikkhunis too worshipped
venerable Nandaka and sat on a side. Then venerable Nandaka said to those
bhikkhunis. ‘Sisters, there will be a session of asking questions and replying

<p>‘Sisters, in the same manner, if someone was to say; my six internal

Sisters, these are the seven enlightenment factors, developing and making
much of which, the bhikkhu, destroying desires releases the mind, releases
through wisdom and here and now abides knowing by himself and realizing.’
<p>Venerable Nandaka advising the bhikkhunis in this manner said. ‘Sisters,
go now, it’s late.’ And sent them away.
<p>The Blessed One, soon after the bhikkhunis had gone away, addressed
the bhikkhus. ‘Bhikkhus, many people seeing the moon on the fifteenth day
of waxing, do not entertain doubts such as is the moon incomplete or complete.
They know that the moon is complete. In the same manner, the bhikkhunis
are delighted hearing Nandaka’s preaching, and their aims are fulfilled.
The least of those five hundred bhikkhunis is a stream entrant, not falling
from that, is aiming extinctlion.
<p>The Blessed One said that and those bhikkhusdelighted in the words of
the Blessed One.
<p>Notes. 1.Holy man, give the bhikkhunis a talk on the Teaching. ‘karohi
tva.m braahmana, bhikkhunina.m dhammikatha.m’ A holy man is one who has
attained worthiness, one who has done the dispensation of t he Blessed
One.
<p>2. The six internal spheres ‘channeta.m ajjhattikaana.m aayatanaana.m’
Six internal spheres are the spheres of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and
mind.
<p>3. The six external spheres. ‘channeta.m baahiraana.m aayatanaana.m’
Six external spheres are forms, sounds, smells, tastes, touches and ideas.
<p>4 The bhikkhu destroying desires, ‘bhikkhu aasavaana.m khayaa’ Desire
is the root cause for a person’s transmigration from one birth to another.
To stop this transmigration, the bhikkhu has to destroy desires.
<p>5. Releases of the mind and releases through wisdom. ‘anaasava.m cetovimutti.m
pa~n~naavimutti.m. The release of the mind is attained when the bhikkhu
does not desire anything. The desiring starts with a contact at one or
the other, of a door of mental contact, such as from a sight, sound, scent,
taste, touch or an idea. To stop desiring the mind should be developed
much. This is also called the release through knowing here and now. The
living worthy ones ‘arahantaa’ enjoy this bliss of not being touched by
any of the contacts at any of the doors of mental contact.Should be something
very pleasant. Someone released through wisdom does not enjoy this bliss
yet, he has read much or heard much and knows what it is and he aims to
attain that bliss.
<p>6. Here and now abides by himself knowing and realizing. ‘di.t.th’eva
dhamme saya.m abhi~n~naa sacchikatvaa upsampajja viharati.’ Here and now
means in this very life, the bhikkhu by himself knowing realizes that highest
aim of a Buddhist, that is the worthy state.
<p>7. The enlightenment factor of examining the Teaching. ‘dhammavicayasambojjhanga.m
bhaaveti,’ This is to consider the complete Teaching, not overlooking any
minor details, to come to a grand decision, so that the ultimate aim could
be attained.
<p>8. The enlightenment factor effort, ‘viriyasambhojjhanga.m bhaaveti.’
This is nothing but a mental effort to see that non arisen demerit does
not arise, arisen demerit is dispelled, non arisen merit is aroused and
arisen merit is developed and completed to the highest limit. This arisen
merits are the developed mind such as the fruition of the entry into the
stream of the Teaching, etcetra.
<p>9. The enlightenment factor joy. ‘piitisambojjhanga.m bhaaveti.’ This
is some internal joy on account of complete confidence of the path, and
enjoyed only by a disciple of the Blessed One.
<p>10. And the enlightenment factor equanimity settled in seclusion, detachment
and cessation maturing in surrender. ‘upekhaasambojjha.nga.m bhaaveti vivekanissita.m
viraaganissita.m nirodhnissita.m vossaggaparinaami.m’
<p>Here equanimity is developed, settled in seclusion, detachment and cessation,
until everything is given up. This amounts to extinctlion.
