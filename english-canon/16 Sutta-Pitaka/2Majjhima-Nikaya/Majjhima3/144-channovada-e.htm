<p><b>144. Advice to Venerable Channa.</b></center>

<p>I heard thus.
<p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the squirrels’ sanctuary in the
bamboo grove in Rajagaha. At that time, venerable Sariputta, venerable
Mahacunda and venerable Channa lived on the Gijjha peak. At that time venerable
Channa was seriously ill. Venerable Sariputta getting up from his seclusion
in the evening approached venerable Mahacunda and said. ‘Friend, Chunda,
let’s approach venerable Channa to inquire about his health.’ Venerable
Mahacunda accepting venerable Sariputta’s suggestion, both approached venerable
Channa. After exchanging friendly greetings with venerable Channa they
sat on a side and venerable Sariputta said. ‘ Friend, Channa, how are you
feeling? Would you survive? Are the unpleasant feelings decreasing or increasing?
Do the feelings show the increasing end or the decreasing end?’
<p>‘Friend, Sariputta, I do not feel well, will not survive. My unpleasant
feelings are severe and increasing, not decreasing. The unpleasant feelings
are increasing until the end. Friend, Sariputta, my top hurts a lot. I
feel as though a strong man was giving me a headdress with a strong headband.
I do not feel well and will not survive. My unpleasant feelings are severe
and increasing, not decreasing. The unpleasant feelings are increasing
until the end. Friend, Sariputta, my belly hurts a lot as though a lot
of air was turning about in my belly. I feel as though a clever butcher
or his apprentice was carving my belly with a sharp butcher’s knife I do
not feel well and will not survive. My unpleasant feelings are severe and
increasing, not decreasing. The unpleasant feelings are increasing until
the end. Friend, Sariputta, there is a lot of burning in my body. I feel
as though two strong men taking me by my hands and feet are pulling me
to a pit of burning embers and are scorching and burning me. I do not feel
well and will not survive. My unpleasant feelings are severe and increasing,
not decreasing. The unpleasant feelings are increasing until the end. Friend,
Sariputta, I will take a weapon to end life.’
<p>‘Friend, Channa, do not take a weapon, do survive. We desire that you
survive. If venerable Channa does not get suitable nourishment, I will
find them for venerable Channa. If venerable Channa does not get suitable
medical requisites, I will find them for venerable Channa.. If venerable
Channa does not have a suitable attendant, I will attend to venerable Channa.
Friend, Channa, do not take a weapon, do survive. We desire that you survive.
<p>‘Friend, Sariputta, it is not that I’m in want of suitable nourishment,
or suitable medical requisites, or a suitable attendant, yet my duties
by the Teacher are done long ago, with pleasure and not with displeasure.
<p>Friend, Sariputta, for a disciple who has done his duties by the Teacher
pleasantly, there is nothing wrong if he takes a weapon to end life, remember
it as that.’
<p>‘Friend Channa, I will ask a certain question if venerable Channa would
volunteer to explain.’
<p>‘Friend, Sariputta, ask, I will explain.’
<p>‘Friend, Channa, is your reflection, eye, eye-consciousness, and things
cognizable by eye consciousness, are me, I’m in them, they are self? Is
your reflection, ear, ear-consciousness, and things cognizable by ear -consciousness,
are me, I’m in them and they are self? Is your reflection, nose, nose-consciousness,
and things cognizable by nose-consciousness, are me, I’m in them, they
are self? Is your reflection, tongue, tongue-consciousness, and things
cognizable by tongue-consciousness, are me, I’m in them, they are self?
Is your reflection, body, body-consciousness, and things cognizable by
body-consciousness, are me, I’m in them, they are self? Is your reflection,
mind, mind-consciousness, and things cognizable by mind-consciousness,
are me, I’m in them, they are self?
<p>‘Friend, Sariputta, eye, eye-consciousness, and things cognizable by
eye consciousness, are not me, I’m not in them, they are not self. Friend,
Sariputta, ear, ear-consciousness, and things cognizable by ear -consciousness,
are not me, I’m not in them, they are not self. Friend, Sariputta, nose,
nose-consciousness, and things cognizable by nose-consciousness, are not
me, I’m not in them, they are not self. Friend, Sariputta, tongue, tongue-consciousness,
and things cognizable by tongue-consciousness, are not me, I’m not in them,
they are not self. Friend, Sariputta, body, body-consciousness, and things
cognizable by body-consciousness, are not me, I’m not in them, they are
not self Friend, Sariputta, mind, mind-consciousness, and things cognizable
by mind-consciousness, are not me, I’m not in them, they are not self.’
<p>‘Friend, Channa, seeing what in the eye, eye-consciousness and things
cognizable by eye-consciousness do you realize, eye, eye-consciousness
and things cognizable by eye consciousness are not me, I’m not in them
and they are not self? ‘Friend, Channa, seeing what in the ear, ear-consciousness
and things cognizable by ear-consciousness do you realize, ear, ear-consciousness
and things cognizable by ear consciousness are not me, I’m not in them
and they are not self? ‘Friend, Channa, seeing what in the nose nose-consciousness
and things cognizable by nose-consciousness do you realize, nose, nose-consciousness
and things cognizable by nose consciousness are not me, I’m not in them
and they are not self? ‘Friend, Channa, seeing what in taste, taste-consciousness
and things cognizable by taste-consciousness do you realize, taste, taste-consciousness
and things cognizable by taste-consciousness are not me, I’m not in them
and they are not self? ‘Friend, Channa, seeing what in the body, body-consciousness
and things cognizable by body-consciousness do you realize, body, body-consciousness
and things cognizable by body-consciousness are not me, I’m not in them
and they are not self? ‘Friend, Channa, seeing what in the mind, mind-consciousness
and things cognizable by mind-consciousness do you realize, mind, mind-consciousness
and things cognizable by mind-consciousness are not me, I’m not in them
and they are not self?
<p>‘Friend, Sariputta seeing the cessation of the eye, eye-consciousness
and things cognizable by eye-consciousness I realized, eye, eye-consciousness
and things cognizable by eye consciousness are not me, I’m not in them
and they are not self. Friend, Sariputta, seeing the cessation of ear,
ear-consciousness and things cognizable by ear-consciousness I realized,
ear, ear-consciousness and things cognizable by ear consciousness are not
me, I’m not in them and they are not self. Friend, Sariputta seeing cessation
of the nose, nose-consciousness and things cognizable by nose-consciousness,
I realized, nose, nose-consciousness and things cognizable by nose consciousness
are not me, I’m not in them and they are not self. Friend, Sariputta, seeing
the cessation of taste, taste-consciousness and things cognizable by taste-consciousness
I realized, taste, taste-consciousness and things cognizable by taste-consciousness
are not me, I’m not in them and they are not self. Friend, Sariputta, seeing
the cessation of the body, body-consciousness and things cognizable by
body-consciousness I realized, body, body-consciousness and things cognizable
by body-consciousness are not me, I’m not in them and they are not self.
Friend, Sariputta, seeing the cessation of the mind, mind-consciousness
and things cognizable by mind-consciousness I realized, mind, mind-consciousness
and things cognizable by mind-consciousness are not me, I’m not in them
and they are not self’
<p>Then venerable Mahacunda said to venerable Channa. ‘Friend, Channa,
constant attention should be given to this too in the dispensation of the
Blessed One. To the settled there is change, to the not settled there is
no change.*1) When there is no change, there is delight.*2) When there
is delight, there is no inclination.*3) When there is no inclination, there
is no coming and going.*4) When there is no coming and going, there is
no disappearing and appearing*5)When there is no disappearing and appearing,
there is no here or there, or in between.*6) That is the end of unpleasantness.
<p>Venerable Sariputta and venerable Mahcunda having advised venerable
Channa, in this manner got up from their seats and went away. Soon after
they had gone venerable Channa took a weapon and put an end to his life.
Then venerable Sariputta approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on
a side and said.’Venerable sir, venerable Channa has put an end to his
life, what are his movements after death?’
<p>‘Sariputta, wasn’t the faultlessness of the bhikkhu Channa declared
in your presence?’
<p>‘Venerable sir, in Pabbajira, the village of the Vajjii’s, the families
of venerable Channa’s friends, well -wishers and earlier relations live.’
<p>‘Sariputta, there may be the families of venerable Channa’s friends,
well-wishers and earlier relatives, I say, there is no fault to that extent.
Sariputta, if someone gives up this body and seizes another, I say it is
a fault. In the bhikkhu that fault is not apparent. Bhikkhu Channa took
his life faultlessly.’
<p>The Blessed One said thus and venerable Sariputta delighted in the words
of the Blessed One.
<p>Notes. 1.To the settled there is change, to the not settled there is
no change. ‘nissitassa calita.m, anissitassa calita.m na’tthi’ When the
bhikkhu develops his mind, there are various stages in which the mind makes
settlements. When such a settlement is made, there is change, when no such
settlement is made, there is no change.The Blessed One’s Teaching is that
the bhikkhu should not be settled anywhere. It is the Teaching of the mind’s
extinction.
<p>2. When there is no change, there is delight.’calite asati passaddhi’
A change is a change in feelings, as a result of a contact at one or the
other of the doors of mental contact. When there is no such change, there
is delight. Delight is a special feature necessary for the development
of the mind, so that it may not deviate from the correct path.
<p>3.When there is delight there is no inclination.’passaddhiyaa sati,
nati na hoti.’ Inclination is to be bent to this and that. The delighted
one enjoys the path, and does not deviate from it. He becomes so sure of
the path, that a teacher is not necessary for him any more.
<p>4. When there is no inclination, there is no coming and going. ‘natiyaa
asati aagatigati na hoti.’ The coming and going is a persistent feature
of the mind. Always coming to its place of interest. The mind’s nature
of persistently returning to a point is the factor, which paves someone’s
rebirth in some place.
<p>5. When there is no coming and going, there is no disappearing and appearing.’aagatigatiyaa
asati cutuupapaato na hoti’ When the mind’s nature of coming and going
is not evident, the disappearing and appearing does not happen.
<p>6.When there is no disappearing and appearing, there is no here or there
or in between.’cutuupapaate asati n’eva idha na hura.m na ubhaya.m antarena.’
When the mind does not disappear and appear, and when it is neither in
between, it is the end of unpleasantness.
