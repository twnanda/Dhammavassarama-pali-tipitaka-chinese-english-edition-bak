1. In matter to see matter ‘ruupii ruupaani passati.’To see matter in matter
is to be aware of whatever matters at one or the other of our six doors
of mental contact. It’s for the purpose of cutting short our long journey
in existences, by penetratingly seeing the unsatisfactory nature of existences.
This is one of the methods to attain the paths and fruits.<o:p></o:p></span>

With internal immaterial perception to see external matter ‘Ajjhatta.m
aruupasa~n~nii bahiddhaa ruupaani passati.’Here the yogi attains to an
immaterial perception and then penetratingly sees the futility of existence
and tries to attain the paths and fruits. The immaterial perceptions are
attained to, by attaining to the jhaanas, or with the help of other meditation
