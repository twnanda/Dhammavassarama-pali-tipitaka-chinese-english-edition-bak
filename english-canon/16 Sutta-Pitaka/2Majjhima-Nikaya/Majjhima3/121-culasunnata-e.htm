heard thus. At one time the Blessed One lived in the Pubba monastery, the
palace of Migaara’s mother in Saavatthi. Venerabe Aananda, getting up from
his seclusion in the evening, approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat
on a side and said thus. ‘Venerable sir, once when the Blessed One was
living with the Sakyas in the hamlet Naagaraka, I heard these acknowledged
words from the Blessed One himself: “Aananda, at present I abide much in
voidity.” How could I, hearing it, grasp it thoroughly bear it?’&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span>

Aananda, listen, hear, grasp thoroughly and bear it. Aananda, in the past
as well as now, I abide much in voidity. Just as the palace of Migaara’s
mother is void of elephants, cattle, mares, raw gold, sovereign gold and
assemblies of women and men and is not void of the community, on account
of this there is a single perception. In the same manner the bhikkhu not
attending to the perception of village or humans.attends to the single
perception of remoteness.*1) With the perception of remoteness, the mind
springs, gets settled and is released.*2) Whatever anxiety there’s on account
of the perception of village, is not evident here. Whatever anxiety there’s
on account of the perception of humans, is not evident here There is this
anxiety of the perception of remoteness. He knows, this is void of the
perception of village and the perception of humans. He knows it is not
void of the perception of remoteness. Thus on account of whatever is not
there, voidity is perceived, whatever remains is perceived as peaceful.

1. Attends to the single perception of remoteness. ‘ara~n~nsa~n~na.m pa.ticca
manasikaroti ekatta.m’ The perception of remoteness is the physical displacing
of the enjoyments of the five strands of sensual pleasures.<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal">2. With the perception of remoteness, the mind springs,
gets settled and is released. ‘tassa ara~n~nasa~n~naaya citta.m pakkhandati
pasiidati santi.t.thati vimuccati.’ It<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>is
the nature of the mind to spring at a sign, if agreeable get settled there
and if ready to be released, to be released..
