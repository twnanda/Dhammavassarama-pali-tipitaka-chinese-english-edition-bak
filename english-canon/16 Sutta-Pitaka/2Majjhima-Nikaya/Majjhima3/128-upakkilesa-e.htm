water vessels for drinking, washing or toilets empty,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>fills
them up. If he finds it not in his capacity to carry it, would call another
with the wave of the hand. Would not utter a word on account of it. On
every fifth day we would sit throughout the night discussing a topic on
the Teaching. Venerable sir, thus we abide diligently for dispelling. Good,
