<br>
<p>I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One was living with the Sakyas,
in Nigrodha’s monastery in Kapilavatthu. During that time the Sakyas of
Kapilavatthu had built a new assembly hall, and before anyone dwelt in
it, the Sakyas of Kapilavatthu wanted the Blessed One to live in it. So
they approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said: Venerable
sir, we have built a new assembly hall and before any, recluse, brahmin
of any human being dwells there, we want the Blessed One to dwell there.
Venerable sir, dwell in it first and the Sakyas of Kapilavatthu will dwell
in it afterwards, and it will be for their good and well being for a long
time. The Blessed One accepted in silence. When the Sakyas knew that the
Blessed One had accepted, they got up, worshipped and circumambulated the
Blessed One and went to the assembly hall. They covered the complete floor
with carpets, prepared seats, placed pots of water and lighted oil lamps
and approached the Blessed One, worshipped, stood on a side and informed:
Venerable sir, the floor is covered with carpets, seats are prepared, pots
of water are placed, and lamps are lighted. It is time for the Blessed
One to do what is fitting. The Blessed One putting on robes and taking
bowl and robes, together with the Community of bhikkhus, approached the
assembly hall, the Blessed One washed his feet and entered the assembly
hall and sat on the prepared seat against the middle post facing the east.
The bhikkhus, washed their feet, entered the hall and sat against the wall
in the west facing the east. Then the Sakyas of Kapilavatthu leading the
rest of the crowd, washed their feet entered the hall and sat against the
wall in the east facing the west. The Blessed One then addressed the Sakyas
of Kapilavatthu deep into the night advised, incited, and made their hearts
light. When the night was far spent, the Blessed One addressed Aananda:
Aananda, preach the Sakyas of Kapilavatthu the method of training, of a
trainer.(1) My back is aching and like to stretch myself. Then the Blessed
One folded the robe in four and laying it stretched on it turning to the
right, keeping one foot over the other and making the lion’s posture, attending
to the perception of waking.
<p>Then venerable Aananda, addressed Mahaanaama the Sakya. Mahaanaama,
the noble disciple should become virtuous, protecting his doors of mental
contact, should know the right amount to partake food, should be yoked
to wakefulness, and should be endowed with these seven good things. Of
the four jhaanas and the higher abidings, which are pleasant here and now,
he should be a gainer for nothing, a quick gainer and a gainer without
difficulty. Mahaanaama, how does the noble disciple become endowed with
virtues? The noble disciple should abide by the higher code of rules. Become
virtuous, should see fear in the slightest fault. Mahaanaama, how does
the noble disciple protect the doors of mental contact?. Mahaanaama the
noble disciple seeing a form with the eye will not take the sign or the
details. To him abiding with the mental faculty of the eye not protected,
evil demerit of covetousness and displeasure may arise. To its control
he falls. Hearing a sound with the ear, Cognising a smell with the nose,
Cognising a taste with the tongue, Cognising a touch with the body, Cognising
an idea with the mind will not take the sign or the details. To him abiding
with the mental faculty of the mind not protected, evil demerit of covetousness
and displeasure may arise. To its control he falls. Mahaanaama, the noble
disciple protects the doors of mental contact thus. Mahaanaama, how does
the noble disciple partake food reflecting? The noble disciple partakes
food, reflecting. It’s not for play, intoxication, or to look beautiful.
It’s for the upkeep of this body, not to enjoy soups, to maintain the body
to lead the holy life. I will put an end to earlier feelings, will not
arouse new feelings, so that I may have a pleasant abiding. Mahaanaama,
the noble disciple knows the right amount to partake food thus. Mahaanaama,
how is the bhikkhu wakeful? The noble disciple, during the day, sits in
the chankamana, cleaning the mind of obstructing things. During the first
watch of the night cleaning the mind of obstructing things. During the
middle watch of the night goes to sleep, with the perception of waking,
turning to the right and making the lion’s posture, keeping one foot over
the other. Then in the last watch of the night sits in the chankamana cleaning
the mind of obstructing things. Mahaanaama thus the noble disciple is yoked
to wakefulness. Mahaanaama, what are the seven good things the noble disciple
is endowed with? The noble disciple establishes faith in the enlightenment
of the Thus Gone One. That blessed one is perfect, rightfully enlightened,
endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, knower of worlds, incomparable
tamer of those to be tamed, Teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed.
The noble disciple becomes shameful, of misbehaviour by body, speech and
mind, fearing a fall for demerit and becoming remorseful of such misbehaviour.
Becomes learned and bears that Teaching, which is good at the beginning,
in the middle and end, explaining the complete and pure holy life. Learns
the Teaching by word order, the essential, and experiences the Teaching.
Arouses effort to dispel demerit and accumulate merit. Becomes firm in
the search for merit thoroughly yoked to it.(2) Becomes mindful in the
very minute things done long ago, recalling them at will. Becomes wise,
endowed with the wisdom of the noble ones about the rising and falling
of the five holding masses for the rightful destruction of unpleasantness.
Mahaanaama, the noble disciple is endowed with these seven good things.
Mahaanaama, how does the noble disciple become a gainer for nothing, a
quick gainer, a gainer without difficulty of the four jhaanas and the higher
abidings. Mahaanaama, the noble disciple secluded from sensual desires,
and thoughts of demerit, with thoughts and discursive thoughts and with
joy and pleasantness born of seclusion abides in the first jhaana…in the
second jhaana,…in the third jhaana,…in the fourth jhaana. Mahaanaama, thus
the noble disciple becomes a gainer for nothing, a quick gainer, a gainer
without difficulty of the four jhaanaa the higher abidings of the mind.
<p>Mahaanaama, when the noble disciple is endowed with these virtues. Is
protected in his the mental faculties. Knows the amount, to partake food.
Is yoked to wakefulness. Is endowed with these seven good things, and becomes
a quick gainer without difficulty, of the four jhaanas and the higher abidings
of the mind. It is said, that the trainer has fallen to the method of training
and is ready, for enlightenment, to come to the end of the yoke. Like an
egg, that is ready to hatch. Mahaanaama, when the hen had sat on the eggs
for eight, ten or twelve days and when they are well warmed, and developed,
it would occur to the hen O! When will this chicken safely come out breaking
the shell with their beaks or the nails of their feet. In the same manner,
when the noble disciple, endowed with these virtues, protected in the mental
faculties, knew the amount to partake food, yoked to wakefulness, endowed
with these seven good things, became a quick gainer without difficulty,
of the four jhaanas and the higher abidings of the mind, it is said, the
trainer has fallen to the method of training and is ready, for enlightenment,
to come to the end of the yoke. Mahaanaana, the noble disciple having come
to this purity of mind through equanimity recollects the manifold previous
births such as one birth, two births, ---with all modes and all details
recollects the various previous births. That to him is the first knowledge,
as the chicken that come out of the egg-shell. Mahaanaama, this noble disciple
having come to this purity of mind through equanimity with the heavenly
eye purified above human, sees beings disappearing and appearing in un
exalted and exalted states, beautiful and ugly in good and bad states…
sees beings according their actions. This is the second knowledge, as it
would come to the chicken, that come out of the egg-shell. Mahaanaama,
this noble disciple having come to this purity through equanimity, the
mind released, and released through wisdom abides released here and now.
This to him is the third knowledge, as it would come to the chicken, that
come out of the egg-shell.
<p>Mahaanaama, when the noble disciple is endowed with virtues, that’s
his good conduct. When controlled in the mental faculties, that is his
good conduct. When he knows the right amount to partake food, that is his
good cnduct. When he is yoked to wakefulness, that is his good conduct,
when the noble disciple is endowed with these seven good things, that becomes
his good conduct. Mahaanaama, when the noble disciple is a quick gainer
for nothing, of the four jhaanas, and the higher abidings of the mind,
that’s his good conduct. Mahaanaama, when the noble disciple recollects
the various previous births, that to him is knowledge. With the purified
heavenly eye when he sees beings disappearing and appearing, in good and
bad states, that to him is knowledge. Mahaanaama, when the noble disciple,
destroys desires and abides with the mind released and released through
wisdom, that to him is knowledge. To this, is said the noble disciple is
endowed with knowledge. Thus the noble disciple is endowed with knowledge
and conduct.
<p>Brahma Sanankumaara said this verse about it.
<p>The warrior is the chief among those born into clans
<br>The one endowed with knowledge and conduct is the chief among gods
and men
<br>Mahaanaama, these words of Brahmaa Sanankumaara are good words, full
of meaning. They are accepted by the Blessed One.
<p>Then the Blessed One got up and addressed venerable Aananda: Aananda,
you explained clearly the training of a trainer for enlightenment
<p>Venerable Aananda knew that the Blessed One approves my words
<p>The Sakyas of Kapilavatthu delighted in the words of venerable Aananda,
<p>Notes. 1. The method of training of a trainer, ‘<i>sekho pa.tipadaa</i>’
A sekha is one who has entered the stream of the Teaching, ie. He has attained
at least the first stage of sainthood. ‘<i>sotaapatti magga’</i>
<p>2. With aroused effort for the dispelling of demerit and the accumulation
of merit becomes firm in the search for merit thoroughly yoked to it. ‘<i>thaamavaa
dalhaparakkamo anikkhittadhuro kusalesu dhammesu</i>’ This is to make effort
until one realises extinction. .
