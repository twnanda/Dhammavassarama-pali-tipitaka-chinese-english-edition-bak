release of the mind in loving kindness, is developed thus, none of the
measured actions remain. This is the method to be born with Brahmaa.. Again
the bhikkhu pervades one direction with the thought of compassion,…re….
with intrinsic joy,…re… with equanimity, so too the second, the third,
the fourth, above, below, across, in every respect, in all circumstances,
the entire world, he pervades with equanimity grown great and immeasurable
without anger and ill will. Young man, when the release of the mind in
equanimity, is developed thus, none of the measured actions remain.*1)
Just as a clever drummer in no time would make known the message in the
four directions. In the same manner, when the release of the mind in equanimity
is developed thus, none of the measured actions remain. This is the method
to be born with Brahmaa..’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

the young man Subha the son of Todeyya said. ‘Good Gotama, now I understand.
It is like something overturned is reinstated. Something covered is made
manifest. As though the path is told to someone who has lost his way. It
is as though a light was borne for the darkness, for those who have sight
to see forms. In various ways good Gotama has explained the Teaching. Now
I take refuge in good Gotama, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus.
May good Gotama bear me as a lay disciple from today until life lasts.
Good Gotama, now we go. There’s much work to be done.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

man, go! If you think it is fit.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

young man Subha delighted and pleased, got up from his seat, worshipped
and circumambulated the Blessed One and went away</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>At
that time the Brahmin Jaanussoni, was going through Saavatthi in a completely
white carriage yoked to a mare. Seeing the young man Subha, he asked. ’From
where does good Bhaaradvaaja come at this time?’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>‘Now
I come from the presence of the recluse Gotama.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

does good Bhaaradvaaja think of the wisdom of, recluse Gotama? Do you think
he is wise?’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>‘Who
am I to know the wisdom of the recluse Gotama, it should be done by one
like him, who knows the depth, of his wisdom.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

good Bhaaradvaaja praises the recluse Gotama.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

am I, and who is the recluse Gotama. Indeed those who need praise should
be praised. Good Gotama is the chief among gods and men. The five things
declared by the Brahmins for the accomplishment and accumulation of merit,
he says are the accessories to develop the mind, without anger and ill
will.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>When
this was said, the Brahmin Jaanussoni got down from his white carriage,
arranged his shawl on one shoulder, turning to where the Blessed One was
abiding with clasped hands said. ‘It is gain for king Pasenadi of Kosala,
it is rare gain for him that the Thus Gone One perfect and rightfully enlightened
abides in king Pasenadi Kosala’s kingdom.’<span

1. Young man, when the release of mind in loving kindness is developed
thus, none of the measured actions remain. ‘Eva.m bhaavitaaya kho maanava
mettaaya cetovimuttiyaa ya.m pamaanakata.m kamma.m na ta.m tatraavasissati,
na tam tatraavatitthati.’ The measured actions that remain in the mind
are small bits of greed, hate and delusion, which from time to time pollute
data that come through the six doors of mental contact and promote actions
and reactions through body speech and mind<span
