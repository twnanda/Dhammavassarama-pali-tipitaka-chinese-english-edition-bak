<p class="MsoBodyText">I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One lived in
Anguttaraapa in a hamlet named Aapana in the bazaar. Then the Blessed One
put on robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes entered Aapana for
alms. After returning from the alms round and after the meal was over,
the Blessed One entered a forest stretch and sat at the root of a tree
to spend the day. Venerable Udayi too putting on robes in the morning and
taking bowl and robes entered Aapana for alms. After returning from the
alms round and after the meal was over, entered that same forest stretch
and sat under a certain tree to spend the day. To venerable Udayi in his
seclusion this discursive thought arose: Indeed a lot of our unpleasant
things of demerit are removed by the Blessed One and a lot of pleasant
things of merit reinstated instead. Then, in the evening venerable Udayi
got up from his seclusion, approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat
on a side and said<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Venerable sir,
in my seclusion this discursive thought arose:to me<span 

style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Indeed
a lot of our unpleasant things of demerit are removed by the Blessed One
and a lot of pleasant things of merit reinstated instead. Venerable sir,
in the past we partook food in the evening, early in the morning, during
the day, and at untimely hours. There was a time when the Blessed One addressed
the bhikkhus thus. Come! Bhikkhus, give up partaking food in the day time,
venerable sir, it was disagreeable to me, I was displeased. Some householders
offer us nourishing eatables and drinks out of faith during the day and
at untimely hours. The Blessed One says, give them up. Venerable sir, I
gave up partaking food during the day and at untimely hours out of love,
reverence, shame and remorse for the Blessed One. Venerable sir, in the
past we partook food in the evening, early in the morning, during the day
and at untimely hours. There was a time when the Blessed One addressed
the bhikkhus thus: Come! Bhikkhus, give up partaking food in the night
and at untimely hours. Venerable sir, it was disagreeable to me. I was
displeased. Of the two meals offered the more excellent one the Blessed
One says give up. Venerable sir, a certain man gaining soups in the day,
put them away thinking we will partake them together in the evening. Venerable
sir, all left overs are in the night. There are little left overs during
the day. Venerable sir, I gave up partaking food at night and at untimely
hours out of love, reverence, shame and remorse for the Blessed One. Venerable
sir, in the past, bhikkhus going for alms in the darkness of the night,
fell into pools. At the entrance of the village, fell into dirty water
pools. Climbed on thorny fences, tred on sleeping cows, met young men gone
or not gone for evil, and encountered women calling for evil. Venerable
sir, when I was going for alms in the darkness of the night, a certain
woman was washing pots in the darkness. With a streak of lightening she
saw me and frightened, shouted ‘am caught by a demon’ Then I said to her,
Sister, it is not a demon, it is a bhikkhu standing for alms. Then she
said, Bhikkhu, it is better that you die, isn’t it noble to die, cutting
the belly with the sharp carving knife of a butcher, than to go for alms
for the sake of the belly in the darkness of the night’. Venerable sir,
when I recall these, it occurs to me:. Indeed a lot of our unpleasant things
of demerit are removed by the Blessed One and a lot of pleasant things
of merit reinstated instead’.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Udayi, a
certain foolish man when I say dispel this, would say, what does it matter
to the diligent bhikkhu of this world. The rising to the beyond is for
a recluse*1) So they do not give it up, they arouse aversion for me. For
the bhikkhus, desirous of the training, it is a strong bond, a firm bond,
a not decaying bond, a bond similar to a big log. Udayi, the quail bound
with the decaying creeper, is tortured, bound, and meets death there itself.
Like the quail bound with the decaying creeper is tortured, bound and meets
death there itself, to them that weak bond, decaying bond, useless bond,
would that be a good bond to say it rightly? No, venerable sir. Like the
quail bound with the decaying creeper is tortured, bound and meets death.
It becomes a strong bond, a firm bond, a not decaying bond, like a big
log. Udayi, in this manner a certain foolish man when I say dispel this,
would say, what does it matter to the diligent bhikkhu of this world. The
rising to the beyond is for a recluse; so they do not give it up. They
arouse aversion for me. For the bhikkhus, who are desirous of the training,
it is a strong bond, a firm bond, a not decaying bond, a bond similar to
a big log.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Udayi, to
a certain son of a clansman: I say, dispel this, he would say, I will dispel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>It
is simple for a diligent bhikkhu of this world. If the Blessed One says
give up, we give it up and they give it up and do not arouse aversion for
me. They are desirous of the training. They give it up, live at ease subdued,
fond of being prepared and living calmly. Udayi, to them that bond is weak,
not firm, a decaying bond, an useless bond. Like the leather straps of
the king’s huge elephant with long tusks, gone to the battle Which he would
easily break, bending his body and would go where he wished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Udayi,
if someone was to say, the strong firm leather straps, of the king’s elephant
were strong, firm, bonds. Could be compared to a log of wood. Is he saying
it rightly? No, venerable sir. The strong, firm, leather straps, by which
the king’s elephant was bound, which he broke bending his body and went
where he wished to go. They to him were weak, infirm, decaying, useless
bonds. In the same manner, a certain son of a clansman, when I say, dispel
this. Would say, what is it for the diligent bhikkhu of this world. If
the Blessed One says give up. We give it up, and they give it up and do
not arouse aversion for me. They are desirous of the training. They give
it up, live at ease subdued, fond of being prepared and living calmly.
Udayi, to them that bond is weak, not firm, a decaying bond, a useless
bond.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Udayi, a
poor destitute miserable man, had a single, valueless, rotting and falling
house, in it a bedstead, a single pot to store grains, a fire -place to
cook. He would go to the monastery and see the bhikkhus, with clean hands
and feet partaking of delightful food and sitting in a shady place yoked
to the development of the mind. Then it would occur to him I shall shave
head and beard, put on yellow clothes, and become a homeless. It is not
possible for him to give up that single, valueless, rotting and falling
house, bedstead, pot to store grains and the fire -place. So it is not
possible for him to shave head and beard, put on yellow clothes, and go
forth. Udayi, if someone was to say. It is not possible for this man to
give up that single, valueless, rotting and falling house, bedstead, the
single pot to store grains, and that single fire place, to cook. So it
is not possible for him, to shave head and beard, put on yellow clothes,
and go forth. If someone says, this bond to him is weak, feeble, a decaying
useless bond. Would he be saying it rightly? No, venerable sir. The bonds
by which that man is bound, to the house, that bedstead, that pot to store
grains, and that fire place, on account of which he finds it impossible
to shave head and beard, put on yellow clothes, and go forth as a homeless.
That bond to him is strong, not feeble, firm, not a decaying bond, it is
a huge log. Udayi, in the same manner, I tell a certain foolish man to
dispel. He would say. What does it matter to the diligent bhikkhu of this
world? The rising to the beyond is for a recluse. So does not give it up.
He arouses aversion for me. As for the bhikkhus, who are desirous of the
training, it is a strong bond, a firm bond, a not decaying bond, a bond
similar to a big log.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Udayi, like
a householder or a householder’s son, with wealth, fields, treasures, wives,
slaves male and female of innumerable amounts, gone to the monastery would
see the bhikkhus, partake pleasant food, and sitting under shady trees
yoked to the development of the mind. Then it would occur to him: Indeed
recluseship is pleasant, recluseship is with ease. What if I shaved head
and beard and put on yellow clothes and went forth? It is possible for
him to give up the collection of innumerable wealth, innumerable fields,
innumerable treasures, innumerable number of wives, slaves male and female.
He
would shave head and beard put on yellow clothes and go forth. Udayi, if
someone was to say. It was possible for him to give up all his wealth,
fields, treasures, an innumerable number of wives, slaves male and female,
shave head and beard put on yellow clothes and go forth. As his bond was
weak, not firm, a decaying bond, an useless bond. Would he be saying it
rightly? He would be venerable sir. In the same manner, a certain son of
a clansman: when I say dispel this. Would say, what is it, to the diligent
bhikkhu of this world? If the Blessed One says give up, we give it up.
They give it up and do not arouse aversion for me. They are desirous of
the training. They give it up, live at ease subdued, fond of being prepared
and living calmly. Udayi, to them that bond is weak, not firm, a decaying
bond, an useless bond.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Udayi, there
are four persons evident in the world. What are the four? Udayi, a certain
person falls to the method of dispelling and giving up endearments. Thoughts
about endearments assail him, he endures them, does not dispel them and
make them not to rise again. Udayi, I say this person is yoked. What is
the reason? I know this person through my developped mental faculties.
A certain person, comes to the method of dispelling and giving up endearments.
Thoughts about endearments assail him. He does not endure them, dispels
them and makes them not to rise again. Udayi, I say this person too is
yoked. What is the reason? I know this person through my developped mental
faculties. Udaayi, a certain person falls to the method of dispelling and
giving up endearments. On account of lapses in mindfulness, thoughts about
endearments arise, mindfulness arises to him slowly, and he instantly dispels
them, and makes them not to rise again. Like a man dropping a few drops
of water to an iron pot heated through out the day. The falling of the
water may be slow, but the water vanishes instantly. Udayi, in the same
manner a certain person falls to the method of dispelling and giving up
endearments. On account of lapses in mindfulness, thoughts about endearments
arise, mindfulness arises to him slowly, and he instantly dispels them,
and makes them not to rise again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>I
say this person too is yoked. What is the reason? I know this person through
my developped mental faculties. Uddayi a certain person, knowing that endearments
are the origin of unpeasantness, frees himself from endearments and the
reckonings of endearments and is released*2) Udayi, I say this person is
unyoked. What is the reason? I know this person through my developped mental
faculties. .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span><span 

style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Udayi,
these are the five strands of sensual pleasures: What five? Pleasant agreeable
forms cognizable by eye consciousness, arousing fondness and delight. Sound
cognizable by ear consciousness. Smells cognizable by nose consciousness..Tastes
cognizable by tongue consciousness and touches cognizable by body consciousness,
arousing fondness and delight. Udayi, these are the five strands of sensual
pleasures. Whatever pleasure and pleasantness arises on account of these
five strands of sensual pleasures, are said to be low pleasures, of the
ordinary man, not the pleasures of the nobles ones. These should not be
practised, developed and made much. I say this pleasantness should be feared.
Udayi, the bhikkhu, secluded from sensual desires and thoughts of demerit,
with thoughts and thought processes, and with joy and pleasantness born
from seclusion, abides in the first jhana. Overcoming thoughts and thought
processes, and the mind appeased and in one point, without thoughts and
thought processes and with joy and pleasant born from concentration abides
in the second jhana—third jhana,-- abides in the fourth jhana. This is
the pleasantness of giving up, the pleasantness of seclusion, pleasantness
of appeasement, the pleasantness of enlightenment, which should be practised,
developed, made much and I say this pleasantness should not be feared.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Here, Udayi,
the bhikkhu secluded from sensual desires--- abides in the first jhana<span 

style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Udayi,
I say it is vacillation. So long as the thoughts and thought processes
have not ceased, it is vacillation. Udayi, the bhikkhu overcoming thoughts
and thought processes, abides in the second jhana. Udayi, I say this too
is vacillation. What vacillates in this? So long as joy and pleasantness
have not ceased, it is vacillation. Udayi, the bhikkhu with equanimity
to joy and detachment—abides in the third jhana Udayi, I say this too is
vacillation. What vacillates in this? As long as pleasantness to equanimity
has not ceased, it is vacillation. Udayi the bhikkhu dispelling pleasantness
and unpleasantness—abides in the fourth jhana. Udayi, I say, this does
not vacillate

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Udayi, the
bhikkhu, secluded from sensual desires—abides in the first jhana. Udayi,
I say it is insufficient. Dispel it and go beyond it. What’s beyond it?
Here, Udayi the bhikkhu, overcoming thoughts and thought processes, abides
in the<span 

style="mso-spacerun:

it is insufficient. Dispel it and go beyond it. What’s beyond it? Udayi
the bhikkhu with equanimity to joy and detachment—abides in the third jhana.
This is beyond that. Udayi, I say this too is insufficient. Dispel it and
go beyond it? What’s beyond it. Udayi the bhikkhu dispelling pleasantness
and unpleasantness—abides in the fourth jhana. This is beyond that. Udayi,
I say this too is insufficient. Dispel it and go beyond it..What’s beyond
it?.Udayi the bhikkhu overcoming all perceptions of matter and perceptions
of aversion, not attending to various perceptions, with space is boundless
abides in the sphere of space This is<span 

style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>beyond
that. Udayi, I say this too is insufficient. Dispel it and go beyond it.
What’s beyond it? Udayi, the bhikkhu overcoming all perceptions of space,
with consciousness is boundless abides in the sphere of consciousness This
is<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>beyond that. Udayi, I say this
too is insufficient. Dispel it and go beyond it. What’s beyond it? Udayi,
the bhikkhu overcoming all the sphere of consciousness with there is nothing
abides in the sphere of no-thingness This, is beyond that. Udayi, I say
this too is insufficient, dispel it and go beyond it. What’s beyond? The
bhikkhu overcoming all the sphere of no-thingness abides in the sphere
of neither -perception-nor -non-perception This is beyond that. Udayi,
I say this too is insufficient. Dispel it and go beyond it. What’s beyond
it? The bhikkhu overcoming all the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception
attains to the cessation of perceptions and feelings. Thus Udayi I declare
the dispelling of the sphere of neither-perceptions-nor-non-perceptions.
Udayi, do you see the bond small or large, on account of which I tell you
dispel it?. No, venerable sir.
