<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU>I heard thus.At one time the Blessed
One was living in the deer park in the Bhesakala forest among the Sunsumara
rocks in the Bhagga country. At that time prince Bodhiraja had recently
completed a palace, Kokanada by name which was not yet occupied, by a recluse,
a brahmin or any human. Then prince Bodhiraja addressed a certain young
man Sanjikaputta and said to him. ‘Come! Friend, Sanjikaputta, approach
the Blessed One,<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>worship the Blessed
One, on my behalf and tell thus. ‘Venerable sir, are you in good health,
with few ailments, and do you have a pleasant abiding and tell the Blessed
One: Venerable sir, prince Bodhiraja inquires your health, and likes to
know whether you are with few ailments and have a pleasant abiding and
also tell the Blessed One, may the Blessed One accept tomorrow’s meal at
the palace of prince Bodhiraja together with the community of bhikkhus.’
The young man Sanjikaputta agreed and approached the Blessed One, worshipped
and inquired from the Blessed One about his health and asked, whether he
had few ailments and said. ‘Venerable sir, prince Bodhiraja worships the
feet of good Gotama, and inquires about the health of the Blessed One and
also says. ‘Venerable sir, accept tomorrow’s meal at the palace of prince
Bodhiraja.’ The Blessed One accepted in silence, the young man Sanjikaputta
knowing that the Blessed One had accepted, approached prince Bodhiraja
and said. ‘Good prince Bodhiraja, in your words, I have worshipped the
feet of good Gotama, inquired his health and about his pleasant abiding,
and I also said. May good Gotama accept tomorrow’s meal together with the
Community of bhikkhus at the palace of prince Bodhiraja.Good Gotama has
accepted it.’ Then prince Bodhiraja, at the end of<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>that
night made preparations of various nourishing eatables and drinks, and
covered the palace Kokananda completely with white cloth as far as the
lowest step of the stair case. Then he addressed the young man Sanjikaputta
and said. ’Come friend, Sanjikaputta, approach the Blessed One, and tell,
Venerable sir, it’s time for the meal, the food is ready.’ The young man
Sanjikaputta agreed and approaching the Blessed One said. ‘Venerable sir,
the meal is ready.’ Then the Blessed One putting on robes in the morning,
taking bowl and robes approached the palace of prince Bodhiraja. At that
time prince Bodhiraja was standing at the entrance of the palace expecting
the arrival of the Blessed One. Seeing the Blessed One coming in the distance
went forward, worshipped and followed the Blessed One up to the palace.
The Blessed One stood at the lowest step of the stairs. Then prince Bodhiraja
said thus to the Blessed One ‘Venerable sir, walk on the cloth, for my
pleasantness and well being for a long time.’ When this was said, the Blessed
One was silent. For the second time prince Bodhiraja said thus to the Blessed
One. ‘Venerable sir, walk on the cloth, for my pleasantness and well being
for a long time.’ When this was said, the Blessed One was silent, for the
second time. For the third time prince Bodhiraja said thus to the Blessed.
One. ‘Venerable sir, walk on the cloth, for my pleasantness and well being
for a long time.’The Blessed One looked at venerable Ananda’s face. Venerable
Ananda, said thus to prince Bodhiraja. ‘Royal prince, fold the cloth laid
for treading, for the sake of the future generation. The Thus gone One
does not tread on the cloth.’<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then
prince Bodhiraja folded the cloth laid for treading and prepared the seats
in the upper storey of the Kokanada palace. The Blessed One ascended the
kokanada palace and sat on the prepared seats, together with the Community
of bhikkhus. Then prince Bodhiraja with his own hands served and satisfied
the Community of bhikkhus headed by the Blessed One with the nourishing
food and drinks. When the Blessed One had finished the meal and had put
away the bowl, prince Bodhiraja took a low seat, sat on a side, and said
thus. ‘Venerable sir, it occurs to me that pleasantness could not be attined
by pleasantness, it has to be attained, with unpleasantness.’<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Royal
prince, before my enlightenment, when I was a seeker of enlightenment,
it occurred to me, with pleasantness, pleasantness could not be attained,
with unpleasantness, pleasantness could be attained. When I was young,
even with black hair a subject of birth sought only birth, a subject of
decay sought only decay, a subject of illness sought only illness, a subject
of death sought only death, a subject of grief sought<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>only
grief, .a subject of defilements, sought only defiling things. Royal prince,
I reflected subject to birth, why should I seek that, subject to illness,
why should I seek that, subject to death, why should I seek that, subject
to grief, why should I seek that, subject to defiling things, why should
I seek that, subject of birth, knowing the dangers of birth; why shouldn’t
I seek that noble end of the yoke extinction? I, a subject of decay, knowing
its dangers why shouldn’t I seek that not decaying noble end of the yoke?
I, a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>subject<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>illness,
.knowing its dangers, why shouldn’t I seek that not ailing<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>noble
end of the yoke? I, a subject of death, knowing its dangers, why shouldn’t
I seek that deathless noble end of the yoke? I, a subject of grief, knowing
its dangers, why shouldn’t I seek that griefless noble end of the yoke
extinction? I, a subject to defiling, knowing its dangers, why shouldn’t
I seek that not defiling noble end of the yoke extinction?’

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>When
in the prime of youth, even with black hair, against the wish of mother
and father, when they were crying with tearing eyes,<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>I
shaved head and beard, donned yellow robes left the household<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>became<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>homeless
and becoming a seeker of good and a seeker of the incomparable peaceful
state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then I approached Aalaara
Kaalaama and said, venerable one, I want to lead the holy life in this
dispensation. Come friend, the wise like you before long realise this teaching
and abide like the teacher. Royal prince, I quickly learned that Teaching
to acknowledge I know and I see by uttering and reciting as the elders
did. Then it occurred to me merely with this faith Aalaara Kaalaama would
not acknowledge, I abide knowing and realising this Teaching, indeed he
abides knowing and seeing this teaching. Then I approached, Aalaara Kaalaama
and asked him. ‘Venerable one, how do you abide knowing and realising this
teaching?’ When I asked Aalaara Kaalaama declared the sphere of nothingness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then
it occurred to me, it is not only Aalaara Kaalaama who has faith, effort,
mindfulness, concentration and wisdom. I too have faith, effort, mindfulness,
concentration and wisdom. What, if I arouse effort to realise this Teaching
realised, by him? Before long I realised that Teaching and abode. Then
I approached Aalaara Kaalaama and asked. ’Venerable one, is it this much,
the teaching you have realised and abide?’ ‘Friend, it is this much only,
the teaching that I have realised, declare and abide’. Then I said. ‘I
too have realised this much and abide.’ ‘Venerable one, it is rare gain
for us to meet co-associates like you in the holy life. That whatever Teaching
I have realised and abide, that, you have realised and abide. So that,
whatever Teaching I know, that, you know. Now the two of us are on equal
grounds. Let the two of us together guide this following. Royal prince,
it was in this manner, that my teacher, Aalaara Kaalaama honoured me, his
pupil, giving me equal status. Then it occurred to me. This teaching does
not lead to giving up, detachment, cessation, appeasement, knowledge enlightenment
and extinction. It leads up to the sphere of no-thingness only, not satisfied
I turned away from it.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Becoming
a seeker of good, and in search of the incomparable peaceful state, I<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>approached,
Uddaka Raamaputta and said. ‘Venerable one, I want to lead the holy life
in this dispensation. Come friend, wise ones like you, before long realise
this teaching and abide like the teacher. Royal prince, I quickly learned
that teaching, to acknowledge I know and I see by uttering and reciting

Raamaputta would not acknowledge I abide knowing and realising this Teaching,
indeed he abides knowing and seeing this Teaching. Then I approached Uddaka
Raamaputta and asked him. ‘Venerable one, how do you abide knowing and
realising this teaching?’ When I asked, Uddaka Ramaputta declared the sphere
of neither perception-nor non-perception. Royal prince, then it occurred
to me, it is not only Uddaka Ramaputta who has faith, effort, mindfulness,
concentration and wisdom I too have faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration
and wisdom. What if I put forth effort to realise this teaching, realised
by him. Before long I realised that teaching and abode. Then I approached
Uddaka Ramaputta and asked, venerable one, is it this much, the Teaching,
you have realised and abide. Friend, it is this much only, the Teaching,
that I have realised, declare and abide Then I said, I too have realised
this much and abide. ‘Venerable one, it is rare gain for us, to meet co-associates
like you in the holy life. That whatever teaching, I have realised and
abide, that same you too have realised and abide. So that whatever Teaching
I know, that Teaching, you too know. Now the two of us are on equal grounds.
‘Come! friend, you guide this following.’ Thus Uddaka Raamaputta my co-associate
honoured me as his teacher. Then it occurred to me, this Teaching does
not lead to giving up, detachment, cessation, appeasement, knowledge enlightenment
and extinction. It leads up to the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception
only, not satisfied I turned away from it.

Gotama. What is the reason..That wet, sappy log of wood put in the water,
rubbed with the over cover, will not produce fire that man will reap only
fatigue. Royal prince, in the same way, whoever recluses or brahmins, abide
not even bodily secluded from sensuality that sensual interest, sensual
need, sensual stupor, sensual thirst, sensual burning not well turned out
internally, experience sharp rough unpleasant feelings and it is not possible
that they should realise knowledge and vision and noble enlightenment.

I partook of food in trifling amounts, the essence of, green grams, peas,

much. It seemed like I had reached my eightieth year or had come to the

owing to taking trifling amounts of food.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>When
I touched the skin of the stomach, I got hold of the backbone. When excreting
or urinating, I fell face downwards. If I touched the body to appease it,
the hairs of the body decayed at the roots, fell off. Thus was my body
owing to taking trifling amounts of food. People seeing me said, the recluse
Gotama is dark. One man said, he is not dark but tan. Another man said
the recluse Gotama is neither dark nor tan but golden hued. Royal prince,
my pure skin complexion was destroyed owing to partaking trifling amounts
of food.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-ansi-language:

prince, then it occurred to me, whoever recluse or brahmin experienced
sharp, rough, unpleasant feelings, in the past, he<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>did
not experience anything more than this. Whoever recluse or brahmin, would
experience sharp rough unpleasant feelings in the future, would not experience
anything more than this. Whoever recluse or brahmin experiences sharp,
rough, unpleasant feelings, at present, he does not experience anything
more than this. It occurred to me: Doing these difficult exertions, I will
not attain, any noble distinctive knowledge and vision above human. There
should be some other method for the realisation of enlightenment. Then
royal prince, I recalled the experience under the shade of the rose apple
tree near my father’s field: Secluded from sensual thoughts and secluded
from thoughts of demerit, with thoughts and discursive thoughts and with
joy and pleasantness born of seclusion, how I attained to abode in the
first jhana. Then consciousness arose this is the path to enlightenment.
I thought, why should I fear this pleasantness, which is other than sensual
pleasure and away from thoughts of demerit.<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-ansi-language:

prince, then it occurred to me, it is not easy to attain that pleasantness
with this emaciated body, what if I take some coarse food some cooked rice
and bread. At that time the fivefold bhikkhus attended on me, thinking
whatever noble thing the recluse Gotama attains he will inform us. When
I partook of coarse food such as cooked rice and bread, they went away
disgusted, thinking the recluse Gotama has given up exerting and has returned
to abundance.<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-ansi-language:

partaking coarse food and gaining strength, secluded from sensual thoughts
and thoughts of demerit with thoughts and discursive thoughts and with
joy and pleasantness born of seclusion attained to abode in the first jhana..
Overcoming thoughts and discursive thoughts, with the mind internally appeased,
and brought to a single point, without thoughts and without discursive
thoughts and with joy and pleasantness born of concentration attained to
abode in the second jhana.. With joy and with equanimity to detachment
abode mindful and aware, and with the body experienced pleasantness too.
To this abiding the noble ones said, abiding mindfully in pleasantness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>I
attained to abode.in that third jhana. Dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness,
and earlier having dispelled pleasure and displeasure, without unpleasantness
and pleasantness and mindfulness purified with equanimity, attained<span

abode in the fourth jhana..&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>When
the mind was concentrated, pure, free from minor defilements, malleable
workable not disturbed, I directed the mind for the knowledge of previous
births.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>I recollected the manifold
previous births, one birth, two births, three, four, five, ten, twenty,
thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand
births, innumerable forward cycles of births, innumerable backward cycles
of births, innumerable forward and backward cycles of births. There I was
of such name, clan, disposition, supports, experiencing such pleasant and
unpleasant feelings and with such a life span. Disappearing from there
was born there with such name, clan, disposition, supports, experiencing
such pleasant and unpleasant feelings, with such a life span, disappearing
from there, is born here. Thus with all modes and all details I recollected
the manifold previous births. Royal prince, this is the first knowledge
I attained in the first watch of the night, ignorance dispelled, knowledge
arose, as it happens to those abiding diligent for dispelling. .

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>When
the mind was concentrated, pure, free from minor defilements malleable
workable not disturbed, I directed the mind for the knowledge of the disappearing
and appearing of beings. With the heavenly eye purified beyond human, I
saw beings disappearing and appearing unexalted and exalted, beautiful
and ugly, arising in good and bad states according to their actions: These
good beings misbehaving by body, speech and mind, blaming noble ones, with
the wrong view of actions, after death are born in loss, in decrease, in
hell. As for these good beings, well behaved in body speech and mind, not
blaming noble ones, with the right view of actions after death are born
in heaven. Thus with the heavenly eye purified beyond human I saw beings
disappearing and appearing. Royal prince, this is the second knowledge
I attained in the second watch of the night, ignorance dispelled, knowledge
arose, as it happens to those abiding diligent for dispelling.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>When
the mind was concentrated, pure, free from minor defilements, malleable
workable not disturbed, I directed the mind for the destruction of desires.
I knew, this is unpleasant, this is the arising of unpleasantness, this
is the cessation of unpleasantness and this is the path to the cessation
of unpleasantness as it really is. I knew these are desires this the arising
of desires this the cessation of desires and this the path<span

of<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>desires<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>as
it really is. When I knew and saw this the mind was released from sensual
desires, from the desires ‘to be’ and from the desires of ignorance. When
released knowledge arose. I’m released, birth is destroyed, what should
be done, is done, the holy life is lived, I knew, there is nothing more
to wish.</span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Royal
prince, it occurred to me. This Teaching that I have realised is deep,
difficult to see, and understand, appeased and exalted, cannot be realised
logically, is clever and should be understood by the wise. The populace
fond of settling and attached to settling, does not see this difficult
point, that dependent arising is from this cause. This point too is difficult
to see, that is the appeasement of all determinations.and the giving up
of all endearments, destruction of craving, detachment, cessation and extinction.
If I teach this to others they would not understand, and I would only reap
fatigue.Then this wonderful stanza occurred to me.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>I
attained it with difficulty, why should I proclaim it,

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>By
those overcome by greed and hate, this is difficult to be understood

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Clever
and going against the stream is deep and difficult to see

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>The
greedily attached do not see it, shrouded with a mass of darkkness.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Royal
prince, when I reflected this, my mind bent to non-action, and not to teach.
Then to Brahma Sahampathi who knew my mind, this thought occurred, the
world will disappear, it will vanish, that the Thus gone One has made up
the mind to non-action and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>not<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>declaring<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Teaching
. Then Brahma Sahampati vanished from the brahma world and appeared before
me, as a strong man would stretch his bent arm or bend his stretched arm.
Brahma Sahampati arranging the shawl on one shoulder and clasping hands
towards the Blessed One entreated me. May the Blessed One teach. There
are beings with little defilements, who would fall on account of not hearing
the Teaching. There will be those who would realise the Teaching, and Brahma
Sahampati further said thus.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>In
the past the Teaching arose in Magadha, impure with blemish.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Open
the door to deathlessness sir, by making the pure Teaching to be heard.
.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

a man on top of a rocky mountain would see the populace on all sides

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

one, the comparison is that, ascend the rock and teach.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Remove
the grief of the populace drenched in grief, look at them overcome by birth<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

get steady and win the battle, leading charioteer, abide in the world without

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

the Blessed One teach, there will be those who understand.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Heeding
the entreaty of Brahma, and out of compassion for beings, I looked with
the eye of the Enlightened One and saw beings with little defilements and
with much defilements, with sharp mental faculties and weak mental faculties,
with good dispositions and weak dispositions, and certain ones abiding
fearing the other world.. Like in a set of blue lotuses, red lotuses and
white lotuses, a certain one would be born in the water grow and develop
in the water and would bloom below the level of<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>the
water. Some others would be born in the water grow and develop and bloom
in the level of the water and certain others would be born in the water,
grow and develop and stand right above the water and bloom. In the same
manner I saw beings with little defilements and<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>much
defilements, with sharp mental faculties, and weak mental faculties, with
good dispositions and weak dispositions and certain ones fearing the other
world. Then I replied to Brahma Sahampati saying a stanza.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]><o:p></o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">.<span style="mso-spacerun:

I have opened the doors of deathlessness,

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

those who have ears be released through faith,

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

Brahma Sahampati knowing I have made it possible for the Teaching to be
heard, worshipped the Blessed One circumambulated<span

vanished from there it self.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">.<span style="mso-spacerun:

it occurred to me to whom shall I give the first discourse, then I thought
this Alara Kalama is very wise, has been with few defilements for a long
time, if I give the first discourse to him, he will indeed realise this
Teaching very quickly. Then the gods approached me and told venerable sir,
he passed away seven days ago. Knowledge, arose its seven days since he
passed away. Then it occurred to me, Aalaara Kaalaama is wise if he had
heard this Teaching, he would have realised it quickly. Again, it occurred
to me, to whom shall give the first discourse. Uddaka Ramaputta is very
wise and has long been with little defilements. If I give the first discourse
to him, he will learn the Teaching quickly. Then the gods approached and
told. ‘Venerable sir, he passed away last night’. Then knowledge arose,
he passed away last night. Again it occurred to me, to whom shall I preach
the first discourse and who will know this Teaching quickly. Then it occurred
to me, these fivefold bhikkhus were of great help, they attended on me
until I gave up striving resolutely. Then it occurred to me, where are
the fivefold bhikkhus living at present, then with my purified heavenly
eye I saw them abiding in the deer park in Isipatana in Benares, After
living as long as I wished in Uruwela, left to go to Benares by<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>stages

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>On
the way I met the wandering ascetic Upaka, between Gaya and the Bo tree

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

bhikkhus, in stages coming to Benares, to Isipatana and to the deer park,
I approached the fivefold bhikkhus. They seeing me approaching from a distance
settled among themselves. This is that recluse Gotama who gave up striving
and returned to a life of abundance we should not worship or attend on
him and should not accept his bowl and robes, will prepare a seat, if he
likes he may sit. Bhikkhus, as I approached closer and closer, the fivefold
bhikkhus could not keep to their settlement, one approached to accept the
bowl and robes, one prepared a seat, one placed water to wash the feet,
yet they addressed me by name. Then I told the fivefold bhikkhus. ‘Bhikkhus,
do not address the Thus Gone One by name or as friend. The Thus Gone One
is perfect and rightfully enlightened. Bhikkhus, to attain deathlessness
listen. I will advice. Those following the method according to the advice
given, before long, for whatever purpose sons of clansmen leave the household
and become homeless, that highest end of the holy life they attain here
and now and abide.’ When this was said the fivefold bhikkhus said thus:
‘Friend, Gotama, with that deportment, that method, and that difficult
striving, you did not attain any distinct knowledge and vision above human,
now having abandoned that striving and gone to abundance, what distinct
knowledge and vision above human have you attained?’ ‘Bhikkhus, the Thus
Gone One is perfect, rightfully enlightened, lend ear, I will advice to
attain deathlessness. Those following the method according to the advice
given, before long, for whatever purpose sons of clansmen leave the household
and become homeless, that highest end of the holy life they attain here
and now and abide.’ For the second time the fivefold bhikkhus told me.
‘Friend, Gotama, with that deportment, that method, and that difficult
striving, you did not attain any distinct knowledge and vision above human.
Now, having abandoned that striving and gone to abundance, what distinct
knowledge and vision above human have you attained?’ For the third time
the fivefold bhikkhus said thus. ‘Friend, Gotama, with that deportment,
that method, and that difficult striving, you did not attain any distinct
knowledge and vision above human. Now, having abandoned that striving and
gone to abundance, what distinct knowledge and vision above human have
you attained?’ When this was said, Royal prince I asked the fivefold bhikkhus.
‘Do you know me of talking like this before?’ They said. ‘No, venerable
sir.’ I said. ‘Bhikkhus, the Thus Gone One is perfect, rightfully enlightened,
lend ear, I will advice to attain deathlessness. Those following the method
according to the advice given, before long, for whatever purpose sons of
clansmen leave the household and become homeless, that highest end of the
holy life, you attain here and now and abide.’ ‘Bhikkhus, I could convince
the fivefold bhikkhus. Then I would advise two bhikkhus, and three would
go for alms, out of what is brought by three bhikkhus, each is supported
on one sixth. I sometimes advise three bhikkhus, and two go for alms, out
of what is brought, each is supported on one sixth. Royal prince, the fivefold
bhikkhus, thus instructed and advised by me before long, knowing, realising,
attained to abode, in the noble end of the holy life, here and now.’

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>When
this was said prince Bodhiraja said thus to the Blessed One. ‘How long
does the Thus Gone One train bhikkhus, to attain the noble end of the holy
life.?’

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then
the Blessed One said, I will cross question you on this and reply it as
it pleases you. ‘Royal prince, are you clever in riding elephants and handling
the elephant hook?’ ‘Yes venerable sir, I’m clever in riding elephants
and handling the elephant hook.’ ‘A man comes, saying prince Bodhiraja
is clever in riding elephants, and handling the elephant hook. I will learn
the art of riding elephants and handling the elephant hook<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>from
the prince. He has no faith, and whatever could be attained through faith
that he does not attain. He has many ailments, and whatever attained, by

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

sir a man with even one of those qualities would not learn the art of riding
elephants or the art of handling the elephant hook. How could he learn

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Royal

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

the same manner, royal prince, establishing on these five factors, effort
