<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

heard thus.<span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>At one time
the Blessed One lived with the Koliyas, in a hamlet named Haliddavasana.
Punna the Koliya, who observed the habits of cattle and naked Seniya who
observed the habits of dogs approached the Blessed One. Punna the Koliya
who observed the habits of cattle worshipped the Blessed One and sat on
a side. Naked Seniya who observed the habits of dogs exchanged friendly
greetings with the Blessed One, and curling up like a dog, sat on a side.
Then Punna the observer of cattle habits said to the Blessed One.’Venerable
sir, this naked Seniya, observer of dog habits, observe difficult vows,
partaking food thrown on the ground, has been observing these vows since
long. After death where would his consciousness move? What would be his
birth?’ ‘Punna, leave it alone, do not ask me.’ For the second and up to
the third time, Punna the observer of cattle habits said to the Blessed
One. ’Venerable sir, this naked Seniya, observer of dog habits, observe
difficult vows, partaking food thrown on the ground, has been observing
these vows since long. After death where would his consciousness move?
What would be his birth?’ ‘Indeed Punna, even when I refused to declare
it, you entreat me to tell it. Now I will tell you. Punna, a certain one
observes, the vows and virtues of a dog complete, without an interval.
Develops the mind and the ways of a dog complete, without an interval.
After death he is born with the dogs. If he, maintains the view, leading
this holy life and keeping my vows, I will be born a god, or among gods.
That is his wrong view. Punna, for wrong view, there are two behaviours
of the mind either hell or birth in the animal world*1). So Punna, with
the completion of those vows he will be born with the dogs or in hell.’&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>When
this was said, naked Seniya, the observer of dog habits cried aloud tears
streaming down his face. The blessed One said. ‘I told Punna, I refused
to declare it, and you entreated me.’ ‘Venerable sir I do not cry because
the Blessed One has declared this. We have been observing these vows for
a long time.’ Seniya the observer of dog habits said to the Blessed One.
‘Venerable sir, this Punna son of the Koliyas, observing cattle habits,
has observed these vows, since long. After death, where would his consciousness
move? What would be his birth?’<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Seniya,
leave it alone, do not ask me.’ For the second and up to the third time,
Seniya the observer of dog habits said to the Blessed One. ‘Venerable sir,
this Punna the koliya observing cattle habits, has been observing these
vows since long. After death where would his consciousness move?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>What
would be his birth?’ ‘Indeed Seniya, even when I refused to declare it,
you entreated me. Now I will tell you. Seniya, a certain one observes the
vows and virtues of cattle complete, without an interval. Develops the
mind and ways of cattle complete, without an interval. After death he is
born with cattle. If he, maintains the view, leading this holy life and
keeping my vows, I will be born a god, or among gods. That would be his
wrong view. Seniya, for wrong view, there are two behaviours of the mind
either hell or birth in the animal world. Seniya, with the completion of
those vows, he will be born with cattle or in hell.’<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>When
this was said, Punna, the son of the Koliyas, observing vows of the cattle
cried aloud with tears streaming down the face. Then the Blessed One said.
‘Seniya. I told you, I refused to declare it. You entreated me.’ ‘Venerable
sir, I do not cry because the Blessed One declared it. We have been observing
these vows since long. I’m pleased with the Blessed One. The Blessed One
can preach the Teaching so that I could give up my cattle vows and this
naked Seniya his dog vows.’ ‘Then Punna, attend carefully I will teach.’
Punna the son of the Koliyas agreed and the Blessed One said.:

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Punna,
these four are the actions by me realised and declared. What are the four?
Punna, there are dark actions with dark results. There are pure actions
with pure results. There are dark and pure actions with dark and pure results
and there are neither dark nor pure actions, with neither dark nor pure
results. Punna, a certain one intends troublesome bodily behaviour, troublesome
verbal behaviour and troublesome mental behaviour*2). Intending troublesome
bodily, verbal and mental behaviour is born in a world of troubles, feeling
troublesome feelings that are only unpleasant. Like beings born in hells.
Punna, the done, brings birth to the doer.*3)The one born feels those contacts.
On account of that, I say beings are the heirs of their actions. To these
are said dark actions with dark results. Punna, what are pure actions with
pure results? Punna, a certain one intends non-troublesome bodily behaviour
intends non-troublesome verbal behaviour and intends non-troublesome mental
behaviour. Intending non-troublesome bodily, verbal and mental behaviour
is born in a world free from troubles. Born in a world free from troubles,
feels untroubled feelings that are only pleasant. Like beings born in complete
happiness. Punna, actions and results bring birth to the doer. The one
born feels those contacts. On account of that I say beings are the heirs
of their actions. Punna, these are pure actions with pure results. Punna
what are dark and pure actions with dark and pure results? Punna, a certain
one intends troublesome and non-troublesome bodily behaviour troublesome
and non-troublesome verbal behaviour and troublesome and non-troublesome
mental behaviour. Intending troublesome and non-troublesome bodily, verbal
and mental behaviour is born in a world with and without troubles, and
feels feelings pleasant and unpleasant, like beings born as humans. They
are once godly and another time hellish Punna, actions and results bring
birth to the doer. The born, feels those contacts. On account of that I
say beings are the heirs of their actions. Punna, these are pure and dark
actions with pure and dark results. Punna what are neither dark nor pure
actions with neither dark nor pure results that lead to the destruction
of actions? Punna, to dispel dark actions with dark results, an intention
is made. To dispel, pure actions with pure results an intention is made.
.To dispel dark and pure actions with dark and pure results, an intention
is made. Punna to this is said neither dark nor pure actions that bring
neither dark nor pure results.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>They
lead to the destruction of actions. Punna, these are the four actions by
me realised and declared.’

<p class="MsoBodyText3" style="margin-right:0in"><span lang=EN-AU><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>When
this was said, Punna the son of the Koliyas who observed the cattle vows
said. ‘Now I&nbsp;</span><span lang=EN-AU
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>understand
it. Venerable sir, it is as though something over turned was reinstalled.
As something covered was made manifest. As though the path was told to
one who had lost his way. As though an oil lamp was lighted for the dark
for those with sight to see forms. I take refuge in the Blessed One, in
the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. May the Blessed One bear me
as one taken refuge from today until life lasts.’ The naked Seniya observing
dog vows said to the Blessed One: ‘Now I understand it venerable sir. It
is as though something over turned was reinstalled. As something covered
was made manifest. As though the path was told to one who had lost his
way, As though an oil lamp was lighted for the dark for those with sight
to see forms The Blessed One has explained the Teaching in various ways.
Now I take refuge in the Blessed One in the Teaching and the Community
of bhikkhus. May I gain the going forth, and the higher ordination, in
the dispensation of the Blessed One.’ ‘Seniya, those of another sect seeking
the going forth and the higher ordination in this Dispensation should be
on probation for four months. After the four months, if the bhikkhus are
satisfied, they would give the going forth and the higher ordination. It
is to see the differnce in the person.’ ‘Venerable sir if one of another
sect would have to be on probation for four months, I would be on probation
for four years. May the bhikkhus, when satisfied give me the going forth
and the higher ordination.’ Seniya, who was the observer of the dog vows
gained the going forth and the higher ordination. Soon after the higher
ordination, venerable Seniya, abode withdrawn from the crowd, diligent
for dispelling. He attained that highest end of the yoke, for which sons
of clansmen rightfully leave the household and become homeless. He here
and now realized and abode in it and knew, birth is destroyed, the holy
life is lived, what should be done is done, there is nothing more to wish..<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Notes.

<p class="MsoBodyText2"><span lang=EN-AU>1. For wrong view there are two
behaviours of consciousness either hell or birth in the animal world.’micchaadi.t.tikassa
kho aha.m Punna dvinna.m gatiina.m a~n~natara.m gati.m vadaami niraya.m
vaa tiracchaana yoni.m vaa‘To behave like cattle or dogs, people have to
think much about their behaviour, and have to probe into the minds of animals
to know how they think. These kinds of mental actions take one to the animal
world here and now. Practising that behaviour much, leads one to the animal
world, here and now and after death too. When humans behave like animals,
they undergo much difficulty and they are here and now in hell. Again when
born as animals, they undergo much difficulty as though,<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>in
hell.&nbsp;</span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>2.
A certain one intends troublesome bodily behaviour, intends troublesome
verbal behaviour<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>and intends troublesome
mental behaviour.<i> ‘sabyaabajjha.m kaayasankhaara.m abhisankharoti sabyaabajjha.m
vaciisankhaara,m abhisankharoti sabyaabajjha.m manosankhaara.m abhisankharot</i>i’
Here it is quite clear that the Blessed One alludes this to the two observers
of cattle vows and dog vows. With difficulty and hard straining they have
to think how cattle and dogs think, behave, act, eat, urinate, excrete
and how they do everything else, and bearing up all the difficulty, they
go on practising these difficult vows, to gain only very bad results. To
be born undoubtedly in a worse state than in which they now are. Here the
Blessed One clearly shows that intentions are what really matters for one’s
actions. These two are here and now in unpleasantness in hell.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">3 The done brings birth
to the doer. ‘iti kho Punna bhuutaa bhuutassa uppattii hoti, ya.m karoti
tena uppajjati<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘ This means whatever
may be the intended actions of someone, it brings him future results of
birth, decay, death etcetra. In whatever fields he had his intentions,
in sensuality, in materiality or in immateriality, in that and the other
sphere he is born, even here and now and also after death.
