<p class="MsoBodyText">I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One was living
in the squirrels’ sanctuary in the bamboo grove in Rajagaha. Then the wandering
ascetic Vacchagotta approached the Blessed One, exchanged friendly greetings
and sat on a side and said, to the Blessed One. ‘It’s a long time since,
we could have a conversation with good Gotama. We like to know merit and
demerit in short.’ ‘Vaccha, I will tell you merit and demerit in short
and in detail as well. Now listen to it in short, I will tell you’. The
wandering ascetic Vacchagotta agreed and the Blessed One said thus:

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Vaccha,
greed is demerit, non-greed is merit. Anger is demerit and non-anger is
merit. Delusion is demerit and non-delusion is merit. Vaccha these three
are demerit, and the other three are merit. Vaccha, destroying life is
demerit, abstaining from destroying life is merit. Taking what is not given
is demerit, abstaining from taking what is not given is merit. Misbehaviour
in sexuality is demerit, abstaining from misbehaviour in sexuality is merit.
Telling lies is demerit, abstaining from telling lies is merit. Slandering
is demerit, abstaining from slandering is merit. Rough talk is demerit,
abstaining from rough talk is merit. Frivolous talk is demerit and abstaining
from frivolous talk is merit. Coveting is demerit, abstaining from coveting
is merit. Bearing an angry mind is demerit and a not angry mind is merit.
Wrong view is demerit and right view is merit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Vaccha,
these ten are demerit and the other ten are merit. Vaccha, when the bhikkhu,
dispels craving pulls it out with the roots, makes it a palm stump, and
makes it a thing that does not grow again, that bhikkhu is perfect..He
is with desires destroyed, the holy life lived, done what should be done,
the weight put down He has come to the highest good, with the bond ‘to
be’ destroyed He rightfully knowing, is released.’.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Good, Gotama,
wait! Is there a single bhikkhu a disciple of Gotama, who has destroyed
desires, has released the mind from desires and released through wisdom,
abiding, here and now?’ ‘Vaccha, not one, not one hundred, not two hundred,
not three hundred, not four hundred, not five hundred. There are many more
bhikkhus, disciples of mine, who have destroyed desires, the mind released
from desires and released through wisdom, here and now abiding.’ ‘Good,
Gotama, wait! Let alone bhikkhus. Is there a single bhikkhuni a disciple
of Gotama, who has destroyed desires has released the mind from desires
and released through wisdom, here and now, have realised?’ ‘Vaccha, not
one, not one hundred, not two hundred, not three hundred, not four hundred,
not five hundred. There are many, more bhikkhunis, disciples of mine, who
have destroyed desires, the mind released from desires and released through
wisdom, here and now realising abide’. ‘Good, Gotama, wait! Other than
bhikkhus, and bhikkhunis.Is there a single lay disciple of Gotama, who
wearing white clothes had led the holy life, has destroyed the five lower
bonds to the sensual world, and is born spontaneously, not to proceed?’
‘Vaccha, not one, not one hundred, not two hundred, not three hundred,
not four hundred, not five hundred. There are many more lay disciples of
mine, who have destroyed the five lower bonds to the sensual world, and
born spontaneously would not proceed.’ ‘Good, Gotama, wait! Other than<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>bhikkhus,
bhikkhunis and lay disciples of Gotama, who wear white clothes and lead
the holy life. Is there a single a lay disciple, who wears white clothes,
leads the holy life, while partaking sensual pleasures, and doing the work
in the dispensation has dispelled doubts. Has become confident of what
should and should not be done, and does not need a teacher any more in
the dispensation of the Teacher. Vaccha, not one, not one hundred, not
two hundred, not three hundred, not four hundred, not five hundred. There
are many more lay disciples of mine, wearing white clothes leading<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>the
holy life, while partaking sensual pleasures and doing the work in the
dispensation have dispelled doubts Have become confident of what should
and should not be done and do not need a teacher any more.’ ‘Good, Gotama,
wait! Other than the bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, the lay disciples who have arisen
spontaneously and will not proceed, and the ones who have entered the stream
of the Teaching and are confident,.is there a single female lay disciple
of good Gotama. Who wears white clothes leads the holy life has destroyed
the five lower bonds to the sensual world, and is born spontaneously not
to proceed’ ‘Vaccha, not one, not one hundred, not two hundred, not three
hundred, not four hundred, not five hundred. There are many more female
lay disciples of mine, who have destroyed the five lower bonds to the sensual
world, and are born spontaneously not to proceed.’ ‘Good, Gotama, wait!
Other than the bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, lay disciples arisen spontaneously
who would not proceed and the ones who have entered the stream of the Teaching
and are confident and the lay female disciples who have arisen apontaneously
not to proceed is there is a single female lay disciple. Who wears white
clothes leads the holy life, while partaking sensual pleasures, and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>doing
the work in the dispensation has dispelled doubts, has become confident,
of what should and should not be done and does not need a teacher any more.’‘Vaccha,
not one, not one hundred, not two hundred, not three hundred, not four
hundred, not five hundred. There are many more female lay disciples of
mine wearing white clothes lead the holy life, while partaking sensual
pleasures, doing the work in the dispensation have dispelled doubts. Have
become confident of what should and should not be done. They do not need
a teacher any more in the dispensation of the Teacher.

who partake sensual pleasures are<span 

style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>perfcted,
this holy life is complete.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Good Gotama,
like the Ganges, which bends towards the ocean, and flows straight into
the ocean, likewise the gathering of good Gotama, those gone forth together
with the householders are bent towards and stand close to extinction. Good
Gotama, now I understand. It’s like something over turned is reinstalled.
As something covered is made manifest. As the path is told to someone who
had lost his way. As though an oil lamp was lighted for the darkness, for
those who have sight to see forms.Good Gotama, the Teaching is explained
in various ways. Now I take refuge in good Gotama, in the Teaching and
the Community of bhikkhus. May I gain the going forth and the higher ordination
in the dispensastion of good Gotama.’Vaccha, one of another sect desiring
the going forth and the higher ordination in this dispensation, should
wait four months, as a perid of probation. At the end of which time the
bhikkhus pleased would give him the going forth and the higher ordination.
It is to test the personal differences’. ‘Venerable sir, if one of another
sect desiring the going forth and the higher ordination have to wait four
months, on probation. I will be on probation for four years. When, the
bhikkhus are pleased may they give me the going forth and the higher ordination.
The wandering ascetic Vacchagotta received the going forth and the higher
ordination.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Two weeks
after venerable Vacchagotta receivd the higher ordination, he approached
the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said to the Blessed One.
‘Venerable sir, I have gained the knowledge of a trainer. May the Blessed
One instruct me further.’ ‘Then Vaccha, you should develop two things further.Develop
calm and insight. Vaccha, when calm and insight is developed, it conduces
to experiencing the various elements..

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Vaccha, when
you desire, experience the various super-normal powers. One, becoming many
and many becoming one. Go unobstructd through walls, embankments and mountains,
as going through air. Dive, in and come out of earth as in water. Walk,
unbroken on water, as on earth. Sit with legs crossed, in space, as birds
small and large do. Touch the moon and sun, as powerful as they are. Wield
power with the body as far as the world of brahma. That will be the eye
-witness for the development of that and other mental faculty.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Vaccha, when
you desire, with the heavenly ear element purified beyond human, hear the
various sounds, heavenly and human, far or near, to you that mindfulness
becomes the eye-witness in that mental faculty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Vaccha, if
you desire, penetrate and know the mental states of others. Know, the mind
with greed and without greed, the angry mind and the not angry mind. the
deluded mind and the non-deluded mind, the attentive mind and the distracted
mind, the developed mind and the undeveloped mind, the mind with a compare
and the mind without a compare, the concentrated mind, and the unconcentrated
mind, the released mind, and the unreleased mind. To you that mindfulness
becomes the eye-witness in that mental faculty.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Vaccha, if
you desire, recollect the various manifold previous births. Such as one
birth, two births, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty
births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births,
an innumerable forward cycle of births, an innumerable backward cycle of
births and an innumerable forward and backward cycle of births. There I
was of such name, clan, disposition, supports and experiencing these pleasant
and unpleasant feelings and with such a life span. Disappearing from there
was born here, with such name, clan, disposition, supports and experiencing,
these pleasant and unpleasant feelings. With such a life span.. Disappearing
from there is born here. Thus recollect the various manifold previous births
that mindfulness, is the eye witness, in that mental faculty.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Vaccha, if
you so desire with the heavenly eye element purified beyond human, see
beings disappearing and appearing unexalted and exalted, beautiful and
ugly, in good and bad states. Know beings according their actions. These
good beings, misbehaving by body, speech and mind, blaming noble ones,
with wrong view and with the wrong view of actions, after death go to loss,
go to decrease and are born in hell.These good beings, with right conduct
by body, speech and mind, not blaming noble ones, with right view and with
the right view of actions, after death go to increase and are born in heaven.
Thus with the heavenly eye element purified beyond human see beings disappearing
and appearing according their actions, and that mindfulness becomes the
eye-witness to you in that mental faculty.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Vaccha, if
you so desire, with the destruction of desires, release the mind of desires,
and be released through wisdom, realising it here and now. That mindfulness
becomes eye witness, in that mental faculty.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then venerable
Vacchagotta, delighted with the words of the Blessed One, got up from his
seat, worshipped and circumambulated the Blessed One and went away.Venerable
Vacchagotta secluded and withdrawn from the crowd abode diligent for dispelling.
For whatever reason sons of clansmen leave the household rightfully and
go forth as a homeless that incomparable end of the holy life he, here
and now realised and abode. He knew, birth is destroyed, the holy life
is lived, what should be done is done, there is nothing more to wish. Venerable
Vacchagotta became one of the perfect ones..

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>At that time
many bhikkhus were going to see the Blessed One, and venerable Vacchagotta
saw those bhikkhus in the distance, approached them and said to them: ‘Venerable
ones, where are you going now?’. ‘Friend, we are going to see the Blessed
One’.’If that is so, worship the feet of the Blessed One for me and tell
–‘Venerable sir, the bhikkhu Vacchagotta worships the feet of the Blessed
One and says, I’m a perfect.one’. The bhikkhus agreed, approached the Blessed
One, worshipped, sat on side and said. ‘Venerable sir, venerable Vacchagotta
says he worships the feet of the Blessed One and says that he is perfected’
‘Bhikkhus, even before, I knew that venerable Vacchagotta is perfect, I
knew it by penetrating his mind. Bhikkhus, he is very powerful, knows the
three knowledges. Even the gods informed me about this’.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>The Blessed
One said this and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed
One.<span
