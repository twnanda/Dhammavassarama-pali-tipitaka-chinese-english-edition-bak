<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>I
heard thus.At one time the Blessed One was touring the Kuru country with
a large community of bhikkhus, arrived in the village of Thullako.t.thita
in the Kuru country. –The brahmin householders of Thullako.t.thita heard
that the Blessed One had arrived and the news spread. The good recluse
Gotama, the son of the Sakyas, gone forth from the clan of the Sakyas while
touring the country of Kuru with a large community of bhikkhus arrived
in the village of Thullako.t.thita. About that good Gotama such fame had
spread, That Blessed One is perfect, rightfully enlightened, endowed with
knowledge and conduct, well gone, knower of the worlds, the incomparable
tamer of those to be tamed, Teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed.
To this world of gods and men together with its Maras, Brahmas and the
community of recluses and brahmins, he declares that Teaching by himself
known and realized,<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>good at the beginning,
in the middle and at the end, full of meanings even in words and stating
the pure and complete holy life. It is good to see perfect ones like that.<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then
the brahmin householders of Thullako.t.thita approached the Blessed One,
of them, some worshipped the Blessed One, some exchanged friendly greetings,
some raised their hands clasped together, some pronounced their clan and
name, and some others silently, sat on a side.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then
the Blessed One instructed, advised, incited and made the hearts light
of the householders of Thullako.t.thita.<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>At
that time the chief clansman Ratthapala’s son was seated in that gathering,
and it occurred to him. As I understand the Teaching given by the Blessed
One, it is not easy to lead that holy life, complete, pure and stainless
while living in a household. What if I shave head and beard, put on yellow
clothes and go homeless. The brahmin householders of Thullako.t.thita instructed,
advised, incited and the hearts made light by the Blessed One got up from
their seats delighted and pleased worshipped and circumambulated the Blessed
One and went away Soon after the brahmin householders of Thullako.t.thita
had gone away the householder’s son Ratthapala approached the Blessed One,
worshiped the Blessed One and sat on a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>side.
Then he said, to the Blessed One. ‘Venerable sir, as I understand the Teaching
given by the Blessed One, it is not easy to lead the complete holy life,
pure and stainless while living in a household. Venerable sir, I desire
to shave head and beard, put on yellow clothes, and go homeless. Venerable
sir, may I gain the going forth and the higher ordination.’.<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Ratthapala,
are you given permission to go forth homeless by mother and father?’<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, I’m not given permission by mother and father to go forth as a homeless.’<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Ratthapala,
the Thus Gone One does not give the going forth as a homeless without the

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Then
venerable sir, I’ll act in such a manner so that I get permisssion from
mother and father for the going forth. Then the householder’s son Rattapala
getting up from his seat worshipped, circumambulated the Blessed One and
approached his mother and father. ‘Mother and father, as I understand the
Teaching given by the Blessed One, it is not easy to lead the complete
holy life, pure and stainless, while living in a household. I desire to
shave head and beard, put on yellow clothes and go forth homeless, give
me permission, to go forth.’ When this was said, the clansman Ratthapala’s
mother and father said. ‘Dear Ratthapala, you are our only son, dear to
us, our pleasure, brought up in pleasantness, dear Ratthapala, you do not
know, what unpleasantness is. Come! Ratthapala, partake of these pleasures,
partake of sensual pleasures and also accumulate merit. We do not give
you permission to go forth. At our death, we will not see you. How could
we give you permission to go forth homeless, when we are living?’<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>For
the second, and up to the third time the clansman Ratthapala, said to his
mother and father. ‘Mother and father, as I understand the Teaching given
by the Blessed One, it is not easy to lead the complete holy life, pure
and stainless, while living in a household. I desire to shave head and
beard, put on yellow clothes, and and to become homeless. Give me permission,
for that. For the third time the clansman Ratthapala’s mother and father
said. ‘Dear Ratthapala, you are our only son, dear to us, our pleasure,
brought up in pleasantness. Dear Ratthapala, you do not know, what unpleasantness
is. Come! Ratthapala, partake of these pleasures, partake of sensual pleasures

At our death, we will not see you. How could we give you permission to
go forth homeless while living?’<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>The
clansman Ratthapala not gaining permission from his mother and father stretched
himself on the ground saying, ‘either I will die here or I will go forth
homeless.’.<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span

the clansman Ratthapala’s mother and father said. ‘Dear Ratthapala, you

you permission to go forth. At our death, we will not see you. How could
we give you permission to go forth homeless when living?’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>When
this was said, the clansman Ratthapala kept silent. For the second, and
up to the third time, the mother and father said to him.’Dear Ratthapala,

clansman Ratthapala kept silent up to the third time.<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then
the mother and father of the clansman Ratthapala approached the friends
of the clansman Ratthapala and said to them. ‘Your friend Ratthapala has
stretched himself on the ground. He says, either I will die, or I will
go forth homeless. Come! Good ones! tell the clansman Ratthapala. Friend,
Ratthapala, you are the only son, dear to your mother and father, their

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then
the friends of the clansman Ratthapala agreeing with them, approached the
clansman Ratthapala and said. ‘Friend, Ratthapala, you are the only son,

they give you permission to go forth homeless even while living?’ The clansman
Ratthapala kept silent. Even up to the third time.<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>The
friends of the clansman Ratthapala approached, the mother and father of
the clansman Ratthapala and said. ‘Mother, father, the clansman Ratthapala,
is lying on the ground. He said, either I die here, or else I will go forth.
If you do not give him permission, to go forth, homeless, he will die there
itself. If you give him permission to go forth homeless, you would at least
see him as one gone forth. If the clansman Ratthapala becomes displeased
with the holy life, what else would he do, other than come back here? So
give him permission to go forth homeless.’&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Dear
ones, we give permission to the clansman Ratthapala, to go forth, homeless
He should instruct us.’&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then
the friends of the clansman Ratthapala approached him and said.’Friend,
Ratthapala, you are the only son, dear to your mother and father, their

Yet you should instruct them.’&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then
the clansman Ratthapala, got up, regained power and approached the Blessed
One, worshipped, sat on a side and said. ‘Venerable sir, I’m given permission
by mother and father to go forth homeless.’ The clansman Ratthapala gained
the going forth and the higher ordination in the presence of the Blessed
One.<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Two
weeks after confering the higher ordination, to venerable Ratthapala, and
having lived as long as he liked in Thullako.t.thita, the Blessed One,
left on a tour to reach Savatthi in stages. Then the Blessed One lived
in the monastery offered by Anathapindika in Jeta’s grove. Venerable Ra.t.thapala
abiding secluded and withdrawn from the crowd, was diligent to dispel and
before long for whatever purpose sons of clansmen, rightfully go forth
homeless, that noble end of the holy life, here and now, he realised and
abode. He knew, birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived, what should
be done is done, there is nothing more to wish. Venerable Ra.t.thapala
became one of the perfect ones.<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then
venerable Ra.t.thapala approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a
side and said. ‘Venerable sir, I desire to instruct mother and father if
the Blessed One gives me permission.’<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>The
Blessed One, mentally considered the thoughts and thought processes of
venerable Ratthapala. Knowing that it’s not possible for the clansman Ratthapala
to give up robes and lead a houehold life said. ‘Ra.t.thapala, if you think
it’s the time, do so.’<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then
venerable Ratthapala getting up from his seat, worshipped and circumambulated
the Blessed One, arranged the dwelling and taking bowl and robes left on
a tour to reach Thullako.t.thita by stages and arrived there. In<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Thullako.t.thita.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>venerable
Ra.t.thapala abode in the deer hunting grounds of king Koravya.Then venerable
Ra.t.thapala putting on robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes
entered Thullako.t.thita for alms going in due order. He approached the
house of his father. At that time his father was combing his hair at the
central entrance to the hall. Venerable Ra.t.thapala’s father seeing venerable
Ra.t.thapala coming in the distance said ‘These shaven headed recluses
gave the going forth to my only dear son.’ Thus venerable Ra.t.thapala
did not receive morsel food at his own father’s home nor was morsels refused,
he<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>gained abuse.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>At
that time, a female slave of his earlier home desired to throw away some
stale bread, and venerable Ra.t.thapala said to her. ‘Sister if you desire
to throw away that food, put it in my bowl.’ When that female slave was
putting the stale bread into the bowl of venerable Ra.t.thapala, she recognised
certain signs in the hands, feet and the voice, of venerable Ra,t.thapala
and told his mother.’Indeed, noble lady, know that the noble son Ra.t.thapala
has come.’<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Good
one, if you tell the truth, you will be released from slavery.’ Then venerable<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Ra.t.thapala’s
mother approached<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>his father and
told him. Householder, do you know that, our noble son Ra.t.thapala has
arrived?.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>At
that time venerable Ra.t.thapala was partaking that stale bread seated
against a wall. Then venerable Ra.t.thapala’s father approached venerable
Ra.t.thapala and said to venerable Ra.t.thapala ‘Dear Ra.t.thapala, why
do you partake that stale bread? Couldn’t you enter your own home?’<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Householder,
where is a home for a homeless? Householder, we came to your house did
not receive morsels, nor a refusal, we gained only abuse.’.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Come
dear Ra.t.thapals, let’s go into the house.’<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>‘Useless

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span

dear Ra.t.thapala accept tomorrow’s meal.’.<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Venerable
Ra.t.thapala accepted, in silence. Then venerable Ra.tt.hapala’s father
knowing that the invitation is accepted approached his own home. Then he
amassed all the gold in one place covered it with a guilt mat. Then he
addressed the previous wives of the clansman Ra.t.thapala. In whatever
manner you were pleasant agreeable and loveable to him earlier get yourselves
decorated in that manner. Then venerable Ra.t.thapala’s father made preparations
of nourishing eatables and drinks, and informed venerable Ra.t.thapala.
‘Dear Ra.t.thapala, the food is ready.’ Then venerable Ra.t.thapala putting
on robes and taking bowl and robes entered the house of his father and
sat on the prepared seat. Venerable Ra.t.thapala’s father removing the
cover manifested,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>the mass of gold,
and said to venerable Ra.t.thapala. ‘Dear Ra.t.thapala, this is wealth
that comes from your mother, this is wealth that comes from your father,
this is wealth that comes from your grand father. Dear Ra.t.thapala. It
is possible to partake wealth and accumulate merit. Come dear Ra.t.thapala,
give up robes partake of this wealth and accumulate merit.’<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Householder,
if you allow me to say a word, amass this gold, put it into a cart and
drop it in a whirl pool in the middle of river Ganges. What is the reason?
Householder, on account of this wealth arise grief, lament, unpleasantness,
displeasure and distress.’<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then
the previous wives of venerable Ra.t.thapala disguising themselves in various
ways came out and said. ‘Noble son, how are those nymphs on account of
whom you lead a holy life?’<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>The

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span
