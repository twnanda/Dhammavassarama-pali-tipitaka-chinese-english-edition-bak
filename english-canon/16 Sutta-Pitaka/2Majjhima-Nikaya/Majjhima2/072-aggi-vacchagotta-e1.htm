<p class="MsoBodyText">I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One was living
in the monastery offered by Anathapindika in Jeta’s grove in Savatthi.
Then the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta approached the Blessed One exchanged
friendly greetings, sat on a side and said to the Blessed One.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Good Gotama,
the world is eternal this only is the truth and all else is false. Does
good Gotama hold this view?’ ‘No, Vaccha, I’m not of that view, the world
is eternal, this only is the truth all else is false’. ‘Good Gotama, the
world is not eternal, this only is the truth and all else is false Does
good Gotama hold this view?’ ‘No, Vaccha, I’m not of that view, the world
is not eternal, this only is the truth all else is false’. ‘Good Gotama,
the world is limited, this only is the truth and all else is false. Does
good Gotama hold this view?’ ‘No, Vaccha, I’m not of that view, the world
is limited, this only is the truth all else is false.’ ‘Good Gotama, the
world is not-limited, this only is the truth and all else is false. Does
good Gotama hold this view?’ ‘No, Vaccha, I’m not of that view, the world
is not limited, this only is the truth all else is false’.’Good Gotama,
the soul is the body, this only is the truth and all else is false. Does
good Gotama hold this view?’ ‘No, Vaccha, I’m not of that view, the soul
is the body, this only is the truth all else is false.’ ‘Good Gotama, the
soul is different from the body, this only is the truth and all else is
false. Does good Gotama hold this view?’ ‘No, Vaccha, I’m not of that view,
the soul is different from the body, this only is the truth all else is
false.’ ‘Good Gotama, the Thus Gone One is after death- this only is the
truth all else is false. Does good Gotama hold this view?’ ‘No, Vaccha,
I’m not of that view, the Thus Gone One is after death, this only is the
truth all else is false.’ ‘Good Gotama, the Thus Gone One is not after
death, this only is the truth and all else is false. Does good Gotama hold
this view?’ ‘No, Vaccha, I’m not of that view, the Thus Gone One is not
after death, this only is the truth all else is false.’’Good Gotama, the
Thus Gone One is, and is not, after death, this only is the truth, all
else is false. Does good Gotama hold this view.’ ‘No, Vaccha, I’m not of
that view, the Thus Gone One is, and is not after death, this only is the
truth all else is false.’ ‘Good Gotama, the Thus Gone One neither is, nor
is not after death, this only is the truth and all else is false. Does
good Gotama hold this view?’ ‘No, Vaccha, I’m not of that view, the Thus
Gone One neither is, nor is not after death, this only is the truth all
else is false.’

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Good Gotama,
when asked, is good Gotama of the view, the world is eternal, this only
is the truth, all else is false, it was said you were not of that view.

danger has thrown out all these views?’

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Vaccha,
the view, the world is eternal, is a bond of views, is a speculation in
views, it is with unpleasantness, with trouble, with burning, not leading
to giving up, to detachment, to appeasement, to knowledge, to enlightenment,
to cessation and to extinction. The view the world is not eternal,--re

a bond of views, is a speculation in views, it is with unpleasantness,
with trouble, with burning, not leading to giving up, to detachment, to
appesement, to knowledge, to enlightenment, to cessation and to extinction.Vaccha,
seeing these dangers I have thrown out all these views.’. ‘Does good Gotama
hold any other view?’<span 


style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Vaccha,
The Thus Gone One has overcome views. This is the view of the Thus Gone
One. This is matter, this is the arising of matter, and this is the fading
of matter. This is feeling, this is the arising of feelings and this is
the fading of feelings. This is perception, this is the arising of perceptions
and this is the fading of perceptions. These are determinations, this is
the arising of determinations and this, the fading of determinations. This
is consciousness, this is the arising of consciousness and this is fading
of consciousness. Therefore, I say the Thus Gone One has destroyed, is
detached, has given up and is released, from all imaginings, recollections,
and all latent tendencies of me and mine.’

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Good Gotama,
where is the thus released mind born?’’Vaccha, is born does not apply’’Then
good Gotama, is he not born?’’Vaccha, is not born does not apply.’<span 


style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Gotama,
is he born and not born?’’Vaccha, is born and is not born does not apply.’’Then
Gotama, is he neither born, nor not born?’’Vaccha, is neither born, nor
is not born, is<span 


style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>not<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>applicable..’.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘When asked
where is the thus released mind born, it was said, is born does not apply.
When asked is it not born, it was said not born does not apply. When asked
is it born and not born, it was said, born and not born does not apply.
When asked, is it neither born, nor is not born, it was said neither born
nor not born, does not apply. Good Gotama, in this I am completely ignorant
and deluded. Whatever little understanding I had with the earlier conversation,
has now vanished.’

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Vaccha,
your ignorance and delusion is nothing strange. This is deep, difficult
to understand peaceful and exalted, not for logical thinking. Is clever
and shoud be experienced by the wise. By one of another sect like you,
with some other liking, without being yoked in it and living in it, it
cannot be understood. So then Vaccha, I will question you, on this and
you may reply as it pleases you. There is a fire burning in front of you,
would you know, there is a fire burning in front of me?’ ‘Good Gotama,
if a fire burns in front of me, I would know, there’s a fire burning in
front of me.’ ‘Vaccha, if you were asked, this fire burning in front of
you, on account of what is it burning, how would you reply?’’Good Gotama,
if I was asked, this fire burning in front of you, on account of what is
it burning, I would reply, this fire burning in front of me is burning
on account of grass and sticks.’ ‘Vaccha, if the fire in front of you extinguishes,
would you know, this fire in front of me has extinguished?’’Good Gotama,
if the fire in front of me extinguishes, I would know, this fire has extinguished’’Vaccha,
if you were asked, this fire that has extinguished in which direction did
it go, to the east, west, north or south?’ ‘Good, Gotama, it does not apply.
That fire burnt on account of grass and sticks, those supports finished,
no other supports were supplied, without supports the fire, went out.’.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Vaccha,
in that same manner, the matter with which the Thus Gone One is pointed
out, is dispelled, uprooted, made a palm stump, made a thing not to grow
again: Vaccha, the Thus Gone One is released from the reckonings of matter.
It is deep, difficult to fathom, like the great ocean. Is born, does not
apply, is not born does not apply. Is born and is not born does not apply,
neither is born, nor is not born does not apply. The feelings, with which
the Thus Gone One is pointed, are dispelled, uprooted, made palm stumps
made things not to grow again: Vaccha, the Thus Gone One is released from
the reckonings of feelings. It is deep, difficult to fathom, like the great
ocean. Is born does not apply, is not born does not apply. Is born and
is not born does not apply. Neither is born nor is not born does not apply.
The perceptions, with which the Thus Gone One is pointed are dispelled,
uprooted, made palm stumps, made things not to grow again. Vaccha, the
Thus Gone One is released from the reckonings of perceptions. It is deep,
difficult to fathom, like the great ocean. Is born does not apply, is not
born does not apply, is born and is not born does not apply. Neither is
born nor is not born does not apply. The determinations with which the
Thus Gone One is pointed out, are dispelled, uprooted, made palm stumps,
made things not to grow again: Vaccha, the Thus Gone One is released from
the reckonings of deterninations. It is deep, difficult to fathom like
the great ocean. Is born does not apply, is not born does not apply Is
born and is not born does not apply. Neither is born nor is not born does
not apply. The consciousness with which the Thus Gone One is pointed out,
is dispelled, uprooted, made a palm stump, made a thing not to grow again.
Vaccha, the Thus Gone One is released from the reckonings of consciousness.
It is deep, difficult to fathom like the great ocean. Is born does not
apply, is not born does not apply. Is born and is not born does not apply.
Neither is born nor is not born does not apply.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>When this was
said the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta said thus to the Blessed One, close
to the village or hamlet, there is a huge Sala tree, because of impermanence,
its leaves, branches, bark, shoots and sapwood fall off and is left with
only the heartwood. In the same manner, on account of the words of good
Gotama, with my<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>leaves and branches
pulled out, shoots pulled out, the bark removed, the sap removed, I stand
as the pure heartwood. I understand good Gotama, it is as though something
over turned is reinstalled, something covered is made manifest. As though
the path is shown to someone who had lost his way. As though an oil lamp
is lighted, for those who have sight to see forms in the dark. Now, I take
refuge in good Gotama, in the Teaching, in the Community of bhikkhus. May
the Blessed One bear me as a lay disciple who has taken refuge from today
until life lasts.
