<p>I heard thus.At one time venerable Aananda was living in the small village
Beluwa in Vesaali. It happened that the householder Dasama, a good citizen
had come to Pataliputta for some business. Then the householder Dasama
approached a certain bhikkhu in Kukkutaaraama, worshipped him and sat on
a side. The householder Dasama asked. ‘Venerable sir, where does venerable
Aananda live at this time?’ ‘Householder, venerable Aananda, abides in
Vesaali in the small village Beluwa’. Then the householder Dasama, having
finished his business in Pataliputta approached venerable Aananda in the
small village Beluwa, worshipped him, sat on a side and said to venerable
Aananda
<p>Venerable sir, Aananda, is there an abiding shown by the Blessed One
perfect, rightfully enlightened, knows and sees, abiding in which, a bhikkhu
diligent for dispelling, would gain the release of his unreleased mind,
destroying his undestroyed desires, would attain the not attained, noble
end of the yoke? Householder, there is an abiding shown by the Blessed
One perfect, rightfully enlightened, knows and sees. Abiding in it a bhikkhu
diligent for dispelling desires, gains the release of his unreleased mind,
destroying his undestroyed desires, attains the not attained noble end
of the yoke. Venerable sir, what is that attainment told by the Blessed
One?
<p>Householder, the bhikkhu, secluding the mind from sensual thoughts and
thoughts of demerit, with thoughts and discursive thoughts and joy and
pleasantness born of seclusion abides in the first jhaana. Then he reflects:
This first jhaana is something compounded, mentally developed. Whatever
is compounded and mentally developed is impermanent. Thoroughly knowing
that impermanent things cease, he gets established in that and destroys
desires. If his desires don’t get destroyed, because of greed and interest,
for that purity, he destroys the five lower fetters and arises spontaneously
to extinguish in this same birth and not proceed*1). This is that attainment
told by the Blessed One perfect, rightfully enlightened, knows and sees.
Abiding in it a bhikkhu diligent for dispelling desires, gains the release
of his unreleased mind and destroying his undestroyed desires attains the
noble end of the yoke.
<p>Again, householder, the bhikkhu overcoming thoughts and discursive thoughts,
the mind internally appeased and brought to a single point, with joy and
pleasanatness born of concentration abides in the second jhaana He reflects,
this second jhaana too is something compounded and mentally developed.
All compounded and mentally developed things are impermanent. Thoroughly
knowing that impermanent things cease, he gets established in that and
destroys desires. If his desires don’t get destroyed, because of greed
and interest for that purity he destroys the five lower fetters and arises
spontaneously to extinguish in this same birth and not proceed. This is
that attainment told by the Blessed One perfect, rightfully enlightened,
knows and sees, abiding in which a bhikkhu diligent for dispelling, gains
the release of his unreleased mind, destroys his undestroyed desires, and
attains the noble end of the yoke.
<p>Again, householder, the bhikkhu with equanimity to joy and detachment,
abides in pleasantness, mindful of pleasantness with the body too*2), abides
in the third jhaana..To this the noble ones say abiding in pleasantness
with equanimity. He reflects this third jhaana too is something compounded,
mentally developed. Whatever is compounded and mentally developed is impermanent.
Thoroughly knowing that impermanent things cease, he gets established in
that and destroys desires. If his desires don’t get destroyed, because
of greed and interest for that purity, destroying the five lower fetters
he arises spontaneously to extinguish in this same birth and not proceed.
This is that attainment told by the Blessed One perfect, rightfully enlightened,
knows and sees. Abiding in it a bhikkhu diligent for dispelling, gains
the release of his unreleased mind, destroys his undestroyed desires, and
attains the noble end of the yoke.
<p>Again, householder, the bhikkhu dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness,
and earlier having dispelled pleasure and displeasure, without unpleasantness
and pleasantness and with mindfulness purified with equanimity abides in
the fourth jhaana. Then he reflects this fourth jhaana too is something
compounded, mentally developed. Whatever is compounded and mentally developed
is impermanent. Thoroughly knowing that impermanent things cease, he gets
established in that and destroys desires. If his desires don’t get destroyed,
because of greed and interest for that purity destroying the five lower
fetters he arises spontaneously to extinguish in this same birth and not
proceed. This is that attainment told by the Blessed One perfect, rightfully
enlightened, knows and sees. Abiding in it a bhikkhu diligent for dispelling,
gains the release of his unreleased mind, destroys his undestroyed desires,
and attains the not attained noble end of the yoke.
<p>Again, householder, the bhikkhu, abides with the thought of loving kindness,
pervading one direction. So too the second, the third, the fourth, above,
below, and across, in all circumstances, for all purposes, towards all,
this thought grown great is developed. Then he reflects, the thought of
loving kindness is something compounded, mentally developed. Whatever is
compounded and mentally developed is impermanent Thoroughly knowing that
impermanent things cease, he gets established in that and destroys desires.
If his desires don’t get destroyed, because of greed and interest for that
purity destroying the five lower fetters he arises spontaneously to extinguish
in that same birth and not proceed. This is that attainment told by the
Blessed One perfect, rightfully enlightened, knows and sees. Abiding in
which a bhikkhu diligent for dispelling, gains the release of his unreleased
mind, destroys his undestroyed desires, and attains the not attained noble
end of the yoke.
<p>Again, householder, the bhikkhu, abides with the thought of compassion,
with the thought of intrinsic joy. He abides with the thought of equanimity
pervading one direction, so too the second, the third, the fourth, above,
below, and across, in all circumstances, for all purposes, towards all,
the thought of equanimity grown great is developed. Then he reflects, this
thought of equanimity too is something compounded something mentally developed.
Whatever is compounded and mentally developed is impermanent. Thoroughly
knowing that impermanent things cease, he gets established in that and
destroys desires. If his desires don’t get destroyed, because of greed
and interest for that purity he destroys the five lower fetters and arises
spontaneously to extinguish in that same birth and not proceed. This is
that attainment told by the Blessed One perfect, rightfully enlightened,
knows and sees. Abiding in which a bhikkhu diligent for dispelling, gains
the release of his unreleased mind, destroys his undestroyed desires, and
attains the noble end of the yoke.
<p>Again, householder, the bhikkhu overcoming all perceptions of matter
and aversion, not attending to various perceptions, with space is boundless
abides in the sphere of space. This sphere of space too is something compounded,
mentally developed. Whatever is compounded and mentally developed is impermanent.
Thoroughly knowing that impermanent things cease, he gets established in
that and destroys desires. If his desires don’t get destroyed, because
of greed and interest for them he destroys the five lower fetters and arises
spontaneously to extinguish in that same birth not to proceed. This is
that attainment told by the Blessed One perfect, rightfully enlightened,
knows and sees. Abiding in it a bhikkhu diligent for dispelling, gains
the release of his unreleased mind, destroys his undestroyed desires, and
attains the noble end of the yoke.
<p>Again, householder, the bhikkhu overcoming all perceptions of space,
with consciousness is boundless abides in the sphere of consciousness.
This sphere of consciousness too is something compounded, mentally developed.
Whatever is compounded and mentally developed is impermanent. Thoroughly
knowing that impermanent things cease he gets established in that and destroys
desires. If his desires don’t get destroyed, because of greed and interest
for that purity, destroying the five lower fetters he arises spontaneously
to extinguish in that same birth not to proceed. This is that attainment
told by the Blessed One perfect, rightfully enlightened, knows and sees.
Abiding in it a bhikkhu diligent for dispelling desires, gains the release
of his unreleased mind, destroys his undestroyed desires, and attains the
noble end of the yoke.
<p>Again, householder, the bhikkhu overcoming all perceptions of consciousness,
with there is nothing, abides in the sphere of nothingness This sphere
of nothingness too is something compounded, mentally developed. Whatever
is compounded and mentally developed is impermanent. Thoroughly knowing
that impermanent things cease gets established in that and destroys desires.
If his desires don’t get destroyed, because of greed and interest for that
purity, destroying the five lower fetters he arises spontaneously, to extinguish
in that same birth not proceed. This is that attainment told by the Blessed
One perfect, rightfully enlightened, knows and sees. Abiding in it a bhikkhu
diligent for dispelling desires, gains the release of his unreleased mind,
destroys his undestroyed desires, and attains the noble end of the yoke.
<p>When this was said the householder Dasama said. Venerable sir, it is
like a man in search of a single treasure has come to know eleven treasures,
in one and the same search. In the same way we came to hear a single gateway
to deathlessness and here we are told eleven gateways to deathlessness.
It is like to a man’s house there are eleven doors and when the house is
on fire he could escape through one of those doors. In the same manner
I can make myself safe through one or the other of these eleven doors to
deathlessness. The ascetics of other sects examine the treasures of their
teacher. Why shouldn’t we make an offering to venerable Aananda. Then the
househoder Dasama assembling the bhikkhus of Paataliputta and Vesaali,
offered them nourishing eatables and drinks with his own hands, and offered
each bhikkhu a pair of robes and venerable Aananda a set of three robes,
and caused five hundred monasteries to be built for venerable Aananda..
<p>Notes.
<p>1.He destroys the five lower fetters and arises spontaneously, to extinguish
in this same birth not to proceed ‘ ‘ Destroying the five lower fetters
and arising spontaneously is something that happens in the twinling of
a moment.In Pali it is called ‘anaagaami’ not returning to this sensual
world for future birth. This would be known by the one who attained it
and not by any other person
<p>2.Mindful of pleasantness with the body.’kaayenaca sukha.m phassati’
This pleasantness is experienced when the one in jhaana is not touched
by contacts at any of his doors of mental contact. The Blessed One says
that this is a constant pleasantness enjoyed by the arahants.
