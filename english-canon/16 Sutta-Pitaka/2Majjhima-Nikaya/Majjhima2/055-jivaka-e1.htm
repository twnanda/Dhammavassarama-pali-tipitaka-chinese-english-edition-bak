<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

heard thus.At one time the Blessed One lived in Raajagaha, in the mango
orchard of Jiivaka, the foster son of the prince. Jiivaka the foster son
of the prince approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and
said: ‘I have heard this, venerable sir, that living things are killed
on account of the recluse Gotama, and he partakes that knowing, it was
killed on account of him. Venerable sir, those who say, that living things
are killed on account of the recluse Gotama, and he partakes that, knowing,
it was killed on account of him, are they saying the rightful words of
the Blessed One and not blaming the Teaching?’

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

yes"></span>‘Jeevaka,
those who say, that living things are killed on account of the recluse
Gotama, and he partakes that knowing, because it was killed on account
of him. They are not my words, and they blame me falsely. Jeevaka, I say
that on three instances meat should not be partaken, when seen, heard or
when there is a doubt. I say, that on these three instances meat should
not be partaken.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>I say, that meat
could be partaken on three instances, when not seen, not heard and when
there is no doubt about it.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

yes"></span>Jeevaka,
the bhikkhu supported by a village or hamlet sits pervading one direction
with thoughts of loving kindness, and also the second, third, fourth, above,
below and across, in all circumstances, for all purposes, towards all.
With that thought developed limitlessly and grown great without anger.
Then a certain householder or the son of a householder approaches and invites
him for the next day’s meal. If the bhikkhu desires he accepts and at the
end of that night, putting on robes and taking bowl and robes, approaches
the house of that householder or the son of the householder and sits on
the prepared seat. That householder or his son serves him with the nourishing
food with his own hands. It does not occur to him. This householder should
offer me nourishing food in the future too. He partakes that morsel food,
neither enslaved and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>swooned, nor
guilty. Wisely reflecting the danger. Jeevaka, does this bhikkhu think
to trouble himself, another or both at that moment?’. ‘No, venerable sir,
he does not.’ ‘Jeevaka, isn’t this bhikkhu partaking this food without
a blemish?’ ‘He is, venerable sir I have heard, that Brahma abides, in
loving kindness. I witness it in the Blessed One. The Blessed One abides
in loving kindness.’ ‘Jeevaka, the Thus Gone One has dispelled that greed,
hate and delusion, pulled it out with the roots, made palm stumps and made
them not to grow again. If you say it, on account of that, I allow it.’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, I say it, on account of that.’ ‘Jeevaka, the bhikkhu abides supported
on a certain village or hamlet. He abides pervading one direction with
thoughts of compassion….With thoughts of intrinsic joy…With equanimity
and also the second, third, fourth, above, below and across, in all circumstances,
for all purposes, towards all, equanimity grown great and developed limitlessly<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>without
anger. Then a certain householder or the son of a householder approaches
him and invites him for the next day’s meal. If the bhikkhu desires he
accepts the invitation. At the end of that night, putting on robes and
taking bowl and robes, he approaches the house of that householder or the
son of the householder and sits on the prepared seat. That householder
serves the bhikkhu with the nourishing food with his own hands. It doesn’t
occur to him, this householder should offer me nourishing food in the future
too. He partakes that morsel food, not enslaved, not swooned, and without
a guilt, wisely reflecting the danger. Jeevaka, does this bhikkhu think
to trouble himself, another, or trouble both at that moment?’. ‘No, venerable
sir, he does not.’ ‘Jeevaka, doesn’t this bhikkhu partake this food without
a blemish?’ ‘Venerable sir, he partakes food without a blemish. .I have
heard, that Brahma abides in equanimity. I witness it, in the Blessed One.
The Blessed One, abides in equanimity.’ ‘Jeevaka, the Thus Gone One is
not troubled, is detached, and not averse to greed, hate and delusion*1),
pulled it out with the roots, made palm stumps and made not to grow again.
If it is said on account of that, I allow it.’ ‘Venerable sir, I say it,
on account of that.’

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

yes"></span>‘Jeevaka,
who ever destroys living things on account of the Thus Gone One or the
disciples of the Thus Gone One, accumulate much demerit on five instances:
If he said, go bring that living thing of such name. In this first instance
he accumulates much demerit. If that living thing is pulled along, tied,
with pain at the throat, feeling displeased and unpleasant*2). In this
second instance he accumulates much demerit. If it was said, go kill that
animal. In this third instance he accumulates much demerit..When killing
if that animal feels displeased and unpleasant*2), in this fourth instance
he accumulates, much demerit. When the Thus Gone One or a disciple of the
Thus Gone tastes that unsuitabale food*2). In this fifth instance he accumulates
much demerit. Jeevaka, if anyone destroys the life of a living thing on
account of the Thus Gone One or a disciple of the Thus Gone One, he accumulates
much demerit on these five instances.’ When this was said Jeevaka the foster
son of the prince said; ‘Wonderful venerable sir, the bhikkhus partake
suitable faultless food. Now I understand venerable sir. It is as though
something overturned was reinstated. Something covered was made manifest.
As though the path was told to someone who had lost his way. As though
an oil lamp was lighted, for those who have sight to see forms. In various
ways the Teaching is explained. Now I take refuge in the Blessed One, in
the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. May I be remembered as one
who has taken refuge from today until life lasts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Notes.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

The Thus Gone One is not troubled, is detached, and not averse to greed
hate and delusion.’yena kho Jeevaka raagena yena dosena yena mohena vihesavaa
assa,arativaa assa pa.tighavaa assa so raago so doso so moho tathaagatassa
pahino ucchinnamuulo taalavatthukato anabhaavakato aayati.m anuppaadadhammo‘
When equanimity is developed, that person’s nature is such, that he is
not troubled, is detached and not averse to greed, hate and delusion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

yes"></span>2.
The Blessed One shows five instances when it is demerit to offer meat to
the bhikkhu. Those are when it is seen, heard, or known, that such and
such an animal is killed. When it is ordered, kill this animal. When seen
it, being pulled along to be killed. When seen it going along sad and unpleasant,
and when the Thus Gone One or a disciple of the Thus Gone One tastes the
unsuitable food. If we understand this correctly, it is feelings which
matter.The Blessed One’s Teaching is completely based on feelings. Unpleasantness-‘dukkha’
is a feeling, and it is for its cessation that the Teaching is proclaimed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>
