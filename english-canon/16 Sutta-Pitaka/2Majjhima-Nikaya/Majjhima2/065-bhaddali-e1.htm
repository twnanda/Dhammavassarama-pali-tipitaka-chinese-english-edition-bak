<p class="MsoBodyText">I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One was living
in the monastery offered by Anathapindika in Jeta’s grove in Savatthi.
The Blessed One addressed from there.Bhikkhus, I partake a single meal
for the day, and on accont of it experience few afflictions, few ailments,
lightness, power, and a pleasant abiding.Come! bhikkhus, you too partake
a single meal for the day, and on accont of it experience few afflictions,
few ailments, lightness, power, and a pleasant abiding. When this was said
venerable Bhaddali said thus to the Blessed One-Venerable sir, I would
not venture to eat one meal for the day. Eating one meal a day, doubts
and remorse arise to me*1). Then Bhaddali, when you are invited do you
partake there, and carry away food to another region and partake it? Bhaddali
are you supported that way too? Even then venerable sir, I would not venture
to eat one meal for the day. Eating one meal a day, doubts and remorse
arise to me. When the Blessed One, was laying down the rules and the Community
of bhikkhus accepting to abide by the rules, venerable Bhaddali was not
venturing to accept them. So Venerable Bhaddali did not come to the presence
of the Blessed One during those three months as one incomplete in the training,
in the dispensation.of the Teacher..

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>At that time
many bhikkhus were sewing the Blessed One’s robe; When the robe was sewn
and completed the Blessed One was to leave on a tour. Venerable Bhaddali
approached those bhikkhus, exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side.
Then those bhikkhus said. ‘Bhaddali, here, we are sewing the Blessed One’s
robe, when it is completed and at the end of the three months the blessed
One is leaving on a tour. Come, Bhaddali, be careful. Don’t fall into unpleasantness
for a long time.’ Venerable Bhaddali accepting the advice given by those
bhikkhus, approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said,
to the Blessed One: ‘Venerable sir, I have transgressed, owing to foolishness,
delusion and demerit. When the rules were laid down for the Community of
bhikkhus, and when the bhikkhus were accepting the rules, I declared not
venturing to accept.<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Pardon my fault,
venerable sir, and that would be for future restraint’. ‘Bhaddali, you
have transgressed, owing to foolishness, delusion, and demerit. When I
was laying down the rules, and when the Community of bhikkhus were accepting
the rules, you declared not venturing to accept them.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhaddali,
didn’t it occur to you, the Blessed One lives in Savatthi, and will know
me as a bhikkhu incomplete in the training? Bhaddali, didn’t it occur to
you, many bhikkhus have come for the rains to Savatthi, they will know
me as a bhikkhu incomplete in the training? Bhaddali, didn’t it occur to
you, many bhikkhunis have come for the rains to Savatthi, they will know
me as a bhikkhu incomplete in the training? Bhaddali, didn’t it occur to
you, many male lay disciples have come to Savatthi, they will know me as
a bhikkhu incomplete in the training? Bhaddali, didn’t it occur to you,
many female lay disciples have come to Savatthi, they will know me as a
bhikkhu incomplete in the training? Bhaddali, this too didn’t occur to
you, many recluses and brahmins of other sects have come to Savatthi for
the rains, they will know me as a bhikkhu incomplete in the training? A
disciple of the recluse Gotama, a certain elder in the dispensation is
incomplete in the training.’ ‘Venerable sir, I have transgressed, owing
to foolishness, delusion and demerit. When the rules were laid down for
the Community of bhikkhus, and when the bhikkhus were accepting the rules,
I declared not venturing to accept them. Pardon my fault, venerable sir,
and that would be for future restraint. Bhaddali, you have transgressed,
owing to foolishness, delusion, and demerit, when I was laying down the
rules, and when the Community of bhikkhus were accepting the rules, you
declared not venturing to accept them.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhaddali,
I tell a bhikkhu released both ways,*1) Come bhikkhu, lie in this mud for
me. Would he lie in the mud, or would he put something else on the mud,
or would he say no?’ ‘That, would not happen, venerable sir.’ ‘Bhaddali,
I tell a bhikkhu released through wisdom.*2) Come bhikkhu lie in this mud
for me. Would he lie in the mud, or would he put something else on the
mud, or would he say no?’ ‘That would not be venerable sir.’ ‘Bhaddali,
I tell a body witness of the path,*3) or one come to righteousness of view,*4)
or one released through faith*5), or one faring according to the Teaching,*6)
or one faring according to faith*7). Come bhikkhu lie in the mud for me.
Would he lie in the mud, or would he put something else on the mud, or
would he say no?’ ‘That would not be venerable sir.’ ‘Bhaddali, weren’t
you at that time empty, useless and gone wrong?’ ‘Yes, venerable sir.I
have transgressed owing to foolishness, delusion and demerit. When the
rules were laid down for the Community of bhikkhus, and when the bhikkhus
were accepting the rules, I declared not venturing to accept them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Pardon
my fault, venerable sir. That would be for future restraint.’ ‘Bhaddali,
you have transgressed, owing to foolishness, delusion, and demerit. When
I was laying down the rules, and when the Community of bhikkhus were accepting
the rules, you declared not venturing to accept them. Bhaddali, since you
accept the fault, and ask to be pardond for future restraint, I pardon
you. It is growth in the noble one’s dispensation to ask to be pardoned,
seeing the fault and for future restraint.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhaddali,
there is a bhikkhu in the dispensation of the Teacher not yet complete
in the training, he thinks Indeed I will attain some distinctive knowledge
above human if I dwelt in some secluded dwelling like the root of a tree
in the forest, a cave or grotto in the mountains, a charnel ground, a jungle
forest, an open space or a heap of straw..He dwells in some secluded dwelling
like the root of a tree in the forest, a cave or grotto in the mountains,
a charnel ground, a jungle forest, an open space or a heap of straw. The
Teacher blames him, considering it the wise co-associates blame him, gods
and he himself blames him and he does not attain some distinctive knowledge
above human. What is the reason? That happens to one incomplete in the
training in the dispensation of the Teacher.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhaddali,

the root of a tree in the forest, a cave or grotto in the mountains, a
charnel ground, a jungle forest, an open space or a heap of straw. When
he abides thus secluded the Teacher does not blame him, considering it
the wise co-associates do not blame him, gods and he himself do not blame
him and he attains some distinctive knowledge above human. Secluded from
sensual desires, and thoughts of demerit, with thoughts and thought processes
and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion attained to abides in the
first jhana: What is the reason?. Bhaddali it happens to one complete in
the training of the dispensation of the Teacher. Again the bhikkhu overcoming
thoughts and thought processes with the mind appeased and in one point,
without thoughts and thought processes and with joy and pleasantness born
of concentration attained to abides in the second jhana: What is the reason?
Bhaddali, it happens to one complete in the training. Again, Bhaddali the
bhikkhu with equanimity to joy and detachment and experiencing pleasantness
with the body too abides in the third jhaana. To this the noble ones say
abiding in pleasantness minful of equanimity. What, is the reason?. Bhaddali
it happens to one complete in the training. Again, Bhaddali, the bhikkhu
dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness and earlier having overcome
pleasure and displeasure..With equnimity purifying mindfulness abides in
the fourth jhana. What is the reason? Bhaddali it happens to one complete
in the training in the dispensation of the Teacher.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>When the
mind is concentrated, pure without blemish free of minor defilements workable
and malleable and is steady he directs the mind to know previous births.
He recollects innumerable previous births. What is the reason? Bhaddali
it happens to one complete in the training in the dispensation of the Teacher.
When the mind is concentrated, pure without blemish free from minor defilements,
workable malleable and steady, he directs the mind to know the disappearing
and appearing of beings. With the heavenly eye purified beyond human he
sees beings disappearing and appearing in unexalted and exalted states,
beautiful and ugly in good and bad states. Knows beings according their
actions. What is the reason? Bhaddali it happens to one complete in the
training in the dispensation of the Teacher When the mind is concentrated,
pure, without blemish free from minor defilements, workable malleable and
is steady directs the mind for the destruction of desires. He knows, as
it really is, this is unpleasant---- knows the path to the cessation of
desires as it really. When he knows and sees thus, his mind is released
from sensual desires, from the desires ‘to be’ and from ignorant desires.
When released knows, I’m released. Birth is destroyed, the holy life is
lived, what should be done is done. There is nothing more to wish. What
is the reason? Bhaddali it happens to one complete in the training, in
the dispensation, of the Teacher’

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>When this
was said venerable Bhaddali said to the Blessed One.Venerable sir, why
is a certain bhikkhu pursued closely and another not? Bhaddali, a certain
bhikkhu always does an offence. When the bhikkhus question him, he leads
the talk aside and shows anger, aversion and displeasure. He does not behave
correctly and say, I will act in such a way to please the Community. Then
it occurs to those bhikkhus. This bhikkhu always does an offence. When
questiond by the bhikkhus, he leads the talk aside and shows anger, aversion
and displeasure. He does not behave correctly and say, I will act in such
a way to please the Community. Then the bhikkhus say, good if the venerable
ones do not settle this bhikkhu’s question quickly. Bhaddali, then it happens
that the bhikkhus do not settle that bhikkhu’s question quickly. Here Bhaddali,
a certain bhikkhu always does an offence, when the bhikkhus question him,
he does not lead the talk aside and does not show anger, aversion and displeasure,
he behaves calmly and says, I will act in such a way to please the Community.
Then it occurs to those bhikkhus.The bhikkhu always does an offence. When
questiond by the bhikkhus he does not lead the talk aside and show anger,
aversion and displeasure. He behaves calmly and says, I will act in such
a way to please the Community, Then the bhikkhus say, good if the venerable
ones settle this bhikkhu’s question quickly. Bhaddali, then it happens
that the bhikkhus settle that bhikkhu’s question quickly. .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Here Bhaddali,
a certain bhikkhu is always guilty, without an offence when the bhikkhus
question him, he leads the talk aside and shows anger, aversion and displeasure.

question quickly. .<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhaddali,
a certain bhikkhu goes on, only out of faith and love. Then it occurs to
the bhikkhus: This bhikkhu goes on only out of faith and love: If we pursue
this bhikkhu too much his little faith and love will decrease. When a man
has a single eye, his friends, co-associates and blood relations protect
his single eye, do not do this and that, your one eye will be lost. In
the same manner it occurs to the bhikkhus: This bhikkhu goes on only out
of faith and love: If we pursue this bhikkhu too much even his little faith
and love will decrease.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhaddali
this is the reason for a certain bhikkhu to be pursued closely and another
not to be pursued closely ‘

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, what is the reason that earlier, with few rules many bhikkhus attained
extinction, and now with many rules a few bhikkhus attain extinction?’
‘Baddali, it happens when human beings diminish in good and when the Teaching
deteriorates. Many rules are appointed few bhikkhus attain extinction.
Bhaddali, the Teacher does not appoint a rule until a fall for desires
is evident, when falls for desires are evident among the Community, the
Teacher appoints a rule for the dispelling of those falls for desires.
Until the Community grows large, these falls for desires do not become
evident. Until the Community become the highest gainers, the Community
reaches the highest fame, become the most learned, the long standing ones,
a fall for desires does not become evident. Bhaddali, when a bhikkhu becomes
a long standing one a fall for desires becomes evident and then the Teacher
appoints a rule to dispel those falls for desires.’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhaddali
you were small when I taught the discourse with the comparison of the thoroughbred,
do you remember it? No, venerable sir. Bhaddali, do you know why it was
taught? Venerable sir, isn’t it for being incomplete in the training in
the dispensation of the Teacher for a long time? Bhaddali, that only, is
not the reason, I have penetrated and seen your mind throughout a long
time. I knew,:this foolish man does not consider the Teaching as a whole
and and take the essence. I will give the discourse with the simile of
the thoroughbred, listen and attend carefully.’ Venerable Bhaddali agreed
and the Blessed One said thus:

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Bhaddali,
a good tamer of horses, getting a thoroughbred to train would first train
it to the mouth. While getting trained to the mouth it would be restless,
disagreeable and would writhe with the unusual training but would quickly
do the first and the last of those exercises and soon the restlessness,
disagreeability and the writhing would subside. When the restlessness,
disagreeability and the writhing by wearing the mouth -piece subsides,
the horse trainer gives it a further training in fixing the yoke. When
fixed to the yoke too the thoroughbred would be restless, disagreeable
and would writhe with the unusual training but would quickly do the first
and the last of the exercises and soon the restlessness, disagreeability
and the writhing would subside. Then the horse trainer would give him a
further training in gallopping in circles, repeatedly. Getting trained
in the unusual gallopping in circles, repeatedly it would be restless,
disagreeable and would writhe with the unusual training but would quickly
do the first and the last of those exercises and soon the restlessness,
disagreeability and the writhing would subside. When the restlessness,
disagreeability and the writhing subsides, when gallopping in circles,
repeatedly, the horse trainer would give it a further training in maintaining
silence. While getting trained in maintaining silence too, it would be
restless, disagreeable and would writhe with the unusual training but would
quickly do the first and the last of those exercises and soon the restlessness,
disagreeability and the writhing would subside. When the thoroughbred has
finished this tenfold training, it becomes worthy for the king, worthy
for the services of the king, the royal property. In the same manner the
bhikkhu endowed with these ten things would be worthy for hospitality,
offerings, gifts, and for reverential salutation. He becomes an incomparable
field of merit for the world: What ten: The bhikkhu should be endowed with
the right view, of one gone beyond the training and right thoughts of one
gone beyond the training. Endowed with right words and right actions of
one gone beyond the training. Endowed with the right livelihood of one
gone beyond the training. With right effort and right mindfulness of one
gone beyond the training. Should be endowed with the right concentration
and right release of one gone beyond the training. Bhaddali, the bhikkhu
endowed with these ten things becomes worthy for hospitality, worthy for
offerings, worthy for gifts, worthy for reverential salutation and an incomparable
field of merit for the world’.

A bhikkhu released both ways.’ubhatovimutto’ A bhikkhu released both ways
literary knows the release and he experiences that release here and now.
That is he experiences the release that he knows with the body here and
now.eg. He is not touched by any contact at one or the other doors of mental
contact. He also has experienced this through the jhaanas. 2. Released
through wisdom.’pa~n~naavimutto’ He literary knows the release, and he
experiences it in jhaanas and higher absorptions. 3. A body witness of
the path.’kaayasakkhi’The body witness of the path, once in a way has experienced
the path. He has to make much effort to experience the results here and
now. Yet he is quite safe and would experience its results at least on
his death bed. 4.One come to righteousness of view.’di.t.thipatto’The one
come to righteousness of view is safely gliding on the path. He also is
safe and would experience, results on his death bed, to the extent of his
attainment, if he does not make effort here and now. 5. One released through
faith.’saddhaavimutto’ The one released through faith has a lot of faith
in the enlightenment of the Blessed One, in the Teaching and in the Community
of bhikkhus. On account of it he is released through faith. He is safely
on the path and the maximum number of births left for him would be seven,
even if he becomes lazy and indolent. 6. The one faring according to the
Teaching ‘dhammaanusaari’ He leads a life according to the Teaching and
if he is not lazy and indolent, is sure to enter the stream of the Teaching..7.
One faring according to faith.’saddhaanusaari’ The one faring according
to faith too is sure to enter the stream of the Teaching, if he is not
lazy and indolent.<span
