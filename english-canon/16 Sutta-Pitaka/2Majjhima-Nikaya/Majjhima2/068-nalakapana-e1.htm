<p class="MsoBodyText">I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One was living
in a forest in Nalakapaana in the kingdom of Kosala. At that time many,
well known sons of clansmen had gone forth as homeless ones, through faith
for the Blessed One. Well known ones such venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya,
Kimbila, Bhagu, Kundadaana, Revata, Aananda, and other sons of clansmen.
At that time the Blessed One was seated in the open attended by the Community
of bhikkhus. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus on account of those
sons of clansmen. The bhikkhus, the sons of clansmen who have gone forth,
on account of faith in me, do you lead the holy life with attachment? When
this was said the bhikkhus, were silent. For the second time, and up to
the third time the Blessed One said, The bhikkhus, the sons of clansmen
who have gone forth, on account of faith in me, do you lead the holy life
with an attachment? Even for the third time the bhikkhus were silent.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then it occurred
to the Blessed One, what if I question one of the sons of those clansmen,
then the Blessed One addressed venerable Anuruddha: Anuruddha, are you
attached to the holy life? Venerable sir, I’m attached to the holy life.
Good! Anurudddha, lead the holy life with attachment! Sons of clansmen,
gone forth out of faith in me, should do so. Anurudddha, you are in the
prime of youth, in the first stage of life, even with black hair. When
you should enjoy the five strands of sense pleasure, you have gone forth
and become homeless. Anuruddha, you were not thrown to recluseship out
of fear for the king or robbers. Nor out of fear of a debt, not because
you have no means to live. It is because you thought, I’m overcome by birth,
decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress,
and that few could declare the complete ending of unpleasantness. Anuruddha,
didn’t you go forth with that faith? Yes, venerable sir I did. Anuruddha,
to the son of a clansman who has gone forth thus, what’s there to be done
in this dispensation? Anuruddha, if you do not seclude the mind from sensual
desires and things of demerit, or attain something more exalted than that,
covetousness takes hold of your mind and stays*1). Anger takes hold of
your mind and stays. Sloth and torpor takes hold of your mind and stays.
Restlessness and worry takes hold of your mind and stays and doubts take
hold of your mind and stay. Therefore, Anuruddha, seclude the mind from
sensual desires and things of demerit, or attain something more exalted
than that.So that covetoutness may not take hold of your mind and stay.
Anger may not take hold of your mind and stay, sloth and torpor may not
take hold of your mind and stay, restlessness and worry may not take hold
of your mind and stay and doubts may not take hold of your mind stay.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Anuruddha,
do you think that these defiling desires, full of unplessant results of
a future birth, decay and death, are not dispelled to the Thus Gone One.
Therefore the Thus Gone One carefully pursues one, endures one, dispels
one and destroys another. Venerable sir, we do not think in that manner.
We think it should be like this. Defiling desires, full of unpleasant results,
of a future birth, decay and death, are dispelled to the Thus Gone One.
Therefore the Thus Gone One carefully pursues one, endures one, dispels
one and destroys another. Good, Anuruddha, you have understood it. To the
Thus Gone One these defiling desires, full of unpleasant results of a future
birth, decay and death, are dispelled. They are pulled out from the roots,
made palm stumps, made things that would not grow again. Anuruddha, it
is like a palm of which the top is cut and is not able to grow again. In
the same manner, these defiling desires, full of unplessant results, of
a future birth, decay and death, are dispelled to the Thus Gone One. Therefore
the Thus Gone One, carefully pursues one, endures one, dispels one and
destroys another.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Anuruddha,
for what purpose does the Thus Gone One tell the disciples, without wasting
time, before you die, be born in something higher. Stating one is born
there, another there.*2) The Teaching’s origin is the Blessed One, its
lead is from the Blessed One, and its refuge is the Blessed One. Good that
the meaning occurs to the Blessed One.We, bhikkhus, hearing it from the
Blessed One, will bear it in mind. Anuruddha, the Thus Gone One tells the
disciples, without wasting time before you die, be born in something higher.
Telling them one is born there, another there. Not to deceive people, not
for prattling, and not for gain honour or fame and not thinking may the
people know me thus. Yet, Anuruddha, there are sons of clansmen who are
born in faith and are pleased, to hear it. Hearing it they would arouse
interest and direct their minds to that and it would be for their good
for a long time.

a bhikkhu hears, the venerable bhikkhu of this name has passed away, and
