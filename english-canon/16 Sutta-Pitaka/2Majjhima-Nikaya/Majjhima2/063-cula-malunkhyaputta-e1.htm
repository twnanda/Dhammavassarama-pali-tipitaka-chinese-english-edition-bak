<p class="MsoBodyText">I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One was living
in the monastery offered by Anathapindika in Jet’s grove in Savatthi. When
venerable Malunkhyaputta was in his seclusion this thought occurred to
him These views are unexplained, put aside by the Blessed One: Is the world
eternal or not eternal, is it limited or unlimited? Is the soul and body
the same, is the soul different from the body? Is the Thus Gone One after
death. Isn’t the Thus Gone One after death? Or is it the Thus Gone One
is and isn’t after death? Or the Thus Gone One neither is, nor is not after
death? I do not like these things unexplained by the Blessed One. If the
Blessed One explains them, I will lead the holy life under him, or else
I will give up robes. These were the thoughts and discurcive thoughts that
occurred to venerable Malunkhyaputta in his seclusion

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then venerable
Malunkhyaputta got up from his seclusion, approached.the Blessed One, worshipped
and sat on a side and said, ‘Venerable sir, in my seclusion this thought
occurred to me These views are unexplained and put aside by the Blessed
One: Is the world eternal or not? Is it limited or unlimited, Is the soul
and body the same, or is the soul different from the body? Is the Thus
Gone One after death? Isn’t the Thus Gone One after death? Or is it, the
Thus Gone One is and isn’t after death? Or is it, the Thus Gone One neither
is nor is not after death? I do not like these things unexplained by the
Blessed One. If the Blessed One explains them, to me, I will lead the holy
life, otherwise I will give up robes: If the Blessed One knows the world
is eternal, may the Blessed One declare the world is eternal. If the Blessed
One knows, the world is not eternal may the Blessed One declare the world
is not eternal. If the Blessed One does not know whether the world is eternal
or not eternal, he should be straightforward and say I do not know and
see this. : If the Blessed One knows the world is limited, may the Blessed
One declare the world is limited. If the Blessed One knows the world is
not limited, may the Blessed One declare the world is not limited. If the
Blessed One does not know whether the world is limited or not limited he
should be straightforward and say I do not know and see this. : If the
Blessed One knows whether the soul and body is the same. May the Blessed
One declare the soul and body is the same. If the Blessed One knows, the
soul is different from the body, may the Blessed One declare the soul is
different from the body If the Blessed One does not know whether the soul
and body is the same or the soul is different from body. He should be straightforward
and say I do not know and see this. If the Blessed One knows the Thus Gone
One is after death, may the Blessed One declare the Thus Gone One is after
death. If the Blessed One knows The Thus Gone One is not after death, may
the Blessed One declare, the Thus Gone One is not after death If the Blessed
One does not know whether the Thus Gone One is after death or the Thus
Gone One is not after death. Should be straightforward and say, I do not
know and see this. : If the Blessed One knows the Thus Gone One is not
after death, may the Blessed One declare the Thus Gone One is not after
death. If the Blessed One does not know, The Thus Gone One is, or is not
after death, should be straightforward and say I do not know and see this.
If the Blessed One knows the Thus Gone One is, and is not after death,
may the Blessed One declare the Thus Gone One is, and is not after death.
If the Blessed One does not know The Thus Gone One neither is nor is not
after death, may the Blessed One declare, the Thus Gone One neither is
nor is not after death.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>If the Blessed
One does not know whether the Thus Gone One neither is, nor is not after
death or the Thus Gone One neither is not or is not, not that after death,
he should be straightforward and say I do not know and see this:

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Malunkhyaputta,
did I tell you, Come Malunkhyaputta lead the holy life in my dispensation
I will declare to you, whether the world is eternal or not eternal The
Thus Gone One neither is not or is not, not that after death.? No, venerable
sir. Then did you tell me, venerable sir, I will lead the holy life in
your dispensation if you declare to me whether the world is eternal or
not?<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>The Thus Gone One neither is
not, nor is not that, after death? No, venerable sir.Malunkhyaputta, I
did not ask you to lead the holy life in my dispensation, with a promise
to declare to you whether the world is eternal or not eternal and the thus
Gone One neither is not or is not, not that after death and you did not
tell me venerable sir, I will lead the holy life in your dispensation if
you declare to me whether the world is eternal or not eternal and The Thus
Gone One neither is not nor is not, not that after death. When this is
so, what is the reason to give up robes?

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Malunkhyaputta,
if some one were to say I will not lead the holy life in the dispensation
of the Blessed One until it is declared to me whether the world is eternal
or not and the Thus Gone One neither is not nor is not, not that after
death. Those things would never be declared by the Thus Gone One, and that
person would die. It is like a man shot with a poisoned arrow, and his
friends, co-associates and blood relations would call a surgeon to attend
on him. He would say, I will not pull out this arrow until I know, the
one who shot this arrow is of warrior, brahmin, householder or out castes’
clan. I will not pull out this arrow until, I knew, the name and family
of the one who shot this arrow. I will not pull out this arrow until, I
knew whether the one who shot this arrow is short or tall or of middling
size. I will not pull out, this arrow until, I knew whether the one who
shot this arrow is dark, or fair or tan. I will not pull out this arrow
until, I knew the town, village or the hamlet from which he came. I will
not pull out this arrow until, I knew the kind of bow used, I will not
pull out the arrow until, I knew the kind of string used for the bow.<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>I
will not pull out this arrow until, I knew the kind of shaft used to shoot.
Malunkhyaputta, this man will die before he knew all this In the same manner,
Malunkhyaputta, if anyone was to say I will not lead the holy life in the
dispensation of the Blessed One until, it is declared to me whether the
world is eternal or not and The Thus Gone One neither is not nor is not,
not that after death..Those things will never be declared by the Thus Gone
One, and that person will die.

<p class="MsoBodyText">Malunkhyaputta, with the view, the world is eternal,
a holy life is not lead, even with the view the world is not eternal, a
holy life is not lead. Malunkhyaputta, with<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>the
view the world is eternal or even the world is not eternal, there is birth,
decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness and displeasure, I declare
he is destroyed here and now. Malunkhyaputta, with the view, the world
is limited, a holy life is not lead, even with the view the world is not
limited, a holy life is not lead. Malunkhyaputta, with the view the world
is limited or even the world is not limited, there is birth, decay, death,
grief, lament, unpleasantness and displeasure, I declare he is destroyed
here and now. Malunkhyaputta, with the view, the soul and body is the same,
a holy life is not lead, even with the view the soul is different from
the body, a holy life is not lead. Malunkhyaputta, with the view, the soul
and body is the same or even with the view the soul is different from the
body, there is birth, decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness and displeasure,
I declare he is destroyed here and now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Malunkhyaputta,
with the view, the Thus Gone One is, after death, a holy life is not lead.
Even with the view the Thus Gone One is not after death, a holy life is
not lead. Malunkhyaputta, with the view the Thus Gone One is after death
or even the view the Thus Gone One is not after death, there is birth,
decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness and distress. I declare he
is destroyed here and now Malunkhyaputta, with the view, the Thus Gone
One is and is not after death, a holy life is not lead. Even with the view
the Thus Gone One neither is, nor is not after death. A holy life is not
lead. Malunkhyaputta, with the view the Thus Gone One is and is not after
death or even the view the Thus Gone One neither is nor is not after death,
there is birth, decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness and distress.I
declare he is destroyed here and now.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Therefore
Malunkhyaputta, bear the undeclared as undeclared.Malunkhyaputta, what
are
the not declared? The world is eternal, is not declared by me. The world
is not eternal, is limited, is not limited. The soul and body are the same.
The soul is different from the body. The Thus Gone One is, after death.
The Thus Gone One, is not after death. The Thus Gone One is and is not
after death. The Thus Gone One neither is, nor is not after death, are
not declared by me.<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Malunkhyaputta,
why are these not declared by me? They are not the essential for the principles
of the holy life, they do not lead to turning away, to detachment, to cessation,
to appeasement, to realisation, to enlightenment and to extinction. Malunkhyaputta,
what are the declared by me? This, is unpleasant, is declared. This, is
its arising, is delcared. This, is its cessation is declared. This is the
path to its cessation, is declared. Malunkhyaputta, why are these declared
by me? These are the essentials for the principles of the holy life, they
lead to turning away, to detachment, to cessation, to appeasement, to realisation,
to enlightenment and to extinction. Malunkhyaputta, I declare them. Bear
the undeclared as undeclared and the declared as declared.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>I heard thus.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>At one time
the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anathapindika in
Jeta’s grove in Savatthi. From there the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:
Bhikkhus, do you remember the five lower bonds of the sensual world preached
by me. When this was said, venerable Malunkhyaputta said to the Blessed
One.Venerable sir, I remember the five lower bonds of the sensual world
preached by the Blessed One. Malunkhyaputta, what do you remember of the
five lower bonds of the sensual world preached by me? Venerable sir, I
remember self view, doubts holding to virtues as the highest aim, sensual
interest and anger as lower bonds of the sensual world preached by the
Blessed One. I remember these five lower bonds of the sensual world preached
by the Blessed One.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Malunkhyaputta,
to whom do you know me preaching, the lower bonds of the sensual world
in this manner. Wouldn’t the ascetics of other sects find fault with this
foolish example. To a toddler, who moves about with difficulty, there is
not even a self. How could a view arise about a self? The latent tendencies
of a self view filter to him.*1)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Maalunkhyaputta,
to a toddler who moves about with difficulty, there are not even thoughts.
How could doubts arise to him about thoughts? The latent tendency to doubt,
filter to him. To a toddler who moves about with difficulty there are not
even virtues. How could there be a holding to virtues as high?.The latent
tendency to hold to virtues as high filter to him. Malunkhyaputta, to a
toddler there is not even sensual desires..How could there be interest
for sensual desires?. The latent tendencies to greed for sensual interest
filter to him.Malunkhyaputta, to a toddler beings don’t matter. How could
he have anger towards beings? The latent tendencies to get angry filter
to him. Malunkhyaputta, wouldn’t the ascetics of other sects find fault
with this foolish example. Then venerable Ananda, said to the Blessed One.
Venerable sir, this is the time to teach the five lower bonds of the sensual
world. The bhikkhus hearing it from the Blessed One will bear it in mind.
Then Ananda, listen I will teach said the Blessed One and venerable Ananda
agreed.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Ananda, the
ordinary man who hasn’t seen noble ones, and Great Men not clever in their
Teaching and not trained in their Teaching abides with a mind overcome
with a view of a self. He does not know the escape from that arisen view
of a self, as it really is. That view of self stands firm and untamed,
as a lower bond of the sensual world. He abides with a mind, overcome with
doubts. Not knowing the escape from arisen doubts as it really is. Those
doubts stand firm and untamed, as a lower bond of the sensual world. Abiding
with a mind that has taken virtues as high, not knowing the escape from
the arisen esteem for virtues as it really is. The high esteem for virtues
becomes firm and untamed, as a lower bond of the sensual world. Abiding
with a mind overcome by sensual greed, does not know the escape from arisen
sensual greed, as it really is. That sensual greed stands firm and untamed,
as a bond of the lower sensual world. Abiding with a mind overcome with
anger. Does not know the escape from arisen anger as it really is. That
anger stands firm and untamed, as a lower bond of the sensual world.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Ananda, the
learned noble disciple who has seen noble ones, and Great Men, clever in
their Teaching and trained in their Teaching abides with a mind not overcome
with the view of a self. He knows the escape from the arisen view of a
self, as it really is. His view of the self, fades together with the latent
tendencies. Not abiding with a mind, overcome with doubts, knows the escape
from arisen doubts as it really is. His doubts fade together with the latent
tendencies. Not thinking that virtues are of high esteem, knows the escape
from the arisen high esteem of virtues as it really is and the high esteem
for virtues fades, together with the latent tendencies. Abiding with a
mind not overcome by sensual greed knows the escape from arisen sensual
greed as it really is. That sensual greed fades from him together with
the latent tendencies. Abiding with a mind, not overcome by anger, knows
the escape from arisen anger as it really is, and that anger fades together
with the latendencies.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Ananda, this
is the path and method, to overcome the lower bonds of the sensual world.
It is not possible that one could, knowing and seeing overcome the lower
bonds of the sensual world without coming to this path and method. It is
like one come to a huge standing tree with heartwood, would cut the heartwood
without removing the bark and sapwood. That is not possible, in the same
manner, it is not possible that one could know, see and overcome the lower
bonds of the sensual world, without coming to this path and method. Ananda,
this is the path and method to overcome the lower bonds of the sensual
world. It is possible that one would know, see and overcome the lower bonds
of the sensual world coming to this path and method. It is like someone
come to a huge standing tree with heartwood, would cut the bark and sapwood
and then take the heartwood. That is possible. In the same manner, come
to this path and method, it is possible that one would know, see and overcome
the lower bonds of the sensual world. Like a weak man come to the bank
of river Ganges, full to the brim with over flowing banks would say I will
cut the stream of the river, with my hands and safely cross the river.
It is not posssible that he would cross the river. In the same manner,
when the Teaching is given for the cessation of the view, of self, the
mind does not spring, delight and settle to be released. It should be known
as the nature of that weak man. Like a strong man come to the bank of river
Ganges, full to the brim with over flowing banks would say I will cut the
stream of the river, with my hands and safely cross the river. It is posssible
that he would cross the river. In the same manner, Ananda, when the Teaching
is given for the cessation of the view, of self, the mind springs, delights
and settles to be released, it should be known as the nature of the strong
man.. .<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Ananda, what
is the path and method, to dispel the lower bonds of the sensual world?
Ananda, the bhikkhu secluding the mind thoroughly, by dispelling things
of demerit, removes all bodily transgressions that bring remorse. Then
secluding the mind, from sensual thoughts and thoughts of demerit, with
thoughts and discursive thoughts and with joy and pleasantness born of
seclusion abides in the first jhana. Established in it he reflects all
things that matter, all feelings, all perceptive things, all intentions,
all conscious signs are impermanent, unpleasant, an illness, an abscess,
an arrow, a misfortune, an ailment, foreign, destined for destruction,
is void, and devoid of a self. Then he turns the mind to the deathless
element: This is peaceful, this is exalted, such as the appeasement of
all determinations, the giving up of all endearments, the destruction of
craving, detachment, cessation and extinction*1). With that mind he comes
to the destruction of desires. If he does not destroy desires on account
of greed and interest for those same things. He arises spontaneously, with
the destruction of the five lower bonds, of the sensual world, not to proceed.
Ananda, this too is a method for overcoming the five lower bonds of the
sensual world..

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Again, Ananda,
the bhikkhu overcoming thoughts and thought processes, the mind internally
appeased, in one point, without thoughts and thought processes and with
joy and pleasantness born of concentration, abides in the second jhana---
in the third jhana—in the fourth jhana.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Attained
to it, he reflects all things that matter, all feelings, all perceptive
things, all intentions, all conscious signs are impermanent, unpleasant,
an illness, an abscess, an arrow, a misfortune, an ailment, foreign, destined

on account of greed and interest for those same things he arises spontaneously,
with the destruction of the five lower bonds of the sensual world, not
to proceed. Ananda, this too is a method for overcoming the five lower
bonds for the sensual world.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Again, Ananda,
the bhikkhu overcoming all perceptions of matter and anger, not attending
to various perceptions, with space is boundless abides in the sphere of
space. Attained to it, he reflects all things that matter, all feelings,
all perceptive things, all intentions, all conscious signs, are impermanent,
unpleasant, an illness, an abscess, an arrow, a misfortune, an ailment,
foreign, destined for destruction, void, devoid of a self.. Then he turns
the mind to the deathless element: This is peaceful, this is exalted, such
as the appeasement of all determinations, the giving up of all endearments,

the destruction of desires on account of greed and interest for those same
things, he arises spontaneously with the destruction of the five lower
bonds not to proceed. Ananda, this too is a method for overcoming the five
lower bonds for the sensual world.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Again, Ananda,
the bhikkhu overcoming all peceptions of space, with consciousness is boundless,
abides in the sphere of consciousness.--overcoming all the sphere of conscioussness,
with there is nothing, abides in the sphere of no-thingness Attained to
it he reflects all things that matter, all feelings, all perceptive things,
all intentions, all conscious signs::are impermanent, unpleasant, an illness,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>an
abscess, an arrow, a misfortune, an ailment, foreign, destined for destruction,

dispelling of the five lower bonds for the sensual world.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Venerable
sir, when this is the path and the method for the destruction of the five
lower bonds for the sensual world, why does a certain bhikkhu talk of a
release of mind and a release through wisdom? Ananda, that is the difference
in the maturity of the mental faculties.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>The Blessed
