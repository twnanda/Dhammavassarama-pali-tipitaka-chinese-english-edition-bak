<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>I
heard thus. At one time the Blessed One lived in Gosita’s monastery in
Kosambi. At that time the wandering ascetic Sandaka lived in a grove of
fig trees with a large community of wandering ascetics about five hundred
of them. Then venerable Ananda, getting up from his seclusion in the evening
addressed the bhikkhus: ‘Friends, let us go to the Devakata pool to see
the caves.’ Those bhikkhus agreed and venerable Ananda approached the Devakata
pool with those bhikkhus. At that time, the wandering ascetic Sandaka was
seated with a large gathering of wandering ascetics making much noise engaged
in various kinds of childish talk. Such as talk about kings, robbers, chief
ministers, the army, about fears, fights, eatables and drinks, dress, beds,
flowers and scents, relations, conveyances,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>villages,
hamlets, towns and states, women and heros, and gossip at the corner of
the street and at the well,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>about
those dead and gone, various other talk about the origin of the world and
the ocean<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>and<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>of
things that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>happened<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>and
did not happen. The wandering ascetic Sandaka saw venerable Ananda coming
in the distance and silenced the gathering: ‘Good sirs, make less noise,
do not make such a noise. The recluse Ananda, a disciple of the recluse
Gotama is coming. Of the disciples of recluse Gotama, residing in Kosambi
this is one. These venerable ones make little noise, are trained to make
little noise and they train others to make little noise. Thinking this
gathering makes little noise may have thought to approach.’ Then those
wandering ascetics became silent Venerable Ananda approached the wandering
ascetic, Sandaka. The wandering ascetic Sandaka said to venerable Ananda:
‘Good Ananda, come! It is after a long time that good Ananda thought of
coming. Sit good Ananda, the seat is ready.’ Venerable Ananda sat on the
prepared seat, and the wandering ascetic too sat on a side taking a low
seat.&nbsp;</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then
venerable Ananda, addressed the wandering ascetic Sandaka who was seated
on a side; ‘Sandaka, with what talk were you seated at this time, and what
was your topic of conversation.’ ‘Let that talk be, good Ananda, with what
we were sitting now. A talk, from good Ananda, we hear rarely. We would
like to hear something concerning the Teaching of your Teacher.’ ‘If so
Sandaka be attentive and listen carefully’. The wandering ascetic Sandaka
agreed and venerable Ananda said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Sandaka,
the Blessed One who knows and sees, is perfect and rightfully enlightened
has declared four holy lives that should not be lived and four other unsatisfactory
holy lives that should not be lived. Which the wise man if possible does
not live, and even if he lives is not convinced that it is merit.’ ‘Good
Ananda, what are the four holy lives declared by the Blessed One who knows
and sees, is perfect and rightfully enlightened that should not be lived,
which the wise man if possible does not live and even if he lives is not
convinced that it is merit?’&nbsp;</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>‘Sandaka,
a certain Teacher upholds this view and declares it: There are no results
for gifts, sacrifices and offerings. There are no results for good and
bad actions, there is no this world, no other world, no mother, no father.
There are no spontaneously arisen beings and no recluses and brahmins,
who by themselves realising this world and the other world declare it.
The man is made of the four primary elements and when he dies, earth, goes
back to earth, water, to water, fire, to the fire, and air, to air. The
mental faculties ascend the sky. Five people, carry the corpse in a decked
chair, as far as the cemetery, the remains are grey bones. The burnt ashes
become a gift. Whoever says, there is something, talk useless words. The
foolish and the wise after death get anihilated and destroyed, and there
is nothing after death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Sandaka
a wise man reflects, this good teacher upholds this view and declares.
There are no results for gifts-re--and there is nothing after death. If
the words of these teachers are true, I should not do anything. I should
not live the holy life. After death my teacher and I become equal in our
recluseship. I who do not even believe it. We both get anihilated and destroyed
after death. Unnecessarily these good teachers went naked and wore a knot
on the head, did austerities yoked to standing and pulling out hairs of
the head and beard. As for me, I lived surrounded by wife and children,
enjoyed wearing Kashmire clothes, bearing flowers and scents, and earning
gold and silver. I become equal with these good teachers after death. Knowing
what and seeing what should I lead the holy life under these teachers.
He knowing this is not a holy life turns away from it. Sandaka, this is
the first holy life the Blessed One who knows and sees, is perfect and
rightfully enlightened has declared should not be lived, which the wise
man if possible does not live, and even if he lives is not convinced that
it is merit.&nbsp;</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Again,
Sandaka a certain teacher upholds this view and declares The doer, and
the subjected, the destroyer and destroyed, the tormentor and tormented,
the griever and giver of grief, the frightened and the monster do no demerit.
The killer, the taker of the not given, the one who cuts limbs, the plunderer,
the prison keeper, the one waiting in ambush, the one going to others’
wives, and the deceiver, do no demerit. If one was to roll a wheel with
blades fixed to the rim, up to the southern bank of the Ganges, killing
all beings and making it, a mass of flesh, the destroyer does not accumulate
demerit, on account of it. If one goes up to the northern bank of the Ganges
giving gifts and making others to give gifts, making sacrifices and making
others to sacrifice, there is no merit accumulated on account of it.</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Sandaka
a wise man reflects. This good teacher upholds this view and declares.
The doer and the subjected--- there is no.merit accumulated on account
of it. If the words of this teacher are true, I should not do, anything.
I should not live the holy life. My teacher and I become equal in our recluseship.
I do not even believe it. We both do not accumulate demerit. Unnecessarily
these good teachers led a holy life.. As for me, I lived surrounded by
wife and children, enjoyed wearing Kashmire clothes, bearing flowers and
scents, and earning gold and silver. After death, I become equal with these
good teachers. Knowing what and seeing what should I lead the holy life
under these teachers. He knowing this is not a holy life turns away from
it. : Sandaka, this is the second holy life the Blessed One who knows and
sees, is perfect and rightfully enlightened has declared should not be
lived, which the wise man if possible does not live, and even if he lives
is not convinced that it is merit.&nbsp;</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Again,
Sandaka, a certain teacher upholds this view and declares it. Beings are
made impure for no cause or reason, and purified for no cause or reason.
There is no strength, no effort, no manly power, no manly courage, all
beings, all living things, all born, are led to maturity and are born in
the higher six and experience pleasantness and unpleasantness</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Here,
Sandaka a wise man reflects, this good teacher upholds this view and declares
that beings are defiled--- experience pleasantness and unpleasantness.
If the words of these teachers are true, here I should not do, anything.
I should not live the holy life. My teacher and I we both become equal
in our recluseship, I who do not believe it. We both will be purified without
a reason Unnecessarily these good teachers led a holy life.. As for me,
I lived surrounded by wife and children, enjoyed wearing Kashmire clothes,
bearing flowers and scents, and earning gold and silver. After death, I
become equal with these good teachers. Knowing what and seeing what should
I lead the holy life under these teachers. He knowing this is not a holy
life turns away from it. Sandaka, this is the third holy life the Blessed
One who knows and sees, is perfect and rightfully enlightened has declared
should not be lived, which the wise man if possible does not live, and
even if he lives is not convinced that it is merit.&nbsp;</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Again,
Sandaka a certain teacher upholds this view and declares it. These seven
bodies are not made nor created, are barren, immovable and stand like strong
pillars. They don’t move or change, or harm each other. One is not interested
in the others pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings.
What are the seven? They are earth, water, fire, air, pleasantness, unpleasantness,
and the soul.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Therefore there is
no harming, or killing, hearing or making to hear, cognizing or making
to cognize. If the head is cut with a sharp weapon, no life is destroyed.
Only the seven bodies are dismantled. There are, fourteen hundred thousand
important births, sixty thousand six hundred and five actions. Five hundred
of four actions, three of four actions, one action, half an action and
sixteen methods. Sixteen internal world cycles. Six high births, eight
births of a prophet, four thousand nine hundred ascetic births, four thousand
nine hundred wandering ascetic births, and four thousand nine hundred elephant
births. Twenty hundred controlling powers, thirty hundred hells, six and
thirty royal elements, seven perceptual births, seven non-perceptual births,
seven niganta births, seven heavenly and seven human births, seven ghostly
births and seven recollections. Seven higher recollections, seven hundred
and seven falls, seven hundred and seven dreams. Faring on as fools or
as wise, for eighty hundred thousand major and minor world cycles should
end unpleasantness. It is not that by these virtues, observances, austerities,
I will mature my imature actions, or while feeling I put an end to feelings.
There are no measurements for pleasant or unpleasant feelings and not seeing
an end to existences. There are no highs and lows. It is like being thrown
into a disordered ball of thread and one has to find one’s way to come
out of it. Faring on as fools or as wise, for eighty hundred thousand major
and minor, world cycles one should end unpleasantness. .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Sandaka
a wise man reflects. This good teacher upholds this view and declares it.
These seven bodies—should end unpleasantness. If the words, of these teachers
are true, I should not do anything. I should not live the holy life. My
teacher and I are equal in our recluseship, I who do not even believe it.
We both will make an end of unpleasantness faring on in existences. Unnecessarily
these good teachers led a holy life, going naked, wearing a knot on the
head. Yoked to standing and pulling out hairs of head and beard.. As for
me, I lived surrounded by wife and children, enjoyed wearing Kashmire clothes,
bearing flowers and scents, and earning gold and silver. After death I
become equal with these good teachers. Knowing what and seeing what should
I lead the holy life under these teachers. He knowing this is not a holy
life turns away from it. : Sandaka, this is the fourth holy life the Blessed
One who knows and sees, is perfect and rightfully enlightened has declared
should not be lived, which the wise man if possible does not live, and
even if he lives is not convinced that it is merit&nbsp;</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Sandaka,
these are the four holy lives, the Blessed One who knows and sees, is perfect
and rightfully enlightened has declared should not be lived, which the
wise man if possible does not live and even if he lives is not convinced
that it is merit. –Surprising and wonderful good Ananda, these four holy
lives that the Blessed One who knows and sees, is perfect and rightfully
enlightend has declared as should not be lived, which the wise man if possible
does not live and even if he lives is not convinced that it is merit. Good
Ananda what are the four holy lives, the Blessed One who knows and sees,
is perfect and rightfully enlightened has declared as unsatisfactory and
should not be lived, which the wise man if possible does not live and even
if he lives is not convinced, that it is merit.&nbsp;</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Sandaka,
a certain teacher acknowledges all pervading knowledge and vision constantly
and continually, while, walking, standing, lying or awake. He enters an
empty house and does not gain morsels.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>A
dog bites him. He encounters an elephant in rut, a rough horse or a rough
bull. Asks for the name and clan of a man or woman, or the name of a village
or hamlet and how one should go there. When asked what it is. He would
say, I entered an empty house, did not gain morsels and a dog bit me. I
met, an elephant in rut, a rough horse, a rough bull. I had to ask the
name and clan of a man, a woman, a village, a hamlet and how I should get
there. Sandaka, a wise man should reflect. This good teacher acknowledges
all pervading knowledge and vision, and ---he asks the name and clan of
a man, a woman. I should know and turn away from that holy life as unsatisfactory.
Sandaka, this is the first holy life, the Blessed One who knows and sees,
is perfect and rightfully enlightened has declared as unsatisfactory and
should not be lived, which the wise man if possible does not live and even
if he lives is not convinced, that it is merit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>.<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Again,
Sandaka, a certain teacher goes by hearsay and takes it as the truth. To
a teacher who goes by hearsay, the tradition becomes the truth. He may
have heard it correctly or may not have heard it correctly. It becomes
the truth to him, the truth may be something else. Sandaka, a wise man
should reflect. This teacher goes by hearsay. He preaches what has reached
him by tradition and hearsay. What he has heard may be the truth or not.
I, should know and turn away from that holy life as unsatisfactory. Sandaka,
this is the second holy life, the Blessed One who knows, sees, is perfect
and rightfully enlightened has declared as unsatisfactory and should not
be lived. The wise man if possible does not live and even if he lives is
not convinced, that it is merit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Again,
Sandaka, a certain teacher goes by logic, arguing logically brings out
a teaching by himself beaten out. In the teaching of a logical teacher,
some arguments may be true and others may not be true. Sandaka, a wise
man should reflect. This teacher goes by logic. He preaches what he has
beaten out by logical conclusion. His arguments may be authentic or not,
I should know and turn away from that holy life as unsatisfactory. Sandaka,
this is the third holy life, the Blessed One who knows and sees, is perfect
and rightfully enlightened has declared as unsatisfactory and should not
be lived. The wise man if possible does not live and even if he lives is
not convinced, that it is merit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Again
Sandaka, a certain teacher is dull and bewildered, when a question is asked,
he wriggles and sits on the fence. It does not occur to me thus, it does
not occur to me otherwise, there is no other solution either and none of
these are the solutions. Sandaka, a wise man should reflect. This teacher
is dull and bewildered, when a question is asked he wriggles and sits on
the fence. I should know and turn away from that holy life as unsatisfactory.
Sandaka, this is the fourth holy life, the Blessed One who knows and sees,
is perfect and rightfully enlightened has declared as unsatisfactory and
should not be lived, which the wise man if possible does not live and even
if he lives is not convinced, that it is merit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Sandaka,
these are the four holy lives the Blessed One who knows and sees, is perfect
and rightfully enlightened has declared as unsatisfactory and should not
be lived.’ ‘Surprising and wonderful good Ananda, these four holy lives
that the Blessed One who knows and sees, is perfect and rightfully enlightend
has declared as unsatisfactory, which the wise man if possible does not
live and even if he lives is not convinced that it is merit. Good Ananda
what is the holy life, declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees,
is perfect and rightfully enlightened as satisfactory and convincing in
the noble Teaching, and is merit?’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-ansi-language:
EN-US'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Sandaka,
the Thus Gone One is born in the world, perfect, rightfully enlightened,<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>endowed
with knowledge and conduct, well gone, knower of the worlds, the incomparable
tamer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed.
He proclaims to this world of gods and men, together with its Maras, Brahmas,
the community of recluses, brahmins, gods and men, that Teaching good at
the beginning, in the middle and in the end, full of meaning even in the
letters declaring the complete and pure holy life. A householder, or the
son of a householder or one born in some clan hears the Teaching and gains
faith in the Thus Gone One.With that gain of faith reflects, the household
life is full of difficulties, it is the path for defiling. Going forth
is like open space. Living in a household it is not easy to lead a holy
life complete and pure without being defiled. What if I shave, head and
beard, put on yellow clothes and go forth homeless. At some suitable time
he gives up a little wealth or a large mass of wealth, either leaving behind
a small circle of friends, or a large circle of friends shaving head and
beard and donning yellow clothes goes forth as a homeless.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Gone forth he becomes a
trainer in the life of a bhikkhu, gives up hurting living things, throwing
away stick and weapon, ashamed and compassion aroused, abides with compassion
for all beings. Abstaining from taking what is not given, desires the given,
the self made pure without thieving he abides. Abstaining from low sexual
intercourse he leads the holy life. Abstaining from telling lies becomes
reliable and trustworthy and abides without a dispute with the world. Giving
up slander, hearing here does not say it elsewhere, to split these. Hearing
elsewhere does not say it here to split those. Unites the split, promotes
unity, fond of unity talks words to unite. Giving up rough words says pleasant
words pleasing to the ears, and going straight to the heart of the populace
at large. Abstains from frivolous talk. Says appropriate, truthful, meaningful
words in accordance with the Teaching and Discipline, those words that
could be treasured.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

from destroying seed groups and vegetable groups. Partaking one meal per
day, abstains from food at night and at untimely hours. Abstains from dance,
singing, music, decorations, flowers and scents, ointments and adornments.
Abstains from high and stately beds. Abstains from accepting gold and silver,
uncooked rice and uncooked flesh,. Abstains from accepting women and girls,
slaves, men or women, Abstains from accepting goats and cows, fowl and
pigs, elephants, cattle, horses and mares.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Abstains, from, accepting
fields and wealth, doing the work of a messenger, buying and selling, and
unfair ways of weighing and measuring. Abstains from cutting severing,
destroying, highway robbery, and wrong ways of obtaining morsels.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Satisfied,
covering the body with robes, and feeding the belly with morsels, goes
with all the belongings when he goes. Like the birds small and large that
go with the weight of their wings. Likewise satisfied covering the body
with robes and feeding the belly with morsels goes with all the belongings
when he goes. Endowed with this mass of virtues, he experiences the pleasure
of blamelessness internally. Seeing a form with the eye, does not take
the sign or the elements. Abiding with the mental faculty of the eye uncontrolled,
demerit may seep, through covetousness and displeasure. He abides protecting
the mental faculty of the eye. Hearing a sound with the ear…re.. Cognizing
a smell with the nose…re…tasting a taste with the tongue..re.. Cognizing
a touch with the body..re..Cognizing an idea with the mind, does not take
the sign or the element. Abiding with the mental faculty of the mind uncontrolled,
demerit may seep, through covetousness and displeasure. He abides protecting
the mental faculty of the mind. Endowed with the noble ones’ control of
the mental faculties, he experiences the untouched pleasure of the mental
faculties. Coming forward or turning back is aware. Looking on and looking
aside is aware, bending and stretching is aware, bearing bowl and the three
robes is aware. Tasting, drinking, eating and enjoying is aware. Going,
standing, sitting, lying when awake, and keeping silence is aware. Endowed
with this mass of virtues, with this control of the mental faculties of
the noble ones, with the mindfulness of the noble ones he abides, in a
secluded dwelling. Such as a forest, the root of a tree, a mountain grotto,
a cave, a charnel ground, a jungle forest, an open space, or a heap of
straw. Returning from the alms round and after the meal is over, he sits
legs crossed, the body straight and mindfulness established in front.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Dispelling,
covetousness for the world he abides, cleaning the mind of covetousness.
.He abides cleaning the mind of anger, compassion aroused for<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>all<span style="mso-spacerun:

Dispelling sloth and torpor he abides, mindful and aware of a perception
of light and mindfully cleans sloth and torpor. Dispelling restlessness
and worry he abides with a mind internally appeased, restlessness and worry
dispelled. Abides doubts dispelled of merit that should be done and should
not be done.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>The
bhikkhu dispelling the five hindrances and making the minor defilements
weak,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>secludes the mind from sensual,
angry and hurting thoughts. With thoughts and thought processes and with
joy and pleasantness, born of seclusion, abides in the first jhana. Sandaka,
when the noble disciple of the Teacher attains that noble distinction,
he has wisely lived the holy life and is convinced of it as merit. Again
the bhikkhu overcoming thoughts and thought processes, appeases the mind
internally in a single point. Without thoughts and thought processes and
with joy and pleasantness born of concentration abides in the second jhana.
Sandaka, when the noble disciple of the Teacher has attained to that noble
distinction, he has wisely lived the holy life and even while doing so
is convinced of it, as merit. Again, the bhikkhu with equanimity to joy
and detachment abides mindful and aware experiencing pleasantness with
the body too, and attains to the third jhaana. The noble ones say this
is abiding in pleasanatness, mindful of equanimity. Again, the bhikkhu
dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness and earlier having dispelled
pleasure and displeasure, and mindfulness purified with equanimity abides
in the fourth jhana. Sandaka, when the noble disciple of the Teacher has
attained to that noble distinction, he has wisely lived the holy life and
even while doing so is convinced of it as merit. .

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>When
the mind is concentrated, pure, free from minor defilements, is malleable

births, one birth, two births, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty,
forty, fifty, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births,
innumerable forward cycles of births, innumerable backward cycles of births,
innumerable forward and backward cycles of births. There I was of such
name, clan, disposition, supports, experienced such pleasant and unpleasant
feelings, in such a life span. Disappearing from there was born there with
such name, clan, disposition, supports, experienced such pleasant and unpleasant
feelings, in such a life span. Disappearing from there is born here. Thus
with all modes and all details manifold previous births are recollected.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>When
the mind is concentrated, pure, free from minor defilements malleable workable
not disturbed, he directs the mind for the knowledge of the disappearing
and appearing of beings. With the heavenly eye purified beyond human, he
sees beings disappear and appear unexalted and exalted, beautiful and ugly,
in good and bad states according to their actions. These good beings misbehaving
by body, speech and mind, blaming noble ones, with the wrong view of actions,
after death are born in loss, in decrease, in hell. As for these good beings,
well behaved in body speech and mind, not blaming noble ones, with the
right view of actions after death are born in heaven. Thus with the heavenly
eye purified beyond human he sees beings disappearing and appearing. Sandaka,
when the noble disciple of the Teacher has attained to that noble distinction,

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>When
the mind is concentrated, pure, free from minor defilements, malleable
workable not disturbed, he directs the mind for the destruction of desires.
Knows, this is unpleasant, this is the arising of unpleasantness, this
is the cessation of unpleasantness and this is the path to the cessation
of unpleasantness as it really is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Knows
these are desires, this is the arising of desires, this is the cessation
of desires and this is the path to the cessation of desires as it really
is. He who knows and sees thus, is released from sensual desires, releasd
from desires ‘to be’ and released from desires of ignorance. When released
knows, I’m released, birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived. What should
be done, is done, there is nothing more to wish. Sandaka, when the noble
disciple of the Teacher has attained to that noble distinction, he has
wisely lived the holy life and even while doing so is convinced of it as
merit.’

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">‘Good, Ananda, the bhikkhu,
perfect, destroyed desires, has done what should be done, put down the
weight, has come to the highest good does he partake sensuality?’ ‘Sandaka,
the bhikkhu who is perfect, has destroyed desires, has done what should
be done, put down the weight, has come to the highest good, has destroyed
the desire ‘to be’, and is rightly knowing released, could not go beyond
five things. It is not possible that the bhikkhu who has destroyed desires,
with awareness, would destroy the life of living things, take what is not
given, indulge in sexuality and tell lies. He would not amass things for
sensual partaking as it was done when leading a household life. Sandaka,
the bhikkhu who is perfect, destroyed desires, has done what should be
done, put down the weight, has come to the highest good, would not do these
five things, it is impossible that he should do them.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

Ananda, to a bhikkhu perfect, has destroyed desires, has done what should
be done, put down the weight, come to the highest good, destroyed the desires
‘to be’ and is rightly knowing released, is knowledge and vision constantly
and continually established, as my desires are destroyed?’ ‘Sandaka, I
will give you a comparison, for some wise men understand when a comparison
is given. Sandaka, a man’s hands and feet are cut off. In whatever posture
he may be he would know my hands and feet are cut and reflecting would
know my hands and feet are cut. In like manner, the bhikkhu who is perfect,
has destroyed desires, has done what should be done, put down the weight,
has come to the highest good, has destroyed the desires ‘to be’ and is
rightly knowing released, would know constantly and continually my desires
are destroyed.’

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Good
Gotama, about how many are led across in this Dispensation?’ ‘Sandaka,
not one, not even one hundred, not two hundred, not three hundred, not
four hundred, not five hundred yet many more are led across in this dispensation.’
‘Wonderful and surprising good Ananda, there was no praising of one’s own
teaching nor disparaging another’s teaching, yet many are led across. As
for these ascetics, they are the sons of dead women. They praise themselves,
disparage others, and show only three as led across. They are Nanda Vaccha,
Sankicca and Makkhali Gosala.’

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

the wandering ascetic Sandaka addressed his own gathering: ‘Good sirs,
lead the holy life in the dispensation of the recluse Gotama. Give up gain
honour and fame.’Thus the wandering ascetic Sandaka aroused interest in
his gathering to lead the holy life in the dispensation of the Blessed
One.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>
