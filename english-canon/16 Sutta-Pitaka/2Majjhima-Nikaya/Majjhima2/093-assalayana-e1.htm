<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>I heard thus.At
one time the Blessed One was abiding in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika
in<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi. At
that time about five hundred Brahmins of various states had come to Saavatthi
for some business and were living in Saavatthi. It occurred to those Brahmins.
This recluse Gotama declares the purity of the four castes. Who is able
to dispute with the recluse Gotama on these words? At that time a young
man named Assalaayana lived in Saavatthi. He was young, shaven headed,
sixteen years of age, had learned the three Vedas, knew, the rites and
rituals as officiating priest, the phonology and etymology of words and
the marks of a Great Man. Then it occurred to those Brahmins. This young
man Assalaayana lives in Saavatthi, is young, shaven headed, sixteen years
of age, is learned in the three Vedas, knows the rites and rituals as officiating
priest. He knows the phonology and etymology of words and the marks of
a Great Man. It is possible for him to dispute with the recluse Gotama,
on these words. Then those Brahmins approached the young man Assalaayana
and said. ‘Good Assalaayana, the recluse Gotama declares the purity of
the four castes. Come, good Assalaayana, dispute with the recluse Gotama
on these words. Then the young man Assalaayana said thus to those Brahmins.
‘The recluse Gotama speaks the truth, it is difficult to dispute with those
speaking the truth. It is not possible that I could dispute this with him.’
For the second time the Brahmins entreated the young man Assalaayana, saying
he was a wandering ascetic. He refused. For the third time the Brahmins
entreated and the young man Assalaayana, saying he should not accept uncontested
defeat.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>When this was
said, the young man Assalaayana said. ’Indeed I will not win, the good
recluse Gotama, tells the truth, it is difficult to dispute with those
speaking the truth. It is not possible that I could dispute this with him.
Yet I will go to satisfy you good ones.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then the young
man Assalaayana, together with a large gathering of Brahmins approached
the Blessed One, exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side. He said
to the Blessed One.’Good Gotama, Brahmins say, Brahmins are from the highest
caste, the others are low. Brahmins are pure, the others impure. Brahmins
become pure, the others do not. Brahmins are the legitimate sons of Brahmaa,
born of his mouth, born of him, with his sign and heritage. What has good
Gotama to say about this?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Assalaayana,
among Brahmins I see a woman menstruating, bearing a womb, giving birth
and giving suck. Born from a womb, do they say, Brahmins are from the highest
caste, the others are low. Brahmins are pure, the others impure. Brahmins
become pure, the others do not. Brahmins are the legitimate sons of Brahmaa,
born of his mouth, born of him, with his sign and heritage?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Assalaayana,
have you heard of Greece, Cambodiya, and certain other bordering states.<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>They
have only two castes, masters and slaves. One becomes a master and then
a slave, and a slave becomes a master?’

death would be born in decrease in hell and not a Brahmin?’

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

this was said the young man Assalaayana, became silent, confused, the body<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>drooping,

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

the Blessed One knew that the young man Assalaayana had become silent with
confusion, body drooping, and the face down, told him thus. ’Assalaayana,
in the past seven Brahmin sages lived in the forest in huts made of leaves.
When they were conversing this evil view arose to them. Brahmins are of
high caste, all other castes are low..Brahmins are pure, the others impure.
Brahmins become pure, the others do not. Brahmins are the legitimate sons
of Brahmaa, born of his mouth, born of him, with his sign and heritage.
Then the heavenly sage Asita, shaved his head and beard, robed himself
in brown clothes, dressed in a hardy pair of sandles, taking a golden pole,
appeared in front of the huts of leaves. There, walking up and down, said.
‘Where have these Brahmin sages gone? Where have these Brahmin sages gone?’
Then it occurred to the Brahmin sages. ‘Why is it said, where have these
brahmin sages gone?’ when the seven Brahmin sages are walking mindfully
like bulls tied to a threshing pole. They thought we will curse him and
cursed ‘Outcaste, go to ashes’ When the sages cursed him, the heavenly
sage Asita became more and more attractive and pleasant to look at. Then
it occurred to the seven Brahmin sages, our austerities are useless, our
holy life is fruitless. Earlier when we cursed, ‘Outcaste, go to ashes’
at once it became ashes, here he becomes more and more attractive and pleasant
to look at.</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

the austerities of the good sirs is not delusion and if the holy life is
not fruitless, sirs dispel the curse put on me. If there is a curse on
you I will dispel that.’</span>

is this good One?’</span>
