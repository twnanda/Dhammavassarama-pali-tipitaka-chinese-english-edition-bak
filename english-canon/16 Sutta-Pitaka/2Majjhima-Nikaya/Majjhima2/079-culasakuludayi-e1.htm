<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU>I heard thus.At one time the Blessed
One was living in the squirrel’s sanctuary in the bamboo grove. At that
time the wandering ascetic Sakuludaayi was living in the monastey of the
wandering ascetics in the Mora sanctuary with a large gathering of wandering
ascetics. Then the Blessed One putting on robes in the morning taking bowl
and robes entered Rajagaha for alms. Then it occurred to the Blessed One,
it is too early to go for alms in Rajagaha, what if I approach the monastery
of the wandering ascetics and approach the wandering ascetic Sakuludaayi.
Then the Blessed One approached the wandering ascetics’ monastery in the
Mora sanctuary. At that time, the wandering ascetic Sakuludaayi was seated
with a large gathering of wandering ascetics making much noise engaged
in various kinds of childish talk, about kings, robbers, chief ministers,
the army, fears, fights, eatables, drinks, dress, beds, flowers, scents,
relations, conveyances, villages, hamlets, towns, states, women, heros,
gossip at the corner of the street, at the well, about those dead and gone,
various other talk about the origin of the world and ocean, of things that
happened and did not happen.<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>The
wandering ascetic Sakuludaayi saw the Blessed One coming in the distance
and silenced the gathering. ‘Good sirs, make less noise, do not make such
a noise. The recluse Gotama is coming. These venerable ones make little
noise, and thinking this gathering makes little noise may have thought
to approach.’ Then those wandering ascetics became silent.&nbsp;</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then
the Blessed One approached the wandering ascetic Sakuludaayi, and the wandering
ascetic Sakuludaayi said to the Blessed One ‘Good Gotama, come! It is after
a long time that good Gotama thought of coming. Sit good Gotama, the seat
is ready.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>The
Blessed One, sat on the prepared seat, and the wandering ascetic too sat
on a side taking a low seat. The Blessed One, said. ‘With what talk were
you seated here and what was the topic of conversation?’<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span></span><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, let that topic be.with which we were seated now, a talk from the Blessed
One is rare and this talk could be heard afterwards. Venerable sir, when
I do not attend to this gathering, they engage in various childish talk.
When I approach them they sit looking at my mouth, to hear what I have
to say. Whatever the recluse Udayi says, we will listen to that. When the
Blessed One approached, I and this gathering look at the Blessed One’s
mouth, whatever the Blessed One says, we will listen to that.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>‘Then
Udayi, tell me what I have to teach you’.</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, a long time ago, this happened. I asked a question about the very
beginning, from a recluse, of those acknowledging, knowledge and vision
constantly and continually established in them, while walking, standing,
lying or when awake. I asked a question about the beginning. When I asked
the question, he asked me another question changed the topic and showed
anger, aversion and displeasure. Venerable sir, then it occurred to me
it is from the Blessed One this question should be asked, it is he who
is clever in answering this question’.</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>‘Udaayi,
who is this recluse, that acknowledges knowledge and vision constantly
and continually established, while walking, standing, lying or when awake?
When asked a question about the beginning, asked another question, changed
the topic and showed anger, aversion and displeasure?’&nbsp;</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, it’s Niganthanaataputta.’.</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Udayi,
it’s from me, who recollect, one birth, two births, --- recollect the manifold
previous births with all modes and details, that this question about the
beginning should have been asked. I could have convinced your mind answering
a question about the beginning. Udayi, with the purified heavenly eye beyond
human, I see beings disappearing and appearing in unexalted and exalted
states, beautiful and ugly, in good and bad states--- I know beings according
to their actions. The question about the beginning should have been asked
from me. I could have convinced your mind answering that question. Yet
Udayi, let alone the beginning and let alone the end, I will teach you,
when this is, this comes to be: when this, arise this arises. When this
is not present, this is not, and when this cease, this ceases.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, I do not understand even my own self, it is not possible for me to
recollect the manifold previous births with all modes and details, such
as one birth, two births, ----with all modes and details, as the Blessed
One does. Venerable sir, now I do not even see a mud sprite, how could
I see with a purified heavenly eye beyond human, beings disappearing and
appearing in unexalted and exalted states--- and know beings according
to their actions, as the Blessed One knows. Yet the Blessed One said let
alone the beginning and let alone the end, I will give the Teaching – When
this is, this comes to be, when this arise, this arises. When this is not
present, this is not, and when this, cease this ceases. It is for my great
pleasure, yet I do not understand.it. Venerable sir, could my teacher be
convinced, answering his question?.<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

what is your teacher’s view?’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, my teacher’s view is, this is the most excellent appearance’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>.‘Udayi,
your teacher’s view, this is the most excellent appearance, how is that
most excellent appearance?’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, there is no other appearance more noble and exalted than this most
excellent appearance.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Udayi,
how is this appearance, which has no other appearance more noble and exalted
than that?’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

sir, when there is no other appearance more noble and exalted than that,
that is the most excellent appearance.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Udayi,
does it extend lengthwise?’&nbsp;</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, as there is no other appearance more noble and exalted than that,
it is said to be the highest appearance, and it cannot be pointed out.’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>‘Udayi,
it is something, like this..There is a man who says, I desire and love
the most beautiful woman in this state: Then he is asked. Good man, the
most beautiful woman you desire, is she of warrior clan, brahmin clan,
householder clan or from an out caste clan? When asked, he would say No.
Then he is asked. Good man, the most beautiful woman you desire and love,
do you know, of what clan she is? Do you know whether she is tall, short
or medium? Do you know whether she is dark, fair or brown? Do you know
in which village, hamlet or town she lives? When asked he says, No. Then
he is told, good man, do you desire and love someone whom you do not know
and have not seen? Then he would say. Yes. What do you think Udayi. Doesn’t
this talk turn out to be stupid talk?’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, when that is so, that man’s talk turns out to be stupid talk</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>In
the same manner Udayi, you say, venerable sir, when there is no other appearance
more noble and exalted than that, that is the most excellent appearance,
and that appearance you do not point out.’&nbsp;</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, it is like a lepis gem of good birth, with eight facets, well completed
and when placed in the orange coloured blanket, shines, emits heat and
illuminates. The self would be of that appearance, healthy after, death.’.&nbsp;</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Udayi,
what do you think, of these two, the lapis gem of good birth, with eight
facets, well completed and placed in the orange coloured blanket, and the
worms and fire flies in the darkness of the night, which give the more
excellent appearance in shining, emitting heat and illuminating?’.</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

sir, of these two appearances the more excellent appearance would be the
worms and fire flies, for the darkness of the night.’.</span>

the excellence of many of these gods surpasses the excellence of the moon

which is inferior even to the appearance of the worms and fire flies, is
the most noble and excellent appearance. That too you would not point out.’&nbsp;</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span

Udayi, it is not for the realisation of this world of only pleasantness,
that the bhikkhus lead the holy life in my dispensation. There is something
more noble and excellent than this to realise on account of which bhikkhus
lead the holy life in my dispensation.’<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span

sir, what is that thing more noble and excellent than this on account of
which the bhikkhus lead the holy life in the dispensation of the Blessed
One.’<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

Udayi, the Thus Gone One is born in the world, perfect, rightfully enlightened,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>with
knowledge and conduct, well gone, knowing the worlds the incomparable tamer
of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed.
He proclaims to this world of gods and men, together with its Maras, Brahmas,
the community of recluses, brahmins, gods and men, that Teaching good at
the beginning, good in the middle and good in the end, full of meaning
even in the letters declaring the complete and pure holy life.----re---
He having dispelled the five hindrances and making less the finer defilements
of the mind secludes the mind from sensual desires and thoughts of demerit---
attains to the first jhana. Udayi, this is something noble and excellent
than the earlier on account of which the bhikkhus lead the holy life in
my dispensation. Again, overcoming thoughts and thought processes and the
mind in one point internally appeased ---abides in the second jhana---<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>abides
in the third jhana—abides in the fourth jhana Udayi, this too is something
more noble and excellent than the earlier on account of which the bhikkhus
lead the holy life in my dispensation... When the mind is concentrated,
pure, free from minor defilements, is malleable workable not disturbed,
he directs the mind for the knowledge of previous births.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Recollects
the manifold previous births, one birth, two births, three, four, five,
ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred births, a thousand births,
a hundred thousand births, innumerable forward cycles of births, innumerable
backward cycles of births, innumerable forward and backward cycles of births.
There I was of such name, clan, disposition, supports, feeling the pleasant
and unpleasant feelings, in such a life span. Disappearing from there was
born there with such name, clan, disposition, supports, feeling the pleasant
and unpleasant feelings, in such a life span, disappearing from there,
is born here. Thus with all modes and all details manifold previous births
are recollected. Udayi, this too is more noble and excellent than that
on accout of which the bhikkhus lead the holy life in my dispensation.
When the mind is concentrated, pure, free from minor defilements malleable
workable not disturbed, he directs the mind for knowledge of the disappearing
and appearing of beings. With the purified heavenly eye beyond human, he
sees beings disappearing and appearing unexalted and exalted, beautiful
and ugly, arising in good and bad states according to their actions. These
good beings misbehaving by body, speech and mind, blaming noble ones, with
the wrong view of actions, after death are born in loss, in decrease, in
hell. As for these good beings, well behaved in body speech and mind, not
blaming noble ones, with the right view of actions after death are born
in heaven. Thus with the heavenly eye purified beyond human he sees beings
disappearing and appearing. . Udayi, this too is more noble and excellent
than that on accout of which the bhikkhus lead the holy life in my dispensation..When
the mind is concentrated, pure, free from minor defilements, is malleable
workable not disturbed, he directs the mind for the destruction of desires.
Knows, this is unpleasant, this is the arising of unpleasantness, this
is the cessation of unpleasantness, and this is the path to the cessation
of unpleasantness as it really is. Knows these are desires, this is the
arising of desires, this is the cessation of desires and this is the path
to the cessation of desires as it really is. The mind, which knows and
sees thus, is released from sensual desires, is releasd from desires ‘to
be’ and released from ignorant desires. When released, he knows, I’m released,
birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived, what should be done is done,
he knows, there is nothing more to wish. Udayi, this too is a thing more
noble and excellent than the other on account of which the bhikkhus lead
the holy life in my Dispensation.’.</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>When
this was said, the wandering ascetic Sakuludaayi said to the Blessed One.
Venerable sir, now I understand. It is as though something over turned
is reinstalled. Something covered is made manifest. As though the path
was told to someone who has lost his way. As though an oil lamp is lighted
for the darkness, so that those who have sight could see forms. In various
ways the Teaching is explained by the Blessed One. Now I take refuge in
the Blessed One, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. May I gain
the going forth and the higher ordination.’&nbsp;</span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>When this was
said the wandering ascetic Sakuludayi’s following said. ‘Good Udaayi do
not lead the holy life in the dispensation of the recluse Gotama. Good
Udaayi, you are a teacher, do not become a pupil. It’s like being a cladron
and then becoming a spoon in it. So good Udayi do not lead the holy life
in the dispensation of the recluse Gotama.’ Thus the wandering ascetic
Sakuludayi’s following prevented him from leading the holy life in the
dispensation of the Blessed One.<span
