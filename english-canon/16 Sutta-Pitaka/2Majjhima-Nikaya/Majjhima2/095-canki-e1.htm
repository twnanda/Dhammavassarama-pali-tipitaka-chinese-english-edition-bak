<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU>I heard thus.At one time the Blessed
One touring Kosala, with a large community of bhikkhus, came to the Brahmin
village Opasaada. The Blessed One abode in the sporting Saala forest to
the north of Opasaada. At that time the Brahmin Cankii lived in Opasaada,
endowed with seven marks of a Great Man. He was supplied grass, firewood,
water and grains, by king Pasenadi of Kosala as royal gifts. The Brahmin
householders of Opasaada heard. The good recluse Gotama, gone forth homeless,
from the clan of the Sakyas is touring the Kosala country with a large
community of bhikkhus, has arrived in Opasaada. This fame has spread of
that good Gotama. He is blessed, perfect and rightfully enlightened, endowed
with knowledge and conduct, gone well, knows the worlds, is the incomparable
tamer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed.
He teaches this world of gods and men, together with its Maaras Brahmaas,
recluses and Brahmins, a Teaching, by himself known and realized. That
Teaching is good at the beginning, in the middle and in the end, with meanings
even in the letters. That Teaching proclaims the complete and pure holy
life. It is good to see such perfect ones.</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>The
Brahmin householders, left Opasaada, and gathering and increasing in numbers
went towards the sporting Saala forest to the north of Opasaada. At this
time the Brahmin Cankii, was sleeping in the day, in his chamber, on the
upper storey of his house. Then he saw the Brahmin householders of Opasaada
going north towards the sporting Saala forest, in large numbers. He addressed
his servant. ‘Friend, why are the Brahmin householders of Opasaada going
north towards the sporting Saala forest?’<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>‘Good
sir Cankii, the recluse Gotama, gone forth homeless, from the clan of the
Sakyas is touring the Kosala country with a large community of bhikkhus,
has arrived in Opasaada. This fame has spread of that good Gotama. He is
blessed, perfect and rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and
conduct, gone well, knows the worlds, is the incomparable tamer of those
to be tamed, is teacher of gods and men,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>enlightened
and blessed. He teaches this world of gods and men, together with its Maaras

That Teaching is good at the beginning, in the middle and in the end, with
meanings even in the letters. That Teaching proclaims the complete and
pure holy life. It is good to see such perfect ones.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>‘Then
friend, approach those Brahmin householders of Opasaada and tell. The Brahmin
Cankii says, good sirs go, the Brahmin Cankii too will approach to see
the Blessed One’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>The
servant agreed, approached those Brahmin householders of Opasaada and said.’The
good Brahmin Cankii says, good sirs go. Brahmin Cankii too will approach
to see the Blessed One.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>At
that time about five hundred Brahmins from various states were residing
in Opasaada come there for some purpose. They heard, that the Brahmin Cankii
was going to see the recluse Gotama and approached the Brahmin Cankii.
They asked. ‘Is it true that good Canakii is going to see the recluse Gotama?’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>‘Yes,
good ones, I too will approach to see the recluse Gotama.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>‘It
is not suitable that good Canakii should approach to see the recluse Gotama,
it is suitable that the recluse Gotama should approach to see good Cankii.
Good Cankii is pure of birth on both the mother’s and the father’s side.
The purity, is without blame about birth, as far back as the seventh fore
father. Therefore it is not suitable that good Cankii should approach the
recluse Gotama, but the recluse Gotama should approach good Cankii. Good
Cankii has great wealth, is learned in the three Vedas, and the rites and
rituals as officiating priest. Knows the phonology and etymology of words.
Is learned in the marks of a Great Man. Good Cankii is pleasant to look
at, has a beautiful skin complexion, talks politely, has nothing inferior
in his appearance. Good Cankii is virtuous and well developed in them.
Speaks politely, distinctly, words full of meaning. Good Cankii is a teacher
of many, teaches three hundred young men orally. King Pasenadi of Kosala
reveres good Cankii. The Brahmin Pokkarasaati reveres good Cankii. The
Brahmin Cankii lives in Opasaada, endowed with seven marks of a Great Man.
He is supplied grass, firewood, water and grains, by king Pasenadi of Kosala
as royal gifts. Therefore it is not suitable that good Canakii should approach
to see the Blessed One, it is suitable that the recluse Gotama should approach
to see good Cankii.</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>‘Then
good sirs, listen to what I have to say about good Gotama, why I should
approach the recluse Gotama and not that the recluse Gotama should approach
me. The good recluse Gotama, is pure of birth on both the mother’s and
the father’s side. The purity, is without blame about birth, as far back
as the seventh fore father. Therefore it is not suitable that the good
recluse Gotama should approach me, but I should approach the good recluse
Gotama. The recluse Gotama gave up much sterling gold, treasures hidden
and open and went forth homeless. When young, even in the prime of youth,
with dark black hair, when his mother and father were crying with tearing
eyes, he shaved head and beard and went forth. The recluse Gotama is pleasant
to look at, has a beautiful skin complexion, talks politely, there is nothing
inferior in his appearance. The good recluse Gotama, is endowed with the
noble one’s virtues, speaks politely, distinctly wise words full of meaning.
The recluse Gotama is the teacher of, the teachers of many. He has destroyed
greed for sensuality and is firm in his decision. The recluse Gotama tells
of the results of actions, and is honoured, for not doing evil by the wise.
The good recluse Gotama went forth from an honoured, wealthy clan with
many resources. Many come from external countries and states to get questions
answered by the good recluse Gotama. Thousands of deities have taken refuge
in good Gotama until the end of their lives. This fame has spread about
good Gotama. That Blessed One is perfect, rightfully enlightened, endowed
with knowledge and conduct, gone well, the incomparable tamer of those
to be tamed, is teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed. The recluse
Gotama is complete with the two and thirty marks of a Great Man. The king
of Magadha<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Seniya Bimbisara<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>together
with his wife and children has taken refuge in the good recluse Gotama
until life lasts. King Pasenadi of Kosala together with his wife and children
has taken refuge in the good recluse Gotama. The Brahmin Pokkarasaati together
with his wife and children has taken refuge in the good recluse Gotama.
The recluse Gotama has arrived in Opasaada and abides in the sporting Saala
forest in the north of Opasaada. Whoever comes to our villages and fields
are our guests. We should look after our guests<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>revere
and honour them. On account of these things it is not suitable that the
recluse Gotama should approach to see me and it is suitable I should approach
the recluse Gotama. These are not all the good qualities of good Gotama,
there is much more untold. Taking into account even one of these, it is
not proper that the recluse Gotama should approach me, but I should approach
the recluse Gotama. Therefore let us all approach the recluse Gotama.</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>The
Brahmin Cankii, with a large gathering of Brahmins approached the Blessed
One, exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side. At that time some
elderly Brahmins were exchanging friendly greetings with the Blessed One.
A young man named Kaapa.thika, about sixteen years of age, with shaven
head, learned in the three Vedas was seated in that gathering. He had learned
the phonology and etymology of words, was learned in the marks of a Great
Man. He interrupted the Blessed One when exchanging friendly greetings
with the elderly Brahmins. The Blessed One said. ’Venerable Bhaaravdaaja
do not interrupt when we are talking with the elderly Brahmins. When this
conversation comes to an end. You should talk,’ The Brahmin Cankii said.
‘Good Gotama do not blame the young man Kaapa.thika. He speaks well, is
wise and young and he could dispute with good Gotama on these words.’ Then
it occurred to the Blessed One. Indeed, there will be a discussion with
the young man Kaapa.thika on the three Vedas, that he is honoured so much
by the Brahmins.’ It occurred to the young man Kaapa.thika, when the recluse
Gotama’s eyes meet with mine, I will, ask my question. The Blessed One
knowing the thought and thought processes of the young man directed his
eyes to Kaapa.thika. It occurred to young Kaapa.thika, my eyes have met
with those of the recluse Gotama, what if I ask the question. He said.
‘Good Gotama, the Brahmins believe the ancient sayings handed down through
hearsay and by authority is the truth, all else is not the truth. What
has good Gotama to say about it?’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

a single Brahmin, among the Brahmins did not say. I know this. I see this.
This, is the truth, all else is false. A single teacher, or a teacher’s

This, only is the truth, all else is false. A single sage of the Brahmins,

all else is false. Bharadvaaja, it is like a line of blind men holding
hands. The first does not see, the middle one does not see and the last
one does not see. When this is so, the words of the Brahmins are similar
to the words of a line of blind men. Bharadvaaja, isn’t this faith not
well established?<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

Gotama, the Brahmins associate it, on not only faith but, also hearsay.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

earlier your dispute was on faith, now it is on hearsay. These five things
have twofold results here and now. What are the five? They are faith, liking,
hearsay, careful thinking and forbearance with view. These five things
are with twofold results here and now. Bharadvaaja, there is good faith,
it becomes useless, not true, changes. Again there is much liking, it becomes
useless, not true, changes. There is hearsay, which becomes useless, not
true, changes. There is very careful thinking too, which becomes useless,
not true, changes. Also there is forbearance with view, which becomes useless,
not true, changes. It is not suitable for a wise man who protects the truth
to take a one sided view and say, this only is the truth, all else is not
the truth.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

When examining the meanings, he speculates patiently and an interest is

1 Weighing is of much help for the fourfold endeavour. ’padhaanassa kho
bharadvaaja tulanaa bahukaaraa’ The fourfold endeavours are pushing the
mind forward earnestly, to dispel arisen demerit to promote non arising
of not arisen demerit To promote the arising of not arisen merit and to
see the development and completion of arisen merit. For this kind of mental
work to happen, we should mentally weigh our activities by body speech
and mind. We should be aware of the activities at the six doors of mental
contact.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU style='font-size:10.0pt'>2. Struggling
is of much help for weighing. ‘Tulanaaya kho bharadvaaja ussaaho bahukaaro
hoti’ This is a mental struggle. It consists of thinking and pondering
to sort out the correct and comes to be right thinking.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText2">3.Right speculation is of much help for interest.’Chandassa
kho Bharadvaaja dhammanijjhaanakhanti bahukaaraa’. Right speculation falls
to the category of right thinking. So this is falling to the Noble Eightfold
path, with right view at the foremost.<span
