<p class="MsoBodyText">I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One lived on
vultures’ peak where pigs were molested, in Rajagaha. Then the wandering
ascetic Dighanakha approached the Blessed One, exchanged friendly greetings,
stood on a side, and said to the Blessed One: ‘Good Gotama, I’m of this
view, and declare Everything is not pleasing.to me’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Aggivessana,
according to this view of yours, everything is not pleasing to me. Is that
view pleasing to you?’ ‘Good Gotama, that view pleases me and such others
like them.’ ‘Aggivessana, there are very many in the world, who have this
view, that too is like that and that too is like that. They do not give
up that view, but take up another view. Aggivessana, only a few in this
world say, that too is like that and that too is like that, and they give
up that view and do not uphold another view’.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Aggivessana,
there are recluses and brahmins, in this world, who uphold this view and
declare it. Every thing is pleasing to me Aggivessana, there are recluses
and brahmins in this world, who uphold this view and declare it. Every
thing is not pleasing to me. Aggivessana, there are recluses and brahmins,
in this world, who uphold this view and declare it. Some things are pleasing
to me and other things are not pleasing to me. Aggivessana the view of
those recluses and brahmins, every thing is pleasing to me, is close upon
greed, is yoked to interest, appropriating and seizing. Aggivessana the
view of those recluses and brahmins, every thing is not pleasing to me,
is away from greed, not yoked to interest, appropriating and seizing’.
When this was said, the wandering ascetic Dighanakha said thus to the Blessed
One.’ Does good Gotama, praise my view.’ ‘Aggivessana, the view of those
recluses and brahmins, some things are pleasing to me and other things
are not pleasing. Pleasing things, are close upon greed, yoked to interest,
appropriating and seizing. The things not pleasing, are away from greed,
unyoked from interest, appropriating and seizing..

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Aggivessana,
a wise man reflects, if I held this view, every thing is pleasing to me,
this only is the truth all else is false, stubbornly and did not give it
up easily. I have to worry on account of two things. About the recluses
and brahmins of this view, every thing is not pleasing to me and the recluses
and brahmins of this view, some things are pleasing to me and some other
things are not pleasing to me. On account of these two views, there is
a split. On account of a split, a dispute, and trouble. Then seeing that
his view has split, and there is a dispute and trouble, he gives up that
view and does not uphold another view. This is the giving up of such views.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Aggivessana,
this material body of the four primary elements, brought forth by mother
and father and supported on rice and bread, is subject to change through
brushing and breaking. It should be reflected, as impermanent, unpleasaant,
an illness, an abscess, an arrow, a troublesome thing, as foreign and as
breaking apart, as void, and as not mine. When he sees this body as impermanent,
unpleasaant, an illness, an abscess, an arrow, as a troublesome thing,
as foreign and as breaking apart, as void, and as not mine, the interest
for the body, the love for it and following the needs of the body, fade.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Aggivessana,
these three are the feelings, pleasant, unpleasant and neither unpleasant
nor pleasaant. Aggivessana, when a pleasant feeling is felt, at such time
an unpleasant feeling or a neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings is
not felt. Only the pleasant feeling is felt. Aggivessana, when an unpleasant
feeling is felt, at such times a pleasant feeling or a neither unpleasant
nor pleasant feelings is not felt. Only the unpleasant feeling is felt.
. Aggivessana, when a neither unpleasant nor pleasant feeling is felt,
at such time a pleasant feeling or an unpleasant feelings is not felt.
Only the neither unpleasant nor pleasant feeling is felt. Aggivessana,
even the pleasant feelings are impermanent, compounded, dependently arisen.
They get destroyed, fade, get detached and cease. Aggivessana, even the
unpleasant feelings are impermanent, compounded and dependently arisen.
They get destroyed, fade, get detached and cease. Aggivessana, even the
neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings are impermanent, compounded and
dependently arisen. They get destroyed, fade,<span 

style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>get
detached and cease. When the noble disciple sees this, his mind breaks
away from pleasant feelings, unpleasant feelings and even from neither
unpleasant- nor<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>pleasant feelings.
When the mind breaks away, it gets detached, when detached it is released.
When released knowledge arises I’m released. Birth is destroyed, the holy
life is lived. What should be done is done. He knows there is nothing more
to wish. Aggivessana, the so released mind does not disagree with anyone
has no dispute with any one, abides with the truth vogue in the world without
a dispute. At that time venerable Sariputta was fanning the Blessed One,
standing beside him, and it occurred to venerable Sariputta. This is the
reason, that the Blessed One asked us constantly, to dispel thoughts. When
venerable Sariputta reflected on this, his mind was released from desires,
without holdings. To the wandering ascetic Dighanakha the stainless, pure
vision arose. Whatever arises, all that ceases.*1) Then the wandering ascetic
Dighanakha here and now, mastered the Teaching, experienced it and penetrated
it, without doubts became confident of things that should be done and should
not be done and did not need a teacher in the dispensation any more. Then
he said. I understand good Gotama. It is like something over turned is
reinstalled. Something covered is made manifest. As though the path is
told to one who had lost his way. As though an oil lamp was lighted for
those who have sight to see forms in the dark. In various ways, good Gotama
explained it. Now I take refuge in good Gotama, in the Teaching and the
Community of bhikkhus. May I be remembered as a lay disciple from today
until life lasts.<span

1. Whatever arises, all that ceases.’ya.m kinci samudayadhamma.m sabba.m
tam nirodhadhamma.m ti.’ This is the core of the Teaching, and it is this
realization, that happens, when he enters the stream of the Teaching.<o:p></o:p></span>
