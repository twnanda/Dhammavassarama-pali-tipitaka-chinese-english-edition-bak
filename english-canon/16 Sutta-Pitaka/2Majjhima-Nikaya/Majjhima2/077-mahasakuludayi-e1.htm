<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

heard thus.At one time the Blessed One was living in the squirrels’ sanctuary
in the bamboo grove in Rajagaha. At that time many well-known wandering
ascetics lived in the wandering ascetics’ monastery in the santuary of
Mora trees. Such as Anugaro Varadhara, Sakuludayi and other well known
wandering ascetics. Then the Blessed One putting on robes in the morning
and taking bowl and robes entered Rajagaha for alms. Then it occurred to
the Blessed One, it’s too early to go for alms in Rajagaha, what if I approached
the wandering ascetic Sakuludayi in the sanctuary of Mora trees. The Blessed
One approached the monastery of the wandering asetics and approached the
wandering ascetic Sakuludayi. At that time, the wandering ascetic Sakuludayi
was seated with a large gathering of wandering ascetics making much noise.
They were engaged in various kinds of childish talk, about kings, robbers,
chief ministers, the army, fears, fights, eatables and drinks, dress, beds,
flowers and scents, relations, conveyances, villages, hamlets, towns and
states, women and heros. About gossip at the corner of the street and at
the well Talk about those dead and gone, various other talk about the origin
of the world and the ocean and of things that did and not happen. The wandering
ascetic Sakuludayi seeing the Blessed One, coming in the distance silenced
the gathering: ‘Good sirs, make less noise, do not make such a noise. The
recluse Gotama is coming. These venerable ones make little noise, and thinking
this gathering makes little noise may have thought to approach’. The wandering
ascetics became silent. Then the Blessed One approached the wandering ascetic
Sakuludayi, and the wandering ascetic Sakuludayi said to the Blessed One:
‘Good Gotama, come! It is after a long time that good Gotama thought of
coming. Sit good Gotama, the seat is ready.’ The Blessed One sat on the
prepared seat, and the wanderig ascetic too sat on a side taking a low
seat. Then the Blessed One, said. ‘With what talk were you seated here
and what was the topic of conversation?’’Let that be venerable sir, the
talk we were sitting with, now. A talk from the Blessed One is rare and
this talk could be heard later. A long time ago, in the past, when recluses
and brahmins were assembled in the assembly hall this talk arose. It is
great gain for Anga and Magadha that many recluses and brahmins, leaders
of gatherings famous ford makers, considered good by many, come to Rajagaha
for the rains with their followers. They are Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosaala,
Ajita Kesakambali, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sanjaya Belatthiputta and Nigantha
Nataputta.and also the recluse Gotama..How do the disciples revere and
honour the Teacher and abide?’. Then a certain one said: ‘This Purana Kassapa
leader and teacher of a gathering, considered a famous ford maker by many,
is not honoured and revered by his disciples and Purana Kassapa does not
give due honour to his disciples. Once Purana Kassapa was teaching a gathering
of hundreds. Then one of the disciples of Purana Kassapa made an exclamation.
Good sirs, do not ask the meaning of this from Purana Kassapa, he does
not know it: I know its meaning, ask the question from me, I will explain
it to the good sirs. It happened that Purana Kassapa beat his breast and
shouted entreating the gathering to be silent. These good sirs do not ask
the question from him, they ask it from me. I will explain it. Many of
his disciples arouse quarrels and go away from him: You do not know this
discipline. I know it. What do you know of this discipline? Your path is
wrong. I talk with reasons and you talk without. You tell the last words
first, and the words that should be told first last. You have thought it
out, reversed it, and aroused a dispute, stop it! If possible dispute it
out and be released. Thus Purana Kassapa is not honoured, and revered by
his disciples and Purana Kassapa does not give due recognition to his disciples,
and Purana Kassapa is reviled by his own Teaching.’ ‘Then a certain one
said, Makkhali Gosala too,--Ajita Kesakambali too,---Pakudha Kaccayana<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>too
---Sanjaya Belatthiputta too---Nigantha Nataputta, leader and teacher of
a gathering, considered a famous ford maker by many, is not honoured and
revered by his disciples and Nigantha Nataputta does not give due honour
to his disciples. Once Nigantha Nataputta was teaching a gathering of hundreds.
Then one of the disciples of Nigantha Nataputta made an exclamation. Good
sirs, do not ask the meaning of this from Nigantha Nataputta, he does not
know it: I know its meaning, ask the question from me, I will explain it
to the good sirs. It happened that Nigantha Nataputta beat his breast and
shouted entreating the gathering to be silent. These good sirs do not ask
the question from him, they ask it from me. I will explain it. Many of
his disciples arouse quarrels and go away from him. You, do not know the
Discipline and the teaching. I know it. What do you know of this Discipline?
You have fallen to the wrong path. I talk with reasons and you talk without.
You tell the last words first, and the words that should be told first
last. You have thought it out, reversed it, and aroused a dispute, stop
it! If possible dispute it out and be released. Thus Nigantha Nataputta
is not honoured, and revered by his disciples and Nigantha Nataputta does
not give due recognition to his disciples, and Nigantha Nataputta is reviled
by his own Teaching.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>A
certain one said thus: ‘The recluse Gotama too is a leader and teacher
of a gathering, considered a famous ford maker by many, is honoured and
revered by his disciples and the recluse Gotama gives due honour to his
disciples, and they abide supported on him. Once the recluse Gotama was
teaching a gathering of hundreds. Then one of the disciples cleared his
throat, and a certain other co-associate in the holy life, nudged him with
his knee and said, venerable one do not make a noise. When the recluse
Gotama teaches a gathering of hundreds, there is not even the sound of
a sneeze or the sound of clearing the throat from the crowd. Then the gathering
waits expecting to hear the next words of the reculse Gotama, thinking
whatever the Blessed One says we will hear it. Like people waiting anxiously
at the cross roads, until a small honey comb, is covered up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>In
that manner, when the recluse Gotama teaches a gathering of hundreds, there
is not even the sound of a sneeze or the sound of clearing the throat from
the crowd. The gathering waits expecting to hear the next words of the
reculse Gotama, thinking whatever the Blessed One says we will hear it.
Even those disciples of the recluse Gotama, who were unable to yoke themselves
to the training and gave up robes, praise the Teacher, the Teaching and
the Community of bhikkhus. They blame themselves and not any one else.
I’m the unlucky one without merit, gone forth in this well preached Teaching
could not lead the pure and complete holy life, until the end of life.
They either live in a monastery or observe the five precepts and live as
lay disciples. Thus the recluse Gotama is revered and honoured by the disciples
and the recluse Gotama gives the due honour and reverence to his disciples
and they abide supported on him.’&nbsp;</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Udayi,

if I am honoured and revered for satisfaction in whatever gain of dwellings

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Udayi, if I’m honoured
and revered for seclusion and for praising it, you should revere and honour
my disciples.and receive the due honour for it. There are disciples of
mine who are forest dwellers, leaf huts dwellers, forest jungle dwellers
and jungle road dwellers. They do not stay, with the community of bhikkhus.
They come every fortinight to recite the higher code of rules. I on the
other hand abide surrounded by bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, lay, disciples, male

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

Udayi, my disciples do not honour and revere me and abide supported receiving
the due honour for it, on account of these five things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Udayi,
there are five other things, on account of which, my disciples honour and
revere me and abide supported receiving the due honour for it..What are
the five? Udayi, my disciples honour me for the highest mass of virtues.
The recluse Gotama is virtuous, endowed with the highest mass of virtues.
This is the first thing on account of which my disciples honour and revere
me.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Again
Udayi, my disciples honour me for the highest mass of knowledges and vision;
The recluse Gotama, knowing, says I know, seeing says, I see. Knowing the
recluse Gotama teaches, with examples and saying wonderful things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>This
is the second thing on account of which my disciples honour and revere
me..<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Again
Udayi, my disciples honour me for the higest mass of wisdom. The recluse
Gotama, is endowed with very high wisdom. There is no possibility that
he has not rcognised a single sign, on account of which a future false
teacher would arouse a dispute, and he has rightfully settled all disputes
that arise at present. Udayi, have you seen a disciple of mine interrupting
me in the middle of a talk?

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>‘No,
venerable sir, I have not.’

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">My disciples think, indeed,
it is on account me, that the disciples are advised, thus they honour me
with the highest mass of wisdom. This is the third thing on account of
which my disciples honour and revere me and abide supported receiving the
due honour for it. .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Again,
Udayi, when my disciples are afflicted and overcome with unpleasantness,
they approach me and ask about the noble truth of unpleasantness. Then
I explain it to them. I convince their minds explaining the noble truth
of unpleasantness. They ask about the noble truth of the arising of unpleasantness,
the noble truth of the cessation of unpleasantness, and the noble truth
of the path to the cessation of unpleasantness. I explain to them the path
to the cessation of unpleasantness and explaining it convince their minds
on it This is the fourth thing on account of which my disciples honour
and revere me and abide supported receiving the due honour for it. .

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Again,
Udayi, I have declared to my disciples the method for the fourfold establishment
of mindfulness. Here, the bhikkhu abides reflecting the body in the body,
mindful and aware for dispelling covetoussness and displeasure for the
world. Abides reflecting feelings in feelings, mindful and aware for dispelling
covetoussness and displeasure for the world. . Abides reflecting the mental
states in the mind, mindful and aware for dispelling covetoussness and
displeasure for the world. Abides reflecting thoughts in thoughts, mindful
and aware for dispelling covetoussness and displeasure for the world. Thus
too my disciples abide aiming perfect knowledge for emancipation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Again, Udayi, I have declared
to my disciples the method for developing the fourfold rightful endeavours.
My disciples fall to the method to develop the four rightful endeavours.
Here, Udayi, the bhikkhu makes endeavour, pulls up the mind, arouses interest
and effort for the non-arising of non-arisen demerit. The bhikkhu makes
endeavour, pulls up the mind, arouses interest and effort for the dispelling
of arisen demerit. The bhikkhu makes endeavour, pulls up the mind, arouses
interest and effort, for the arousing of non-arisen merit. The bhikkhu
makes endeavour, pulls up the mind, arouses interest and effort for the
unconfused stabilisation growth and development of arisen merit..Thus too
my disciples abide aiming perfect knowledge for emancipation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Again, Udayi, I have declared
to my disciples the method for developing the fourfold super normal powers.
The bhikkhu develops the supernormal power endowed with interest to concentrate
with endeavour and intentions. The bhikkhu develops the supernormal power
endowed with effort to concentrate with endeavour and intentions. The bhikkhu
develops the supernormal power endowed with mental concentration with endeavour
and intentions and the bhikkhu develops the supernormal power endowed with
investigating concentration, with endeavour and intentions. Thus too my
disciples abide aiming perfect knowledge for emancipation.<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Again,
Udayi, I have declared to my disciples the method for developing the fivefold
mental faculties. Udayi, the bhikkhu develops the mental faculty of faith
leading to appeasement and emancipiation. The bhikkhu develops the mental
faculty of effort leading to appeasement and emancipiation. The bhikkhu
develops the mental faculty of mindfulness, leading to appeasement and
emancipiation. The bhikkhu develops the mental faculty of concentration
leading to appeasement and emancipiation. The bhikkhu develops the mental
faculty of wisdom leading to appeasement and emancipiation. Thus too my
disciples abide aiming perfect knowledge for emancipation.<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Again,
Udayi, I have declared to my disciples the method for developing the fivefold
powers. The bhikkhu develops the power of faith leading to appeasement
and emancipiation. The bhikkhu develops the power of effort leading to
appeasement and emancipiation. The bhikkhu develops the power of mindfulness
leading to appeasement and emancipiation..The bhikkhu develops the power
of concentration leading to appeasement and emancipiation The bhikkhu develops
the power of wisdom leading to appeasement and emancipiation...Thus too
my disciples abide aiming perfect knowledge for emancipation.<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">. Again, Udaayi, I have
declared to my disciples the method for developing the seven enlightnment
factors. The bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor mindfulness settled
in seclusion, for detachment and cessation ending in relinquishment. The
bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor investigation into the Teaching
settled in seclusion, for detachment and cessation ending in relinquishment.
The bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor effort settled in seclusion,
for detachment and cessation ending in relinquishment. The bhikkhu develops
the enlightenment factor, joy settled in seclusion, for detachment and
cessation ending in relinquishment. The bhikkhu develops the enlightenment
factor, delight settled in seclusion, for detachment and cessation ending
in relinquishment. The bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor, concentration,
settled in seclusion, for detachment and cessation ending in relinquishment.
The bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor, equanimity settled in seclusion,
for detachment and cessation ending in relinquishment. Thus too my disciples
abide aiming perfect knowledge for emancipation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Again,
Udayi, I have declared to my disciples the method for developing the Noble
Eightfold path..Udayi, my disciples develop right understanding, right
thoughts, right words, right actions, right livelihood, right endeavour,
right mindfulness and right concentration. Thus too my disciples abide
aiming perfect knowledge for emancipation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Again,
Udayi, I have declared to my disciples the method for developing the eight
releases: Being matter, sees matter, this is the first release.* With internal
immaterial perception sees external matter, this is the second release.
Is released in only good, this is the third release. Overcoming all perceptions
of matter and perceptions of anger, not attending to various perceptions,
with space is boundless attains to the sphere of space. This is the fourth
release. Overcoming all the sphere of space, with consciousness is boundless,
attains to the sphere of consciousness, this is the fifth release. With
there is nothing, abides in the sphere of no-thingness. This is the sixth
release. Overcoming all the sphere of no-thingness abides in neither-perception-nor
–non-perception. This is the seventh release. Overcoming all the sphere
of neither-perception-nor-non-perception abides in the cessation of perceptions
and feelings. This is the eighth release. Thus too my disciples abide aiming
perfect knowledge for emancipation..<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Again, Udayi, I have declared
to my disciples the method for developing the eight masteries. A certain
one with internal material perceptions*1) sees limited external forms beautiful
and ugly. Mastering them says, I know and see. This is the first mastery.
A certain one with internal material perceptions sees unlimited external
forms beautiful and ugly. Mastering them says, I know and see. This is
the second mastery. A certain one with internal immaterial perceptions
sees limited external forms beautiful and ugly..Mastering them says, I

internal immaterial perceptions sees blue forms with the colour, hue and
lustre. The colour of blue lotuses, with hue and lustre beaten in, like
kashmire cloth, with the colour hue and lustre beaten in, on both sides.
Mastering them says, I know and see. This is the fifth mastery. A certain

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Again, Udayi, I have declared
to my disciples the method for developing the ten kasina signs. One perceives
the sign of earth, above, below, across without another, limitlessly. One
perceives the sign of water, above, below, across without another, limitlessly.
One perceives the sign of fire, above, below, across without another, limitlessly.
One perceives the sign of air, above, below, across without another, limitlessly.
One perceives the sign blue, above, below, across without another, limitlessly.
One perceives the sign yellow, above, below, across without another, limitlessly
One perceives the sign red, above, below, across without another, limitlessly
One perceives the sign white, above, below, across without another, limitlessly.
One perceives the sign space, above, below, across without another, limitlessly
One perceives the sign consciousness, above, below, across without another,
limitlessly.. Thus too my disciples abide aiming perfect knowledge for
emancipation..<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Again,
Udayi, I have declared to my disciples the method for developing the four
jhanas. The bhikkhu secluded from sensual desires and from demerit, with
thoughts and thought processes, and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion
abides in the first jhana. Then he pervades this same body with joy and
pleasantness born of seclusion, perfects it, fills it up, he does not leave
any place untouched with the joy and pleasanatness born of seclusion. Like
a bather or his apprentice would put some bathing powder in the bronze
bowl and while sprinkling water would mix it up into a ball of lather without
anything dripping out. In the same manner he pervades this same body with
joy and pleasantness born of seclusion, perfects it and fills it up, does
not leave any place untouched with the joy and pleasanatness born of seclusion.
Again the bhikkhu ovecoming thoughts and thought processes, with the mind
internally appeased and in a single point, without thoughts and thought
processes and with joy and pleasantness born of concentration abides in
the second jhana. Then he pervades this same body with joy and pleasantness
born of concentration, perfects it, fills it up, and does not leave any
place untouched with the joy and pleasanatness born of concentration. Like
a deep pond, with water springing from the bottom, without inflows of water
from the four directions, and without even rain water falling, is filled
and completed with the cool water that springs from the bottom, not leaving
any place untouched with the cold water. In the same manner he pervades
this same body with joy and pleasantness born of concentration, perfects
it, fills it up, does not leave any place untouched with the joy and pleasanatness
born of concentration. Again, Udayi, the bhikkhu, with equanimity to joy
and detachment abides mindful and aware, experiencing pleasantness with
the body too, abides in the third jhaana.to this the noble ones say abiding
in pleasantness with equanimity. Then he pervades this same body with pleasantness
devoid of joy, perfects it, fills it up, not leaving any place untouched
with the pleasanatness devoid of joy. Like some blue, red and white lotuses
that grow in the water, develop in the water, get nourished in the water
and bloom in the water, have their tops and roots touched with the water,
they have no place untouched with the water. In the same manner he pervades
this body with pleasantness devoid of joy, perfects it, fills it up, and
leaves no place untouched with the pleasanatness devoid of joy. Again,
Udayi, the bhikkhu dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness, and earlier
overcoming pleasure and displeasure without unpleasantness and pleasantness
and with mindfulness purified with equanimity abides in the fourth jhana.
Seated he permeates the whole body with that pure clean mind, without leaving
any place untouched with it. Udayi, it’s like a man who has covered himself
up with a white cloth together with the head and there is not a single
place untouched with that cloth. In that same manner, seated he permeates
the whole body with the pure clean mind. Thus too my disciples abide aiming
perfect knowledge for emancipation..<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span><o:p></o:p></span>

Udayi, I have declared this method to my disciples, by which method my
disciples know, this body of mine is made of the four great elements, is
produced by mother and father, supported on rice and bread is subject to
change through decay, brushing, breaking up and destruction and my consciousness
is attached there, bound there. Like a comely lapis gem of high birth,
having eight facets and in it is a string either blue, yellow, red or white
or pale yellow. In this manner I have declared this method to my disciples.
Fallen to this method my disciples know, this body of mine is made of the

Udayi, it’s like a man who has taken a snake out of a box. It occurs to

up from earth could be done as though in water. Could walk on water, as
though on earth. Could sit cross legged, in space as birds small and large
do. So powerful as the moon and the sun, could brush with the palm. As
far as the world of Brahma, power is held with the body. Like a clever
potter or his apprentice, would create whatever vessels he desired, with
clay well mixed. Or like a clever craftsman, or his apprentice who would
create ornaments out of the seasoned elephants’ tusks. Or a clever goldsmith
or his apprentice would create beautiful ornaments with purified gold.
In that same manner I have declared this method to my disciples, fallen

they recollect the various manifold previous births. Udayi, it is like
a man who would go from his village to another village, and from there
would go to another village, and would come back to his own village: and
it would occur to him. I went from my village to that village, there I
stood thus, sat thus, said this and kept silence thus. From that village
