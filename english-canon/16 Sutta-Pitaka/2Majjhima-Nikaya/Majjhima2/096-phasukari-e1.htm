<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU>I heard thus.At one time the Blessed
One was living in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika in Jet’s grove
in Saavatthi. The Brahmin Esukaari approached the Blessed One, exchanged
friendly greetings and sat on a side. The Brahmin Esukaari said to the
Blessed One.’Good<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Gotama, the Brahmins
appoint services to the Brahmins, warriors, the ordinary people and the
low caste. Good Gotama the Brahmins appoint services to the Brahmins thus.
A Brahmin should attend on a Brahmin, or a warrior should attend on a Brahmin,
or an ordinary man should attend on a Brahmin or else one of low caste,
should attend on a Brahmin. Brahmins appoint services to the warrior thus.
A warrior should attend on a warrior, or an ordinary man should attend
on a warrior, or else one of low caste should attend on a warrior. Brahmins
appoint services to the ordinary man thus. An ordinary man should attend
on an ordinary man, or else one of low caste should attend on him. Brahmins
appoint services to one of low caste thus. One of low caste should attend
on a person of low caste. Who else would attend on him? Good Gotama, the
Brahmins appoint these four kinds of services. What has good Gotama to
say about that?’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>‘Brahmin,
does all the world acknowledge, this appointment of services by the Brahmins?’&nbsp;</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>‘Good
Gotama, that is not so.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>‘Brahmin,
it is like a poor miserable man against his wish was told, here good man,
you should eat meat and you should not spend money on it. In a likewise
manner, without the consent of recluses and Brahmins, have appointed these
four services. Brahmin, I do not say all services should be done. I do
not say, all services should not be done. When doing those services if
there is evil, that service is not good. I say it should not be done. When
doing those services, if there is no evil, that service is good. I say
it should be done. Brahmin, the warriors, should be questioned. When serving
if there is evil and no good, and when serving if there is good and no
evil, how would you serve in this case? The warriors replying correctly
should reply thus. When serving if there is evil and no good, I will not
do that service. When serving if there is good and no evil, I will do that
service. Even the Brahmins, …re…. the ordinary class and the low caste
should be questioned. When serving if there is evil and no good, and when
serving if there is good and no evil, how would you serve in this case?
One of low caste replying correctly should reply thus. When serving if
there is evil and no good, I will not do that service. When serving if
there is good and no evil, I will do that service. Brahmin, I do not see
excellence, in a high clan, nor do I see any evil in a high clan. Brahmin,
I do not see excellence, in noble appearance, nor do I see evil in noble
appearance. Brahmin, I do not see excellence in great wealth, nor do I
see evil in great wealth.</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

a certain one of high clan may destroy living things, take the not given,
misbehave in sexuality, tell, lies, malicious things, talk roughly and
frivolously, may have a coveting mind, angry mind and wrong view. Therefore
I do not say there is excellence in high birth. A certain one of high clan
may abstain, from destroying living things, taking, the not given, misbehaving
in sexuality, telling, lies, malicious things, talking roughly and frivolously,
may not, covet or bear an angry mind and would have right view. Therefore
I do not say there is evil in high birth.&nbsp;</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

a certain one of noble appearance,…re… of great wealth may destroy living
things, take the not given, misbehave in sexuality, tell, lies, malicious
things, talk roughly and frivolously, may have a coveting mind, an angry

A certain wealthy one may abstain, from destroying living things, taking
the not given, misbehaving in sexuality, telling, lies, malicious things,
talking roughly and frivolously, may not bear, a coveting mind, or angry
mind and would have right view. Therefore I do not say there is evil in
wealth. I do not say everything should be followed after, nor do I say
everything should not be followed after. When following after something,
if faith, virtues, learnedness, benevolence and wisdom increases, I say
that, should be followed.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>When
this was said, the Brahmin Esukaari said. ‘Good Gotama, the Brahmins give
four wealths, one wealth for the Brahmins, another for the warriors, another
for the ordinary and another for the low castes. Brahmins offer going for
alms, for the Brahmins. Brahmins that belittle going for alms, dismiss
it, and become cowherds, which is not their wealth. Brahmins give the wealth
of the bow and arrow to the warriors. Warriors belittle the bow and arrow,
dismiss it and become cowherds, which is not their wealth. Brahmins give
agriculture and cattle rearing to the ordinary class. They belittle that,
dismiss it and become cowherds, which is not their wealth. Brahmins give
the wealth of the pingo to the low cast to carry, and dismiss dirt. They
belittle it, dismiss it and become cowherds, which is not their wealth.
What does good Gotama say about that?’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>.&nbsp;</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

does all the world acknowledge the offering of wealths by the Brahmins?’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

I offer this noble wealth to humans, which is beyond this world. Earlier,
humans recollect, the name and clan of their mother and father and are
reckoned accordingly. If born with the warriors, he is reckoned a warrior,
with the Brahmins a Brahmin, with the ordinary class, one of that class
and with the low caste, one of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>that
caste. Brahmin, just as on account of whatever, fire is burnt, on that
it is reckoned. So fire that burns from twigs is twig fire, fire that burns
with grass is grass fire, fire that burns from cow dung is cow dung fire.
In the same manner, I offer this noble wealth to humans, which is beyond
this world. Earlier, humans recollect the name and clan of their mother
and father and are reckoned accordingly. If born with the warriors, he
is reckoned a warrior, with the Brahmins a Brahmin, with the ordinary class,

even a warrior that goes forth homeless, to the Dispensation declared by
the Thus Gone One, abstains from, destroying life, taking the not given,

talk. He does not covet, bear an angry mind and comes to right view. Arouses

a head anointed warrior king invites hundreds of people born in various
clans, such as warrior, Brahmin, the ordinary class or low caste. Whether
you are born in a hall, under a sweet scented tree, under a Chandana tree,
or in a lotus, take an outer cover and make a fire. Come sirs, it does
not matter, whether you are born with the out castes, low castes, bamboo
weavers, or chariot makers, or the cleaners. Whether born in a trough of
the, dogs, pigs, the washerman, or born in some brushwood. Take an outer

born in a trough of the dogs, pigs, the washerman, or born in a brush wood,
would take an outer cover and make fire, would not that fire give the flame,
