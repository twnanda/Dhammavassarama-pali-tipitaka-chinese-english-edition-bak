<p class="MsoBodyText">I heard thus.At one time, the Blessed One was touring
Kashmire with a large community of bhikkhus. Then the Blessed One addressed,
those bhikkhus: Bhikkhus, I refrain from food at night and experience few
affictions, few illnesses, lightness, power, and a pleasant living. Come!
Bhikkhus, you too refrain from food at night and experience few afflictions,
few illnesses, lightness, power and a pleasant abiding. Those bhikkhus
agreed. Then the Blessed One touring in stages arrived in a hamlet named
Kitagiri in Kashmire.At that time a bhikkhu named Assaji-Punabbasuka was
a resident of Kitagiri. Then many bhikkhus approached the bhikkhu Assaji-Punabbasuka
and said thus: Friend, the Blessed One and the Community of bhikkhus refrain
from food at night and experience few affictions, few illnesses, lightness,
power, and a pleasant living. Come! Bhikkhu, you too, refrain from food
at night and experience few afflictions, few illnesses, lightness, power
and a pleasant abiding When this was said, the bhikkhu Assaji-punabbasuka
said thus to those bhikkhus. Friends, we partake food in the evening, early
in the morning, during the day and at untimely hours. Partaking in this
manner we experience few afflictions, few illnesses, lightness, power and
a pleasant abiding. Why should we, give up, what we, experience here and
now, and go after, new experiences.<span 

style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Those bhikkhus,
not able to convince the bhikkhu Assaji-Punabbasuka, approached the Blessed
One, worshipped, sat on a side and said to the Blessed One.Venerable sir,
we approached the bhikkhu Assaji-Punabbasuka and said to him. Friend, the
Blessed One and the Community of bhikkhus refrain from food at night and
experience few affictions, few illnesses, lightness, power, and a pleasant
living. Bhikkhu, you too, refrain from food at night and experience few
afflictions, few illnesses, lightness, power and a pleasant abiding. When
this was said, the bhikkhu Assaji-punabbasuka said thus to us. Friends,
we partake food in the evening, early in the morning, during the day and
at untimely hours. Partaking in this manner we experience few afflictions,
few illnesses, lightness, power and a pleasant abiding. Why should we,
give up, what we know here and now, and go for new experiences? Venerable
sir, as we could not convince the bhikkhu Assaji-Punabbasukha, we came
to inform this to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One addressed a certain
bhikkhu. Come bhikkhu! tell the bhikkhu Assaji-Punabbasuka in my words,
the Teacher wants you. That bhikkhu agreed, approached the bhikkhu Assaji-Punabbasuka
and said to him: The Teacher wants you. The bhikkhu Assaji-Punabbasuka
agreeing approached the Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side. Then
the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhu Assaji-punabbasuka: Bhikkhu, is it
true that, many bhikkhus approached you and said to you, friend, the Blessed
One and the Community of bhikkhus refrain from food at night and experience
few affictions, few illnesses, lightness, power, and a pleasant living?
. Come! Bhikkhu, you too, refrain from food at night and experience few
afflictions, few illnesses, lightness, power and a pleasant abiding. Did
you say this to them. Friends, we partake food in the evening, early in
the morning, during the day and at untimely hours. Partaking in this manner
we know of few afflictions, few illnesses, lightness, power and a pleasant
abiding. Why should I, give up, what I know, here and now, to seek new
experiences?. I said, Venerable sir.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhikkhus,
do you know this Teaching preached by me: Whatever this person feels, pleasant,
unpleasant, or neither unpleasant-nor pleasant feelings, to him, there
is decrease and increase of merit and demerit. No, venerable sir, we do
not know this. Bhikkhus, do you not know this Teaching preached by me:
When a person experiences a certain kind of pleasant feeling, demerit increases,
merit decreases. When a person experiences a certain kind of pleasant feeling,
demerit decreases, merit increases. When a person experiences a certain
kind of unpleasant feeling, demerit increases, merit decreases.. When a
person experiences a certain kind of unpleasant feeling, demerit decreases,
merit increases.. When a person experiences a certain kind of neither unpleasant-nor-pleasant
feeling, demerit increases, merit decreases. When a person experiences
a certain kind of neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant feeling, demerit decreases,
merit increases? Yes, we know it, venerable sir.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhikkhus,
good, that you have understood it. If I had not known, seen, experienced,
realized it and mentally touched, a certain person experiencing, such a
kind of pleasant feeling increase demerit and decrease merit. Not knowing
it, I would have said, give up that kind of pleasant feeling. Yet to a
person like me, is it suitable to do.so? No, venerable sir. Since, bhikkhus,
I have known, seen, experienced, realized and mentally touched a certain
person experiencing such a kind of pleasant feeling, increase demerit and
decrease merit I say dispel such a kind of pleasant feeling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>If
I had not known, seen, experienced, realized it and mentally touched, a

bhikkhus, I have known, seen, experienced, realized and mentally touched,
a certain person experiencing such a kind of pleasant feeling decrease
demerit and increase merit, I say pursue such a kind of pleasant feeling.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhikkhus,
I do not ask all bhikkhus to abide diligently, neither do I ask all bhikkhus
not to abide diligently. To those bhikkhus, who are perfect, have destroyed
desires, lived the holy life, done what should be done, have put down the
weight, have come to the highest good, have destroyed the bonds ‘to be’
and released rightfully knowing, to such bhikkhus, I do not say abide diligently.
What is the reason: They have done what should be done diligently, and
it is impossible that they should be negligent. Bhikkhus, as for those
trainers, not yet attained to the highest end of the yoke, and abiding
aiming it, to such bhikkhus, I say, abide diligently. What is the reason?
These venerable ones partaking of suitable dwellings, associating good
friends, and with the development of their faculties, for whatever reason
these sons of clansmen left the household and became homeless, that highest
end of the holy life, they here and now realize and abide. Bhikkhus, seeing
these results of diligence I tell these bhikkhus<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>to
be diligent.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhikkhus,
there are seven persons evident in the world: What seven: those released
both ways, released through wisdom, those with body witness, those come
to righteousness of view, those released in faith, those living according
to the Teaching, and those living according to faith.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhikkhus,
who is released both ways: Here bhikkhus, a certain person experiences
with the body those immaterial attainments and also with wisdom sees the
destruction of desires.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>To such a
one is said released both ways. Bhikkhus, to such ones, I do not say abide
diligently. What is the reason: They have done it diligently and it is
impossible that they be negligent.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhikkhus,
who is released through wisdom? Bhikkhus, a certain person does not .experience
those immaterial attainments with the body, seeing with wisdom his desires
are destroyed. To this one is said, released through wisdom. Bhikkhus,
to such a one too I do not say, abide diligently. What is the reason: They
have done it diligently and it is impossible that they be negligent.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhikkhus,
who witneses with the body? Bhikkhus, a certain person experiences<span 

style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>those
immaterial attainments with the body. Some of his desires are destroyed
seeing with wisdom Bhikkhus, this one is a body witness. To this bhikkhu
I say, there is something to be done diligently. What is the reason? Bhikkhus,
this one partaking of suitable dwellings, associating good friends, and
with the development of his faculties, for whatever reason this son<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>of
a clansman left the household and became homeless, that highest end of
the holy life, he here and now, would<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>realize
and abide. Seeing these results of diligence I tell<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>this<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>bhikkhu,<span 

style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>to
be diligent.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhikkhus,
who is the person come to righteousness of view. Here, bhikkhus, a certain
person does not .experience those immaterial attainments with the body,
seeing with wisdom some of his desires are destroyed. Through wisdom he
sees the Teaching of the Thus Gone One, and behaves accordingly. Bhikkhus,
to this one is said, come to righteousness of view To this bhikkhu I say,
there is something to be done diligently. What is the reason? Bhikkhus,
this one partaking of suitable dwellings, associating good friends, and
with the development of his faculties, for whatever reason this son<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>of
a clansman left the household and became homeless, that highest end of
the holy life, he here and now, would<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>realize
and abide. Seeing these good results of diligence I tell this bhikkhu to
be diligent.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhikkhus,
who is the person released in faith? : Here, bhikkhus, a certain person
does not experience<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>those immaterial
attainments with the body, and seeing with wisdom some of his desires are
destroyed. His faith in the Thus Gone One is thoroughly established, well
rooted. To this one is said, released in faith. To this bhikkhu too I say,
there is something to be done diligently. What is the reason: Bhikkhus,
this one partaking of suitable dwellings, associating good friends, and
with the development of his faculties, for whatever reason this clansman
left the household and became homeless, that highest end of the holy life,
he here and now, will realize and abide. Seeing these good results of diligence
I tell this bhikkhu to be diligent.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhikkhus,
who is the person living according to the Teaching. : Here, bhikkhus, a
certain person does not experience those immaterial attainments with the
body. His desires are not destroyed, not seeing with wisdom. He is convinced
in the Teaching of the Thus Gone One to a certain extent, by wisely thinking
about it..Yet to him there are the faculties of faith, effort, mindfulness,
concentration and wisdom. To this one is said, living according to the
Teaching. To this bhikkhu too I say, there is something to be done diligently.
What is the reason: Bhikkhus, this one partaking of suitable dwellings,
associating good friends, and with the development of his faculties, for
whatever reason this clansman left the household and became homeless, that
highest end of the holy life, he here and now, would realize and abide.
Seeing these good results for diligence I tell this bhikkhu to be diligent.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhikkhus,
who is the person living according to faith? Bhikkhus, a certain person
does not experience the immaterial attainments with the body.His desires
are not destroyed, not seeing with wisdom.He has some faith and love for
the Thus Gone One Yet to him there are the faculties of faith, effort,
mindfulness, concentration and wisdom<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>To
this one is said, living according to faith. To this bhikkhu too I say,
there is something to be done diligently. What is the reason: Bhikkhus,
this one partaking of suitable dwellings, associating good friends, and
with the development of his faculties, for whatever reason this clansman
left the household and became homeless, that highest end of the holy life,
he here and now, will realize. Seeing these good results for diligence,
I tell this bhikkhu to be diligent.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhikkhus,
I do not convince of perfection right at the beginning. It is a gradual
ascent, with gradual training, action, and follow up. Bhikkhus, how does
the conviction of perfection come about with gradual training, action,
and follow up? Bhikkhus, someone approaches when faith is born. Then he
associates. Associating lends ear. Listening bears the Teaching. Bearing
the Teaching examines the meanings. Examining the meanings some conviction
arises. Pleased with that conviction an interest arises for the Teaching.
With interest there is effort. With that effort there is weighing. Weighing
realises the highest truth with the body, and wisely penetrates it. Bhikkhus,
without faith, there is no approach..Without the approach there is no association.
Without association there is no lending ear. Without lending ear there
is no listening, Without listenning, the Teaching is not borne in the mind.
Without bearing the Teaching there is no examining of the meanings. Without
an examination, there is no conviction. Without a conviction, there is
no interest. Without an interest, there is no effort. Without effort there
is no discrimination..Without discrimination there is no weighing. Without
weighing, there is no confrontration. Those gone astray are on the wrong
track. Bhikkhus, the foolish, not interested in this dispensation of Teaching,
how far have they strayed?.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhikkhus,
there is an explanation given with four lines.through which the wise learn
the meaning quickly. Explain it bhikkhus, do you know it? Venerable sir,
do we<span 

style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>know the Teaching to explain?
Bhikkhus, if a Teacher honours materiality, leaves a material heritage,
abides engrossed in materiality, these doings and non-doings, occur to
him. That is to us, we will do that, that is not to us, we will not do
that. Bhikkhus, if the Thus Gone One abides unyoked from all materiality,
to the disciple with faith in the dispensation of the Teacher penetration
into the Teaching is lawfulness. The Blessed One is the Teacher, we, his
disciples. The Blessed One knows, we do not know. Bhikkhus, to the disciple
with faith in the dispensation of the Teacher the essentials for growth
and penetration into the Teaching are there. Bhikkhus, to the disciple
with faith in the dispensation of the Teacher, the penetration into the
teaching is lawful. Let skin, nerves, and bones remain, let the body dry
up with the flesh and blood, that which should be attained by manly strength,
manly effort and manly power should be attained. I will not give up the
inner effort without attaining it. Bhikkhus, to the disciples with faith
in the dispensaton of the Teacher yoked to penetration, one of these results
could be expected. Either perfection here and now, or with susbstratum
remaining mindfulness of not returning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>The Blessed
One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed
One.
