<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I heard thus.At one time
the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anathapindika in
Jeta’s grove in Savatthi. The carpenter Pancakanga approached venerable
Udayi worshipped and sat on a side and asked ‘Venerable sir, how many feelings
are made known by the Blessed One?’ ‘Householder, three feelings, are made
known by the Blessed One. They are pleasant feelings, unpleasant feelings
and neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings’.’Venerable Udayi, there are
only two feelings pointed out by the Blessed One. They are pleasant feelings
and unpleasant feelings, neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings are an
exalted state declared by the Blessed One’. For the second time venerable
Udayi said to the carpenter Pancakanga. ‘Householder, not two feelings,
the Blessed One has said of three feelings, pleasant feelings, unpleasant
feelings and neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings’. For the second
time, the carpenter Pancakanga said, ‘Venerable Udayi, two feelings are
made known by the Blessed One and they are pleasant feelings and unpleasant
feelings. This neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings, is an exalted
state is said, by the Blessed One’. For the third time venerable Udayi
said to the carpenter Pancakanga. ‘Householder, the Blessed One has said
of three feelings, pleasant feelings, unpleasant feelings and neither unpleasant
nor pleasant feelings’. For the third time, the carpenter Pancakanga said.
‘Venerable Udayi, only two feelings are pointed out by the Blessed One
and they are pleasant feelings and unpleasant feelings. The neither unpleasant
nor pleasant feelings, is an exalted state is said, by the Blessed One’.
Venerable Udayi could not convince the carpenter Pancakanga and the carpenter
Pancakanga could not convince venerable Udayi.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Venerable
Ananda heard this conversation between venerable Udayi and the carpenter
Pancakanga and approached the Blessed One worshipped the Blessed One and
sat on a side and related the complete conversation to the Blessed One.
Then the Blessed One addressed venerable Ananda. ‘Two feelings are also
declared by me,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>three in another,
five in another, six in another, eighteen in another, thirty-six in another
and also in another one hundred and eight feelings. Thus Ananda, this Teaching
is analytically preached. Ananda, in this analytical Teaching, if one does
not approve another’s view appreciating and accepting it, this kind of
thing could happen and quarrels, fights, disputes and verbal fights would
ensue. Therefore you should be united, open hearted, should co-operate
like milk and water, and should look at each other with understanding and
abide’.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Ananda,
there are five strands of sense desires. What five: Pleasant agreeable
forms cognizable by eye consciousness arousing fondness and sensual desires.
Pleasant agreeable sounds—Pleasant agreeable smells-- Pleasant agreeable
tastes -- Pleasant agreeable touches cognizable by body consciousness arousing
fondness and sensual desires. Ananda, these are the five strands of sensual
desires. All pleasure and pleasantness that arise on account of the five
strands of sensual desires, are said sensual pleasures.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Ananda,
if someone says, this is the highest pleasure, beings experience, I would
not second it. What is the reason? Ananda, there is a pleasantness which
exceeds this, and is more exalted than this. Ananda, what is that pleasantness
which exceeds this and is more exalted than this? Here the bhikkhu secluded
from sensual desires, secluded from things of demerit, with thoughts and
thought processes and with joy and pleasantness born from seclusion abides
in the first jhaana. Ananda, this exceeds, and is more exalted than the
previous..

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Ananda,
there is a possibility, for ascetics of other sects to question, does the
recluse Gotama declare the cessation of perceptions and feelings also as
a feeling? How could that happen? How could that be? This is our reply
to those ascetics of other sects. Friends, for the matter of only feeling
pleasant, the Blessed One does not declare it as pleasant. Whenever pleasantness
is gained to that the Blessed One declares pleasant*.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>The
Blessed One said thus and venerable Aananda, delighted in the words of
the Blessed One.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]><o:p></o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Notes.*
Friends for the matter of only feeling pleasant, the Blessed One does not
declare it as pleasant. Whenever pleasantness is gained, to that the Blessed
One declares pleasant.’na kho aavuso bhagavaa sukha.myeva vedana.m sandhaaya
sukhasmi.m pa~n~naapeti.apica aavuso yattha yattha sukha.m upalabhati yahi.m
yahi.m ta.m ta.m tathaagato sukhasmi.m pa~n~naapeti.’ Yet when pleasantness
is gained, to that the Blessed One declares pleasant. The<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>discourse
shows how the least pleasantness in the sensual sphere and the most exalted
pleasantness in the immaterial sphere is gained,. yet the Blessed One is
not pleased clinging to even that highest pleasantness. Extinction and
enlightenment means giving up that too.
