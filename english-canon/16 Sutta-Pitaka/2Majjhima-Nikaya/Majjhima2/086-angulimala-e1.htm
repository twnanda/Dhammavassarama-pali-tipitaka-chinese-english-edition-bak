<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>I
heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered
by Anathapindika in Jeta’s grove in Savatthi. At that time in King Pasenadi
Kosala’s kingdom there was a robber named Angulimala. He was fierce, with
bloody hands, engaged in killing living things without mercy. At that time
he destroyed complete villages, complete hamlets and even the state. He
killed humans to wear a garland of fingers. Then the Blessed One put on
robes in the morning, taking bowl and robes entered Savatthi for alms.
Going the alms round and returning from the alms round and after the meal
was over, arranged the dwelling and taking bowl and robes, followed up
the path to where Angulimala was. Cowherds, farmers and travellers seeing
the Blessed One following up the path leading to where Angulimala was staying
said. ‘Recluse do not fall to that path, there lives a robber named Angulimala,
a fierce one with bloody hands, engaged in killing living things, without
mercy. He has destroyed complete villages, complete hamlets and even states.
He kills humans to wear a garland of fingers. O! recluse, even a band of
ten, twenty, thirty forty, or even fifty people going along this path were
killed by this robber Angulimala. When this was said the Blessed One went
on, silently.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>For
the second time they said it and the Blessed One went on, silently and
for the third time they said it and the Blessed One went on, silently.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>The
robber Angulimala saw the Blessed One coming in the distance and it occurred
to him: Indeed it is wonderful, people come along this path in bands of
ten, or twenty, or thirty, or forty, or fifty, they all got into my hands,
this recluse comes all alone, without another, may be he thinks to overcome
me. What if I kill this recluse? Then the robber Angulimala took out his
sword and armour and fixed his bow and arrow and followed close behind
Blessed One. The Blessed One performed such a psychic intention, that the
robber Angulimala pursuing the Blessed One with all his strength would
not reach the Blessed One. Then it occurred to the robber Angulimala: It
is indeed wonderful, earlier, I could overtake a running elephant, a running
horse, a moving chariot, here running with all my strength, I cannot reach
up to this recluse. He stopped and called to the Blessed One. ‘Stop! Recluse
stop!’

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Angulimala,
I have stopped. ‘Stop you too!’ The Blessed One said.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Then
it occurred to the robber Angulimala: These recluses, the sons of the Sakyas
talk the truth and are established in the truth: Yet while walking why
did he say, I have stopped and Angulimala you too stop! What if I ask about
it from the recluse?’ Then the robber Angulimala said this verse to the
Blessed One.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>‘While
going the recluse says ‘I have stopped,’ when I have stopped, he says I
have

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>not
stopped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Recluse,
explain this to me, how have you stopped and I have not stopped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Angulimala
I have stopped for good, giving up punishing living things.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>You
are not restrained towards living things, therefore I have stopped and
you have<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>After
a long time did we meet a great sage in the great forest,

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>I
will throw away demerit for good, hearing your words enjoined with the
Teaching.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Then
and there the robber threw away his weapons into the depths of the forest

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Fell
at the feet of the Blessed One and begged for the going forth,

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>The
Blessed One, the sage with compassion, for the whole world,
<div style='border:none;border-bottom:solid windowtext .75pt;padding:0in 0in 1.0pt 0in'>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;border:none;mso-border-bottom-alt:

style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Gave
him the going forth saying. ‘Come O! bhikkhu!’ that was his going forth</div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span></div>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Then
the Blessed One with venerable Angulimala as the second monk went through
the streets of Savatthi and arrived at the monastery offered by Anathapindika
in Jeta’s grove. At that time at the entrance to the palace of king Pasenadi
of Kosala was assembled a large gathering, making much noise: Lord, there
is a robber Angulimala, in the kingdom. He is fierce, with bloody hands,
has no compassion for living things, destroys, hamlets, villages and states.
He killing humans collects fingers to wear as a garland round his neck.
Lord he should be punished.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Then
king Pasenadi of Kosala left his palace with about five hundred riders
on horse back and approached the monastery. Went as far as could be reached
in that conveyance and approached the Blessed One, on foot. Approaching
the Blessed One worshipped and sat on a side. Then the Blessed One said
thus to king Pasenadi of Kosala ’Great king, has king Seniya Bimbisara
of Magadha arisen against you, or has the Licchavis of Vesali arisen against
you?’ ‘No, venerable sir, neither king Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha has
arisen against me, nor the Licchavis of vesali have arisen against me.
Yet there is a robber in my kingdom, by the name Angulimala, fierce, bloody
handed, without compassion for living things. He destroys hamlets, villages
and states killing humans to collect fingers to wear a garland round his
neck..Venerable sir, I cannot punish him.’

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>‘Great
king, if you see, Angulimala, with shaved head and beard, donning yellow
clothes, gone forth homeless, abstaining from, destroying life, taking
the not given, telling lies, partaking one meal a day, and virtuous. What
would you do to him?’

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, I will get up from my seat on his arrival, prepare him a seat, invite
him, arrange to provide the four requisites of life, robes, morsel food,
dwellings and requisites when ill and provide him righteous protection.
Yet venerable sir, how could such virtues come to evil doers, like him?’

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>At
that time venerable Angulimala was seated close to the Blessed One, and
the Blessed One stretched his right and said, to king Pasenadi of Kosala:
Great king that is Angulimala.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then
king Pasenadi of Kosala was shivering with fear and his hairs stood on
end. Then the Blssed One knowing that king Pasenadi of Kosala was shivering
with fear and that his hairs were standing on end, said thus: Great king,
do not fear, there is nothing to fear now. Then all that fear vanished
from the king and approached venerable Angulimala and said. ‘Venerable
sir, are you Angulimala?’

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>‘Yes,
great king, I’m Angulimaala.’

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Of
what clan is the venerable one’s father and of what clan is the venerable
one’s mother?’

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Great
king, my father is Gagga and my mother Mantani’

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, venerable Gaggamantaniputta, take pleasure in the Dispensation, I
will provide with the four requisites of life such as robes, morsel food
dwellings and requisites when ill. At that time venerable Angulimala was
a dependent on morsel food, a forest dweller, a rag robe wearer and confined
to three robes. So venerable Angulimala said to king Pasenadi of Kosala.’Useless
great king, my three robes are complete.’

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Then
king Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Blessed One worshipped, sat on a
side and said. ‘Indeed, it is wonderful, how you tame, those that have
to be tamed, how you appease those that are not appeased, how you make
the not extinguished to extinguish. How you tame those that could not be
tamed with stick or weapon, without stick or weapon. Now we have much work
to do, we would go. Then king Pasenadi of Kosala getting up from his seat,
worshipped and circumambulated the Blessed One, and went away.’

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then
venerable Angulimala putting on robes in the morning and taking bowl and
robes entered Savatthi for alms. When going the alms round in Savatthi
in due order, saw a certain woman with the pains of childbirth, then it
occurred to him, indeed beings are defiled. Then after the alms round and
after the meal was over, venerable Angulimala approached the Blessed One
worshipped, sat on a side and said to the Blessed One: ‘Venerable sir,
when I was going for alms in due order, I saw a certain woman suffering
from the pains of childbirth and it occurred to me: Indeed beings are defiled.’

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>‘Then
Angulimala go to Savatthi, approach that woman and tell her. ‘Sister, since
my birth I have not destroyed a living thing knowingly, by that truth may
you be well and may the one to be born be well.’

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, won’t it be a lie told with awareness, I have destroyed many living
things with awareness.’

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Then Angulimala go to Savatthi
and approach that woman and tell her. ‘Sister, since I was born in the
noble birth I have not destroyed a living thing knowingly, by that truth
may you be well and may the one to be born be well.’

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then
venerable Angulimala agreed went to Savatthi approached that woman and
told her. ‘Sister, since I was born in the noble birth I have not destroyed
a living thing knowingly, by that truth may you be well and may the one
to be born be well.’ Then she got well and the child was also well. Then
Angulimala withdrawn from the crowd, secluded and diligent for dispelling
abode and before long for whatever reason sons of clansmen rightfully leave
the household and become homeless, that noble end of the holy life he here
and now knowing realised and abode. He knew, birth is destroyed, the holy
life is lived, what should be done is done. There is nothing more to wish.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then
venerable Angulimala putting on robes in the morning and taking bowl and
robes went the alms round in Savatthi. Then if a clod was thrown at anybody
else, it hit venerable Angulimala. If a stick was thrown at anybody else,
it hit venerable Angulimala. If a stone was thrown, it hit venerable Angulimala.
Venerable Angulimala would come to the Blessed One with a split head and
blood dripping, with the bowl broken and with robes torn. The Blessed One
seeing venerable Angulimala approaching in the disstance would say: Brahmin,
endure that, on account of the results of your actions you would have been
reaping results for many years, for many hundreds of years, for many thousands
of years in hell. Brahmin, bear the results of your actions here and now.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Venerable
Angulimala experienced the pleasantness of release in his seclusion, and
then these verses occurred to him:
