<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left:0in">I heard thus.At one
time the Blessed One was touring the kingdom of Kosala with a large community
of bhikkhus and entered the brahmin village of Saala. The householders
of Saala heard that the good recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyas, who
had gone forth homeless was touring the kingdom of Kosala, with a large
community of bhikkhus. That he had entered the brahmin village of Saala.
Of that good Gotama fame had spread: That blessed one is perfect, rightfully
enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, knower of worlds,
the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, Teacher of gods and men, enlightened
and blessed. In this world of gods and men, together with its Maras, Brahmas,
the community of recluses and brahmins, gods and men, he declares a teaching
by himself known and realized. Which is good at the beginning, in the middle
and at the end, full of meaning even in the letters and proclaiming the
pure and complete holy life. It is good to see such noble ones. Then the
brahmin householders of Saala approached the Blessed One, some worshipped
the Blessed One, some exchanged friendly greetings, some clasped hands
towards the Blessed One, some announced their clan and name, and some were
silent. They all sat on a side. Then Blessed One asked them, ‘Householders,
have you a favourite teacher, in whom you could gain some faith, gradually?’.
‘Venerable sir, we have no favourite teacher in whom we could gain faith
gradually’. ‘Householders, you who have no teacher would you like to observe
this inquiring teaching?*1). Householders, if you observe this inquiring
teaching it will be for your good for a long time. What is the inquiring
teaching?’

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Householders,
there are certain recluses and brahmins who have this view and declare
it. There are no results for gifts, offerings, or sacrifices. There are
no results for good and bad actions. There is no this world, no other world,
no mother, no father. There are no spontaneously arisen beings and there
are no recluses and brahmins in this world, who come to the right path,
have realized this world and the other world and declare it. Householders,
there are some other recluses and brahmins who have opposite views and
declare. There are results for gifts, offerings, and sacrifices. There
are results for good and bad actions. There is this and other world. There
is mother, father. There are spontaneously arisen beings and recluses and
brahmins in this world, come to the right path, have realized this world
and the other world and declare it. Householders, do these two groups of
recluses and brahmins bear completely opposite views and declare them?’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘They
do venerable sir’.<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Householders,
those recluses and brahmins who have this view and declare there are no
results for gifts, offerings, or sacrifices. There are no results for good
and bad actions, there is no this world, no other world, no mother, no
father. There are no spontaneously arisen beings recluses and brahmins
in this world, who come to the right path, have realized this world and
the other world and declare it*2). We could expect this, they would abstain
from these three things of merit such as good conduct by body, speech and
mind, would observe these three things of demerit such as misconduct by
body, speech and mind. What is the reason? These good recluses and brahmins
do not see the dangers of demerit, the vile nature of defilements, the
purity and the results of merit in giving up. There’s another world*3.
So their view there is no other world, becomes wrong view. Words that say,
there is no other world, becomes wrong speech. The view, there is no other
world, is completely opposite to what the noble ones say. The noble ones
talk of another world. Their instructions, there is no other world, becomes
wrong instructions, and the wrong teaching. Giving the wrong instructions,
they praise themselves and disparage others. .By that they decrease in
their virtues and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>accumulate various
things of demerit, on account of wrong view. Such as wrong thoughts, wrong
speech, giving instructions in the wrong teaching quite opposite to the
noble one’s teaching, and praising themselves and disparaging others.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>A wise man
reflects, if there is no other world, these good persons will be well and
good after death. If there is another world, after death they would go
to decrease, to hell. Let us say there is no, other world, and the words
of these good recluses and brahmins are true. Yet they are blamed by the
wise, here and now, as un -virtuous ones bearing wrong view, and negative
ideas. If there is the other world, these good persons will have unlucky
throws on both sides. The wise will blame them here and now, they will
decrease in virtues and birth in hell after death. Thus if this pervading
teaching is observed, it pervades both sides and neglects the side of demerit.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Householders,
there are recluses and brahmins who have this view and declare, there are
results for gifts, offerings, and sacrifices, there are results for good
and bad actions, there is this and other world, there is mother and father.
There are spontaneously arisen beings, recluses and brahmins in this world,
who come to the right path, have realized this world and the other world
and declare it We could expect this Giving up these demerits such as misconduct
by body, speech and mind, they<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>would
be of right conduct by body, speech and mind. Why is that? These good recluses
and brahmins see the danger of demerit, the impurity of defiling things,
the results and the purity of giving up. If there is another world, their
view there is another world, becomes right view. The thought ‘there is
another world,’ becomes their right thoughts. The words ‘there is another
world,’ are right words for them. They that say, ‘there is another world,’
come to the same view as the noble ones. They give the right instructions
in the right Teaching. Thus they do not praise themselves or disparage
others. Even from the beginning their evil virtues are dispelled Thus they
develop much merit on account of right view, such as right speech, giving
instructions in the teaching which is the same that the noble ones say
and by that not praising themselves and not disparaging others..<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Here, householders
a wise man reflects thus: If there was another world, these good persons
after death will go to increase will be born in heaven. Perhaps there was
no other world and the words of these good recluses and brahmins would
not be true. Yet they are here and now praised by the wise: These are virtuous
persons, with the right view, they think there are results for actions.
If there was another world, these persons are lucky both ways. Here and
now they are praised by the wise, and after death, will increase will be
born in heaven. Thus those who abide by this pervading teaching, pervades
both sides and keeps away from demerit.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Householders,
there are recluses and brahmins who have this view and declare it. The
doer and the subject, the destroyer and the destroyed, the tormentor and
one tormented, the griever and the one that causes it, the one frightened
and the monster, the killer, the taker of the not given, the one who cuts
limbs, the plunderer, the prison keeper, the one waiting in ambush, the
one going to others’ wives, the one telling lies, does no demerit. If one
was to roll a wheel with blades fixed to the rim, up to the southern bank
of the Ganges, killing all beings and making it, a mass of flesh, the destroyer
does not accumulate demerit, on account of it. If one goes up to the northern
bank of the Ganges giving gifts and making others to give gifts, making
sacrifices and making others to sacrifice, there is no merit accumulated
on account of it.<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then householders,
there are recluses and brahmins who hold a completely opposite view to
this and declare it The doer and the subject, the destroyer and the destroyed,
the tormentor and his subject, the griever and the one causing it, the
frightened and the monster, the killer, the taker of the not given, the
one who cuts limbs, the plunderer, the prison keeper, the one waiting in

accumulated on account of it. Householders, do these two groups of recluses
have completely opposite views?’ ‘Yes, venerable sir, they have.’

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Householders,
there are recluses and brahmins who have this view and declare it. The
doer and the subject neither do demerit. The destroyer and the destroyed,

giving gifts and making others to give gifts, making sacrifices and making
others to sacrifice, there is no merit accumulated on account of it. We
could expect this, from them. They would refrain from the three merits,
of good conduct by body, speech and mind. Would. Observe the three demerits
of misconduct by body, speech and mind.. What is the reason? These good
recluses and brahmins do not see the dangers of demerit, the vile nature
of defilements, the purity and the results of merit in giving up. There
are results for actions, their view, ‘there are no results for actions’,
becomes to them wrong view. Words that say ‘there are no results for actions,’
becomes to them wrong speech. This view is completely opposite to what
the noble ones say, the noble ones talk of the results of actions. The
instructions, ‘there are no results for actions,’ that comes to be giving
instructions in the wrong Teaching. The giver of wrong instructions praises
his, self and disparages others. Thus he loses whatever virtues he was
endowed with and he accumulates various things of demerit on account of
wrong view, such as wrong thoughts, wrong speech, giving instructions in
the wrong Teaching quite opposite to the noble one’s teaching, and praising
himself and disparaging others. Thus he accumulates much demerit on account
of wrong view.

their view ‘there are results for actions’ becomes right view, for them.
. When they think, ‘there are results for actions, that becomes right thoughts
for them. When they talk that ‘there are results for actions’, that becomes
right words for them. The view, there are results for actions, is the same
as the view of the noble ones, and the instructions they give is the right
Teaching. On account of that they do not praise themselves or disparage

There’s strength, effort, manly power, manly courage, all beings, all living

there is no complete cessation of being is close upon greed, is fixed to
the yoke, is with interest, is close upon appropriation, is close to holding.
The view of those recluses and brahmins who say there is a complete cessation

others yoked to tormenting. There is a person who neither torments his
self or others, is unyoked. He is here and now appeased, cooled and abides
in pleasantness like Brahma. Householders, who torments his self yoked
to tormenting? A certain person goes without clothes, licks the hands without
manners
as in the Karandakasuttam. --- Thus he abides yoked to giving various kinds
of torture to the body, tormenting his self yoked to tormenting. Householders,
which one tortures others yoked to it? A certain person kills pigs and
sheep and is yoked to giving various kinds of torture to living things.
This person torments others yoked to tormenting. Householders, which one
torments his self and others yoked to tormenting? Householders, a certain
person is a king or a head anointed warrior—frightening others makes them
work with tears in their eyes. This one, torments his self and others yoked
to it. Householders, which one does not torment his self or others and
is unyoked? Is here and now appeased, cooled and abides in pleasantness
like Brahma?. Householders, the Thus Gone One is born in the world, perfect
and rightfully enlightened,---- dispelling the five hindrances and making
the minor defilements weak, he secludes the mind from sensual desires and
thoughts of demerith. With thoughts and thought processes, and with joy
and pleasantness born of seclusion abides in the first jhaana—the second
jhaana—third jhaana,---fourth jhaana,-- When the mind is concentrated,
pure without blemish free of minor defilements workable and malleable and
is steady, he directs the mind to know previous births. Reflects innumerable
previous births. –When the mind is concentrated, pure without blemish free
from minor defilements, workable malleable and steady, he directs the mind
to know the disappearing and appearing of beings. With the heavenly eye
purified beyond human he sees beings disappear and appear<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>not
exalted and exalted, beautiful and ugly, good and bad. Knows beings according
their actions. When the mind is concentrated, pure, without blemish free
from minor defilements, workable malleable and steady directs the mind
for the destruction of desires. He knows as it really is, this is unpleasant----
knows the path to the cessation of desires as it really is. When he knows
and sees thus, his mind is released from sensual desires released from
the desires ‘to be’ and released from the ignorant desires. When released
knows I’m released..I have destroyed birth. The holy life is lived, what
should be done is done, there is nothing more to wish. Householders, this
one does not torment himself or others, is unyoked. Is here and now appeased,
cooled and abides in pleasantness like Brahma.’

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>When this
was said the brahmin householders of Sala said thus to the Blessed One.
.‘Good Gotama, now we understand. It is like something over turned is reinstalled.
Like something covered is made manifest. As though the path is told to
someone who had lost his way. It is as though an oil lamp is lighted for
the darkness for those who have sight to see forms. In various ways good
Gotama has explained the Teaching. Now we take refuge in Good Gotama, in
the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. May we be remembered as lay
disciples who have taken refuge from today until life lasts.’<span style="mso-spacerun:

world is a being who experiences the world through his six spheres of mental
contact. So another world is another birth.4. All born are led to maturity
