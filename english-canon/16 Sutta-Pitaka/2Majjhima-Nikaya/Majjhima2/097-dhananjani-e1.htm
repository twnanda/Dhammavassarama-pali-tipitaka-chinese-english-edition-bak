One was living in the squirrels’ sanctuary in the bamboo grove in Raajagaha.
At that time venerable Saariputta was touring the southern hilly regions

Saariputta put on robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes entered
Rajagaha for alms. At that time the Brahmin Dhaananjaani was milking the
cows out side the city close to it. Venerable Saariputta having gone the
alms round, and after the meal was over approached the Brahmin Dhaananjaani.
