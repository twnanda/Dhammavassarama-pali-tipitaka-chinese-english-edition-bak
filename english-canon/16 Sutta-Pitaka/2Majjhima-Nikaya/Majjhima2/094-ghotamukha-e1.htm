<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>I
heard thus.At one time venerable Udena was dwelling in Khemiya’s mango
orchard in Benares. At that time the Brahmin Go.tamukha had arrived in
Benares for some purpose. While walking and wandering for exercise came
to the mango orchard of Khemiya and saw venerable Udena walking mindfully
in the mango orchard and approached him. The Brahmin Go.tamukha exchanged
friendly greetings with venerable Udena and while walking beside him said
‘Good recluse, I think there is no rightful going forth, a one with a vision
for ending, ‘being’, or a teaching like that.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

this was said, venerable Udena, stepped out of the chankamana went to his
dwelling and sat on the arranged seat. The Brahmin too stopped his exercises,
followed venerable Udena, entered his dwelling and stood on a side. Brahmin,
there are seats, if you wish, sit.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

venerable Udena took a seat, we would not sit, not that I thought, I will
not take a seat without being offered?’<span

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

Brahmin Go.tamukha took a low seat and sat on a side and said.’ Good recluse,
I think there is no rightful going forth, a one with a vision for ending
‘being’, or a teaching like that.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

if you give me permission to rebuke you, when rebuke is necessary and when
anything is not clear, if you question me further. We will have a conversation

Udena, I grant permission to rebuke me when rebuke is necessary and when
anything is not clear I will question, venerable Udena what is the meaning
of this. There will be a conversation between us on this.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

four kinds of persons are evident in the world. What are the four? A certain
person tortures his self yoked to it. Another tortures others yoked to
it. Another tortures his self and others yoked to it. Another does not
torture his self or others, is satisfied, extinguished, cooled and abides
in pleasantness like Brahmaa. Brahmin, of these four which one pleases
you?’</span>

Udena, I’m not pleased with him who tortures his self yoked to it, nor

tortures his self and others yoked to it. I’m pleased with the person who
does not torture his self or others, is satisfied, extinguished, cooled
and abides in pleasantness like Brahmaa.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

why are you not pleased with these three persons?’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

Udena, this person who tortures his self, is yoked to torturing his self,
which desires pleasantness and loathes unpleasantness. Therefore I’m not
pleased with this person. This person who tortures others, is yoked to
torturing others, who desire pleasantness and loathe unpleasantness. Therefore
I’m not pleased with this person. This person who tortures his self and
others, is yoked to torturing his self and others that desire pleasantness
and loathe unpleasantness. Therefore I’m not pleased with this person.
The person who does not torture his self and others, is unyoked, satisfied,
extinguished, cooled and abides in pleasantness like Brahmaa. Therefore
I’m pleased with this person.’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

there are two gatherings. What are the two? One gathering is attached to
jewels, ear -rings, sons wives, slaves male and female, fields, wealth
and gold and are in search of them. The other gathering is not attached
to jewels, ear- rings, sons, wives, slaves male and female, fields, wealth
and gold. Giving up these, they go forth, homeless. Brahmin, this person
does not torture his self and others, is unyoked, satisfied, extinguished,
cooled and abides in pleasantness like Brahmaa, here and now. In which
kind of gathering do you see this person much? Is it in the gathering that
is attached to, and is in search of, jewels, ear rings sons wives slaves
male and female, fields, wealth and gold. Or else in the gathering that
is not attached to jewels, ear rings, sons wives, slaves, male and female,
fields, wealth and gold, has given up these and has gone forth?’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

gone forth.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

we know you saying these words.’ Good recluse, I think there is no rightful
going forth, a one with a vision for ending, ‘being’, or a teaching like
that.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

Udena, indeed those words were spoken carelessly. It now occurs to me,
there is a rightful going forth. I believe good Udena is one of them. May
those four persons mentioned in short be explained to me in detail.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

listen I will explain.’ He replied ‘Yes good Udena.’</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

venerable Udena said. ‘Brahmin, a certain one tortures himself, yoked to
it. He goes naked, without manners licks the hand, does not accept a greeting
or a tarrying. Does not accept what is brought or specially prepared. Does
not endure an invitation. Does not accept, from the rim of a pot, when
a goat is about the place, across a stick or broom. Does not accept from,

for the body. Bhikkhus, this person tortures himself yoked to it.*1).<o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

which person tortures others yoked to it? Bhikkhus, here a certain person
is a killer of pigs, goats, birds, a hunter of wild animals, a fisherman,
a robber, a highway robber, one who keeps a prison, or engaged in any other
vicious activity. This person tortures others yoked to it..

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhikkhus,
who tortures his self and others, yoked to it?<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>A
certain king or the head anointed king of warrior, or brahmin or householder
clan, builds a new assembly hall. Shaving head and beard, and putting on
a rough garment, smears his body with ghee and oil. Pricking the horn of
a deer on his rear parts and enters the assembly hall, with the queen consort
and the brahmin adviser. Within the enclosure, on some greenery he lies
down. From a certain young cow, milk is drawn from one nipple to support
the king, from the second to support the queen, from the third to support
the adviser with the milk from the fourth nipple the sacrificial cake is
cooked. With the remaining milk the calf is fed. Then he orders, the people
kill so many bulls for the sacrifice, so many cows, so many goats, so many
sheep. He orders cut so many trees for the sacrificial post, and clear
so much space for the sacrifice. The slaves, servants, and messengers are
frightened with a stick and made to do the necessary work. Bhikkhus, this
one torments himself, and others yoked to it.

who does not torture his self or others, is unyoked? Bhikkhus, the Thus
Gone One is born in the world, perfect, rightfully enlightened, endowed
with knowledge and conduct, well gone, knower of the worlds, the incomparable
tamer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed.
He proclaims to this world of gods and men, together with its Maaras, Brahmaas,
the community of recluses, brahmins, gods and men, that Teaching. Which
is good at the beginning, in the middle and the end, full of meanings even
in the letters declaring the complete and pure holy life. A householder,
or the son of a householder or one born into some clan hears the Teaching
and gains faith in the Thus Gone One. With that gain of faith he reflects.
The household life is full of difficulties. It is a path of defilements.
Going forth, homeless, is like open space. Living in a household it is
not easy to lead a holy life complete and pure without being defiled. Shaving
head and beard, putting on yellow clothes, why shouldn’t I go forth as
a homeless? At some suitable time he gives up a little wealth or a large
mass of wealth, either leaving behind a small circle of friends, or a large
circle of friends shaving head and beard and donning yellow clothes, goes
forth as a homeless.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

Thus he unites the split, promotes unity. Fond of unity talks words to
unite. Gives up rough talk, saying words pleasing to the ears. Words that

with all the belongings wherever he goes. Like the birds small and large
that go with the weight of their wings. Likewise satisfied covering the

Tasting tastes, Cognizing touches with the body, Cognizing an idea with
the mind, does not take the sign or the element. To him abiding with the
mental faculty of the mind not controlled, demerit of covetousness and
displeasure may trickle. He abides protecting the mental faculty of the
mind. Endowed with the noble ones’ control of the mental faculties, he
experiences the untouched pleasure of the mental faculties. Going forward
or returning he is aware. Looking on, or looking aside is aware. Bending
or stretching is aware. Bearing the bowl and three robes is aware. Tasting,
drinking, eating and enjoying is aware. Going, standing, sitting, lying,

forest, an open space, or a heap of straw. After the meal and returning
from the alms round, he sits legs crossed, the body placed straight and
mindfulness established in front.

cleaning sloth and torpor. Dispelling restlessness and worry he abides
with a mind internally appeased, cleaning the mind of restlessness and
worry. Abides with doubts dispelled of merit that should be, and should

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>The
bhikkhu dispelling the five hindrances of the mind, and wisely making the
minor defilements weak, secludes the mind from sensual thoughts and demerit.
With thoughts and thought processes and with joy and pleasantness, born
of seclusion he abides in the first jhaana..

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:

the bhikkhu overcoming thoughts and thought processes, the mind internally
appeased, in a single point, with joy and pleasantness born of concentration

born there with such name, clan, arrangements, supports, experiencing such
pleasant and unpleasant feelings, in such a life span. Disappearing from

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>When

ugly, arising in good and bad states according to their actions. These
good beings misbehaving by body, speech and mind, blamed noble ones, had
the wrong view of actions, after death are born in loss, in decrease, in
hell. As for these good beings, well behaved in body speech and mind not

these are desires, this, their rising, this, their cessation and this,
the path to their cessation as it really is. His mind that knows and sees
thus, is released from sensual desires, from desires ‘to be’ and from ignorant
