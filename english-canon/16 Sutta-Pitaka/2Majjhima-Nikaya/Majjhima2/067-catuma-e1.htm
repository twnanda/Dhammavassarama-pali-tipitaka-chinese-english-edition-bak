<p class="MsoBodyText">I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One was living
in the Aamalaki forest in Catuma. At that time about five hundred bhikkhus
had come to Catuma headed by venerable Saariputta and venerable Moggallana
to see the Blessed One.While exchanging friendly greetings, arranging beddings,
putting away bowls and robes, they made much noise.The Blessed One addressed
venerable Ananda: ‘Ananda, who are those making such a noise, like fishermen
hauling a catch of fish’ ‘Venerable sir, about five hundred bhikkhus, headed
by Sariputta and Moggallana have arrived in Catuma to see the Blessed One.
They exchanging friendly greetings.with the resident bhikkhus, while arranging
beddings, putting away bowls and robes are making much noise.Then Ananda,
call those bhikkhus in my words’.. Venerable Ananda agreed, approached
those bhikkhus and said. ‘Venerable ones, the Teacher calls you.’. Then
those bhikkhus, agreeing approached the Blessed One, worshipped and sat
on a side.The Blessed One addressed those bhikkhus. ‘Bhikkhus, why do you
make such a big noise? It’s like fishermen hauling a catch of fish.’ ‘Venerable
sir, about five hundred bhikkhus, headed by Sariputta and Moggallana have
arrived in Catuma to see the Blessed One.Exchanging friendly greetings,
with the the resident bhikkhus, arranging beddings, putting away bowls
and robes they are making much noise’. ‘Go! Bhikkhus, I turn you away,
you should not stay close to me’. Those bhikkhus, agreed, worshipped the
Blessed One circumambulated the Blessed One and taking their bowls and
robes left the presence of the Blessed One.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>At that time
the Sakyas of Catuma had assembled in the assembly hall for some matter.
The Sakyas of Catuma saw the bhikkhus going away in the distance, approaching
them said thus:’Venerable Ones, why do you go away?’ ‘The Blessed One has
turned out the Community of bhikkhus’.’Then venerable ones wait a moment,
perhaps I would be able to win over the Blessed One’ Then those bhikkhus
listened to the words of the Sakyas of Catuma and waited. The Sakyas of
Catuma approached the Blessed One worshipped the Blessed One and sitting
on a side said thus: ‘Let, the Blessed One take pleasure in the Community
of bhikkhus. May, the Blessed One welcome, the community of bhikkhus, As
the Blessed One showed compassion to the community in the past, let compassion
be shown now too. Venerable sir, here, there are new bhikkhus, those gone
forth recently. If they do not get a chance to see the Blessed One, they
would change their minds. Like small plants that die in want of water.
Venerable sir, if these bhikkhus recently come to the dispensation do not
get a chance to see the Blessed One they would change their minds. Like
the calf that would be disturbed not seeing the mother. Venerable sir,
in the same manner if these bhikkhus recently come to the dispensation
do not get a chance to see the Blessed One they would change their minds.
May the Blessed One take pleasure in the Community of bhikkhus. May the
Blessed One welcome the community of bhikkhus, As the Blessed One showed
compassion to the community<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>in the
past, let there be compassion now too.’

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then Brahma
Sahampati knowing the Blessed One’s thoughts, as a strong man would stretch
his bent arm, or bend his stretched arm in that manner disappearing from
the world of Brahma appeared before the Blessed One. Brahma Sahamapathy
arranging his shawl on one shoulder and clasping hands towards the Blessed
One said ‘Let the Blessed One take pleasure in the Community of bhikkhus.
May the Blessed One welcome the community of bhikkhus, As the Blessed One
showed compassion to the community in the past, let compassion be shown
now too. Venerable sir, here, there are new bhikkhus, those gone forth
recently. If they do not get a chance to see the Blessed One, they would
change their minds, like small plants that die in want of water. Venerable
sir, if these bhikkhus recently come to the dispensation do not get a chance
to see the Blessed One they would change their minds. Like the calf that
would be disturbed not seeing the mother. Venerable sir, in the same manner
if these bhikkhus recently come to the dispensation do not get a chance
to see the Blessed One they would change their minds. Let the Blessed One
take pleasure in the Community of bhikkhus. May the Blessed One welcome
the community of bhikkhus, As the Blessed One showed compassion to the
community in the past, let compassion be shown now too.’

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>The Sakyas
of Catuma and Brahma Sahampati could win over the Blessed One with the
comparison of the plants and the calf. Then venerable Mahamoggallana addressed
the bhikkhus: ‘Friends, get up, take your bowls and robes, it was possible
for the Sakyas of catuma and Brahma Sahampati to win over the Blessed One
with the comparison of the plants and the calf’. Those bhikkhus agreeing
got up from their seats and taking bowls and robes, approached the Blessed
One, worshipped and sat on a side. Then the Blessed One spoke to venerable
Sariputta. ‘Sariputta, when I turned away the Community of bhikkhus, what
occurred to you?’ ‘Venerable sir, it occurred to me. The Blessed One will
abide in pleasantness here and now, unconcerned, I too will abide in pleasantness
here and now, unconcerned. Come! Sariputta, you should not arouse such
a thought in the future’ Then the Blessed One addresssed venerable Mahamoggallana:
‘Moggallana, when I turned away the Community of bhikkhus, what occurred
to you?’.’Venerable sir, it occurrd to me thus: The Blessed One will abide
in pleasantness here and now unconcerned, I and venerable Sariputta will
lead the Community of bhikkhus.’ ‘Good! Moggallana, either I or Sariputta
and Moggallana should lead the Community of bhikkhus’.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then the
Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: ‘Bhikkhus, four fears should be expected
by one descending to water: What four? Fear of, waves, crocodiles, whirl
pools and alligators. Bhikkhus, these four fears should be expected by
one entering<span 

style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>water. In the same
manner four fears should be expected by a person leaving the household
to become a homeless. What four?. The fear of waves, fear of crocodiles,
fear of whirl<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes"></span>pools and fear of
alligators.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhikkhus,
what is the fear of waves? Bhikkhus, a certain son of a clansman out of
faith goes forth from a household. He becomes a homeless thinking am overcome
by birth, decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and
distress.There’s only a few who could declare the complete ending of this
unpleasantness.The co-associates in the holy life, advise him.You should
go forward like this, turn and go like this, Look on, like this<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>and
look this and other side like this. Thus you should bend your limbs and
stretch you limbs.Thus you should bear the three robes and bowl. Then it
occurs to him: When I was a householder, I advised others, here I have
to abide by the advice of those who are like my sons and grand sons. Then
he gives up robes and becomes a layman, out of fear for waves, it is said.
Bhikkhus, fear of waves is a synonymn for anger and aversion.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhikkhus,
what is the fear of crocodiles?.Bhikkhus, a certain son of a clansman out
of faith goes forth from a household. He becomes a homeless thinking, I’m
overcome by birth, decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure
and distress.There are only a few who could declare the complete ending
of this unpleasantness.The co-associates in the holy life, advise him.You
should eat this, should not eat this.You should partake thus, not partake
thus, You should taste thus and not taste thus. You should drink thus,
and not drink thus. You should drink the suitable and avoid the unsuitable.
Eat, partake and taste the suitable and avoid the unsuitable. You should
eat and partake at the right time, avoid eating food at untimely hours.
Then it occurs to him. When I was a householder, I ate what I liked, and
not what I disliked, Partook what I liked and not what I disliked. Drank
what I liked and not what I disliked. I ate, partook, tasted and drank
the suitable and the unsuitable.I partook, tasted and drank at timely hours
and at untimely hours.Householders offer us nourishing food and drinks
out of faith during the day time, when it is not the correct time. I think
it is a restriction for the mouth. Then he gives up robes and becomes a
layman. He gives up robes and becomes a layman, out of fear for crocodiles
it is said. Crocodiles is a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>synonymn
for, greed for food.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhikkhus,
what is the fear for whirl pools? Bhikkhus, a certain son of a clansman
out of faith goes forth from a household and becomes a homeless thinking
I’m overcome by birth, decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure
and distress. He thinks there’s only a few who could declare the complete
ending of this unpleasantness. He gone forth thus, putting on robes in
the morning, takes bowl and robes and goes the alms round, in the village
or hamlet controlled in body and speech, mindfulness not established and
mental faculties not protected. In the village he sees a householder or
the son of a householder partaking the five strands of sensual pleasures,
possessed and provided with them. Then it occurs to him, when I was a householder,
I too partook these five strands of sensual pleasures, possessed and provided.
I have wealth in my clan, to enjoy these sensual pleasures. I could do
merit, too. Then he gives up robes and becomes a layman. He gives up robes
and becomes a layman out of fear for whirlpools, it is said. Bhikkhus,
fear for whirlpool is a synonymn for, the five strands of sensual pleasures.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhikkhus,
what is the fear for alligaters? .Bhikkhus, a certain son of a clansman
out of faith goes forth from a household. He becomes a homeless thinking
I’m overcome by birth, decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure
and distress. There are only a few who could declare the complete ending
of this unpleasantness. He gone forth thus, putting on robes in the morning,
taking bowl and robes goes the alms round, in the village or hamlet controlled
in body and speech, mindfulness not established and mental faculties not
protected. In the village he sees a woman not well covered and dressed.
Seeing her in that manner, greed assails his mind and with a mind assailed
by greed he gives up robes and becomes a layman.He gives up robes and becomes
a<span 

style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>layman out of fear for alligaters.Bhikkhus,
fear for alligaters is a synonymn for women.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bhikkhus,
these are the four fears, that should be expected by a certain person who
goes forth as a homeless, in this dispensation of the Discipline.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>The Blessed
One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed
One.
