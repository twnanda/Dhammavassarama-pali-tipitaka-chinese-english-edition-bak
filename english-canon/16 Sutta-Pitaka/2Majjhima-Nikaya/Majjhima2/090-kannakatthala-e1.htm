<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>I heard thus.At
one time the Blessed One lived in the Ka.n.nakatthala deer park in Uju~n~naaya.
At that time, king Pasenadi of Kosala had come to Uju~n~naaya for some
purpose. Then the king called a certain man, and said. ‘Come good man,
approach, and worship the Blessed One, for my sake and ask whether he has
few ailments, no troubles and a light living. Also tell, king Pasenadi
of Kosala will come to see the Blessed One after the mid-day meal.’ This
man agreed, approached, worshipped the Blessed One, and sat on a side.
Then he said, ‘Venerable sir, king Pasenadi of Kosala worships, with his
head at the feet of the Blessed One, and inquires whether the Blessed One
is with few ailments, without troubles and has a light living. Today king
Pasenadi of Kosala will come to see the Blessed One after the mid-day meal.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>The two sisters
Soma and Sakulaa heard that the king would go to see the Blessed One after
his mid-day meal, and they approached him at the time he was taking his
meal. They said to the king, ‘Great king, if that is so, worship the feet
of the Blessed One for the sake of Soma and Sakula and inquire whether
the Blessed One is with few ailments, without troubles and has a light
living.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then king Pasenadi
of Kosala, after the meal was over approached the Blessed One, worshipped,
sat on a side and said to the Blessed One. ’Venerable sir, my sisters Soma
and Sakulaa too worship the Blessed One with their heads at your feet and
asks whether the Blessed One is with few ailments, without trouble and
has a light living?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Great king,
hasn’t the sisters Soma and Sakula any other messenger?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, my sisters Soma and Sakula heard that I was approaching you, after
my mid-day meal. They approached me when I was partaking the mid-day meal
and said. Great king if you approach the Blessed One, worship the feet
of the Blessed One for the sake of Soma and Sakula and inquire whether
the Blessed One is with few ailments, without troubles and has a light
living.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Great king,
may the sisters Soma and Sakula be with pleasantness*1).’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then king Pasenadi
of Kosala said. ‘Venerable sir, I heard that the recluse Gotama said this.
There is no possibility that a recluse or Brahmin could acknowledge, knowledge
and vision of everything without leaving out anything. Venerable sir, those
who say, the recluse Gotama said, there is no possibility that a recluse
or Brahmin could<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>have knowledge and
vision of everything without leaving out anything. How far are they saying
the words of the Blessed One, and not insulting the Blessed One falsely.
How much of it is according the Teaching and are they saying the words
of the Blessed One?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Great king,
those who say, the recluse Gotama said, there is no possibility that a
recluse or Brahmin could acknowledge, knowledge and vision of everything,
without leaving out anything, are not saying my words. They insult me falsely.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>King Pasenadi
of Kosala spoke to the general Waduudabha. ‘General, who was it that brought
these words to the inner chambers of the palace?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Great king,
it was Sanjaya Aakaasagotta.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then king Pasenadi
of Kosala called a certain man and said. ‘Good man, call the Brahmin Sanjaya
Aakaasagotta in my words, tell him the king wants you.’ He agreed, approached
the Brahmin Sanjaya Aakaasagotta and said. ‘Sir, king Pasenadi of Kosala
wants you.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Meanwhile king
Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One. ‘Venerable sir, has the Blessed
One said something else on account of this? Which people may have not understood
correctly? How does the Blessed One recall saying something pertaining
to this?’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Great king
I remember saying something like this. There is no possibility that a recluse
or Brahmin, could know and see everything at one and the same time.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, you have said with reasons. There is no possibility that a recluse
or Brahmin, could know and see everything at one and the same time. Venerable
sir, there are four castes. They are warrior, Brahmin, one of the common
grade and slaves. ‘Great king of these four castes, two are thought to
be superior, that is the warrior and Brahmin castes, in the matter of revering,
paying attention, clasping hands as respect, and to associate with respect.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Venerable,
sir, I do not question, about the here and now, it is here after I question.
Venerable sir, of these four castes of warriors, Brahmins, the common man
and the slaves is there any difference?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Great king
there are these five attributes for exertion. What are the five? The bhikkhu
places faith in the enlightenment of the Blessed One. The Blessed One is
perfect, rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well
gone, knows the worlds,*2 is the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed,
Teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed. He is one with few ailments,
a good digestive system not too cold nor too hot. Not crafty and fraudulent,
shows his real self to the Teacher, to the wise or co-associates in the
holy life. Abides with aroused effort, for dispelling demerit and becomes
firm and strenuously yoked to accumulate merit. Becomes wise, endowed with
the noble one’s wisdom, to penetrate and see the rising and falling, for
the rightful destruction of unpleasantness.*3) Great king, these are the
five attributes for exertion. If these four castes of warriors, Brahmins,
of ordinary people and slaves, are endowed with these five attributes of
exertion, it will be for their good and welfare for a long time.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, when these four castes of warriors, Brahmins, ordinary people and
slaves are endowed with these five attributes of exertion, will there be
a difference among them?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Great king,
I will tell you the difference in their exerting. There are two elephants,
or horses or bulls to be trained, of them one trained and tamed, the other
untrained and untamed. Of them which one would be trained tamed and come
to the category of the trained, is it the trained tamed one or the untrained
untamed one?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, the trained, tamed one will be trained and tamed, and will come to
the category of the trained.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Great king
in the same manner, whatever could be attained by one with faith, few ailments,
without craftiness and fraudulence, with aroused effort and wisdom, that<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>could
be attained by one without faith, many ailments, crafty, fraudulent, lazy,
without effort and<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>not wise is not
a possibility.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, the Blessed One said with reasons<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, when these four castes of warriors, Brahmins, ordinary people and
slaves are endowed with these five attributes of exertion, will there be
a difference among them here?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Great king,
I do not see any difference in the release or the released. Like one man
would light a fire with dry branches leaves and twigs. Another would light
with dry Sal wood, another with dry mango wood and yet another with dry
wood apple sticks. Great king in these fires lighted with different kinds
of wood, do you see any difference in the flame, colour or the lustre?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘No, venerable
sir.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Great king
in the same manner, in that fire created by effort, and born out of exertion,
I do not see any difference in the release or the released.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, the Blessed One speaks with reasons. Venerable sir, are there gods?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Great king,
why do you ask? Venerable sir, are there gods?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, are there gods, who would return here, or gods who would not return
here?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Great king,
those gods with a troubled mind return here and the others without a troubled
mind do not return here.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then the general
Widuudabha asked the Blessed One. ‘Venerable sir, do the gods with an untroubled
mind chase out or banish the gods with a troubled mind?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘It occurred
to venerable Aananda, general Widuudabha is the son of king Pasenadi of
Kosala, and I’m the son of the Blessed One. The son should speak to the
son. Then venerable Aananda spoke to the general Widuudabha. ‘General,
I will question you on this, answer as it pleases you. Within the kingdom
of king Pasenadi of Kosala, where he wields power, could he chase out or
banish recluses, Brahmins, pure or impure ones, those leading the holy
life or those not leading the holy life?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Within the
kingdom of king Pasenadi of Kosala, where he wields power, it is possible
for him to chase out or banish recluses, Brahmins, pure or impure ones,
those leading the holy life or those not leading the holy life.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘General, have
you heard of the gods of the thirty three?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘I have heard
of the gods of the retinue of thirty three, and also this king Pasenadi
of Kosala has heard of the gods of the retinue of thirty three.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘General could
king of Kosala chase out or banish gods of the thirty three from there?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Even gaining
a sight of those gods is not possible to king Pasenadi of Kosala. How could
he chase out or banish them from there?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘General in
the same manner, the troubled gods who come here, do not even see the untroubled
gods who do not come here, so how could they chase them out or banish them
from there?’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>King Pasenadi
of Kosala asked the Blessed One.‘Venerable sir, what is the name of this
bhikkhu?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Great king
his name is Aananda.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Indeed, good
Aananda has pleasant ways, speaks with reasons. Venerable sir, is there
Brahmaa?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Great king,
why do you ask? ‘Is there Brahmaa?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Are there
Brahmaa who return here and those that do not return here?’<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Great king
the troubled Brahmaas return here and those not troubled do not return
here.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then a certain
man said to king Pasenadi of Kosala. ‘Great king, the Brahmin Sanjaya Aakaasagotta
has come.’ King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Brahmin Sanjaya Aakaasagotta.
‘Brahmin who brought these words to the inner chambers of the palace.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Great king,
the general Widuudabha did so.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>General Widuudabha
said.’Great king it is the Brahmin Sanjaya Aakaasagotta.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then a certain
man said to king Pasenadi of Kosala. ‘Great king it is time to go.’ Then
king Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Blessed One.’I asked the Blessed One,
about the knowledge and vision of all. The Blessed One explained it to
me. I like the reply and I’m satisfied. I asked the Blessed One about the
purity of the four castes<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>The Blessed
One explained it to me. I like the reply and I’m satisfied. I asked the
Blessed One about the superior gods. The Blessed One explained it to me.
I like the reply and I’m satisfied. I asked the Blessed One, about the
Great Brahmaas The Blessed One explained it to me. I like the reply and
I’m satisfied. Whatever questions I asked, the Blessed One explained them,
now I’m happy and satisfied. Venerable sir, now we go. There is much work
to do.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Great king
if you think it is fit, do so.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Then king
Pasenadi of Kosala got up from his seat, worshipped,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>circumambulated
the Blessed One and went away.

<p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]><o:p></o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal">.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Notes<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>1.
May the sisters Soma and Sakula be with pleasantness.’sukhiniyo hontu Mahaaraaja
Somaa ca bhaagini Sakulaaca bhagini’ When the Blessed One says sukhiniyo,
he means may they be healthy, this is not bodily health, which cannot be
obtained. What can be gained is the mental health. That is the mind free
from greed, hate and delusion. Pleasantness is the mind free from greed,
hate and delusion.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>2Knows the
worlds.’lokaviduu’ The world to any person is the data collected through
six spheres of mental contact. That collected data is different from one
person to the other, according to the additions made of greed, non-greed,
hate, non-hate, delusion and non-delusion. So each person differs from
the other. The Blessed One declared this fact and so he is lokaviduu.

<p class="MsoNormal">3.Becomes wise endowed with the noble one’s wisdom
to penetrate and see the rising and falling for the rightful destruction
of unpleasantness. ‘Pa~n~nvaa hoti udayatthagaaminiyaa pa~n~naaya samannaagato
ariyaaya nibbedhikaaya sammaadukkhakkhaya gaaminiyaa.’ To attain enlightenment
one has to penetrate and see the rising and falling nature of the five
holding masses. The five holding masses are the holding masses of matter,
feelings, perceptions, determinations and consciousness. It is through
these five that one holds on to a self and a view. So we have to see wisely
that they are impermanent. We have to see that whatever is impermanent
is not pleasant-‘dukkha’ and whatever is impermanent and unpleasant should
not be taken as mine. It is in this manner we push away ‘sakkayadi,t,thi’
the view about a self. In plain words it is thoughts about a self.<span
