<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun:

heard thus.At one time the Blessed One was living with the Saakyas in a
hamlet of the Saakyas named Medhalumpa. At that time king Pasenadi of Kosala,
had come to Nangaraka for some purpose, and he said to Diigha Kaaraayana,
‘Friend Kaaraayana, yoke good carriages we like to tour the parklands and
see the good soil.’ He agreed, and yoking suitable carriages, informed
king Pasenadi of Kosala.’Great king the carriages are yoked, it is time
to do what is fit.’ King Pasenadi of Kosala ascended a suitable carriage
and left Nangaraka in great splendour, going as far as the carriages could
go, descended from the carriages and entered the parklands. King Pasenadi
of Kosala walking about in the parklands, saw the roots of trees that were
pleasing, noiseless, away from humans, and suitable for seclusion and thought
of the Blessed One. He thought, on account of these roots of trees that
are pleasing, noiseless, away from humans and suitable for seclusion, I
should associate the Blessed One, perfect and rightfully enlightened. Then
King Pasenadi of Kosala addressed Digha Kaaraayana. ‘Friend Kaaraayana,
these roots of trees, that are pleasing, noiseless, away from humans, and
suitable for seclusion recall to me the Blessed One, perfect and rightfully
enlightened. Friend where does he abide now?’ ‘Great king, there is a hamlet
of the Sakyas, Medalumpa, the Blessed One, perfect and rightfully enlightened
lives there now.’ ‘Friend, Kaaraayana, how far is Medalumpa from Nangaraka
?’ ‘It isn’t very far about one and twenty miles from here.’ ‘Could we
reach there by night fall?’ ‘Then friend, Kaaraayana yoke suitable carriages,
I want to see that Blessed One, perfect, rightfully enlightened.’ Then
Diigha Kaaraayana agreeing yoked suitable carriages and informed the king.
‘Great king, the carriages are yoked, it is the time to do the suitable.’
Then king Pasenadi of Kosala, ascended the well yoked carriages and left
Nangaraka, to reach the hamlet Medalumpa of the Sakyas. When it was dark,
they reached Medalumpa. Going in the carriage as far as it could reach,
descending from the carriages came to the monastery grounds. At that time
many bhikkhus, were doing the walking meditation in the open and king Pasenadi
of Kosala approached them and asked. ‘Venerable sirs, where is the Blessed
One at this time, we like to see that Blessed One perfect and rightfully
enlightened?’ ‘Great king the door of the living house is closed, approach
it quietly, without intruding, step up to the terrace cough and knock on
the cross bar. The Blessed One will open the door. At that point the king
of Kosala, gave the sword and crown to Diigha Kaaraayana, and it occurred
to him, the king wishes to be alone. I should not proceed. King Pasenadi
of Kosala quietly approached the closed door of the living house without
intruding stepped on the terrace, coughed and knocked on the cross bar.
The Blessed One opened the door. King Pasenadi of Kosala, entered the living
house, placed his head at the feet of the Blessed One kissed the feet and
stroked them with his hands. Then he announced, venerable sir, I’m king
pasenadi of Kosala.’</span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Great king,
seeing what good, do you show highest reverence and make these friendly
offerings to this body?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, I have come to the main drift of the Blessed One’s Teaching. The Blessed
One is rightfully enlightened, the Teaching of the Blessed One is well
proclaimed. The disciples of the Blessed One have come to the right path.
Venerable sir, I see recluses and Brahmins, who lead the holy life for
ten, twenty, thirty or even forty years. Later I see them having bathed
and decorated themselves, with hair and beard shortened, partaking of sensual
pleasures, well provided. Here I see bhikkhus leading the holy life complete
and pure until the end of life, until they breathe their last breath. Venerable
sir, on account of this too I have come to the main drift of the Blessed
One’s Teaching. The Blessed One is rightfully enlightened, the Teaching
of the Blessed One is well proclaimed. The disciples of the Blessed One
have come to the right path.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Again venerable
sir, kings dispute with kings, warriors with warriors, Brahmins with Brahmins,
householders with householders, the mother with the son, the son with the
mother, the father with the son, the son with the father, brother with
brother, brother with sister, the sister with the brother, friend with
friend. Here, venerable sir, I see bhikkhus united and friendly, without
a dispute, mixing like milk and water, abide seeing each other with friendly
eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>Venerable sir, on account of
this too I have come to the main drift of the Blessed One’s Teaching. The
Blessed One is rightfully enlightened, the Teaching of the Blessed One
is well proclaimed. The disciples of the Blessed One have come to the right
path.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Again, venerable
sir, I wander from one monastery to the other, from one park to the other,
there I see certain recluses and Brahmins wasted, unpleasant, discoloured
with jaundice, with protruding veins, not attractive to the eyes. Then
it occurs to me. Indeed these venerable ones live the holy life not attached
to it. Or they have some undisclosed demerit. On account of which they
are wasting, unpleasant, discoloured with jaundice, are with protruded
veins, not attractive to the eyes.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>I approach
them and ask. ‘Why are the venerable ones wasting, unpleasant, discoloured
with jaundice, with protruding veins, not attractive to the eyes’ They
tell me. ‘Great king,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>we suffer from
jaundice.’ ‘Venerable sir, here we see bhikkhus, pleased, in good spirits,
pleasant to the sight with satisfied mental faculties, leading a carefree
life, without fear and ready to help, abiding with the mind of a wild animal.
Venerable sir, it occurs to me<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Indeed
these venerable ones, see some gradual distinction in themselves, that
they are pleased, in good spirits, pleasant to the sight, are with satisfied
mental faculties, leading a carefree life, without fear are ready to help,
abide with minds like those of wild animals. Venerable sir, on account
of this too I have come to the main drift of the Blessed One’s Teaching.
The Blessed One is rightfully enlightened, the Teaching of the Blessed
One is well proclaimed. The disciples of the Blessed One have come to the
right path.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Again venerable
sir, as a head anointed warrior king, I have power in my kingdom, to kill,
destroy or banish, those who need to be killed, destroyed or banished.
Yet when I sit for jurisdiction, I find it impossible to do justice as
various interruptions come to me. I even tell them, good sirs, do not interrupt
me, wait till I finish, my talk. Venerable sir, when the Blessed One is
teaching various hundreds of bhikkhus, even the sound of a sneeze or a
cough is not heard. Once it happened, that the Blessed One was teaching
a gathering of some hundreds. Then a certain disciple of the Blessed One
coughed and another disciple of the Blessed One nudged him on the knee,
to say, make no noise, the Blessed One is teaching. Venerable sir, then
it occurred to me, it is amazing the gathering is well behaved, without,
stick or weapon. Venerable sir, I have not seen a disciplined gathering
like this anywhere else. On account of this too I have come to the main
drift of the Blessed One’s Teaching. The Blessed One is rightfully enlightened,
the Teaching of the Blessed One is well proclaimed. The disciples of the
Blessed One have come to the right path.<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Again venerable
sir, I see a certain wise, clever, warrior disputant, going about thinking
to pull down wise ones and their views. Hearing that the recluse Gotama
has visited a certain village or hamlet, they concoct a question. We will
approach the recluse Gotama and ask this question when he explains it,
we will draw him to a dispute. When they approach, the Blessed One advises
them, incites them and makes their hearts light. Advised, incited and made
the hearts light, they do not even ask the question, how is a dispute to
come up? They become all round disciples of the Blessed One On account
of this too I have come to the main drift of the Blessed One’s Teaching.
The Blessed One is rightfully enlightened, the Teaching of the Blessed
One is well proclaimed. The disciples of the Blessed One have come to the
right path.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Again venerable
sir, I see a certain wise, clever Brahmin, ….re… a householder,…re…. a<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>recluse,
disputant going about thinking to pull down wise ones and their views.
Hearing that the recluse Gotama has visited a certain village or hamlet,
they concoct a question. We will approach the recluse Gotama and ask this
question. He will explain it thus and we will draw him to a dispute. When
they approach, the Blessed One advises them, incites them and makes their
hearts light. Advised, incited and made the hearts light, they do not even
ask the question, how is a dispute to come up? They become all round disciples
of the Blessed One On account of this too I have come to the main drift
of the Blessed One’s Teaching. The Blessed One is rightfully enlightened,
the Teaching of the Blessed One is well proclaimed. The disciples of the
Blessed One have come to the right path.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Again, venerable
sir, the master builders,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Isiidatta
and Puraana, were brought up by me, given life by me, raised<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>to
that state by me. Yet these two do not show that same reverence to me,
that they give to the Blessed One. Venerable sir, in the past, when the
army was marching against me, it happened that I went to a difficult dwelling
of the master builders Isiidatta and Puraana, they advised me late into
the night. They told<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>that they sleep,
placing their heads towards where the Blessed One was, and their feet towards
me. Then it occurred to me. It is wonderful and surprising, the master
builders Isiidatta and puraana were brought up by me, given life by me,
raised to that state by me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Yet these
two do not show that same reverence to me, that they give to the Blessed
One. Indeed these venerable ones see some gradual distinction in themselves.
On account of this too I have come to the main drift of the Blessed One’s
Teaching. The Blessed One is rightfully enlightened, the Teaching of the
Blessed One is well proclaimed. The disciples of the Blessed One have come
to the right path.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Again, venerable
sir, I’m a warrior, a man of Kosala eighty years old, the Blessed One too
is a warrior, of Kosala and is eighty years of age. On account of this,
too I show highest reverence and make these friendly offerings to this
body. Venerable sir, now we go, there is much work to be done.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Great king
do, as you think fit.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>King Pasenadi
of Kosala got up from his seat, worshipped and circumambulated the Blessed
One and went away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Soon after
king Pasenadi of Kosala had gone, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus.
‘Bhikkhus, king<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Pasenadi of Kosala
made monuments of the Teaching. Bhikkhus, learn those monuments to the
Teaching. They are conducive to good and belong to the fundamentals of
the holy life.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>The Blessed
One said that and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed
One.
