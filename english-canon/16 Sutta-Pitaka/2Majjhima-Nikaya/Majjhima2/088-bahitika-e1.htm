<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>I heard thus.At
one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika
in Jeta’s grove in Saavatthi. Venerable Aananda put on robes in the morning,
taking bowl and robes entered Saavatthi for alms. After the alms round,
when the meal was over, approached the palace of Migaara’s mother to spend
the day. At that time king Pasenadi of Kosala having ascended the elephant
Ekapundariika was going through Saavatthi during the day. King Pasenadi
of Kosala saw venerable Aananda coming in the distance and asked the chief
minister Siriwadda, ‘Siriwadda, is that venerable Aananda?’ ‘Great king,
it is venerable Aananda.’ Then king Pasenadi of Kosala called a certain
man, and said. ‘Good man approach venerable Aananda, worship him for my
sake, with your head at his feet and tell him. Venerable sir, King Pasenadi
of Kosala worships you with his head at your feet and said. If venerable
Aananda has no urgent work to do, would he wait a moment for king Pasenadi
of Kosala, out of compassion.’ He agreed, approached venerable Aananda,
worshipped, stood on a side and said, ’venerable sir king Pasenadi of Kosala
worships you, with his head at your feet and says. If venerable Aananda
has no urgent work, could he wait a moment for king Pasenadi of Kosala
out of compassion.’ Venerable Aananda agreed silently. The king went on
the elephant’s back as far as he could go and descending from the elephant,
approached venerable Aananda on foot. He worshipped venerable Aananda and
stood on a side and said. ‘If venerable Aananda has no urgent work, could
he approach the bank of river Acirawathie, out of compassion. Venerable
Aananda accepted it silently, approached the bank of river Acirawathie
and sat on the prepared seat. The king went on the elephant’s back as far
as he could go, descending from the elephant, approached venerable Aananda
on foot, worshipped him and stood on a side. Then he said. ‘May venerable
Aananda, sit on the elephant rug.’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Useless,
great king, I’m seated, you sit on it.’ King Pasenadi of Kosala sat on
the prepared seat and said. ‘Venerable Aananda, does the Blessed One practise
bodily behaviour that is hostile to recluses Brahmins and the wise?’ ‘No,
great king the Blessed One does not practise any bodily behaviour that
is hostile to recluses, brahmins and the wise.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Sir Aananda,
does the Blessed One, practise verbal behaviour that is hostile to recluses,
brahmins and the wise? Does the Blessed One practise mental behaviour that
is hostile to recluses, brahmins and the wise?’ ‘No, great king the Blessed
One does not practise any verbal… any mental behaviour that is hostile
to recluses and brahmins and the wise.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Wonderful
and surprising venerable sir, this question we could not ask and get an<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>explained,
now venerable Aananda has explained it to me. Venerable sir, fools who
do not think and fathom their words, praise or blame others. I do not believe
those words.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Sir Aananda,
what kind of bodily behaviour is hostile to recluses, Brahmins and the
wise?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Great king
bodily behaviour that is demerit.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, what kind of bodily behaviour is demerit?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Great king,
bodily behaviour that is faulty”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, what kind of bodily behaviour is faulty?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Great king,

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, what kind of bodily behaviour has unpleasant results?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Great king,
bodily behaviour that is hurtful to oneself, hurtful to others and hurtful
to both and on account of which demerit increases and merit decreases.
Such bodily behaviour is hurtful to oneself, to others and to both.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Sir Aananda,

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Sir Aananda,

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Wonderful
and surprising, I’m pleased with these words of venerable Aananda. I’m
so pleased, I would offer my jewel of an elephant to venerable Aananda,
or my jewel of a horse, or even a splendid village, we know that they are
not suitable. This warm cloth was sent by king<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Ajaatasattu,
of Magadha. in a case of reeds, it’s sixteen measures by length and eight
measures by breadth, it is suitable, may venerable Aananda accept it, out
of compassion.’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Useless, great
king, my three robes are complete.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Venerable
sir, we both see, this river Acirawathie falling in torrents from the mountains
and flowing flooding the banks. In like manner, venerable Aananda will
make his three robes with this warm cloth. Will distribute the earlier
three robes among the co-associates in the holy life, I think. May venerable
Aananda accept this warm cloth.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Venerable Aananda
accepted the warm cloth. Then king Pasenadi of Kosala said to venerable
Aananda. ‘Venerable sir, we have to go now, there’s much work to be done.’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>‘Great king
do, as you think fit.’ King Pasenadi<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>of<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Kosala
got up from his seat, worshipped and circumambulated venerable Aananda
and went away. Soon after the king had gone, venerable Aananda approached
and worshipped the Blessed One, and sat on a side. Venerable Aananda informed
the Blessed One all the conversation that occurred between the king and
himself and offered the warm cloth to the Blessed One.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then the Blessed
One addressed the bhikkhus. ‘Bhikkhus, it is rare and great gain for king
Pasenadi of Kosala, that he approaches and associates venerable Aananda.’
The bhikkhus were pleased with the words of the Blessed One.<span style="mso-spacerun:
