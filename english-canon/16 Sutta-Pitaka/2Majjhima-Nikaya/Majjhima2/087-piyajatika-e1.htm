<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:6.0pt">I heard thus.At one time
the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika, in Jeta’s
grove in Saavatthi. At that time the only dearly loved son of a certain
householder had died. On account of that, the householder would neither
go for his work nor eat any food. He would go to the cemetery again and
again crying. ‘Where is my only son?’ Eventually he approached the Blessed
One, worshipped and sat on a side. The Blessed One said to him. “Householder,
your mental faculties are not established, they have undergone a change”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>“Venerable
sir, how could my mental faculties not undergo a change? My dearly loved
only son died and on account of that I neither go for work, nor take any
food. I go to the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>cemetery again
and again crying ‘where is my only son?’”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>“Householder,
it is so, dear ones bring grief, lament, unpleasantness and distress, the
little pleasure gained is insignificant ” That householder not pleased
with those words, and not accepting them, got up and went away.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>At that time,
some people were gambling close to the place where the Blessed One was
living. He approached them and said. “Sirs, I approached the Blessed One,
worshipped him and sat on a side, then the Blessed One said. Householder,
your mental faculties are not established, they have undergone a change.
Then I said, venerable sir, how could my mental faculties not undergo a
change. My dearly loved only son died and on account of that I neither
go for work nor eat any food. I go to the cemetery again and again crying
‘where is my only son? Then the Blessed One said, householder, it is so,
dear ones bring grief, lament, unpleasantness and distress, the little
pleasure gained is insignificant. Sirs, how could dear ones bring grief,
lament, unpleasantness and distress and how could the pleasure be insignificant?
Sirs, dear ones bring much pleasantness and the displeasure is insignificant.
I was not pleased with those words, got up and came a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>words.
‘Dear ones bring grief, lament, unpleasantness and distress the little
pleasure gained is insignificant.’ Whatever the reply the Blessed One gives,
learn it thoroughly and inform me. Thus Gone Ones do not talk words that
are not truthful. The Brahmin, agreeing to do so, approached the Blessed
One, exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side and said. “Good Gotama,
queen Mallika worships the feet of the Blessed One and asks, is the Blessed
One with few ailments, few troubles and a light living. Further queen Mallika
asks whether the Blessed One has said these words. ‘Dear ones bring grief,
lament, unpleasantness and distress and the pleasure gained out of them
is insignificant?”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>“Brahmin, that
is so, dear ones bring grief, lament, unpleasantness and distress, whatever
the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>pleasure gained, is insignificant.”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>“Brahmin, it
should be known in this manner how dear ones bring grief, lament, unpleasantness
and distress and how the pleasure gained out of them is insignificant.
In the past in this same Saavatthi there was a woman, whose mother died.
On account of that she was deranged in mind and ran from one street to
the other and from one junction to the next and asked. ‘Did anyone see
my mother?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Again it should
be known thus. In the past in this same Saavatthi there was a woman, whose
father died…. re….whose<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>brother died,
… re …<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>whose sister died, … re …
whose son died, ..re… whose daughter died, whose husband died On account
of that she was deranged in mind<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>and
ran from one street to the other, from one junction to the next and asked.
Did anyone see my husband?

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Brahmin, it
should be known, in this manner too how dear ones bring grief, lament,
unpleasantness and distress and how the pleasure gained out of them is
insignificant. In the past in this same Saavatthi, there was a man whose
mother died. On account of that he was deranged in mind and ran from one
street to the other, from one junction to the next and asked. ‘Did anyone
see my mother?’

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Again it should
be known thus. In the past in this same Saavatthi there was a man, whose
father died…. re….whose brother died, … re …<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>whose
sister died, … re … whose son died, ..re… whose daughter died, whose wife
died On account of that he was deranged in mind<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>and
ran from one street to the other, from one junction to the next and asked.
Did anyone see my wife?

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Brahmin, it
should be known in this manner too how dear ones bring grief, lament, unpleasantness
and distress and how the pleasure gained out of them is insignificant.
In the past in this same Saavatthi a certain woman went to live with her
husband. Her relations wanted to break her away from her husband and give
her to another man. She told her husband, dear one, my relations want to
take me away from you and give me to another man, I do not like it. He
split that woman in two and killed her. Saying we will meet after death.
It should be known in this manner, how dear ones bring grief, lament, unpleasantness
and distress and how the pleasure gained out of them is insignificant.”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>The Brahmin
Naalijangha pleased and appreciating the words of the Blessed One getting
up from his seat, approached queen Mallika, and informed her all the conversation
that was exchanged. Queen Mallika approached king Pasenadi of Kosala and
asked him.’Great king is princess Vajiri dear to you?”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>“Indeed, Mallika
princess Vajiri is dear to me.”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>“If princess
Vajiri dies, would grief, lament, unpleasantness and distress arise to
you?”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>“Mallika if
princess Vajiri dies, even my life would be in danger, why should not grief,
lament, unpleasantness and distress arise to me?”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>“Great king,
it was on account of this that it was said dear ones bring grief, lament,
unpleasantness and distress and the pleasure here is insignificant. Great
king, is the warrior Waasabha dear to you?”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>“Indeed Mallika,
the warrior Waasabha is dear to me.”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>“If the warrior
Waasabha dies, would grief, lament, unpleasantness and distress arise to
you?”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>“Mallika, if
the warrior Waasabha dies, even my life would be in danger, why should
not grief, lament, unpleasantness and distress arise to me.”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>“Great king,
it was on account of this that the Blessed One who knows and sees, is perfect
and rightfully enlightened has said. Dear ones bring grief, lament, unpleasantness
and distress and the pleasure gained from them is insignificant. Great
king, is the general Widuudabha dear to you?”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>“Indeed, Mallika,
the general Widuudabha is dear to me.”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>“If the general
Widuudabha dies, would grief, lament, unpleasantness and distress arise
to you?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>“Mallika, if
the general Waduudabha dies, even my life would be in danger, why should
not grief, lament, unpleasantness and distress arise to me?”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>“Great king,
it was on account of this that the Blessed One who knows and sees, is perfect
and rightfully enlightened has said. Dear ones bring grief, lament, unpleasantness
and distress and the pleasure gained from them is insignificant. Great
king, am I dear to you?”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>“Indeed, Mallika,
you are dear to me.”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>“If I die would
grief, lament, unpleasantness and distress arise to you?”<span 
style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>“Mallika, if
you die, even my life would be in danger, why should not grief, lament,
unpleasantness and distress arise to me?.”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>“Great king,
it was on account of this that the Blessed One who knows and sees and is
perfect and rightfully enlightened has said. Dear ones bring grief, lament,
unpleasantness and distress and the pleasure gained from them is insignificant.
Great king, is Kashmire and Kosala dear to you?”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>“Indeed, Mallika
they are dear to me. On account of the two countries Kashmire and Kosala
I partake Kashmire scents, garlands and anointments.”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>“If you lose
Kashmire and Kosala, would grief, lament, unpleasantness and distress arise
to you?”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>“Mallika, if
I lose Kashmire and Kosala, even my life would be in danger, why should
not grief, lament, unpleasantness and distress arise to me?.”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>“Great king,
it was on account of this that the Blessed One who knows and sees is perfect
and rightfully enlightened has said. Dear ones bring grief, lament, unpleasantness
and distress and the pleasure gained from them is insignificant.”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>“Mallika it
is wonderful and surprising, the Blessed One penetratingly sees. Mallika,
pardon me.”

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>King Pasenadi
of Kosala got up from his seat arranged the shawl on his shoulder clasping
hands towards the direction in which the Blessed One was, uttered a solemn
utterance three times.’I worship that Blessed One, perfect and rightfully
enlightened.’”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>
