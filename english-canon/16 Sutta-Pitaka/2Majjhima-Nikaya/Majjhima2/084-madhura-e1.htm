heard thus.At one time venerable Mahaakaccaayana was living in Madhura
in the Gunda forest. King Avantiputta of Madhura heard that venerable Mahaakaccaayana
was living in Madhura in the Gunda forest, and fame of venerable Mahaakaccaayana
had spread, he is wise, learned, a clever preacher, a perfected one since
long, and it is good to see such perfect ones. Then king Avantiputta of
Madhura getting ready good conveyances went to see venerable Mahaakaccaayana
in all royal splendour. Going as far as the conveyances could carry them
went on foot and approached venerable Mahaakaccaayana. Approaching and
exchanging friendly greetings with venerable Mahaakaccaaya, sat on a side
and said thus: Venerable sir, brahmins say, brahmins are from the chief
clan, the most superior in appearance, all other clans are inferior, its
the brahmins born from the mouth of Brahma, his hereditary sons, that purify,
non-brahmins do not purify. What has good Kaccaayana to say about this?&nbsp;</span>
