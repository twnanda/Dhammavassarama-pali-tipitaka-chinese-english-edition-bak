<p class="MsoBodyText">I heard thus.At one time the Blessed One was living
in the monastery offered by anathapindika in Jeta’s grove in Savatthi.
Then the Blessed One put on robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes
entered Savatthi for alms. Venerable Rahula too putting on robes, taking
bowl and robes followed the Blessed One close behind. Then the Blessed
One looked back and addressed venerable Rahula: ‘Rahula, whatever matter,
in the past, in the future or at present, internal or external, coarse
or fine, un exalted or exalted, far or near, all matter is not mine, that
is not me, that is not my self. This has to be seen as it really is with
right wisdom’. ‘Blessed One, is it only matter?’ ‘Rahula, feelings also,
perceptions also, determinations and consciousness too.’

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Then it occurred
to venerable Rahula, advised by the Blessed One. What is the use of going
for alms today? Venerable Rahula, stopped short, and sat with legs crossed
at the root of a certain tree. The body straight and mindfulness established
in front. Venerable Sariputta saw venerable Rahula seated cross, legged
at the root of a certain tree, the body straight and mindfulness established
in front of him. He said,‘Rahula, develop in breathing and out breathing.
When, in- and out breathing is developed and made much, it brings good
results and benefits. In the evening, venerable Rahula got up from his
seclusion, approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said,
‘Venerable sir developed and made much in which ways do in-breaths and
out-breaths bring good results and benefits?*1)<span style="mso-spacerun:
