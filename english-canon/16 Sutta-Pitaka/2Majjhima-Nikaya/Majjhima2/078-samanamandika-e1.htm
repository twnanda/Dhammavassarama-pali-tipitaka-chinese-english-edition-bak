<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>I
heard thus.At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by
Anathapindika in Jet’s grove in Savatthi. At that time the wandering ascetic
Uggaahamaana<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Samanamandikaaputta
with the opportunitst view was living in the single halled Mallika monastery
on the bank of Tindukaa, with a large gathering of wandering ascetics about
three hundred. It happened that the carpenter Pancakanga arrived in Savatthi
during the day to see the Blessed One and it occurred to him. It is too
early to see the Blessed One, he is abiding in his seclusion. He also thought
of approaching the bhikkhus who give advice for the development of the
mind, and thought. They should be in seclusion and then thought of approaching
the wandering ascetic Uggaahamaana Samanamandikaaputta in the single halled
Mallika monastery and approached him At the time the wandering ascetic
Uggaahamaana Samanamandikaaputta was seated with a large gathering of wandering
ascetics&nbsp;</span><span 
lang=EN-AU>making much noise. They were engaged
in various kinds of childish talk, about kings, robbers, chief ministers,
the army, fears, fights, eatables, drinks, dress, beds, flowers scents,
relations, conveyances, villages, hamlets, towns and states, women heros,
gossip at the corner of the street and at the well. Gossip about those
dead and gone, various other talk about the origin of the world and the
ocean and the things that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>happened<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>and
did not happen. The wandering ascetic Uggaahamaana Samanamandikaaputta
saw the carpenter Pancakanga coming in the distance and silenced the gathering.
‘Good sirs, make less noise, do not make such a noise. A lay disciple of
the recluse Gotama the carpenter Pancanga is coming. He is one of the lay
disciples of the recluse Gotama, of those who live in Savatthi and wear
white clothes These venerable ones make little noise, are trained to make
little noise and they train others to make little noise. Thinking this
gathering makes little noise may have thought to approach.’ Then those
wandering ascetics became silent. The carpenter Pancakanga approached the
wandering ascetic Uggahamana Samanamandikaputta, exchanged friendly greetings
with the wandering ascetic Uggaahamaana Samanamandikaaputta and sat on
a side. When he was seated the wandering ascetic Uggaahamaana Samanamandikaaputta
said thus to him. ’Carpenter, I declare the person endowed with four things
as the most skilled, perfect recluse, endowed with highest merit. What
are four? Here carpenter, he does no evil by body, no evil by words, does
not think evil thoughts and does not lead an evil livelihood. A man endowed
with these four things, I declare as the most skilled, perfect recluse
endowed with the highest merit.’&nbsp;</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>The
carpenter Pancakanga was not pleased nor did condemn those words of the
wandering ascetic Uggahamana Samanamandikaputta. He got up thinking I will
know the meaning of these words from the Blessed One approached the Blessed
One, worshipped and sat on a side. Then he related the conversation, that
occurred between himself and the wandering ascetic Uggaahamaana Samanamandikaaputta.
The Blessed One said to the carpenter Pancakanga. ‘Carpenter, if this is
so, a toddler who could not stand or sit quickly would be the most skilled,
perfect recluse endowed with the highest merit. Carpenter, a toddler who
could not stand and sit quickly, would not have an idea of a body, so how
could he do evil with the body, other than move his limbs. Carpenter, a
toddler who could not stand and sit quickly, would not have even words,
so how could there be evil done with words, other than crying. Carpenter,
a toddler who could not stand and sit quickly, would not have even thoughts,
so how could he think evil thoughts, other than expressing displeasure.
Carpenter, a toddler who could not stand and sit quickly, would not have
even a livelihood, so how could there be evil livelihood to him, other
than drinking the mother’s milk. Carpenter, according to the words of the
wandering ascetic Uggaahamaana Samanamandikaputta, a toddler who could
not stand and sit quickly would be the most skilled, perfect recluse endowed
with the highest merit.&nbsp;</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Carpenter,
I do not declare the most skilled perfect recluse endowed with the highest
merit with these four things, as the wandering ascetic Uggaahamaana Samanamandikaputta
says. I say these are the perfect qualities of a toddler who could not
stand and sit quickly. What are the four? Carpenter, he does no evil action
by body, utters no evil words, does not think evil thoughts, and has no
evil livelihood. I do not declare the most skilled perfect recluse endowed
with the highest merit with these four qualities. They are the perfect
qualities of a toddler who could not stand and sit quickly.</span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Carpenter,
with these ten things I declare the most skilled perfect recluse endowed
with the highest merit. I say, he should know, these observances lead to
demerit. These observances of demerit start here. The observances of demerit
cease here without a remainder. Carpenter, I say, this is the method of
ceasing observances of demerit. He should know these observances of merit
start here and cease here without a remainder. I say, this is the method
of ceasing observances of merit. Carpenter, I say, he should know, that
these are evil thoughts that start here. He should know, these evil thoughts
cease here without a remainder. Carpenter, I say, this is the method of
ceasing evil thoughts. He should know these are thoughts of merit, and
they start here. These thoughts of merit cease here without a remainder.
Carpenter, I say, this is the method for the cessation of thoughts of merit,
he should know this too.&nbsp;</span><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Carpenter,
what are observances of demerit? Bodily actions of demerit, verbal actions
of demerit and a livelihood of demerit are the observances of demerit.
Carpenter, where do these observances of demerit rise? They arise in the
mind, is the reply What is that mind? Minds are various and different.
The mind is with greed, anger and delusion. Thus observances of demerit
start there. Carpenter, where do these observances of demerit cease completely?
Their cessation is thus. The bhikkhu gives up bodily actions of demerit
and develops bodily actions of merit. Gives up verbal actions of demerit
and develops verbal actions of merit. Gives up mental actions of demerit
and develops mental actions of merit. Giving up wrong livelihood develops
the right livelihood. Here, these observances of demerit cease completely.
Carpenter, fallen to what method, is the ceasing of observances of demerit?
Carpenter, the bhikkhu arouses interest and effort to push the mind forward
with endeavour, for the not arising of not arisen demerit. The bhikkhu
arouses interest and effort, to push the mind forward with endeavour, to
dispel arisen demerit. The bhikkhu arouses interest and effort to push
the mind forward with endeavour for arousing not arisen merit. The bhikkhu
arouses interest and effort, to push the mind forward with endeavour for
the undeluded stabilisation, growth, development and completion of arisen
merit. Carpenter, this is the method, of ceasing observances of demerit.&nbsp;</span><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang=EN-AU>. Carpenter, what are observances,
for merit?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>Bodily actions of merit,
verbal actions of merit and a pure livelihood are observances for merit.
Where do these observances of merit rise? They arise in the mind, is the
reply What is that mind? Minds are various and different. The mind without
greed, the mind without anger and the mind without delusion, are the varied
and different minds. Thus observances of merit start here. Carpenter, where
do these observances of merit cease completely? Their cessation too is
told. Carpenter, the bhikkhu becomes virtuous, not only that, but knows
as it really is, how there is to him the release of the mind and the release
through wisdom through the cessation of the observances of merit*1) Here,
these observances of merit completely cease. Carpenter, fallen to what
method, is the ceasing of observances of merit? Carpenter, the bhikkhu
arouses interest and effort to push the mind forward with endeavour for
not arousing of not arisen demerit. The bhikkhu arouses interest and effort
to push the mind forward with endeavour to dispel arisen demerit. The bhikkhu
arouses interest and effort to push the mind forward with endeavour to
arouse, not arisen merit. The bhikkhu arouses interest and effort, to push
the mind forward with endeavour for undeluded stabilisation, growth, development
and completion of arisen merit. Carpenter, the bhikkhu falls to this method,

what are thoughts of demerit? Sensual thoughts, angry thoughts and hurting
thoughts, are thoughts of demerit. Where do these thoughts of demerit arise?
They arise from perceptions, is the reply. What are perceptions? Perceptions
are also various and different. They are sensual perceptions, angry perceptions,
and hurting perceptions. Thoughts of demerit arise from these perceptions.
Carpenter, where do these thoughts of demerit cease completely? Their cessation
too is told. Here, the bhikkhu secluded from sensual thoughts ---abides
in the first jhana. Here, all thoughts of demerit cease completely. Carpenter,
fallen to what method is the ceasing of thoughts of demerit? Here, carpenter,

–re—attained to abide in the second jhana. Here all thoughts of merit cease

the bhikkhu falls to this method for the cessation of thoughts of merit.
Carpenter, endowed with what ten things do I declare the most skilled perfect
recluse with the highest merit.? Here, carpenter, the bhikkhu is endowed
with, right understanding of one gone beyond the training. He is endowed
with right thoughts right speech, right actions, right livelihood, right
endeavour, right mindfulness and right concentration of one gone beyond
the training. He is endowed with right knowledge and right release of one
gone beyond the training. Endowed with these ten things, I declare the
