<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>IT is not easy to
put ourselves in the mental position suitable for appreciating the kind of idea
that underlies the argument in this Suttanta. The social view against which it,
is directed lies too remote from the social views universally admitted now in
the West. But in the sixth century B. C. in the Eastern valley of the Ganges,
the question as to the ethics of teachers and teaching was one of wide interest
and of great importance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>Saïkara quotes with
approval the rules of the priestly law books which lay down that the ears of a
Sådra who hears the Veda (including of course the theosophy of the Upanishads)
are to be filled with molten lead and lac. His tongue is to be split if he
recites it ; his body is to be cut through if he preserves it in his memory<a

God himself has bestowed the exclusive right of teaching upon the hereditary
priests<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[2]<![endif]></span></span></a>;
who indeed claim to be, each of them, great divinities<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn3' href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[3]<![endif]></span></span></a>,
even to the gods<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn4' href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:

would be a danger to social order if they taught women, or any males not
twice-born, or any twice-born males who would not share their views as to the
ethics of teaching, and as to the privileges and prerogatives of the priest as
teacher.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>These passages are
much later than the Piñakas. But they, and the many others like them, give a
fair idea of the spirit animating one section at least of the priests, and of a
trend of opinion that doubtless had its supporters also in Piñaka times. When
Asoka thought he had brought about such a chance in public opinion that those
who had been very gods upon the earth had come to be gods no longer, he was
very far from thinking right. That is a battle that is not so easily won. But
the expression of his belief is sufficient to show that the striking idea he
thought he had killed was far older than our existing text of Manu.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>On the other hand
one may be permitted to doubt whether the gentle measures approved by Saïkara
for keeping people in that state of life into which their evil deeds in a
previous birth had brought them, were ever actually, in practice, carried</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>out. The Piñakas
themselves give ample proof that, in spite of the priests, there were not a few
base-born people who succeeded, in that time at least, not only in getting
taught, but in becoming teachers. And this was not the case only among the
despised Buddhists. The numerous passages collected by Dr. Muir in his article
in the 'Indian Antiquary' for 1877 show that the priestly literature itself-the
law books and the epics-has preserved evidence of the lax way in which the
strict rules as to exclusion from teaching or being taught were really carried
out. And that is especially the case, according to the priestly tradition, in
ancient times, as old, or older, than the rise of Buddhism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>The fact doubtless
is that, though there were bigots among the Brahmans, and though they were
strong enough to establish, before the time to which our present Sutta refers,
rules as to restriction of teaching which no one in priestly circles could
venture formally to dispute-yet that there was also always a strong party in
India, to which many of the more liberal minded of the Brahmans themselves
belonged, who looked with sympathy on relaxations of these rules. The general
practice must have been that, the hereditary priests kept the magic of the
sacrifice, and the emoluments and privileges that went with the knowledge of
it, in their own hands. Even the higher teaching of the mysteries of theosophy
was to be handed down only from priest-father to son, or from priestly teacher
to pupil. But there were many exceptions. The numerous Brahmans who were not
priests were wont, of course, to emphasise the importance rather of birth than
of knowledge. We have enough evidence, even in the pre-Buddhistic Upanishads,
of others, besides the priests, being teachers of the higher wisdom. The four
powerful kings, and the still important free clans, though they gave support to
the Brahmans, gave also equal support to other teachers-just as, in later
times, Hindu and Buddhist sovereigns are found supporting Buddhists and Hindus
alike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>Our knowledge of
Indian views of life having been hitherto derived almost exclusively from the
priestly books, scholars have inevitably tended to attach too great a degree of
importance to what the priests describe as the proper state of things. As a
matter of fact it never really prevailed. Even now the Brahmans, or those who
in the census returns claim to be such, form only about five per cent. of the
population. And of these the vast majority are not priests at all ; they are
engaged in all sorts of worldly occupations<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn5'

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>must not judge
India at any time, much less in the time of the Buddha, through the yellow
spectacles of Saïkara, or even of the priestly compilers of Manu. As M. Barth
said, already in 1873, in protesting against Lassen for falling into this
mistake<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn6' href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[6]<![endif]></span></span></a>:
'We must distinguish, more than Lassen does, between different epochs, as well
as between the pretensions of a caste and the real state of things. The
Brahmans had not yet monopolised the intellectual life. Certain testimonies of
the epics, applicable to this very period, as also the very nature of the Vedic
books, show for example that there existed alongside of them an entire profane
literature of great extent .which was certainly, at first, in other hands.
Their teaching (that of the Brahmans), it is true, appears to have been in a
high degree esoteric and exclusive.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>The position taken
up by the Buddha on this question, as appears from our present Sutta (and such
other passages as M. I, 513-.524; A. I, 277; III, 123-127 ; M. P. S. II, 32 =
A. III, 69 = V, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>56 </i>= Mil. 144), is
that every one should be allowed to learn ; that every one, having certain
abilities, should be allowed to teach ; and that, if he does teach, he should
teach all and to all; keeping nothing back, shutting no one out. But no man
should take upon himself to teach others unless and until he have first taught
himself, and have also acquired the faculty of imparting to others the truth he
has gained himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>There can, I
think, be very little doubt but that the great teacher is here voicing the
opinion of many others of liberal views, his contemporaries and predecessors.
He lays no claim, either in our Sutta or elsewhere, to any special peculiarity
in this respect. It. is taken for granted that the arguments put into his mouth
in our Sutta will appeal to the Brahman to whom they are addressed. And they
are based not on any distinctively Buddhist doctrine but on general ethical
principles accepted, or rather acceptable, by all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>[224] 1. Thus have
I heard. The Exalted One, when once passing on a tour through the Kosala
districts with a great multitude of the members of the Order, with about five
hundred Bhikshus, arrived at Sàlavatikà (a village surrounded by a row of Sàla
trees). Now at that time Lohicca<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn7' href="#_ftn7"
name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[7]<![endif]></span></span></a>
the Brahman was established at Sàlavatikà, a spot teeming with life, with much
grassland and woodland and corn, on a royal domain granted him by King Pasenadi
of Kosala, as a royal gift, with power over it as if he were the king<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn8' href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>2.<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>         </span>Now at that time Lohicca the Brahman
was thinking of harbouring, the following wicked view: 'Suppose that a Samaõa
or a Bràhmaõa have reached up to some good state (of mind), then he should tell
no one else about it. For what can one man do for another ? To tell others
would be like the man who, having broken through an old bond, should entangle
himself in a new one. Like that, I say, is this (desire to declare to others);

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>Now Lohicca the
Brahman heard the news: 'They say that the Samaõa Gotama, of the sons of the
Sàkyas, as, who went out from the Sàkya clan to adopt the religious life, has
now arrived, with a great company of the brethren of his Order, on his tour
through the Kosala districts, at Sàlavatikà. Now regarding that venerable
Gotama, such is the high reputation that has been noised abroad:-that Exalted
One is an Arahat, fully awakened, abounding, in wisdom and goodness, happy,
with knowledge of the worlds, unsurpassed as a guide to mortals willing to be
led, a teacher for. gods and men, an exalted one, a Buddha. He, by himself,
thoroughly knows, and sees as it were face to face, this universe-including the
worlds above of the gods, the Brahmàs, and the Màras; and the world below with
its Samaõas and Bràhmaõas, its princes and peoples-and having, known it, he
makes his knowledge known to others. The truth, lovely in its origin, lovely in
its progress, lovely in its consummation, doth he proclaim both in the spirit
and in the letter. The higher life doth he make known in all its fullness, and
in all its purity. And good is it to pay visits to Arahats like that.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>[225] 4. Then
Lohicca the Brahman said to Bhesikà' the barber: 'Come now, good Bhesikà, go
where the Samaõa Gotama is staying, and, on your arrival, ask in my name as to
whether his sickness and indisposition has abated, as to his health and vigour
and condition of ease; and speak thus: &quot; May the venerable Gotama, and
with him the brethren of the Order, accept the to-morrow's meal from Lohicca
the Brahman.&quot;'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>5.<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>         </span>'Very well, Sir,' said Bhesikà the
barber, acquiescing in the word of Lohicca the Brahman, and did so even as he

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>6.<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>[226] 7. Then
Lohicca the Brahman, when the night had passed, made ready at his, own dwelling

went, Bhesikà the barber walked, step by step, behind the Exalted One. And he
said to him:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>'The following
wicked opinion has occurred to Lohicca the Brahman: &quot;Suppose that a Samaõa
