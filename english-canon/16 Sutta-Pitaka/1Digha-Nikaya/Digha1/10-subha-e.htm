<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>As this Sutta is
almost word for word the same as the Sàma¤¤a-phala, the question arises why it
was considered advisable to include it in our collection as a separate Sutta.
The chief difference is that the states of mind enumerated in the Sàma¤¤a-phala
as fruits of the life of a recluse are here divided under the three heads of
Sãla, Samàdhi, and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Pa¤¤à </i>(Conduct,
Concentration, and Intelligence).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>Samàdhi has not
yet been found in any Indian book older than the Piñakas. And, as in them, it
is used exclusively of a mental state, never in a concrete sense, its meaning
is not easy to fix exactly. It is not the same as Jhàna, which is a
pre-Buddhistic term applied to four special forms of meditation, culminating in
self-induced ecstasy. Samàdhi on the other hand is a constant habit, or
faculty, of mind. The oldest Sanskrit text in which. it occurs is the Maitri
Upanishad; and it probably has there the same meaning as it has in the Piñakas.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>In our present
Sutta-and the principal reason for its existence as a separate Sutta is that it
points out just this-it is pointed out that Samàdhi includes, it is true, the
Jhànas, but also other, and very different things. These are the habit of
guarding the doors of one's senses; constant mindfulness and self-possession;
and the faculty of being content with little. From the negative point of view
it is said to include emancipation from ill-temper, inertness of mind and body,
worry, and perplexity; from the positive point of view it is said to include a
constant state of joy and peace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>Wilson's Sanskrit
Dictionary (1819) gives the meaning 'devout meditation'; and the rendering
'meditation' has been used for it in subsequent works in English by Western
scholars. It is quite clear that this would be a very inadequate and misleading
rendering in our Sutta. But exigencies of space preclude the discussion here,
either of the meaning, or of the very interesting and suggestive history of the
word in India.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>How far was the
word (literally 'allocation') invented or adopted by the Buddhists, or by their
immediate spiritual forerunners, to express 'self-concentration' with implied
co-ordination, harmonisation, of the mental faculties-an idea they wanted, in
the statement of their most essential and ethical doctrines, to be used in
preference to the more limited, more physical, notion of Jhàna? (It is Samàdhi,
and not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>,</i>Jhàna<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> </i>that we find in the Four Truths, in the Noble Path, and in the
thirty-seven constituent parts of Arahatship.) How far, through the constant
association of the two ideas, did the larger, as ethical feeling died away,
become swallowed up by the smaller? At what date, in what circles, and under
what reservations, did the word Samàdhi come to mean nothing more than
meditation? The history of the two ideas, Samàdhi and Jhàna, has constant
analogies with the history of the two similarly related ideas of Tàpasa and
Bhikshu, and, like it, is of the first importance in following the evolution of
philosophical and religious thought in India.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>[204]. I. 1. Thus
have I heard. The venerable ânanda was once staying at Sàvatthi in the Jeta
Wood, in Anàtha Piõóika's pleasaunce, shortly after the Exalted One had died
away<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></span></span></a>.
Now at that time the young Brahman Subha, the son of the man of Tudi<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[2]<![endif]></span></span></a>,
was dwelling at Sàvatthi on some business or other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>2. Now Subha, the
young Brahman, addressed a certain young man, and said:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>'Come now, young
man. Go to the Samaõa ânanda, and ask in my name as to whether his sickness and
indisposition has abated, as to his health and vigour and condition of ease;
and say: &quot;'Twere well if the venerable ânanda would be so kind as to pay a
visit to Subha, the young Brahman, the son of the man of Tudi.&quot;'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>3. 'Very well, Sir,'
said that young man in reply. And he went to the place where the venerable
ânanda was staying, and exchanged with him the greetings and compliments of
politeness and courtesy, and took his seat apart. And, so seated, he delivered
to the venerable ânanda the message with which he had been charged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>[205] 4. On
hearing that message, the venerable ânanda said to him:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>'It is not just
now, young man, convenient, for I have just taken medicine. But perhaps I may
be able to go on the morrow, if so be that conditions and opportunity seem
fit.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>Then that young
man arose from his seat, and went to Subha, and told him all, and added:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>'So, Sir, the
matter has been so far accomplished that perhaps the venerable ânanda may be
able to come on the morrow, if so be that conditions and opportunity seem fit.'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>5. And the
venerable ânanda, when the night had passed away, dressed himself early in the
morning, and went, in his robes and carrying his bowl, with a Bhikkhu from the
Cetiya country as his attendant, to Subha's house, and took his seat on the mat
spread out for him. And Subha, the young Brahman, the son of the man of Tudi,
came there where he sat, and exchanged with the venerable ânanda the greetings
and compliments of politeness and courtesy, and took his seat on one side. And,
so seated, he said to the venerable ânanda:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>[206] 'You, Sir,
have waited long on the venerable Gotama, constantly near him, continually in
his company. You, Sir, will know what were the things the venerable Gotama was
wont to praise; to which he used to incite the folk, in which he established
them, and made them firm. What were they, ânanda?'</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN-GB>6. 'Three are the
bodies of doctrine, O Brahman, which the Exalted One was wont to praise; to
which he used to incite the folk, in which he established them, and made them
firm. And what are the three ? The so noble body of doctrine regarding right
conduct, the so noble body of doctrine regarding self-concentration, the so
