<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The last chapter is a description of the benefits in
developing understanding. That means the benefits of meditation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: I want to note something. Most people when they
come want to know what they can get out of meditation. In <st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region>
this should be the first chapter instead of the last chapter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Right. We have to wait until the end. ëDeveloping
understandingí means the practice of vipassan» meditation. What benefit can you
get? Removal of the various defilements, experience of the taste of cessation,
ability to attain the attainment of cessation, and achievement of worthiness to
receive gifts and so on. There are four benefits to be derived from the
practice of meditation, especially the practice of vipassan» meditation. I say
ëespecially vipassan»í because it says developing understanding or wisdom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 2 ìIt should be understood that one of the
benefits of the mundane development of understanding is the removal of the
various defilements beginning with mistaken view of individuality. This starts
with the Delimitation of Mentality-Materiality.î When you get to that stage of
knowledge, when you see mind and matter clearly and nothing else, then you
abandon the mistaken view of individuality, the mistaken view that there is a
person, there is an individual and so on. ìThen one of the<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>benefits of the supramundane development of
understanding is the removal, at the Path moment, of the various defilements
beginning with the fetters.î That is at the Path moment, you abandon
defilements or fetters all together. This is the benefit of supramundane
development. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>ìWith dreadful

this very life</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>A man himself
may know.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So you will get this benefit in this very life. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 3<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>Next is
the experience of the taste of the Noble Fruit. Now after Path follows Fruition
immediately. ìNot only the removal of the various defilements but also the
experience of the taste of the Noble Fruit is a benefit of the development of
understanding. For it is the fruitions of Stream Entry, etc., - the Fruits of
Asceticism -, that are called the ëNoble Fruití.î The Noble Fruits or the Four
Fruitions are called ëthe Fruits of Asceticismí or ëthe Fruits of Monkhoodí. In
P»ƒi they are called ës»ma““a-phalaí. There is a discourse by that name,
ëS»ma““aphala Suttaí, in the D gha Nik»ya (The Collection of Long Discourses).
In that discourse the Buddha explained the benefits of being a monk, something
like worldly benefits. For example, he does not have to worry about his
livelihood and so on. Step by step Buddha explained the benefits of the life of
a monk until the Arahantship or until the person becomes an Arahant. So
reaching the Fruition state is called ëthe benefit of being a monk or an
asceticí. ìIts taste is experienced in two ways, that is to say, in its
occurrence in the cognitive series of the Path, and in its occurrence in the
attainment of Fruition.î At the moment of enlightenment there is one thought
process. So in that thought process there is the Path consciousness for one
moment. And that Path consciousness moment is followed by two or three moments
of Fruition. So ëin the cognitive series of the Pathí means in that first
moment of enlightenment. After that the cognitive series or thought process
stops and the consciousness falls into life-continuum. Then later on, maybe on
the same day or a few days later, he wants to experience that Fruition again.
Then he practices vipassan» meditation. At that time only the Fruition
consciousness arises, not Path consciousness although he practices vipassan»
meditation. That is because his aim is not to reach Path, but his aim is for
Fruition consciousness to arise in him for some period of time. So the taste of
Fruition is twofold - first at the moment of enlightenment, later on when he
enters into Fruition attainment. When he enters into Fruition attainment, then
this Fruition consciousness arises in his mind, say millions of times without
any interruption. So he is like in jh»na state. When a person is in jh»na, he
doesnít know any other thing. The functions of the five senses are temporarily
suspended when he is in the jh»na state. So the same thing happens when a
person is in a state of Fruition attainment. There are two kinds of
experiencing of the taste. One is during the Path thought process and the other
is at the attainment of Fruition later on. It is similar to entering into a
jh»na state. ìOf these, only its occurrence in the cognitive series of the Path
has been shown.î That means it has been shown before in the previous chapter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now the author in paragraph 4 is going to describe the
Fruition attainment in detail. ìFurthermore, when people say that the Fruit is
the mere abandoning of fettersî - this is the opinion of some teachers. The
Venerable Buddhaghosa did not approve. So the people say that Fruit is the mere
abandoning of the fetters and nothing more than that. The following Sutta can
be cited in order to convince them that they are wrong. So this is something
like a debate or a controversy. According to these teachers, there is no
separate this that is Fruit. Just the mere abandoning of fetters is called
ëFruití. So for them there is no separate Fruit. Then the author of the Visuddhi
Magga brings out the Text from the Pa‘isambhid»magga to show that they are
wrong. ìHow is it that understanding of the tranquilizing <u>of</u> effort is
knowledge of Fruit?î Here ëeffortí means Path. So it should not be
ëtranquilizing <u>of</u> effortí, but ëtranquilizing by effort is knowledge of
Fruití. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAt the moment of the Stream-Entry Path, Right View in the
sense of seeing emerges from wrong view, and it emerges from the defilements
and from the aggregates that occur consequent upon that [wrong view], and externally
it emerges from all signs. Right View arises because of the tranquilizing of
that effort.î Here ëRight Viewí means ëFruitioní. So Fruition arises because of
the tranquilizing of that effort. That is because at the moment of Fruition the
effort of Path has already ceased. ìThis is the Fruit of the Path and this
should be given in detail.î If you want to read about it in detail, you have to
go to the Pa‘isambhid»magga. ìAlso such passages as ëThe four Paths and the
four fruits - these states have a measureless object (A ëmeasureless objectí
means Nibb»na.)í and ëAn exalted state is a condition, as proximity condition,
for a measureless stateí.î The first is taken from the Dhammasa~ga”  and the
second is taken from the Pa‘‘h»na. So this is a digression. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 5 ìHowever, in order to show how it occurs in the
attainment of Fruition there is the following set of questions.î According to
these questions he will explain: (1) What is Fruition attainment?, (2) Who
attains it?, (3) Who do not attain it?, (4) Why do they attain it?, (5) How
does its attainment come about?, (6) How is it made to last?, (7) How does the
emergence from it come about?, (8) What is next to Fruition?, (9) What is
Fruition next to?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first question is: ìWhat is Fruition attainment? <u>It
is absorption in the cessation in</u> <u>which the Noble Fruition consists</u>.î
I donít think this translation is correct. Actually what it means is: ìIt is
absorption of the Noble Fruit in the cessation.î ëCessationí here means
Nibb»na. So it is the absorption of the Noble Fruition in Nibb»na. That means
Noble Fruition is arising again and again taking Nibb»na as object. ìIt is
absorption of the Noble Fruition in the cessation.î We may put the word
ëNibb»naí after cessation in parenthesis. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìWho attains it? Who do not attain it? No ordinary men
attain it. Why? Because it is beyond their reach. But all Noble Ones attain it.
Why? Because it is within their reach. But those who have reached a higher Path
do not attain a lower Fruition (That means they do not enter the lower Fruition
attainment.) because the state of each successive Person is more tranquilized
than the one below.î Actually it means when you reach the second stage, the
first stage disappears. It is something like that. ëThey are tranquilizedí really
means ëdisappearanceí. When you get to the Second Path, then there is no First
Path. ìAnd those who have only reached a lower Path do not attain a higher
Fruition because it is beyond their reach.î So if you have attained only the
First Magga, you can go into First Fruition, but not the second stage of
Fruition, or the third stage of Fruition and so on. Then when you have reached
the second stage, you can enter into the second stage of Fruition. You cannot
enter into the first stage of Fruition because it has already gone and the
third and the fourth you have not yet attained. So you can enter into the
second stage only. If you have reached the third stage, you can enter into the
third stage of Fruition only, not the first nor the second because they have disappeared,
and not the fourth because you have not yet attained it. ìBut each one attains
his appropriate Fruition.î We may say that Sot»panna can attain only first
Fruition attainment, the Once-Returner can only attain the second Fruition
attainment and so on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 7 ìBut there are some who say that the Stream
Enterer and Once-Returner do not attain it, and that only the two above them
attain it.î This is the opinion of some teachers. ìThe reason they give is that
only these two show achievement in concentration.î It is said that only when a
person who has reached the third stage of enlightenment has he really achieved
concentration. That means his concentration is really strong only when he
reaches the third stage and also the fourth stage. So the Stream Enterer and
Once-Returner donít<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>have much
achievement in concentration. These teachers think that these two cannot enter
into Fruition attainment. ìBut that is no reason, since even the ordinary man
attains such mundane concentration as is within his reach.î So if even
puthujjanas can reach the jh»nas and enter into jh»na attainment, why are the
Stream Enterer and Once-Returner not able to go into their respective
attainments? Therefore, their reason is no reason at all. ìBut why argue here
over what is and what is not a reason? Is it not said in the Text as follows?î
And then he brings out the Text. We will skip over it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 8 ìWhy do they attain it? For the purpose of
abiding in bliss here and now.î That means in modern terms to enjoy themselves
or to enjoy the bliss of Nibb»na here and now. ìFor just as a king experiences
royal bliss and a deity experiences divine bliss, so too the Noble Ones think
ëWe shall experience the noble supramundane bliss, and after deciding on the
duration, they attain the attainment of Fruition whenever they choose.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In footnote 3<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>ìAlthough they are resultant statesî - now during the Fruition
attainment, the Fruition consciousness alone arises, perhaps millions of times.
Fruition consciousness is resultant consciousness. Right? With regard to other
resultant consciousness do we have choice? We have no choice. It is the fruit
of past kamma. So we have to just accept it. We see something good and there is
eye consciousness. Right? We cannot avoid that. We have to accept it. But with
regard to this resultant consciousness, Fruition consciousness, there is a
choice. ìAlthough they are resultant states, nevertheless the states of
Fruition attainment occur in the Noble Person only when he chooses since they
do not arise without the preliminary work <u>and do so only</u> <u>when they
are given predominance.</u>î So when they want to go into Fruition attainment,
they have to practice. They have to do something. They have to practice
vipassan» meditation again. They do not arise without preliminary work. That is
why they are said to be ëwith predominanceí. That means they belong to javanas.
The Fruition consciousness has the javana function. And then there is what is
called ëpredominance (adhipati)í. When they arise, they have this predominance
in them. What are the four adhipati? (1) desire (chanda), (2) consciousness
(citta), (3) effort (viriya), (4) investigation (vima—s» or pa““»). You can
find these four in The Manual of Abhidhamma. So I think the last part of the
translation is not so correct<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>- ë<u>they
do so</u> <u>only when they are given predominance</u>.í Actually when the
Fruition consciousness arises, one of these four has the function of
predominance. One will always have predominance. And they arise only with
preliminary work. That is why, it is said in the Visuddhi Magga ëwhenever they
chooseí. It is different from other types of resultant consciousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 9 ìHow does its attainment come about? How is it
made to last?î That means how does it last? ìHow does the emergence from it
come about? In the first place its attainment comes about for two reasons: with
not bringing to mind any object other than Nibb»na, and with bringing Nibb»na
to mind only, according as it is said.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 10 ìNow the process of attaining it is as follows.î
It describes how to enter into Fruition attainment. ìA Noble Disciple who seeks
the attainment of Fruition should go into solitary retreat.î That means he
should go to a place where he has seclusion. ìHe should see formations with
insight according to rise and fall and so on.î That means he must practice
vipassan» meditation and see the rise and fall of mental and physical phenomena
and then he must go up stage by stage of vipassan» knowledge. ìWhen that
insight has progressed [as far as conformity], then comes change-of-lineage
knowledge with formations as its object. And immediately next to it
consciousness becomes absorbed in cessation with the attainment of Fruition.
And here it is only Fruition, not Path, that arises even in a Trainer, because
his tendency is to Fruition attainment.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is footnote 4. Right? ìThen comes change-of-lineage
knowledge with formations as its object.î Change-of-lineage is what? The P»ƒi
is gotrabhu. In the Path process change-of-lineage takes what as object? It
takes Nibb»na as object. But in this thought process it takes formations as
object, not Nibb»na. ìWhy does change-of-lineage not have Nibb»na as its object
here as it does when it precedes the Path?î In the Path thought process
change-of-lineage takes Nibb»na as object. Why does it not take it here?
ìBecause states belonging to Fruition are not associated with an outlet [as in
the case of the Path].î ëOutletí means ëgetting you out of sa—s»ra or out of
mental and physical phenomena. Because it is the function of Magga, let us say
to take you out of sa—s»ra, but it is not the function of Fruition. ìFor this
is said ëWhat states are an outlet? The four unincluded Pathsí.î So only the
four Paths are called ëoutletí. The P»ƒi word is ëniyy»naí. That means something
that takes something out of something. ìHere it is only Fruition, not Path,
that arises even in a Trainer.î ëTrainerí means a person who is enlightened,
but who is not yet an Arahant. So such persons are called Trainersí. So even in
a Trainer, Path consciousness does not arise because his tendency or his
intention is to Fruition attainment. His aim is not to get Path consciousness
but to get into Fruition attainment. That is why Path does not arise although
he practices vipassan» meditation and he progresses through the successive
stages of vipassan» knowledges, maybe even in one sitting. Path consciousness
does not arise because his intention is not to get Path consciousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 11 ìBut there are those who say that when Stream
Enterer embarks on insight, thinking ëI shall attain Fruition attainmentí, he
becomes a Once-Returner, and a Once-Returner a Non-Returner.î<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>That is what they say. ìThey should be told
ëIn that case a Non-Returner becomes an Arahant, and an Arahant a Pacceka
Buddha, and a Pacceka Buddha a Buddha.î That is not the case. ìFor that reason,
and because it is contradicted as well by the Text quoted above, none of that
should be accepted. Only this should be accepted: Fruition itself, not Path,
arises also in the Trainer. And if the Path he has arrived at had first jh»na
his Fruition will have the first jh»na too when it arrives. If the Path has the
second, so will the Fruition. And so with the other jh»nas.î Now when a person
gets Path consciousness, his first consciousness may resemble first jh»na, or
second, or third, or fourth, or fifth jh»na depending upon how many jh»na
factors arise with that Path consciousness. If the Path consciousness is or
belongs to first jh»na, then the Fruition consciousness must also be first
jh»na fruition consciousness because it must resemble its source or its cause.
If when he gets the Path, that Path has only four jh»na factors, then his
Fruition consciousness in this thought process must also have four jh»na
factors. So it belongs to the second jh»na and so on. This is how attainment
comes about and how a person enters into Fruition attainment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 12 ìIt is made to last in three ways, because of
the words ëFriends, there are three conditions for the persistence of the
signless mind deliverance: they are the non-bringing to mind of all signs, the
bringing to mind of the signless element, and the prior volitioní. Herein, the
prior volition is the predetermining of the time before attaining; for it is by
determining it thus ëI shall emerge at such a timeí that it lasts until that
time comes. This is how it is made to last.î<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>So here ëthe prior volitioní means predetermining ëI will be in this
attainment for one hour or two hoursí and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 13 ìEmergence from it comes in two ways, because
of the words ëFriend, there are two conditions for the emergence from the
signless mind deliverance: they are the bringing to mind of all signs, and the
non-bringing to mind of the signless elementí. Herein, ëof all signsí means the
sign of materiality, sign of feeling, perception, formations, and
consciousness. Of course, a man does not bring all those to mind at once (Not
all these five become the object of his mind at once.), but this is said in
order to include all. So the emergence from it should be understood in this
way: emergence from the attainment of Fruition comes about in him when he
brings to mind whatever is the object of the life-continuum.î Now a person is
said to emerge from the attainment when life-continuum arises. So long as he is
in attainment, then only the Fruition consciousness arises time after time
after time. When at the predetermined time the life-continuum arises, he is
said to have emerged from the attainment of Fruition. That is when he brings up
the object of the life-continuum. You know that the life-continuum takes kamma,
or the sign of kamma, or the sign of destiny as object. When life-continuum
arises, the object also changes. During the Fruition attainment the object is
Nibb»na. But when the life-continuum arises, the object is one of the three
(kamma, or sign of kamma, or sign of destiny). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 14 ìWhat is next to Fruition? What is Fruition
next to?î You have to understand the thought processes in order to understand
this paragraph. ìIn the first case either Fruition itself is next to Fruition
or the life-continuum is next to it.î Now during the Fruition attainment
thought process, one Fruition moment follows another Fruition moment and so on.
Fruition itself is next to Fruition. One Fruition follows after another. ìOr
the life-continuum is next to it.î That means at the end of Fruition attainment
there is life-continuum. So life-continuum follows it. ìBut there is Fruition
that is (a) next to the Path (following the Path immediately in the Path
thought process), (b) there is that next to Fruition (That is in the Path
thought process the second Fruition and the third Fruition.), [c]<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>there is that next to change-of-lineage (That
is in the Fruition attainment thought process.), and (d) there is that next to
the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception.î That is during
the attainment of cessation which will be described later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHerein, (a) it is next to the Path in the cognitive series
of the Path. (That means the Path thought process.) (b) Each one that is
subsequent<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>to a previous one is next to
Fruition. [c] Each first one in the attainments of Fruition is next to
change-of-lineage. And Conformity should be understood here as
ëChange-of-lineageí (Here actually conformity is called ëchange-of-lineageí.);
for this is said in the Pa‘‘h»na.î So he cites the Pa‘‘h»na as proof. ìIn the
Arahant conformity is a condition, as proximity condition, for Fruition
attainment. In Trainers, conformity is a condition, as proximity condition, for
Fruition attainment.î So in the Pa‘‘h»na the word ëconformityí is used, not
ëchange-of-lineageí. What he describes here as change-of-lineage is actually to
be taken as conformity. ì (d) The Fruition by means of which there is emergence
from the attainment of cessation is next to the base consisting of neither
perception nor non-perception.î That is during and after the cessation
attainment. We will come to that later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 15 ìHerein, all except the Fruition that arises in
the cognitive series of the Path occur as Fruition attainment.î Except those
that arise in the Path thought process, the other Fruition consciousnesses
occur as Fruition attainment described here. ìSo whether it arises in the
cognitive series of the Path or in Fruition attainment, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the benefit of vipassan» meditation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next we come to the attainment of cessation. ëAttainment of
cessationí means attainment of cessation of citta, cetasika and r|pa
born-of-citta. That is called ëattainment of cessationí. In this attainment the
activities of mind are temporarily suspended. When a person is in that
attainment, there is no mental activity whatsoever. He may be like a statue for
as long as he wishes, say for one day, two days, at most for human beings for
seven days. During that period he may be like a statue. And then there are
questions and answers. Letís go to the answers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 18 ìWhat is the attainment of cessation? It is the
non-occurrence of consciousness and its concomitants owing to their progressive
cessation.î When a person enters into this cessation, he has to go into the
jh»nas one by one. He enters into first jh»na, and then enters into the second
jh»na and so on. When he enters into the second jh»na, initial application
(vitakka) ceases. And when he enters into the third jh»na, sustained
application (vic»ra) ceases and so on. So they cease gradually until he reaches
the fourth ar|p»vacara (formless) jh»na. ëAttainment of cessationí means
cessation of consciousness and its concomitants. ëIts concomitantsí means
cetasikas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìWho attains it? Who do not attain it? No ordinary men, no
Stream Enterers or Once-Returners, and no Non-Returners and Arahants who are
bare insight workers, attain it.î That means beings who practice only vipassan»
and become Non-Returners and Arahants cannot enter into this cessation
attainment. Even if you are a Non-Returner or an Arahant, if you do not have
jh»nas, then you cannot enter into this attainment. Those who practice jh»na
first, then practice vipassan», and attain to the third stage and fourth stage
of enlightenment can enter into this attainment. ìBut both Non-Returners and
those cankers destroyed (That means Arahants.) who are obtainers of the eight
attainments (That means four r|p»vacara jh»nas and four ar|p»vacara jh»nas.
They are called ëeight attainmentsí or we may say ënine attainmentsí if we take
the r|p»vacara to be five.), attain itî and so on. ìAnd these qualifications
are not to be found together in any persons other than Non-Returners and those
whose cankers are destroyed, who are obtainers of the eight attainments.î The
qualifications mentioned in the quotation are not to be found together in any
persons other than the Non-Returners and Arahants. ìThat is why only they and
no others attain it.î Non-Returners and Arahants who have eight jh»nas or nine
jh»nas can go into this attainment of cessation. ìBut which are the two
powers?î Actually they are digressions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We will go to paragraph 27. ìMastery: there are five kinds
of masteries.î They are also described in chapter 4. So I want you to note down
chapter 4, paragraph 131 and following. You may go back and read about them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìWhere do they attain it?î In which realms can they attain
or can they go into this attainment? That is in paragraph 29. ìIn the
five-constituent becoming.î Do you know the five-constituent becoming? That
means where there are five aggregates. Human beings, devas, and r|p»vacara
brahm»s have the five-constituent becoming. But the ar|p»vacara brahm»s do not
have the five-constituent becoming; they have only four. ìIn the
five-constituent becoming. Why? Because of the necessity for the succession of
[all] the attainments.î In order to get into this attainment of cessation, one
must begin with the first r|p»vacara jh»na and then the second, third, fourth,
and so on. But if you are reborn as a formless brahm», you do not have the four
r|p»vacara jh»nas. So you cannot enter r|p»vacara jh»nas in the formless state.
If you are reborn as a formless brahm», you cannot enter into the r|p»vacara
first, second, third, fourth and fifth jh»nas. ìBut in the four-constituent
becoming (That is ar|p»vacara.) there is no arising<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>of the first jh»na, etc., and so it is not
possible to attain it there. But some say that is because of the lack of a physical
basis [for the mind there].î So some people say that because there is no
physical basis for the mind there, that cessation attainment cannot be entered
into. Actually not only the physical basis but all material properties are not
found in the ar|p»vacara.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 30 ìWhy do they attain it? Being wearied by the
occurrence and dissolution of formations, they attain it thinking ëLet us dwell
in bliss by being without consciousness here and now and reaching the cessation
that is Nibb»na.î Now they are wearied by the arising and disappearing of
formations. So they want to dwell in bliss by being without consciousness here
and now and reaching the cessation that is Nibb»na. It is also a way of kind of
enjoying themselves, that is to be without mental activities for some time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 31 ìHow does its attainment come about? It comes
about in one who performs the preparatory tasks by striving with serenity and
insight and causes the cessation of [consciousness belonging to] the base
consisting of neither perception nor non-perception. One who strives with
serenity alone reaches the base consisting of neither perception nor
non-perception and remains there, while one who strives with insight alone
reaches attainment of Fruition and remains there. But it is one who strives
with both, and after performing the preparatory tasks, causes the cessation of
[consciousness belonging to] the base consisting of neither perception nor
non-perception, who attains it. This is in brief.î So you must practice samatha
and vipassan» coupled when you want to get into this attainment of cessation.
If you do only samatha, you cannot get into this cessation attainment. And also
if you do only vipassan», you cannot get into this attainment. So first you
enter into first jh»na. Then you emerge from this first jh»na and practice
vipassan» on the first jh»na. So it goes in pairs, samatha and vipassan»,
samatha and vipassan». </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 32 ìBut the detail is this. When a bhikkhu who
desires to attain cessation has finished all that has to do with his meal and
has washed his hands and feet well, he sits down on a well-prepared seat in a
secluded place. Having folded his legs crosswise, set his body erect,
established mindfulness in front of him (That means towards the meditation object.),
he attains the first jh»na, and on emerging he sees the formations in it with
insight as impermanent, painful, not self.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThis insight is threefold insight that discerns formations,
insight for the attainment of Fruition, and insight for the attainment of the
cessation.î There are three kinds of vipassan». ìHerein, insight that discerns
formations, whether sluggish or keen, is the proximate cause only for Path.î
You practice vipassan» and it is the cause only for the Path. ìInsight for the
attainment of Fruition (That means insight practice for the attainment of
Fruition.), which is only valid when keen, is similar to that for the
development of Path. Insight for the attainment of cessation is only valid when
it is not over-sluggish and not over-keen.î If it is over-sluggish, it cannot
cause the cessation of the neither perception nor non-perception. And if it is
over-keen, if it is too strong, too keen, then it will go on to the Fruition
and not to the cessation attainment. If it is too keen, it sees dangers and
others in the formations. So it leaps into Fruition attainment, not cessation
attainment. So here the insight should not be over-sluggish or over-keen.
ìTherefore he sees those formations with insight that is not over-sluggish and
not over-keen.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 34 ìAfter that, he attains the second jh»na, and
on emerging he sees formations with insight in like manner. After that he
attains the third jh»naî and so on. ìAfter that he attains the base consisting
of boundless consciousness (That means the second ar|p»vacara jh»na.), and on
emerging he sees formations in it in like manner. Likewise he attains the base
consisting of nothingness (third ar|p»vacara jh»na). On emerging he does the
fourfold preparatory task.î So after emerging from the third ar|p»vacara jh»na,
he must stop entering into jh»na. He must do these four preparatory tasks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now the translator got it wrong here with regard to
non-damage to <u>otherís</u> property. It is non-damage to the property that is
not attached to him. So the first one is important. I checked it with the other
translation made by a Burmese author. He was also wrong. What it really means
is non-damage to the property that is not physically attached to him. Maybe
they are misled by the word ënanabhaddhaí in P»ƒi. It is the opposite of the
P»ƒi word ëekabhaddhaí. That means ëattached toí, ëattached to oneí, or
ëconnected to oneí. ëNanabhaddhaí means the opposite of that. So the real
meaning is the property that is not physically attached to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 35 this ìrefers to ëwhat the bhikkhu has about
him that is not his personal property: (No. That is wrong.) a robe and bowl, or
a bed and chair, or a living room, or any other kind of requisite kept by him
but the property of various others.î No. It is other kinds of requisites that
lie unattached to him. When he enters into this attainment, he has his robe.
Right? He has worn his robe. If he has a bowl and puts it to his left, he may
have that bowl too. They are connected or attached to his body. He may have
some other sets of robes or some other things, not with him or not attached
physically to him. For those things he must do something so that they do not
get damaged by fire, by water, by bites of rats and so on. So the first is
non-damage to the property that is not attached to him, his property, not the
property of others. If it were possible for othersí property to be like
insured, we need such a monk, only one such monk. ìIt should be resolved that
such property will not be damaged, will not be destroyed by fire, water, wind,
thieves, rats, and so on. Here is the form of the resolve: (he makes the
resolution in this way.) ëDuring these seven days let this and this not be
burned by fire; let it not be swept off by water; let it not be spoilt by wind;
let it not be stolen by thieves; let it not be devoured by rats, and so oní.
When he has resolved in this way, they are not in danger these seven days.î
That means for as long as he is in the attainment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 36 ìIf he does not resolve in this way, they may
be destroyed by fire, etc., as in the case of the Elder Mah»-N»ga. He went for
alms into the village where his mother, a lay follower, lived. She gave him
rice gruel and seated him in the sitting hall. The Elder sat down and attained
cessation.î So he entered into the cessation attainment in the village, in the
sitting hall. ìwhile he was sitting there, the hall caught fire. The other
bhikkhus each picked up their seats and fled. The villagers gathered together,
and seeing the Elder, they said ëWhat a lazy monk!í The fire burned the grass
thatch, the bamboos and timbers, and it encircled the Elder.î The fire did not
burn the Elder, but everything else was burned. ìPeople brought water and put
it out. They removed the ashes, did the repairs (that means like making the
ground smooth again and so on.), scattered flowers, and then stood respectfully
waiting. The Elder emerged at the time he had determined. Seeing them, he said
ëI am discovered!í (Because he didnít want the people to know that he was an
An»g»mi or an Arahant.) And he rose up into the air and went to Piya~gu
Island.î So ìThis is no-damage to property (not ë<u>othersí propertyí</u>) that
is not attached to him.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 37 ìThere is no special resolving to be done for
what is <u>his own personal</u> <u>property</u>.î That means what is attached
to his body, not ëhis own personal propertyí. For the robe he is wearing, he
doesnít have to bother. He doesnít have to worry about that. He doesnít have to
make a resolution for the safety of the robe he is wearing. It will be taken care
of. There is no special resolving to be done for what is attached to his body
such as the inner and outer robes or the seat he is sitting on. ìHe protects
all that by means of the attainment itself, like those of the Venerable
Sa“j va. And this is said ëThere was success by intervention of concentration
in the Venerable Sa“j va. There was success by intervention of concentration in
the Venerable S»riputta.î So you go back to chapter 12, paragraph 30. When you
see that, you will know. Venerable Sa“j va was in attainment and people didnít
know that he was a monk and so the people put fuel and wood on him and then set
it on fire. But he was not burned because he was in attainment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 38 ìThe Communityís (or Sa~ghaís) waiting is the
Communityís (Sa~ghaís) expecting; the meaning is: till this bhikkhu comes there
is no carrying out of acts of the Community (Sa~gha).î When the Sa~gha does
what we call ëthe acts of Sa~ghaí, then all monks must assemble to a place. If
one monk is absent or away from the assembled monks, then that act becomes
invalid. So he must come to where the other monks are assembled. But when he is
in attainment, he may not be able to come. So he must do something about that.
ìAnd here it is not the actual Communityís waiting that is the preparatory
task, but the adverting to the waiting.î That means thinking of the waiting.
ìSo it should be adverted to in this way ëWhile I am sitting for seven days in
the attainment of cessation, if the Community wants to enact a resolution,
etc., I shall emerge before any bhikkhu comes to summon meí.î So if the Sa~gha
expects him, then he will emerge from the attainment. He must resolve like
that. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 39 ìBut if he does not do so, then perhaps the
Community assembles, and not seeing him, it is asked ëWhere is the bhikkhu?î
and so on. If he does not make the resolution before entering the attainment,
then he will not emerge from it automatically. But he will emerge from it when
a monk goes to him and just says to him ëYou are expected by the Sa~ghaí. Then
he will surely emerge from the attainment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 40 Then the third one is the Masterís summons.
ëMasterí means the Buddha. If Buddha wants him to come, then he must go to the
Buddha and so on. It is similar to Communityís waiting. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 42 The fourth one is the limit of life duration.
So he must think of how long he will live before he enters into this
attainment. At least he must know that he is going to live more than seven
days. Otherwise there will be a dilemma. That is because during the attainment
death cannot come. So he must surely make this preparatory task although the
others can be ignored. So he should attain only after adverting to that. ìFor
it is said that while it may be permissible to omit adverting to others (the other
three), this however must be adverted to.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìNow when he has thus the base consisting of nothingness and
done this preparatory task, he then attains the base consisting of neither
perception nor non-perception. Then after one, or two, turns of consciousness
have passed (That means one or two moments of the fourth ar|p»vacara jh»na.),
he becomes without consciousness.î So consciousness ceases at that moment. He
achieves cessation. There are no cittas, no cetasikas, no r|pa-born-citta. ìBut
why do consciousnesses not go on occurring in him after the two
consciousnesses? Because the effort is directed to cessation.î His effort is
directed to cessation, so there is cessation of consciousness. ìFor the
bhikkhuís mounting through the eight attainments, coupling together the states
of serenity and insight is directed to successive cessation, not to attaining
the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception. So it is because
the effort is directed to cessation that o more than two consciousnesses occur.î
So there are not many moments of consciousness; only two consciousnesses occur.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 44 ìBut if a bhikkhu emerges from the base
consisting of nothingness without having done this preparatory task and then
attains the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception, he is
unable to become without consciousness: he returns to the base consisting of
nothingness and settles down there.î So he will not be able to make it
disappear; he will go back to the third one. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 48 ìHow is it made to last? It lasts as long as
the time predetermined for its duration, unless interrupted meanwhile by the
exhaustion of the life span, by the waiting of the Community, or by the
Masterís summons.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 49 ìHow does the emergence from it come about? The
emergence comes about in two ways thus: by means of the Fruition of non-return
in the case of the Non-Returner, or by means of the Fruition of Arahantship in
the case of the Arahant.î</p>
