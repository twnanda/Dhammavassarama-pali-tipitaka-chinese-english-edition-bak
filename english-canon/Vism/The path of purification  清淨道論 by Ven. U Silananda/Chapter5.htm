<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Today we will do two chapters, chapter five
and chapter six because both chapters are small chapters, not like the fourth
chapter. The fourth chapter is a long chapter. Up to the end of the fourth
chapter we have studied how a person practices the first of the kasi”a
meditation subjects. That is the earth kasi”a meditation up to the attainment
of jh»nas. Then we will look at the person who makes the jh»nas a basis for
vipassan» and practices vipassan» meditation on them and becomes an Arahant.
Only the jh»nas are mentioned here, not vipassan» in this chapter. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The four jh»nas - first, second, third,
fourth - are explained in detail in the fourth chapter. That is the four jh»nas
or five jh»nas that are attained through the practice of earth kasi”a
meditation are explained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>You may remember that there are ten kasi”a
objects for meditation mentioned earlier at the beginning of chapter four.
Chapter five deals with the remaining kasi”a objects of meditation. We have the
earth kasi”a in chapter four. In chapter five we will have the remaining nine
kasi”as.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The next kasi”a is the water kasi”a. The
word ëkasi”aí cannot be translated into English. It is very difficult. For the
sake of convenience we translate it as disk meditation. Not all the kasi”a
objects are disks however. So we will just leave it untranslated and use the
word ëkasi”aí. ëKasi”aí means whole or orb. When you practice with the kasi”a,
you take the whole of the object, not just part of the object. That is why it
is called ëkasi”aí. In P»ƒi ëkasi”aí means whole or orb.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Now we want to practice water kasi”a. What
should we do? ìOne who wants to develop the water kasi”a should, as in the case
of the earth kasi”a, seat himself comfortably and apprehend the sign in water that
is ëeither made up or not made upí.î Water kasi”a can be practiced without a
made up kasi”a. One may just look at water and practice water kasi”a meditation
on it. That is for those who had experience in the past, especially in past
lives. For those who have not had previous experience, they will have to make a
water kasi”a.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìSomeone with no such previous practice
should guard against the four faults of a kasi”a.î That means the water should
be clear water or colorless. It should not be red or yellow, but it should be
clear water. ëThe four faults of a kasi”aí means it should not be mixed with
color. If it is mixed with color, it will become color kasi”a and not water
kasi”a. The water has to be pure and clean.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìHe should fill a bowl or a four-footed
water pot (something like a kettle) to the brim with water uncontaminated by
soil, taken in the open through a clean cloth [strainer], or with any other
clear unturbid water. He should put it in a screened place on the outskirts of
the monastery as already described and seat himself comfortably. He should
neither review its color nor bring its characteristic to mind.î That means he
should not reflect on its color because it will be color kasi”a and not water
kasi”a. You should not reflect on the characteristic of water. Water has the
characteristic of cohesion. Here you are to take water as a concept, not as a
reality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìHe should neither review its color nor
bring its characteristic to mind, apprehending the color as belonging to its
physical support.î Clear is a kind of color. One should not pay attention to it
although one may be seeing it. It is like the earth kasi”a. You may be seeing
the earth or the color of the earth,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>but
you do not reflect on it. You do not keep your mind on the color of the earth
but on the earth itself. In the same way here even though there may be some
color in the water, you do not pay attention to color, but you pay attention to
the substance called ëwaterí.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìHe should set his mind on the [name]
concept as the most outstanding mental datum, and using any among the [various]
names for water (»po) such as rain (ambu), liquid (udaka), dew (v»ri), fluid
(salila), he should develop [the kasi”a] by using [preferably] the obvious
ëwater, waterí.î Then the footnote states: ìEnglish cannot really furnish five
words for water.î In P»ƒi there are many synonyms for water. The author tells
us you can say any of the words.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
You shouldnít switch words. You should just focus on one word.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
thatís right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
The water should be very still?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
Yes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In English we just say ëwater, waterí or you
could say ëliquid, liquidí or you could say some other thing. ëWaterí is the
word that comes to us naturally when we see the substance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
so this is similar to mantra practice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
It is something like that, but the meditator does not concentrate on the sound
ëwaterí. He concentrates on the substance, on the concept. That is the
difference.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then he develops the kasi”a looking at the
water and then closing his eyes trying to visualize it, and then he looks at
the water again like the meditator did with the earth kasi”a. Then he gets
first jh»na, second jh»na and so on as with the earth kasi”a.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Here the learning sign and the counterpart
sign - ìIf the water has bubbles of froth mixed with it, the learning sign has
the same appearance.î If there are bubbles of water, or froth, or whatever the
learning sign is the same as that because the learning sign is the exact image
of the real thing. After you get the learning sign<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>or the grasped sign, you may go to any place
and sit down and concentrate on that visualized or memorized image. Then the
faults in the learning sign will gradually disappear and it will become very
clear. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThe learning sign has the same appearance,
and it is evident as a fault in the kasi”a. But the counterpart sign appears
inactive (That means still.), like a crystal fan set in space, like the disk of
a looking-glass made of crystal. With the appearance of that sign he reaches
access jh»na (That is neighborhood jh»na.) and the jh»na tetrad and pentad in
the way already described.î He dwells upon the counterpart sign again and again
and gets jh»na - first jh»na, second jh»na, third jh»na, fourth jh»na, or five
jh»nas. That means if he eliminates vitakka and vic»ra at the same time, there
are four jh»nas. If he eliminates the jh»na factors one at a time, then there
are five jh»nas. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The remaining kasi”as are pretty much the
same. With fire kasi”a you look at some fire. ìHerein, when someone with merit,
having had previous practice, is apprehending the sign, it arises in him in any
sort of fire, not made up, as he looks at the fiery combustion in a lampís
flame or in a furnace, or in a place for baking bowls, or in a forest
conflageration, as in the Elder Cittaguttaís case.î <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThe sign arose as he was looking at a
lampís flame while he was in the Uposatha house on the day of preaching the
Dhamma. Anyone else should make one up.î If a person has no practice
previously, he will have to make a fire kasi”a.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>One should build a fire. ìHe should make a
hole a span and four fingers wide in a rush mat or a piece of leather or a
cloth.î You make a hole. It may be about ten inches in diameter. Then you look
at the fire through that hole. You say ëfire, fire, fireí. There are different
synonyms for fire. You may take any of those. In the same way the learning sign
and the counterpart sign will appear to you. You dwell on the counterpart sign
and jh»na will arise. Then first, second, third and fourth jh»na will come.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then there is the air kasi”a. How do we
practice the air kasi”a? A yogi should practice air kasi”a by looking at
something or by feeling. When you look at a tree shaking in the wind, you see
that that is wind. That is air. Or as it is said in this book you may sit near
a window and feel the wind touching your body. You may concentrate on that
feeling of air touching your body or the movement of air in the treetops. There
are two ways that you can practice air kasi”a meditation. Then you can say any
one of the synonyms for wind or air. In English it is just air.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìHere the learning sign appears to move like
the swirl of hot [steam] on rice gruel just withdrawn from an oven. The
counterpart sign is quiet and motionless.î The counterpart sign is always like
that. It is more refined, smoother, and maybe more brilliant, but the learning
sign is just the exact image of the object. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Next is the blue kasi”a. The P»ƒi word for
blue is n la. This word means more than just blue. For example it can mean
black. Hair is said to be n la in color. Maybe not the color of the hair of
Western people. I see many hair colors here. It is like the hair of Eastern
people, black. In </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Burma</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'> we translate n la not as blue but
as brown. Between brown and black we translate as n la. A lotus which is called
ëblue lotusí in Burmese we call it ëbrown lotusí although it is blue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
Could it be green?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
Yes, if it is very dark. So here we have any color bordering on blue - blue, or
maybe dark green, or something like black.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìOne who is learning the blue kasi”a
apprehends the sign in blue, whether in a flower, or in a cloth, or in a color
element.î ëColor elementí simply means paint. You may paint on a board blue
color and practice on it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìOne should take flowers such as blue
lotuses, girika””ik» (morning glory) flowers, etc., and spread them out to fill
a tray or a flat basket completely so that no stamen or stalk shows, or with
only their petals. Or he can fill it with blue cloth bunched up together; or he
can fasten the cloth over the rim of the tray or basket like the covering of a
drum. Or he can make a kasi”a disk, either portable as described under the
earth kasi”a or on a wall, with one of the color elements such as bronze-green,
leaf-green, anjana-ointment black.î Anjana-ointment is the cosmetic women use
to decorate their eyes. What do you call that?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Students:
Eye shadow. Mascara.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
Yes, mascara. It can be any color?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
Itís usually dark.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
Yes, it must be dark. So any one of these colors will do. He surrounds it with
a different color. Let us say you want to make a blue kasi”a. The circle should
be blue and the bordering color should not be red, yellow or white, but some
other color. There should be no confusion with the colors of the other kasi”as.
ìAfter that he should bring it to mind as ëblue, blueí.î He looks at it and
says ëblue, blueí. The rrest is similar to the preceding kasi”a objects.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>With the yellow kasi”a one uses a yellow
cloth, yellow flowers or yellow paint. The only difference is the color. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>With the red kasi”a you use red color - red
flowers, red cloth or red paint. With white kasi”a you use white flowers, white
cloth or white paint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Next is the light kasi”a. ìOne who is
learning the light kasi”a apprehends the sign in light in a hole in a wall, or
in a keyhole, or in a window opening.î So it is light coming through a hole.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìSo firstly, when someone has merit, having
had previous practice, the sign arises in him when he sees the circle thrown on
a wall or a floor by sunlight or moonlight entering through a hole in the wall,
etc., or when he sees a circle thrown on the ground by sunlight or moonlight
coming through a gap in the branches of a dense-leafed tree or through a gap in
a hut made of closely packed branches. Anyone else should use that same kind of
circle of luminosity just described, developing it as ëluminosity, luminosity,
or ëlight, lightí. If he cannot do so, he can light a lamp inside a pot, close
the potís mouth, make a hole in it and place it with the hole facing a wall.
The lamplight coming out of the hole throws a circle on the wall.î He looks at
that circle and says ëlight, lightí.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThis lasts longer than the other kinds.î
That means that sunlight or moonlight may change. They may not last long, but
this light which is put in a pot and that falls on the wall will last longer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThe learning sign is like the circle thrown
on the wall or the ground. The counterpart sign is like a compact bright
cluster of lights. The rest is as before.î <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The last one is the limited space kasi”a.
Here ëlimited spaceí is said to differentiate it from ëinfinite spaceí which is
the object of the first formless (ar|p»vacara) jh»na. After getting the fifth
or the fourth jh»na, if a person wants to attain ar|p»vacara jh»na, first he
has to practice the kasi”a meditation. Then he makes the sign disappear and he
dwells on the space that was taken by the sign. Then he expands this sign until
the end of the world or the end of the universe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>But here the yogi takes the space which is
limited. It is like looking at a round hole or something like that. ìOne who is
learning the space kasi”a apprehends the sign in a hole in a wall, or in a
keyhole, or in a window opening, and so firstly, when someone has merit, having
had previous practice, the sign arises in him when he sees any [such gap as a]
hole in a wall. Anyone else should make hole a span and four fingers broad in a
well thatched hut, or in a piece of leather, or in a rush mat, and so on. He
should develop one of these, or a hole such as a hole in a wall, as ëspace,
spaceí.î So he looks at the hole and says ëspace, spaceí.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìHere the learning sign resembles the hole
together with the wall.î So there is a limit. There is a boundary. That is why
in that state attempts to expand it fail. You cannot expand that in the mind
because it has a limited boundary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThe counterpart sign appears only as a
circle of space.î Here there is no boundary, just a circle of space, and so
attempts to extend it succeed. ìThe rest should be understood as described
under the earth kasi”a.î<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>These are the ten ksi”as. All of the ten
kasi”as lead a yogi to attain all four jh»nas or all five jh»nas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The following is general but I think it is
the interesting part of this chapter. We will learn what results we can get
from the jh»nas based on the practice of kasi”a meditation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>You know in the book many miracles are
stated like flying through the air, going into the earth, creating storms or
fire. They may be called ëpsychic powersí now. In order to get those powers
first one has to attain all eight or nine jh»nas, not only r|p»vacara jh»nas
but also ar|p»vacara jh»nas also. Then one goes back to the fourth or the fifth
jh»na and practices in a special way so that the supernormal power or ëdirect
knowledgeí as it is called in this book arises in that person. When the direct
knowledge arises as that person wishes, he is able to see things far away, he
is able to hear sounds far away and so on. Then there are monks who show their
psychic power.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Suppose you want to shake this whole
building. What must you do? Suppose you have power. If you go about it in the
wrong way, you will not be able to do that. In order to shake this building you
must practice jh»na taking water kasi”a as an object. If you develop jh»na on
earth kasi”a, it will become stronger and you will not be able to shake it. In
order to shake this building you have to practice jh»na on water kasi”a. Water
is fluid. If you develop direct knowledge, you will be able to do that. Things
like this are mentioned in the following paragraphs. They are interesting. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
It is interesting. There is a story of a novice. It is said that he had psychic
powers. He went up to the world of the gods and he said: ìI will show my power
to you. I will shake your buildings, your mansions so that you will become
afraid.î He tried to do that, but he was not successful. He couldnít shake them
at all. The celestial nymphs teased him and he went back ashamed. Then he
returned to his teacher and told him that he tried to shake the celestial
mansion and he was unable to do that. His teacher said to him that he got into
the wrong jh»na meditation. He had practiced jh»na on the earth kasi”a. So he
could not shake the mansion. Then he went up again. Once again the nymphs
teased him. But this time their king said: ìDo not tease him. Now he has
instructions from his teacher.î So that time he was able to shake the celestial
mansion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>These supernormal powers are mentioned in
the following paragraphs. The first is the results of the earth kasi”a. ìThe
earth kasi”a is the basis for such powers as the state described as ëhaving
become one, he becomes manyí (That means you make multiple images of
yourself.), etc.î<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>Let me read about etc.
ìBeing one he becomes many, or having become many he becomes one again. He
becomes visible or invisible. He goes feeling no obstruction through the
further side of a wall, or a rampart, or a hill as if through air. He
penetrates up and down through the solid ground as if through water. He walks
on water without breaking through as if on solid ground. He travels
cross-legged in the sky like the birds on wing. Even the moon and the sun so
potent, so mighty though they be, does he touch and feel with his hand. He
reaches in the body even up to the heaven of Brahma.î Such things can be done
through direct knowledge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

powers as diving in and out of the earth.î So if you want to dive into the
earth, first you enter into water kasi”a and something like create water in
your mind so that you can get into the earth. ìCausing rain storms, creating
rivers and seas, making the earth, and rocks, and palaces quakeî - if you want

The footnote says ìSense desires are not called empty (ritta) in the sense that
space, which is entirely devoid of individual essence, is called empty.î So
sense desires are not empty?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
Right. Emptiness in Therav»da teaching is different. Whenever we say ëemptyí,
we mean it as empty or devoid of permanency, devoid of happiness, devoid of
self. It is not that they do not have an existence of their own because desire
is a reality (paramattha). It is an ultimate reality. Desire is a mental
factor. So it has its own existence or entity. But it is free or void of
permanency. It is void of happiness (sukha). It is void of self or ego. So it
is called void or su““a. It is different.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
It is empty in that it is going to change, in that it is not permanent. It is
empty in that sense. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
yes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
It is not empty in that it has momentary existence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
Yes. It has momentary existence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
Space does not even have momentary existence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
Space is not included in the realities. Space is considered to be a concept,
space and time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
Is your description of sense desire different from Mah»yana?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: I
donít know what ësu““aí means in Mah»yana. If it means that sense desire has no
existence at all, that it is something like a concept, then it is different.
What we understand by su““a is that it is devoid of permanency and so on. But it
has its own existence, momentary existence. It arises and disappears. During
that moment it is real. So it is called reality, but this reality has no
quality of permanency and so on, no substance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

powers as smoking, flaming, causing showers of sparks, countering fire with
fire, ability to burn only what one wants to burn, causing light for the
purpose of seeing visible objects with the divine eye, burning up the body by
means of the fire element at the time of attaining Nibb»na.î<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The ability to burn only what one wants to
burn is to be found in the Sa—yutta Nik»ya. In the translation it is to be
found in Kindred Sayings, volume 4, page 196. (In Bhikkhu Bodhiís more recent
translation it is in The Connected Discourses of the Buddha, volume 2, pages
1319 &amp; 1320.) There a monk did that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and shut the bolt of the door, performed such a feat of magic power such that a
flame came through the keyhole and the parts about and the parts about the door
bar, and set the grass on fire, but not the cloak. Citta the householder in
alarm with hair on end shook out his cloak and stood aside.î So here the
venerable showed his psychic power. The cloak did not burn but the grass
burned. That is what is said here. This is the ability to burn only what one
wants to burn. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>This fire kasi”a is very useful in trying to
see things with the divine eye. The divine eye is one kind of direct knowledge.
In order to see far away things or to see things in the dark one needs some
light. So first he practices jh»na based on the fire kasi”a. Then he goes to
the fifth jh»na and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

element at the time of Nibb»naí - that means when an Arahant dies if he has this
power, he could will that the body be consumed by fire when he dies. Nobody has
to take care of burning his body. It will burn by itself. In order to do that
before his death he enters into jh»na on the basis of fire kasi”a. Then he
wills ìMay my body burn at death.î <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>That was done by one of the disciples of the
Buddha. His name was Venerable Bakkula. He was foremost among those that are
free from disease. He was endowed with perfect health. Before he died he
thought ìI have not given any duty or any burden to anybody in my life. So when
I die, I will not give them this burden of cremating my body. Let my body
cremate itself.î So he willed that way and then he died. As soon as he died,
the body was consumed by fire. The moment he died the body was burned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the basis for such powers as creating black forms, causing darkness,
acquisition of the bases of mastery by the method of fairness and ugliness, and
attainment of the liberation by the beautiful. The yellow kasi”a is the basis
for such powers as creating yellow forms, resolving that something shall be
gold.î You may resolve that something will be gold and then it may turn into gold
or look like gold. The reference is Kindred Sayings, volume 1, page 145.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

(That is banishing sleepiness.), dispelling darkness, causing light for the
purpose of seeing visible objects with the divine eye. The light kasi”a is the basis
for such powers as creating luminous forms, banishing stiffness and torpor,

possess bad kamma entailing immediate effect [rebirth].î It is given in the
footnote that it is the five kinds of grievous kamma - killing oneís mother,
killing oneís father, killing an Arahant, causing blood to congeal in the body
of the Buddha, and causing schism in the Community, in the Sa~gha. These are
said to be very grievous offenses. A person who has done any one of these cannot
escape rebirth in hell in the next existence. It is said here that if anyone
has done any of these, he will not be able to develop jh»na.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The fourth one is important. Here it say
ëintentional shedding of a Buddhaís bloodí. It is believed in the Therav»da
tradition that we cannot wound a Buddha. We cannot injure a Buddha. The most we
can do is hit him and have the blood congeal under the skin. Sometimes you hit
yourself and there is a bruise. No blood comes out. What is that?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then by defilement - that means those who
have fixed wrong view or who are hermaphrodites or eunuchs. These people cannot
attain jh»na even though they practice meditation. ëWrong viewí means no cause
view, moral inefficacy of action, and nihilist view. ëNo cause viewí means
there is no cause for something to happen. Anything can happen without a cause.
That is called ëno cause viewí. If you deny the cause, you deny the effect. In
reality these three kinds of wrong view are the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The others deny the effect. If you deny the
effect, you also deny the cause. Then third one is the nihilist view. There is
nothing. Whatever you do will not constitute a kamma. The second one is moral
inefficacy of action and the third one is nihilist view - no cause, no doing.
There is no result from the practice of giving; there is nothing like respect
to the Elders, to parents and so on. You donít have to pay respect to your
elders, something like that. There is no this world, no other world; there are
no holy men who have practiced and attained to the spiritual attainments and so
on. That is what is called the ënihilist viewí here. If a person has one of
these wrong views or he is a hermaphrodite or a eunuch, he will not be able to
attain jh»na.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìBy kamma result: who have had a
rebirth-linking with no [profitable] root-cause or with only two [profitable]
root-causes.î That means when a person takes rebirth, there is a type of
consciousness which arises. With that consciousness roots may arise. There are
six roots - three good roots and three evil roots. The roots of evil are
attachment, hatred and delusion. The roots of good are the opposites of these
three. When a person takes rebirth, his rebirth consciousness may not be
accompanied by any of these roots at all or it may be accompanied by two or
three of the good roots. There is no rebirth consciousness<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>which is accompanied by any of the evil
roots. If a personís rebirth consciousness is not accompanied by any of these
roots, then he cannot attain jh»na in that life. ëTwo rootsí means non-greed
and non-hatred without wisdom or understanding (“»”a). So our rebirth
consciousness must be accompanied by pa““» in order for us to attain jh»na in
this life or enlightenment in this life. Otherwise it is impossible for us to
attain jh»na or enlightenment. This is called ëby kamma-resultí.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ëWill be incapable of entering into the certainty of rightness in profitable

ëcertaintyí and ërightness in profitable statesí.î That simply means such
people are incapable of attaining enlightenment, attaining jh»nas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

for none of them will succeed in developing any meditation subject at all. So
the task of devotion to a meditation subject must be undertaken by a clansman

defilement, and who fosters faith, zeal and understanding by listening to the
