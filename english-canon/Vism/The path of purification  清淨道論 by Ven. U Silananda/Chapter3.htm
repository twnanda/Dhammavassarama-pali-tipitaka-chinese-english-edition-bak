<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Today we come to
the third chapter. With this chapter we begin the second stage of spiritual
development, the stage of sam»dhi or concentration. The first chapter deals
with the first stage, s la. The second chapter deals with ascetic practices
which are a kind of s la. From the third chapter through the thirteenth chapter
the second stage, the stage of sam»dhi or concentration, is described in
detail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The third chapter
begins with the definition of the word ësam»dhií. It is important that we
understand or learn what we are talking about. The word ësam»dhií is translated
as concentration. In order to understand properly we have to go back to the
P»ƒi word ësam»dhií. The word ësam»dhií is composed of ësamí, ë»í, and ëdh», plus
ëií. The prefix ësamí here has two meanings. The first meaning is evenly. That
means in a unifying way, without scattering. The second meaning is rightly.
That means without being distracted. ëåí and ëdh»í together mean putting or
placing. So sam»dhi means placing without scattering or placing, keeping them
unified and undistracted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††† </span>Placing what?
Placing the consciousness and its concomitants or the mental factors. Placing
on what? Placing on a single object. Sam»dhi is a mental factor. It is one of
the 52 mental factors. Among the 52 mental factors we call it ëone-pointedness
of mindí or ëekaggat»í. Ekaggat» and sam»dhi are the same or synonymous.
Sam»dhi is that mental factor which puts consciousness and its concomitants on
a single object, without scattering them, keeping them unified and
undistracted. Sam»dhi coordinates consciousness and all the mental factors
arising with it and does not allow them or itself to be distracted or to wander
away. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In another chapter
of the Visuddhi Magga sam»dhi is described as the steadiness of mind, like the
steadiness of a lampís flame when there is no draft. In a room with no draft
there might be a candle with a flame. Like that flame sam»dhi is steady.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The steadiness of
sam»dhi is a series of moments of steadiness. It is not one moment only. It is
a series of moments of consciousness arising again and again on a single
object. Sam»dhi is a mental factor and as a mental factor it must arise and
disappear in just three sub-moments. So here ëbeing on the object for some time
without scattering, unified and undisturbedí means a series of sam»dhi moments
arising and disappearing, taking one and the same object, taking a single
object. That is what is called ësam»dhií in Buddhism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Whenever we want
to understand something, we have to understand it with reference to
characteristic, function, manifestation, and proximate cause. These are given
in paragraph 4.î Concentration has non-distraction as its characteristic.î The
characteristic of sam»dhi is non-distraction, non-wandering. ìIts function is
to eliminate distraction. It is manifested as non-wavering (non-shaking). Its
proximate cause is bliss.î ëBlissí means sukha, comfort or something like
happiness. Only when there is something like comfort of the mind and the body
can there be concentration or sam»dhi.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In another chapter
characteristic and the others are given a little differently, although they
mean more or less the same thing. In that chapter the characteristic is given
as non-wandering or non-distraction. The function is to conglomerate conascent
states as water does bath powder. That means you have some powder or flour and
you put some water in it. The water conglomerates them into one solid thing. As
water conglomerates the particles of powder, sam»dhi conglomerates, or
coordinates, or collects concomitants. It does not let the concomitants (both
citta and cetasikas) arising with it to scatter. It keeps together
consciousness and mental factors. It does not let them be scattered. Its
manifestation there is described as peace because when there is sam»dhi there
is peacefulness. The proximate cause again is sukha (bliss).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then the author
describes different kinds of concentration. ìFirst it is of only one kind with
the characteristic of non-distraction.î According to this characteristic there
is only one kind of sam»dhi. But then it can be of two kinds, three, four and
so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìIt is of two
kinds as access concentration and absorption concentrationî I think it is
important to understand these two at least - access concentration and
absorption concentration. ëAccess concentrationí means neighborhood
concentration. It is in the neighborhood of jh»na or Magga. Therefore it is
called ëneighborhoodí or ëaccess concentrationí.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Suppose a person
practices kasi”a meditation, looking at a disk, taking it into his mind,
remembering it , or memorizing it. When he has got the image in his mind, he is
said to have got the ëgrasped signí. Then he dwells upon this ëgrasped signí,
this mental image again and again until that image becomes free from all
defects, very pure. At that time he is said to have gained the neighborhood
concentration or access concentration. He has very strong concentration at that
time. Neighborhood or access concentration precedes jh»na or absorption
concentration. It also precedes Magga, the Path concentration. That kind of
concentration is called ëaccess concentrationí or ëneighborhood concentrationí.
The other concentration immediately following that concentration is called
ëabsorption concentrationí. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Here ëabsorptioní
does not mean jh»na only. The P»ƒi word is appan». ëAppan» concentrationí means
both jh»na concentration and Magga (Path) concentration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Student: So sam»dhi can be broken up into jh»na and Pth
types of sam»dhi.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Yes. Jh»na sam»dhi and Magga sam»dhi belong to
absorption (appan») concentration. First there is access concentration and then
absorption concentration. Absorption concentration can be divided into two -
jh»na concentration and Magga concentration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Student: So sam»dhi is the larger term and then jh»na is a
subset within sam»dhi.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Yes. Thatís right. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>These two kinds of
concentration (access and absorption) are for samatha (tranquillity)
meditation. In vipassan» we have another kind of concentration which is called
ëmomentary concentrationí. It is like access concentration. It is not really
access concentration because there is no jh»na there. But with regard to
samatha meditation there are these two kinds of concentration - neighborhood or
access concentration and absorption concentration. And again let me repeat
ëabsorption concentrationí does <u>not</u><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>mean jh»na <u>only</u>. <u>It means Magga also</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In paragraph 6,
section 2, the subjects of meditation which lead to the attainment of
neighborhood concentration, but not jh»na concentration are given. I want you
to look at this chart ( the handout). It is in P»ƒi so it will not be easy at
this stage. If you look at the chart the last column is jh»na. You can see that
if you practice a particular subject of meditation, you can get for example
first through fifth jh»nas, or first jh»na only, or no jh»na at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Please look at the
middle of the page at the anussati ten. The first one is Buddh»nussati,
recollection of the virtues of the Buddha. If you practice that meditation, you
will not get jh»na. You will get only the access concentration. You will not
get jh»na concentration or jh»na through the practice of that kind of
meditation. Similarly with Dhamm»nussati, Sa~gh»nussati and so on you will not
get jh»na. In these subjects of meditation you will only get access
concentration and not absorption concentration. This chart will be useful for
the other chapters too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>I deliberately
used P»ƒi because it is shorter to use P»ƒi words. If you write English, you
have to say ërecollection of the virtues of the Buddhaí and so on. I need space
on the page.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The forty subjects
of meditation are given in this chapter later on. The list of the forty
subjects of meditation is given in paragraphs 104 and 105. You may check with
that. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Student: Are they in the same order in the book as on the
chart?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Let me see. In the book there are ten kasi”as, ten
kinds of foulness, ten recollections, four divine abodes, four immaterial
states, one perception and one defining. No, they are not the same. In the
chart there are the kasi”a ten, the asubha or ten kinds of foulness, the ten
recollections, the four divine abodes. They are the same. In the book the four
immaterial states are next. They are the last group on the chart. ëOne
perceptioní means sa““» one on the chart. ëOne definingí means vavatth»na one
on the chart. The order on the chart is taken from The Manual of Abhidhamma.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The other kinds of
sam»dhi like mundane and supramundane, with happiness or without happiness,
with p ti and without p ti, accompanied by bliss, accompanied by equanimity and
so on - in order to understand these divisions you have to remember the five
jh»nas. The first jh»na is accompanied by vitakka (initial application), vic»ra
(sustained application), p ti, sukha and ekaggat» (one-pointedness of mind).
The second jh»na is accompanied by vic»ra, p ti, sukha, and ekaggat». The third
jh»na is accompanied by p ti, sukha, and ekaggat». The fourth jh»na is
accompanied by sukha and ekaggat». The fifth jh»na is accompanied by upekkha
(indifferent feeling) and ekaggat».<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>I hope that you
remember that jh»nas can be four or five. In the Sutta Pi‘aka jh»nas are
described as four. It is very rare that they are described as five in the
Suttas. But in Abhidhamma they are described as both four and five. According
to the fourfold method there are four jh»nas, but according to fivefold method
there are five jh»nas. Actually they are the same. The first of the fourfold
method is the same as the first of the fivefold method. The second of the
fourfold method is the third of the fivefold method. If you remember that you
will understand these divisions, but if you donít, donít worry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In paragraph 14
ìIn the first of the tetrads there is concentration of difficult progress and
sluggish direct knowledge.î ëDifficult progressí means difficult practice. You
have to practice much. You have to spend a lot of time practicing in order to
make progress. ëSluggish direct knowledgeí means sluggish understanding.
Understanding is slow. Understanding can be swift or it can be slow. The
practice is also difficult for some and it is not so for others. That depends
on many factors. They are given in these pages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>With regard to the
previous practice let us look at paragraph 17. ìBesides, they should be
understood as classed according to craving and ignorance, and according to <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>whether one has had practice in serenity
and</b> <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>insight</b>.î Here what is meant
is whether one had the practice of samatha or vipassan» (insight) meditation in
his former lives. If you have the practice of samatha meditation in your former
lives, then when you take up the practice of samatha meditation here, your
progress is not difficult. You have easy progress. If you do not have such
practice in the past, then it may be difficult. So ìIf he has had no practiceî
means practice in former lives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In paragraph 22
about the middle of the paragraph ìthe state of partaking of distinction is the
attaining of higher distinction.î ëHigher distinctioní here means higher
jh»nas. Sometimes ëdistinctioní means enlightenment. Here ëdistinctioní means
jh»nas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThe state of
partaking of penetration is accessibility to perception and attention

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: That means he does not practice it well.
ëDiminutioní means something like regression. You may lose the degree of
concentration if you do not practice. There is accessibility to opposition.
ëOppositioní means the hindrances. When the hindrances are close to you, then
you may lose sam»dhi. That kind of sam»dhi is called ëpartaking of diminutioní.
ëStagnationí is when the sam»dhi does not regress nor does it progress. It just
stands there, not making progress. That is called ëpartaking of stagnationí.
That is because that person cannot get rid of attachment to that sam»dhi. He is
attached to sam»dhi and so he cannot make progress.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Today we come to
temperaments. In paragraph 74 ìThere are six kinds of temperament, that is,
greed temperament, hating temperament, deluded temperament, faithful
temperament, intelligent temperament, and speculative temperament.î On this
sheet the second column represents the six temperaments. The first word in the
second column ëcaritaí means temperament. The temperaments are r»ga, dosa,
moha, saddha, buddhi, and vitakka.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Greedy temperament
is r»ga. Hating temperament is dosa. Deluded temperament is moha. Faithful
temperament is saddha. Intelligent temperament is buddhi. Buddhi is a synonym
for “»”a or pa““» (wisdom). Speculative temperament is vitakka. Some teachers
say there are more than six kinds of temperament and mixtures of them. They are
not so interesting because they are confusing. Following the author we take six
temperaments. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Three are good
temperaments and three are bad temperaments. Each one has parallel in the other
group. Faithful temperament is similar to greedy temperament because ìfaith is
strong when profitable (kamma) occurs in one of greedy temperament, owing to
its special qualities being near to those of greed.î That means greed is
similar to faith or saddha. ìFor in an unprofitable way, greed is affectionate
and not over-austere, and so, in a profitable way, is faith.î<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Instead of saying
ìin an unprofitable wayî we should say ìon the side of unwholesome states, on
the side of akusalaî. So it means among akusala states greed is affectionate
and not over-austere. Among kusala states (wholesome states) faith has the same
qualities; faith is affectionate and not over-austere. So they are similar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The same is true
for hateful temperament and intelligent temperament. They are also similar. A
person who habitually gets angry may be of intelligent temperament. There are
some people who are short-tempered and who get angry for a very small reason.
Those people may be of sharp intelligence. They are similar or parallel
qualities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

what is ëhumourí? ëHumourí here means something in the body - wind, phlegm,

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

according to the elements. ìA person is of deluded temperament because two

be of deluded temperament and so on. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The author gives
the exposition given by the teachers of the Commentaries. That means given by
the Therav»da tradition. ìthe fact that these beings have prominence of greed,
prominence of hate, prominence of delusion, prominence of non-greed, prominence
of non-hate, prominence of non-delusion, is governed by previous root-cause.
For when in one man at the moment of his accumulating (rebirth-producing) kamma
greed is strong and non-greed is weak, non-hate and non-delusion are strong and
hate and delusion are weak, then his weak non-greed is unable to prevail over
his greed, but his non-hate and non-delusion being strong are able to prevail
over his hate and delusion. That is why, on being reborn through
rebirth-linking given by that kamma, he has greed, is good-natured and unangry,
and possesses understanding with knowledge, like a lightening flash.î<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAt the moment of
his accumulating (rebirth producing kamma) greed is strong and non-greed is
weak.î - here it does not mean that the kamma and the greed or non-greed arise
at the same moment. Greed is unwholesome mental state and non-greed is a
wholesome mental state. They cannot arise together. The kamma which gives
results relinking in human existence and so on is good kamma, wholesome kamma.
It cannot be unwholesome kamma. When kusala kamma arises in our minds, there
can be no greed arising at the same time. He has greed before and after that
kamma. That is what is meant here by ìat the moment of his accumulating kamma.î
It is not that they arise at the same time, at the same moment, but the kamma
is influenced by strong greed, non-greed is weak and so on. When at the moment
of accumulating kamma greed is strong, non-greed is weak and so on, there is
this difference of being of different temperament. These are explained with
reference to which root-cause, which hetus, are predominant or strong or weak
at the moment of accumulating good or bad kamma, especially good kamma. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

of visible forms is called ëquite clearí in the sense of extension of the sign,
while the perception of bones is called ënot quite clearí in the sense of
non-extension. But the words ëI was intent upon this whole earth with the
perception of a skeletoní are said of the manner of appearance to one who has
acquired that perception.î That means one who has acquired that perception
before and now he extends this perception. It is all right because he is not
practicing to get that perception. He has already got that perception so he may
extend it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

The queen asked the community whose sound was the sweetest. They all said the
sound of the karav ka bird was the sweetest. So the queen wanted to listen to
the sound of the karav ka bird. She asked her king, King Asoka, to bring a
karav ka bird to her. So what King Asoka did was to send a cage. The cage flew
through the air and landed near the bird. The bird got in the cage and the cage
flew back to the city. After reaching the city, the bird would not utter a
sound because he was depressed. The king asked why the bird did not make any
sound. His advisors said that the bird did not make any sound because he was
lonely. If the bird had companions, he would make noise. So the king put
mirrors around him. The bird saw his image in the mirrors and thought that
there were other birds. He was happy and so he made sounds. The queen when she
heard the sounds was very pleased. She was very happy. She practiced meditation
on that happiness. She practiced vipassan» and became a Stream-Winner. ìShe
