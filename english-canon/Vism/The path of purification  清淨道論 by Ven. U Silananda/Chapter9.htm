<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Today we begin the
chapter on the divine abidings (the brahm» vih»ras), chapter nine. We may
expect the Commentator to give us the meanings or the definition of brahm»
vih»ra, mett» and so on at the beginning of the chapter. It should be done that
way, but the definitions and meanings are given towards the end. Letís go to
the explanation of the words brahm» vih»ra in paragraph 105.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAnd here it may be
asked: But why are loving-kindness, compassion, gladness, and equanimity,
called divine abidings? And why are they only four? And what is their order?
And why are they called measureless states in the Abhidhamma?î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìIt may be replied:
The divineness of the abiding (brahmavih»rat») should be understood here in the
sense of best and in the sense of immaculate.î We need to look at the P»ƒi
words ëbrahm»í and ëvih»raí. ëBrahm»í can mean the best or immaculate. When we
say the word ëbrahm»í, the first meaning that usually comes to mind is a being,
a higher kind of celestial being that is called brahm». Brahm» beings are
better than or higher than beings belonging to the sense-sphere or belonging to
the world of human beings or lower celestial beings. So the word ëbrahm»í came
to mean the good or the best and also immaculate or pure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìFor these abidings
are the best in being the right attitude towards beings.î These abidings or
actually these practices of meditation are the best because they are the right
attitude towards beings - loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and
equanimity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAnd just as Brahm»
Gods abide with immaculate minds, so the meditators who associate themselves
with these abidings abide on an equal footing with Brahm» Gods.î Another
explanation is ëbrahm» vih»raí means vih»ra like that of the brahm»s. ëVih»raí
means living or abiding, so abiding like that of brahm»s. It is said that the
brahm»s in their world just practice peaceful kinds of meditation. There is
nothing for them to do other than going into jh»nas, peaceful kinds of
meditation. So ëbrahm» vih»raí means the abiding of the brahm» gods. So they
are called divine abidings in the sense of best and in the sense of immaculate.
We can explain it as the best way of abiding, or the best way of living, or
living like that of the brahm»s. It is translated as divine abidings or
sometimes they are called sublime states.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>There are four
brahm» vih»ras or four divine abidings. They are (1) mett» (loving-kindness),
(2) karu”» (compassion), (3) mudit» (gladness), (4) upekkh» (equanimity). Today
we will study mett». Letís go to the explanation of mett» in paragraph 92. We
should clearly understand what is meant by this word ëmett»í (loving-kindness).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìNow as to the
meaning firstly loving-kindness, compassion, gladness and equanimity: it
fattens (mejjati), thus it is loving-kindness (mett»).î The word ëmett»í is
derived from a P»ƒi root. The P»ƒi root is ëmidí. It has the meaning to fatten.
Actually here it means to be moist or something like sticky. That is because
when you have love for someone, you are sort of attached or glued to that
person. ìIt is solvent (siniyhati) is the meaning.î It is moist or it is
gluttonous. That is why it is called mett». That is one explanation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Another explanation
is : ìAlso: it comes about with respect to a friend.î A friend is called
ëmittaí in P»ƒi. The state of a friend or the behavior of a friend is called
ëmett»í. That is according to P»ƒi grammatical rules. In this second
explanation the word ëmett»í comes from the word ëmittaí, which means a friend.
The behavior of a friend or behavior towards a friend is called ëmett»í.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>What is mett»? It
is a kind of love, but it is not mixed with attachment or craving. It is pure,
wholesome desire for the well-being of beings, for the welfare of beings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>If you have studied
Abhidhamma, you will know that there are 52 mental factors or 52 cetasikas.
Among the 52 mental factors mett» is adosa. Adosa is non-hatred or non-anger.
Mett» is the opposite of anger or the opposite of hatred. It is the wholesome
desire for the well-being or welfare of all beings. Now we can go to the
beginning of the chapter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>When we want to
practice mett» meditation or loving-kindness meditation, what we must do first
is to review the danger in hate and to review the advantage in patience. That
is before doing something we must know the danger in the opposite of what we
are going to do and also the benefits of the thing we are going to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>First we need to
review the danger in hate. When we see the danger in hate or in anger, we will
want to avoid. We will want to get away from that hate or anger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìTo start with he
should review the danger in hate and the advantage in patience. Why? Because
hate has to be abandoned and patience attained in the development of this
meditation subject and he cannot abandon unseen dangers and attain unknown
advantages.î If he does not see any danger, he cannot abandon them. If he does
not see the advantages, he will not attain them. First the meditator has to see
the danger in hate and the advantage in patience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Danger and hate
should be seen in accordance with such Suttas as this. There are many Suttas
where Buddha taught about the danger in hate and the advantage of patience.
(Tape cuts away and it sounds like Say»daw is beginning anew.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Today we begin the
chapter on the divine abidings. The P»ƒi word for divine abidings is ëbrahm»
vih»raí. The definition of that word is towards the end of the chapter. The
word ëmett»í or ëloving-kindnessí is defined as that which is moist or which is
gluttonous. Mett» or loving-kindness is a wholesome desire for the well-being
of all beings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Before we practice
loving-kindness meditation this book says that we must do two things. One is to
review the danger in hate and the other is to review the advantage in patience.
If we do not see the danger in hate, we will not be able to abandon hate. If we
do not see advantages in being patient, we will not get these advantages. So
danger in hate and advantage in patience should be reviewed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>This we could do by
reading some Suttas. The first is the danger in hate. ìFriends, when a man
hates, is a prey to hate and his mind is obsesses by hate, he kills living
beingsî and so on. When a man is angry, he may kill a being or do something to
injure another person and so on. So there is this danger in hate or this danger
in anger. There are many Suttas similar to this Sutta in the Sutta Pi‘aka. The
reference given here is A, 1, 216. If you want to read the original Sutta, that
is the English translation, I can give you the reference. ëAí means A~guttara
Nik»ya. The translation of A~guttara Nik»ya is named ëGradual Sayingsí. There
are five books or five volumes in this collection. So this is in Gradual
Sayings, volume 1, page 196. You may read there in more detail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAnd the advantage
in patience should be understood according to such Suttas as these:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>ëNo higher rule,
the Buddhas say, than patience,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>and no Nibb»na
higher than forbearance</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>Patience in
force, in strong array:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>Tis him I call a
brahmaní.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here a brahman means a h man. So Buddha said I call him a
holy man who has patience as an army or as a force and who is strong in
forbearance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìNo greater thing
exists than patience.î These are from other Suttas. By reviewing, by reading,
by remembering these Suttas we can see danger in hate and advantage in
patience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>After reviewing
danger in hate and advantage in patience what should we do? ìThereupon he
should embark upon the development of loving-kindness for the purpose of
secluding the mind from hate seen as a danger and introducing it to patience
known as an advantage.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìBut when he
begins, he must know that some persons are of the wrong sort at the very
beginning and that loving-kindness should be developed towards certain kinds of
persons and not towards certain other kinds at first.î So when we practice
loving-kindness meditation, we must first understand to whom we must first
practice loving-kindness meditation. In this book it is said that
ìloving-kindness should not be developed at first towards the following four
kinds of persons: an antipathetic person (That means a person whom you hate.),
a very dearly loved friend, a neutral person, and a hostile person. Also it
should not be developed specifically towards the opposite sex, or towards a
dead person.î It will be explained later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Why should it not
be developed toward antipathetic persons and others? That is because to put
antipathetic persons in a dear oneís place is fatiguing, It is very difficult.
So we should not begin with such persons and other persons also. We should not
radiate thoughts of loving-kindness to them in the beginning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>It should not be
developed towards persons of the opposite sex because lust can arise in the
person who practices loving-kindness towards persons of the opposite sex. It is
not suitable to practice loving-kindness towards persons of the opposite sex in
the beginning or maybe it is better not to practice specifically, but one may
practice to all men or to all women. That we should do. Or if we can really
keep ourselves from getting lustful thoughts or attachment, we may be able to
do that. But it is very difficult especially in the beginning to keep these
thoughts from coming up in our mind. So it is best to avoid persons of the
opposite sex in the beginning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The it says that it
should not be developed towards a dead person. We can send thoughts to him, but
we cannot get any jh»nas from that practice. The story of a young monk is given
here. He was familiar with jh»na through loving-kindness. That means he
practiced jh»na through loving-kindness. He could enter into jh»na easily. But
when he practiced loving-kindness towards his teacher and tried to enter into
jh»na, he could not do that. So he went to another Elder and asked him why he
could not do that. He said I am familiar with the jh»nas through
loving-kindness meditation, but now I practice loving-kindness meditation to my
teacher and I could not get into the jh»na.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>What did the Elder
say? ìSeek the sign, friend.î Just that. ëSeek the signí means examine your
object, the object of your meditation. ìHe did so. Finding that his teacher had
died, he proceeded with developing loving-kindness inspired by another and
attained absorption.î So he changed his object to another person who was
living. We cannot send thoughts of loving-kindness to a person who is dead and
at the same time we donít know that they are dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>What about your
parents who have died and you want to send thoughts to them? is that possible?
I think it is because I am doing that. I send thoughts to them. I know they are
dead. So I think of them as reborn in some other state, say, a state among the
devas and I send thoughts to them. In that way we can practice loving-kindness
to dead persons. But if you donít know that they are dead and you are sending
thoughts to them as living persons, it wonít help.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Is there a difference between sending thoughts of
goodwill and attaining jh»na?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: You attain jh»na after you send thoughts. It will
be explained here. In order to attain jh»na you have to practice seriously and
try to break the barriers. And after the barriers are broken you are said to
get the access concentration. Then you continue practicing loving-kindness and
you will get jh»na.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Even towards a person that is dead?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Oh, no. You cannot attain jh»na, but you can send
thoughts to those persons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìFirst of all it
should be developed only towards oneself, doing it repeatedly thus.î When we
practice loving-kindness, we begin with ourselves. Then there are questions and
answers about practicing towards oneself as to whether it is in accordance with
the teachings in other books. That is because in the Texts it does not say that
first you should practice loving-kindness towards yourself and then that you
practice to other beings. It is not explicitly said. It may seem to conflict
with those Texts. But the author says here that it does not conflict. That is
because it refers to absorption. In the P»ƒi Texts when it says ìA monk
pervades one direction with his heart filled with loving-kindnessî and so on,
that means for jh»na for absorption. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìBut this [initial
development towards oneself] refers to [making oneself] an example.î Practicing
towards oneself is to make ourself an example. ìI am happy. Just as I want to
be happy, and I dread pain, just as I want to live and not to die, so do other
beings.î So may they be happy, live long and so on. In order to make ourselves
an example first we practice loving-kindness towards ourselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Practicing
loving-kindness towards ouselves will not lead to the attainment of any
absorption. ìFor even if he developed loving-kindness for a hundred or a
thousand years in this way..absorption would never arise.î But it is best to
begin with ourselves and then to practice towards other beings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†</span>In paragraph 10 ìfor even if he developed
loving-kindness for a hundred or a thousand years in this way ë<u>I am happyíí</u>.î
Actually it is not ëI am happyí but ëMay I be happyí. When you practice
loving-kindness towards yourself, you say to yourself ëMay I be happyí. You
repeat<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>it in your mind ëMay I be happy.
May I be happy.í The P»ƒi word for ëI am happyí and ëMay I be happyí is the
same. In P»ƒi it is aha— avero homi. ëAvero homií may mean either ëI am happyí
or ëMay I be happyí. Here it means may I be happy. When you practice
loving-kindness towards yourself, you do not say ëI am happy. I am happyí, but
you say ëMay I be happyí. So it is taking oneself as an example.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>ìI visited all
quarters with my mind</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Nor found I any
dearer than myself,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Self is
likewise to every other dear;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Who loves
himself should (not ëwillí) never harm another.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you look at all beings, there is no one dearer than
yourself. For other persons it is also the same. If you love yourself, you do
not harm others. So he should pervade himself with loving-kindness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAfter that, in
order to proceed easily, he can recollect such gifts, kind words, etc., as
inspire love and endearment, such virtue, learning, etc., as inspire respect
and reverence met with in a teacher or his equivalent or a preceptor or his
equivalent, developing loving-kindness towards him<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>in the way beginning ëMay this good man be
happy and free from sufferingí.î After practicing towards ourselves, we
practice towards a person. Because the book is written for monks it says it
should be practiced towards a teacher or towards a preceptor. Or it should be
for someone who is like a teacher or who is like a preceptor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>When I teach
meditation, my sequence of sentences is: ìMay I be well, happy and peaceful;
may my teachers be well, happy and peaceful.î Only after that do I say ìMay my
parents be well, happy and peaceful.î That is because for monks, for those who
have left the home-life teachers come first before parents. Parents are left
behind. Teachers are like parents to a monk. We put teachers before parents.
But lay people may practice towards parents first and teachers later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìBut if this
bhikkhu does not rest content with just that much and wants to break down the
barriers, he should next after that, develop loving-kindness towards a very
dearly loved friend.î After practicing towards a revered teacher, one should
practice towards a very dearly loved friend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThen towards a
neutral person, <u>as a very dearly loved friend</u>î - ëas a dearly loved
friendí is not correct. Venerable ©»”amoli misunderstood some words here. What
is meant here is after the very dearly loved friend he practices towards a
neutral person. Then after the neutral person he practices towards the hostile
person. So first you practice towards a very dearly loved friend. When you have
practiced for some time, you gain familiarity with the practice. Then you move
to a neutral person. Then after practicing towards a neutral person, you move
towards a hostile person if there is any.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAnd while he does
so, he should make his mind malleable and wieldy in each instance before
passing on to the next.î That means not to do like we do every day. We say ìMay
I be well, happy and peaceful; may my friends be well, happy and peaceful; may
the indifferent persons be well, happy and peaceful; may the unfriendly persons
(That means the hostile persons.) be well, happy and peaceful.î We are doing
all that in one sitting. But in fact what we should do is practice towards a
dearly loved person for some days. Then we should practice for some days
towards a neutral person and then towards a hostile person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: In paragraph 12 it says ìthen towards a neutral
person as a very dearly loved friendî -</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: No, that is not so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: That should be eliminated?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: ëAs a very dearly loved friendí - that should go.
And also ìthen towards a hostile person <u>as neutral</u>î - ëas neutralí
should go.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>If you have no
enemy, the you donít have to do that. ìBut if he has no enemy, or he is of the
type of a great man who does not perceive another as an enemy even when the
other does him harm, he should not interest himself as follows: ëNow that my
consciousness of loving-kindness has become wieldy towards a neutral person, I
shall apply it to a hostile oneí.î This is because he has no hostile persons.
He has no enemies. And he should not find one and practice this. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Wit regard to
practicing towards a hostile person we come to some problems here. ìIf
resentment arises in him when he applies his mind to a hostile person because
he remembers wrongs done by that person, he should get rid of the resentment by
entering repeatedly into loving-kindness [jh»na] towards any of the
first-mentioned persons and then, after he has emerged each time, directing
loving-kindness towards that person.î<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>These are the ways of getting rid of resentment. But this first way is
something like strange. Donít you find it strange? We donít know how to
practice loving-kindness meditation. We are going to practice loving-kindness
meditation. He instructs us to enter into jh»na to get rid of resentment. We
donít even practice loving-kindness yet. Here the author is saying you should
go into jh»na to get rid of resentment. I donít know why it is put at the
beginning. Maybe it should go at the end. That is the first one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>ìBut if it does
not die out in spite of his efforts, then:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††††† </span>Let him
reflect upon the saw</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††††† </span>With other
figures of such kind,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††††† </span>And strive,
and strive repeatedly,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††††† </span>To leave
resentment far behind.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That means to reflect<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>upon the simile of the saw and other teachings, teachings of the Suttas.
ìHe should admonish himself this way: ëNow, you who get angry, has not the
Blessed One said this: ìBhikkhus, even if bandits brutally severed limb from
limb with a two-handled saw, he who entertained hate in his heart on that
account would not be one who carried out my teaching.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>I always point out
this teaching. I think when Jesus said ìGive the other cheekî, he was just
echoing this piece of advice. He may have learned these teachings when he was
in India. Some people believe that during the lost years he went to India and
learned from Buddhist monks there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then the others:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>ìTo repay angry
men in kind</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Is worse than
to be angry first;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Repay angry men
not in kind</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>And win a
battle hard to win.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I like this very much. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>ìThe weal of both
he does promote,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>His own and
then otherís too,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Who shall
anotherís anger know</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>And mindfully
maintain his peace.í</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìTo repay angry men in kind is worse than to be angry first.
Repay not angry men in kind and win a battle hard to win.î If somebody gets
angry with you and you donít get angry, reckon yourself as having won a battle
hard to win.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then there are some
other Suttas. ìBhikkhus, there are seven things gratifying and helpful to an
enemy that happen to one who is angry, whether a man or a woman.î I hope you
have read all of these. There are some things which your enemy wants you to be
or not to be. Why let them get their satisfaction by being angry? That is the
gist of this Sutta.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAs a log from a
pyre, burnt at both ends and fouled in the middle, serves neither for timber in
the village nor for timber in the forest, so is such a person as this I say.î A
person who gets angry is like a stick used in cremating dead bodies. It cannot
be used as timber in the village or in the forest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìIf you are angry
now, you will be one who does not carry out the Blessed Oneís teaching; by
repaying an angry man in kind you will be worse than the angry man and not win
the battle hard to win; you will yourself do to yourself the things that help
your enemy; and you will be a pyre log.î This is the second method of getting
rid of resentment. This is reflecting upon the teachings of the Buddha with
regard resentment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††† </span>Then we have the
third one. ìIf his resentment subsides when he strives and makes effort in this
way, it is good. If not then he should remove irritation by remembering some
controlled and purified state in that person, which inspires confidence when
remembered.î When you are angry with some person, try to see good things in him
instead of seeing bad things in him. When we are angry with someone, we tend to
see only the bad things in him. We donít want to see or we refuse to see the
good things in him. Here the advice is to remember ìsome controlled or purified
state in that person.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That means to remember the good things in him. Remembering
them your resentment may disappear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then the advice
given here is that there are people who are purified and controlled as to their
bodily actions, or as to their verbal actions, or as to their mental actions.
Try to find whatever is good in him. It may be his bodily actions, or his
speech, or his mind. Whatever is good in him try to see it. Try to get rid of
resentment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìBut there may be
another in whom not even one of these three things is controlled.î What about a
person who has none of these? It is said that some person may be good in his
bodily behaviour, but not in his speech. Or there may be someone who is
controlled in speech but not in his bodily behaviour. But what if there is a
person who does not even have one of these three things? ìThen compassion for
that person should be aroused thus.î Here instead of practicing mett» you
practice compassion (karu”») towards that person. ìThough he is going about in
the human world now nevertheless after a certain number of days he will find
himself in [one of] the great hells or the sixteen prominent hells. For
irritation subsides too through compassion.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>What about a person
who has all three of these controlled states? ìThen he can remember any of the
three in that person, whichever he likes; for the development of
loving-kindnesstowards such a person is easy.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAnd in order to
make the meaning of this clear the following Sutta from the Book of Fives
should be acted in full.î So he wants us to read the Sutta in full. That is in
Gradual Sayings, third volume, page 137.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The fourth method
is to admonish yourself thus:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††† </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†</span>ìSuppose an enemy has hurt</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>You now in what
is his domain,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Why try
yourself as well to hurt</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Your mind? -
That is not his domain.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is ëhis domainí ? ëHis domainí means my body. He has
hurt me bodily. ìWhy try yourself as well to hurt your mind?î When you get
angry, your mind is also hurt. So why do you do that?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: So he can hurt your body, but hurting your mind is
your doing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Thatís right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††† </span>ì<u>In tears</u>
you left your family.î That is not so. ìYou left your family who were in
tears.î You left them and they were crying when you left. It is not that you
left with tears. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Maybe both.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: No, no. Because you have thought about it
thoroughly and decided to leave them. So you do not feel any regret or sorrow
in leaving them. But your parents or your family members may not want you to go
forth. So they may be crying. So ëin tearsí is describing your family, but not
you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>ìYou left your
family who were in tears.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>They had been
kind and helpful too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††</span>So why not leave your enemy,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††††† </span>The anger that
brings harm to you?î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You left your family who were kind to you. Why donít you
leave your enemy the anger that brings harm to you?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>ìThis anger that
you entertain</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Is gnawing at
the very roots</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Of all the
virtues that you guard -</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Who is there
suchh a fool as you?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

ignoble deeds, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>So you are
angry - How is this?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Do you then
want to copy too</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>The sort of
acts that he commits?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Suppose another,
to annoy, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Provokes you
with some odious act, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Why suffer
anger to spring up,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>And do as he
would have you do?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>If you get
angry, then maybe</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>You make him
suffer, maybe not;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Though with the
hurt that anger brings</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>You certainly
are punished now.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That means right now you inflict yourself with anger which
is suffering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>ìIf anger-blinded
enemies</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Set out to
tread the path of woe,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Do you by
getting angry too</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Intend to
follow heel to toe?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>If hurt is done
you by a foe</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Because of
anger on your part,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Then put your
anger down, for why</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††††† </span>Should you be
harassed groundlessly?î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That means your anger is put on a wrong object. ìIf hurt is
done you by a foe because of anger on your partî - that really means because
you are there the other peerson can hurt you. So actually you are the cause of
his hurting you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThen put your
anger down, for why should you be harassed groundlessly.î ëGroundlesslyí here
means that you are vexed on a wrong object. You should be angry with yourself
or something like that because you are also the cause of this hurt that is done
by another person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>ìSince states
last but a momentís time</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Those
aggregates, by which was done</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>The odious act,
have ceased, so now</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††††† </span>What is it you
are angry with?î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That is applying the Law of Impermanence here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>ìWhom shall he
hurt, who seeks to hurt</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Another, in the
otherís absence?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Your presence
is the cause of hurt; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Why are you
angry, then, with him?î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yourself is the cause. This is admonishing oneself with
these reflections or considerations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then the next one,
the fifth one is: ìHe should review the fact that he himself and others are
owners of their deeds (kamma).î That means review the Law of Kamma. ìWill not
this kamma of yours that has anger as its source lead to your own harm? For you
are the owner of your deeds, heir of your deedsî and so on. When you get angry,
you have unwholesome mental states (akusala). This akusala will give you
painful results because beings are owners of their deeds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAnd this is not
the kind of deed to bring you to full enlightenment, to undeclared
enlightenment.î ëUndeclared enlightenmentí is the translation here of Pacceka
Buddha.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Pacceka?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Yes, in Sanskrit ëpratyekaí. They are in some ways
like Buddhas and in some ways like Arahants. They are a step higher than the
Arahants but lower than the Buddhas. The Buddha is called ësamm»sambuddhaí.
ëSamm»í means rightly. ëSamí means by oneself. ëBuddhaí means enlightenment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: How do you admonish yourself? It seems like if you
were angry with yourself or somebody, it creates problems. It seems like there
needs to be some kind of control of what you are doing. It says he should
admonish himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: The verses given are how you admonish yourself.
That means you talk to yourself. You reflect on the meaning of the verses. I am
angry with him. Since I have anger in my mind, I am hurting myself. So why
should I get angry? Talking to oneself is what is meant by admonishing here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>So Pacceka Buddha -
the P»ƒi word ëpaccekaí means separate, so separate Buddhas. They become a
Buddha without the help of any person. That is why they are called ëSambuddhaí.
They are self-enlightenend ones. But they are not called ësamm»sambuddhaí
because they are not as great as the fully enlightened ones. Here it is
translated as ëundeclared enlightenmentí. Maybe the word ëundeclaredí is used
because the Pacceka Buddhas do not usually live in the villages or the cities.
They are ones who want to be secluded and live in the Himalayas. They seldom
visit or go to the places where human beings live. That is why they are called
ëundeclared Buddhasí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>So this anger will
not bring you to full enlightenment as a Buddha, or to enlightenment as a
Pacceka Buddha, or to enlightenment as a disciple and so on. So you talk to
yourself in this way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Also as you reflect
on yourself, you reflect on the other person. Now he is angry with me. His
anger will not lead him to enlightenment as a Buddha and so on. The anger will
give him painful results. In this way you may be able to get rid of resentment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The next, the sixth
one is to review the special qualities of the Masterís former conduct. You must
think of the Bodhisatta.In the Buddhaís lives as a Bodhisatta he had done many
noble things. By reflecting on his former conduct you may be able to get rid of
resentment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>A number of J»takas
are referred to here. The first one is the S lavant Birth Story. Do you have
the J»taka book here?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Yes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: You can find these J»takas in that book. ìWhen his
friends rose to prevent his kingdom of 300 leagues being seized by an enemy
king who had been incited by a wicked minister in whose mind his own queen had
sown hate for him, he did not allow them to lift a weapon.î The other king
seized him and buried him to the neck and he was left at the cemetery with the
other ministers. Even though he was treated that way, he did not get angry with
that king. With much effort he got out of that state and went back to his
palace. Then he made peace with the other king. The king whose name was
S lavant practiced patience or forbearance with the other king who tried to
kill him. In the same way you should not have anger towards such persons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In paragraph 28 the
second story is about Khantiv»di. The Bodhisatta was a hermit at that time. He
practiced patience at that time. The king was a very cruel person at that time.
The king met the hermit and asked ìWhat are you?î The hermit answered ìI am a
monk.î Then the king asked ìWhat do you practice?î He answered ìI am a preacher
of patience.î<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>ìThe king had him flogged
with scourges of thorns and had his hands and feet cut off, he felt not the
slightest anger.î Although his hands and feet were cut off he did not feel any
anger towards that king.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>When the king left
the hermit, a general came and asked him to get angry with the king. ìPlease
hate the king. Please get angry with the king, so he will not suffer such
painful consequences.î The hermit said ìPeople like me do not hate. People like
me do not get angry.î That is what he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The next one is
about C|ƒa-Dhammap»la. The Bodhisatta was a child in this story. He was killed
by his own father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The next J»taka is
about an elephant. The Bodhisatta was reborn as an elephant at that time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>ìThe elephant,
when struck by the stout shaft,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Addressed the
hunter with no hate in mind:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>ëWhat is your
aim? What is the reason why</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>You kill me
thus? What can your purpose be?î<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Actually what the elephant said was: ìWhose order was this?,
Whose order is this?î, not ëwhat can your purpose be?í The elephant asked who
had ordered him to be killed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The hunter had been
ordered by the queen to kill the elephant because the elephant had a tusk. It
is said that the tusk had six kinds of rays, rays of six colors. That is why
the elephant was called ëChaddantaí. ëChaí means six. ëDantaí means tusk. It is
not six tusks but six-colored tusks. Although the elephant could easily kill
the hunter, he did not. He practiced patience or forbearance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The next J»taka is
about a great monkey. The Bodhisatta was born as a great monkey at that time.
The great monkey saved a man from a rocky chasm, a rocky pit. The man could not
get out of the pit by himself. So the monkey saved him. After saving him the
monkey was tired. So he said to the man ìLet me rest a little and put my head
on your lap.î While he was resting the man thought:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>ìNow this is food
for human kind</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Like other
forest animals</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>So why then
should a hungry man</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Not kill the
ape to eat?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Iíll travel
independently (Actually it is Iíll travel satiated.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Taking his meat
as a provision;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Thus I shall
cross the waste, and that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Will furnish my
viatcum.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So he struck the great monkey with a big rock, but the
monkey was not killed. His head was broken. So he climbed up a tree and said
ìYou are a very ungrateful person. As I am a Bodhisatta, I will not hurt you. I
will not kill you. I will even show you the way out of this wilderness.î The
monkey jumped from tree to tree. The blood from his head dropped to the earth.
Following those drops of blood the man was able to get out of the waste or
wilderness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The next J»taka is
about a serpent king. The Bodhisatta was reborn as a serpent in this Sutta. He
had power but he did not use his power to kill his tormentors. This is
B|ridatta.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The next is another
serpent. In another life Buddha was reborn as a serpent. It is the same thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>In paragraph 34 the
Bodhisatta was reborn as the roya n»ga, Sa~khap»la. It is a royal n»ga again.
So the Buddha was reborn as a snake for many lives. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>There are some
people who find it difficult to accept that a person could die here and be
reborn as a snake. They find it hard to believe that a human being could die
and be reborn as a snake or an an animal because they are thinking of
evolution. It is not evolution. It is just that a person dies here and is
reborn there as a result of his kamma. It is possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The other day I was
reading a book about past lives. In that book the author said he regressed
patients back to former lives. He was asking one patient what did you see then.
So in one life the patient said ìI am a dog now.î So he remembered his past
life as a dog or a wolf there. It was reported in that book.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In Myanmar there
was a monk who said that he had been a snake. As a snake he ate eggs. One day
when he was looking for an egg, a man saw him and killed him with a spear. The
snake did not die quickly. He was put on a heap of rubbish and left to die. He
died and was reborn as the son of that man. When he grew up, he could remember
his past life as a snake. He remembered how he had suffered before he died
after he was struck by the spear. He was so apprehensive, he was so afraid of
suffering that he became a monk so that he might not be reborn as a snake
again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Such things can
happen. You can find people that have been animals in their past lives. Some
may not want to tell you or some just donít remember. There are people who have
been reborn as animals and remember those lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>There are so many
stories. The next one is M»tuposaka. Here it is an elephant. ìNow it is in the
highest degree improper and unbecoming to you to arouse thoughts of resentment,
since you are <u>emulating</u> as your Master that Blessed One. The P»ƒi word
means that you are pointing to him as your Master. You are referring to him as
your Master. It is not ëemulatingí.You are claiming the Buddha is your Master.
So we should review the qualities of the Masterís former conduct.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìHe should review
the Suttas that deal with the beginninglessness [of the round of rebirths].î
Beings have lives in the past and they will have lives in the future. This
series of lives is called ëthe round of rebirthí. Nobody knows or nobobody can
tell when this round of rebirth begins. That is why the round of rebirth is
called ëbeginninglessí. There is no beginning although we know there is a
middle. We are in the middle of this round of rebirths. There will be many more
rebirths and there have been millions of rebirths in the past. We do not know
the beginning of it or the beginning of it cannot be known.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In this
beginingless round of rebirths the person with whom you are angry has been your
father, your mother, your brother, your sister and so on. So Buddha said it is
very difficult in this sa—s»ra to find a person who has not been your father,
your mother and so on. So that person with whom you are angry might have been
your father or your mother in your past life. So it is not proper to be angry
with him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The reference is
given as S., 2, 189-190. That is the Sa—yutta Nik»ya. The Sa—yutta Nik»ya is
translated as Kindred Sayings. So in the English translation it is in Kindred
Sayings, volume 2, page 128. These references in the book are for the P»ƒi
Texts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The next method is
to review the advantages of loving-kindness. There are eleven advantages to be
gained from the practice of loving-kindness. They will be explained in detail
towards the end of the chapter. So if you are angry and do not practice
loving-kindness, you will not get these advantages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The next one is the
resolution into elements. You resolve that person into elements. ìNow you who
have gone forth into homelessness, when you are angry with him, what is it you
are angry with? Is it head hairs you are angry with? Or body hairs? Or nails?
Or teeth? Or skin?î and so on. So you ask yourself are you angry with head
hairs and so on. That is the resolution into elements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>I always say cut
him into pieces. If you are familiar with the teaching of aggregates, you may
say ìAm I angry with material aggregate, or consciousnesss aggregate, or
formation aggregate?î and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The last one is to
try the giving of a gift. So when you are angry with a person, give him a gift.
ìIt can either be given by himself to the other or accepted by himself from the
other.î You may accept a gift given by him for you or you may give him a gift.
You may give him a present. That is because when a person accepts a present,
the mind becomes soft. So you may be able to get rid of resentment in this way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>A story is given
here. ìAs happened to the senior elder who received a bowl given to him at the
Cittapabbata Monastery by an almsfood-eater elder who had been three times made
to move from his lodgingby him, and who presented it with these words
ëVenerable sir, this bowl worth eight ducats was given by my mother who is a
lay devotee, and it is rightly obtainedí, let the good lay devotee acquire
merití.î The other monk maybe was a resentful monk. He made the other monk give
up his lodging three times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>You know when you
are living in a monastery which is the property of the Sa~gha, you are given a
place to live. It may be a small room. But if a monk comes who is senior to you
and there are no other places to give to him, then you have to give your place
to that monk. That is because he is senior to you, he is older than you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>So that monk went
there and got his place three times, I think out of malice. So the other monk
donated a bowl to him saying ìThis bowl worth eight ducats was given to me by
my mother who is a lay devoteeî and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>ìA gift for
taming the untamed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>A gift for
every kind of good.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Giving accomplishes everything. That is what is said here.
By giving you can do anything. It is something like that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>We should not apply
this wrongly. Especially in our countries in Asia we say ìGiving accomplishes
everything. So give him a bribe.î Once a car was stopped by a policeman in this
country. The grandchild was driving and her grandmother was with her. The
grandmother said ìGive him some pocket-money or give him a bribe.î Then the
girl said ìGrandmother, it is not Myanmar. We cannot do that here.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Now we have the
breaking down of barriers. ìWhen his resentment towards that hostile person has
been allayed, then he can turn his mind with loving-kindness towards that
person too, just as towards one who is dearî and so on. After reflecting in
different ways, then you will be able to get rid of resentment. Then you
practice towards him too until the barriers are broken. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThe <u>characteristic</u>
of it is this.î I think - can you say ëindication of thisí? That means you may
judge from this when the barriers are broken and when they are not. The P»ƒi
word is ëlakkha”aí. ëLakkha”aí is usually translated as characteristic.
Sometimes it may be translated differently. I think ëindicationí is better
here. ìThe indication of it is this.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then there is a
story about four persons. The robbers come and ask to give one person for
sacrifice. If you can yourself or any other person, you have not broken down
the barriers. Only when you cannot give anyone are the barriers broken. If you
say ìTake me to be killed. Do not take them.î, then you are not impartial. You
want your own destruction. That is partiality towards others. So you have not
broken the barriers if you say that. The barriers are only broken when you say
ìDo not take any person.î You see the other three persons as yourself. You do
not find anybody to be given for the sacrifice. Only then are the barriers
broken. That means you see these four kinds of persons equally, imparitally.
When the barriers are broken, you are said to gain the sign and access. Here
there is no special gaining of access concentration, but when the barriers are
broken, you are said to gain access concentration. After you have access
concentration, you go on until you get jh»na. ìAt this point he has attained
the first jh»na which abandons<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>five
factorsî and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then we have the
Texts and the Commentary. In the explanation of the words and how to practice
meditation the practice of mett» meditation is given according to what is
taught in the Pa‘isambhid»magga. That is the 528 ways of practicing mett».
Please look at the handout today. This is how we practice mett» in 528 ways. If
you look at the first column there are twelve kinds of persons to whom we send
thoughts of loving-kindness. In the second column are the ten directions - the
four cardinal directions, the four corners, and down and up. In the third
column are the four modes of loving-kindness - May they be free from enmity.
May they be free from displeasure. May they be free from affliction. May they
live happily or keep themselves happily. In these four ways we practice towards
persons. We can practice mett» following this chart in 528 ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>If you look at
column one, there should be some space between #5 and #6. The first five are
called ënon-specific pervasioní. From #6 through #12 there is specific
pervasion. When we say all beings, we mean all beings. ëAll breathing thingsí
means all beings. ëAll creaturesí means all beings. ëAll personsí means all
beings. ëAll those who have personalityí means all beings. The first five mean
all beings without specification. Then for #6 we say ìmay all womenî, so in
that case no men are specified. Then we say ìmay all menî and no women are
specified.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>When we practice
loving-kindness meditation, we combine these three columns in different ways.
First we say ìMay all beings be free from enmity, free from displeasure, free
from affliction and live happily.î Then we say ìMay all breathing things be
free from enmity, free from displeasure, free from affliction and live happilyî
and so on. Then we come to #12. ìMay all beings in states of loss be free from
enmity, free from displeasure, free from affliction and live happily.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Next we combine it
with directions. In P»ƒi the word for direction comes first, but in English it
comes later. So it is a little strange. So you say ìMay all beings in the
eastern direction be free from enmity, free from displeasure, free from
affliction and live happily.î May all breathing things, may allcreatures, may
all persons and so on in the eastern direction be free from enmity and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Following this you
practice toward 48 in non-specific mode and 480 in the specific mode. So in
this way there are 528 ways of practicing mett». We have practiced this a
number of times in this country. It takes about 45 or 50 minutes to practice
all 528.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In paragraph 53
there is the explanation of the word ësattaí. A being is called ësattaí because
ìany craving for it, has held (satta) it, has gripped (visatta) it, that is why
ëa being (satta)í is said.î A being is called a ësattaí because he is attached
to his life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìBut in ordinary
speech this term of common usage is applied also to those who are without
greed, just as the term of common usage ëpalm fan (t»lavanta)í is used for
different sorts of fans [in general] even if made of split bamboo.î A being is
called ësattaí. Why is he called ësattaí? Because he has attachment to things.
What about calling an Arahant a ësattaí? An Arahant is also called a being. An
Arahant is a person who has eradicated all mental defilements. He has no
attachment at all. Still he is called a ësattaí. The Commentator explains ìIn
ordinary speech this term of common usage is applied also to those who are
without greed.î Although literally ësattaí means a person who has attachment,
it is applied both to beings who have attachment and those who do not have
attachment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The author points
out the P»ƒi word ët»lavantaí as an example. ëT»lavantaí means a fan made of
palm leaves. This word is used for other fans as well whether they are made of
palm leaves or not. Now they are made of paper or split bamboo, but still they
are called ët»lavantaí in P»ƒi. In the same way a person who has attachment is
called ësattaí and a person who does not have attachment is called ësattaí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Can you give me
some examples in English? You know what is meant here? There is a town called
29 Palms near Palm Springs. There may be more than 29 palms now or less than 29
palms, but the city is still called 29 Palms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>I looked up the
word ëpení in the dictionary. What is the original meaning of the word ëpení?
It comes from French and Latin. The original meaning is feather. So at first
pens were made of feathers or quills. Now pens are not made of feathers or
quills but we still call them ëpensí. So it is usage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In paragraph 54
there is an interesting word, ëpuggalaí. ì ë<u>Pum</u>í is what hell is
called.î Actually it is ëputí. In Sanskrit it is ëputí. ìThey fall (galanti)
into that, is the meaning.î The P»ƒi word is puggala and the Sanskrit word is
pudgala. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>This word is
interesting because it reflects a certain belief in Hinduism. According to
Hinduism you will go to hell after death if you do not have offspring, if you
do not have sons and daughters. If you live without having a son or a daughter,
you will go to hell. That is why brahmans always point out to monks that we are
the ones who are going to hell. We have no family. We have no offspring. It is
a brahman belief. That is why they have to be householders for some years. Even
though they want to become monks, they have to be householders for some years
and have a family. Then they can leave the family. So those who have no sons or
daughters will go to hell. ëPuggalaí means those who are going to hell, such
persons. But later on ëpuggalaí came to be applied to every being.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The word for son in
P»ƒi is ëputtaí and in Sanskrit it is ëputraí. ëTraí means to protect. ëPutraí
means a person who protects you from hell because when you have a son, you
wonít go to hell. You are protected from hell. So a son is the person who
protects you from going to hell. He is called ëputraí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: That is the same word as in S»riputta?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Thatís right. Later on it just meant a son. This is
a Hindu belief, but the word was used by Hindus as well as Buddhists. I think
the others you can read by yourselves. For next week read until the end of the
first immaterial jh»na.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>I thought that I
had finished loving-kindness, but I think that I will go back a little. When
you practice loving-kindness, first you try to see the danger in anger or in
hate and also you try to see the advantages in patience. Then you practice
loving-kindness first towards yourself, later towards a person who is dear,
then towards a neutral person, and lastly towards an enemy. When you are able
to break down the barriers - that means when you have mental impartiality
towards these four kinds of persons, you are said to have broken the barriers.
With the breaking of barriers comes access concentration. In other kinds of
meditation we can say at this point you get the learning sign and at another
point you get the counterpart sign. But here there is no separate learning sign
and counterpart sign. There is no special sign. When you have broken the
barriers, you are said to have obtained the counterpart sign. At that moment
you also obtain the access concentration. Then you dwell on the beings and
cultivate further so that you obtain jh»na. With mett» one can get up to the
third jh»na with the fourfold method and the fourth jh»na in the fivefold
method.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then we have the
Texts and Commentary beginning with paragraph 44. The Text given here is a
stock-phrase Text<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>found in many Suttas
and also in Abhidhamma. The references given here are from Vibha~ga which is in
Abhidhamma and D gha Nik»ya which is in Sutta Pi‘aka. In Sutta Pi‘aka and
Abhidhamma Pi‘aka you find this passage again and again whenever
loving-kindness meditation is described.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then there is the
explanation of the words. In paragraph 47 about the middle ìJust as to oneself;
equality with oneself without making the distinction ëThis is another beingí,
is what is meant. Or alternatively equally (sabbattat»ya),with the whole state
of mind; not reserving even a little, is what is meant.î What it really means
here is not being distracted outside even a little. So with the whole state of
mind you practice loving-kindness meditation, not to be distracted outside even
a little.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then in about the
middle of paragraph 48 ìmeasureless through familiarity and through having
measureless beings as its objectî - so it is called ëmeasurelessí because it is
practiced again and again. So you are very familiar with that meditation, that
kind of jh»na. Or it can mean it is measureless through having measureless
beings as its object. Since its object is measureless, it is also called
ëmeasurelessí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: In paragraph 48 it says ìendued with
loving-kindnessî. Is ëenduedí right or do they mean ëembuedí?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Endued with loving-kindness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Shouldnít it be ëembuedí?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Endued, yes. I think they mean the same thing. It
means endowed with or embued with.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then there is the
description of the 528 modes of loving-kindness. That was explained last week.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In paragraph 53
there is the explanation of the word ëbeing (satta)í. ìThey are held (satta),
gripped (visatta) by desire.î The P»ƒi word is just to be attached. ëVisattaí
means very attached to by way of desire. So they are called ësattaí in P»ƒi.
Those who have no greed are also called ësattaí because it is the common term
or usage for beings actually.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The example given
here is t»lavanta in P»ƒi. ëT»lavantaí means palm fan, a fan made of palm
leaves. Later on anything which is used to fan is called a ët»lavantaí whether
it is made with palm leaves or whatever. The same name is applied to that
thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Last time I pointed
out the word ëpení in English. ëPení really means a feather. Even though it may
not be a feather, still it is called ëpení.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Do you see the word
ëakkhara-cintakaí? ìHowever, [in the world] etymologists (akkhara-cintaka) who
do not consider meaning have it that it is a mere name.î ëAkkharaí means
letters and ëcintakaí means fingers, so the fingers of letters. That means
grammarians or etymologists. There are two kinds of etymologists here. One kind
of etymologist did not search for the meaning of the word, the literal meaning
of the word. They said it is just a name given to the being. So donít worry
whether it means to be attached to or whatever. So it is a mere name for them.
ìWhile those who consider meaningî - there are other kinds of etymologists who
said it has a meaning. They said that the word comes from ësattvaí in Sanskrit.
A being is called ësattvaí because it has a bright principle, ësattvaí. This
refers to the teaching of the Samkhya system in Indian philosophy. Samkhya
system teaches that there are three principles - the sattva, rajas and tamas.
They are given in footnote 6. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>I think that I
talked about ëpuggalaí last time. ëPutí means hell and ëgalaí means to fall, so
falling to hell. Those who fall to hell are puggala. The Hindu belief is that
you go to hell if you do not have any offspring.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In footnote 7 ìHere
when the aggregates are not fully understood, there is naming (abhid»na) of
them and <u>of the</u> consciousnessî - I think ëof theí should go. ìThere is
naming of them and consciousness of them as self (att»).î That means we do not
understand the real nature of them as aggregates, we call or give a name to
these aggregates, self (att»). We understand it as att». So ëconsciousnessí
here really means understanding. We know or understand these aggregates as
att». ìThat is to say, the physical body or alternatively the five aggregates.î
The Sub-Commentary is explaining the word ëatt»bh»vaí. You can find the word in
paragraph 54. Personality (att»bh»va) is explained here. ëAtt»í means att» and
bh»vaí means something arising from it. ëSomethingí here means the naming and
knowing. Naming and knowing arise from it. Therefore it is called ëbh»vaí. How
naming and how knowing? Knowing as att». So that is called ëatt»bh»vaí in P»ƒi
or in Sanskrit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In paragraph 56
ìAnd here may all beings be free from enmity is one absorption.î The
Sub-Commentary also said something about absorption or jh»na here. The word
used is appan». Appan» is normally translated as absorption or jh»na. But I
think if we translate it as something like application, it makes more sense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>When we practice
loving-kindness meditation, we practice in four ways. May all beings be free
from enmity, that is one. May all beings be free from affliction, that is the
second one. May all beings be free from anxiety, that is the third one. May
they live happily, that is the fourth one. Each one is an application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The Sub-Commentary
explains that you can get jh»na just by saying this one sentence - ìMay all
beings be free from enmity. May all beings be free from enmity. May all beings
be free from enmity.î This is called ëone absorptioní or ëone applicationí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In the explanation
of these ëfree from afflictioní means free from mental affliction. ëFree from
anxietyí I think is not an accurate translation. The P»ƒi word is anigha. That
means free from dukkha. You may have noticed on the sheet I gave you last week
that I changed them. The second application is translated as ìMay all beings be
free from displeasure.î The third application is translated as ìmay all beings
be free from affliction.î ëFree from afflictioní means free from bodily
suffering, free from pain. ëFree from displeasureí means free from domanassa or
mental affliction. The fourth one is ìMay they live happily.î Literally it
means may they hold themselves happily or may they maintain their bodies or
themselves happily. It is all right if we just say ìMay they live happily.î So
there are four absorptions, four applications. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then there are
eleven benefits to be enjoyed from the practice of loving-kindness meditation.
One sleeps in comfort, one wakes up in comfort and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In paragraph 71
references are given for ìlike fire in the case of the lay woman devotee
Uttar»î. You are referred to chapter 12, paragraph 34. You will come to that
later, not now, not today. On<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>ëDhaí
refers to the Commentary the Dhammapada. If you want to read the story in more
detail you may read the book Buddhist Legends, part 3, page 103. ìLike the
poison in the case of the Sa—yutta Reciter the Elder C|ƒa-S vaî - we donít know
this story because the Sub-Commentary did not explain this. Maybe it was very
well-known at the time this Commentary was written down. But now nobody knows
about this Elder C|ƒa-S va. ìLike the knife in the case of the novice Sa~kiccaî
- this also is in the Commentary to the Dhammapada. You may read the same book
Buddhist Legends, part 2, page 238 and the following pages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Now we go to
compassion. Compassion is karu”» in P»ƒi. It will be explained later. ìOne who
wants to develop compassion should begin his task by reviewing the danger in
lack of compassion and the advantage in compassion.î Then he practices
compassion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Compassion takes
beings in suffering or beings in distress as object. So it is a little
different than the object of loving-kindness meditation. Loving-kindness
meditation takes all beings whether they are suffering or whether they are
enjoying, so all beings. Karu”» takes all beings who are in distress, who are
suffering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>When we want to
practice karu”» meditation, we have to find a person who is in distress, who is
suffering, mentally as well as physically. So we have to find such a person. If
we cannot find such a person, what should we do?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>Then we can arouse compassion for an
evil-doing person. There may be some person doing evil. Even though he is happy
right now, he is going to suffer in his next lives. So he is the object of
compassion also. We can practice to such a person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Bhante, were people so happy at that time they
could not find a person in suffering?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: They may be having fun right now doing evil things,
but they are going to suffer the consequences of wrong doing in the next life.
You can think of that and take them as the object of karu”».</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then the comparison
is given to a man who is caught with stolen goods and who is condemned to
death. He is given food and all these things, but he was not happy. In that
story in paragraph 79 it says ìgiving him a hundred blows <u>in sets of four</u>.î
Actually it is not in sets of four, but at every crossroads. A crossroads is
called ëa set of fourí because four roads meet there. So at every crossroads he
was given a hundred blows. The people give him things to eat. Although he may
be eating and although he may even be enjoying it, he is going to suffer death.
In the same way a person who is doing evil may be enjoying himself now, but he
will suffer. So he can be the object of karu”».</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then there may be
some person who does not do evil, who does profitable deeds, but he may be
overtaken by one of the kinds of ruin beginning with the ruin of health, or
ruin of relatives, or ruin of property and so on. That person also can be the
object of karu”» meditation. A person who does not do evil things but who does
meritorious deeds, good things, may be in poor health, or may have disease, or
may have lost relatives, or may have lost his property and so on. So he can be
the object of karu”». </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In paragraph 81 the
second paragraph it says ìAnd here tooî. The ëtooí is misplaced. That should go
after ìHe <u>too</u> deserves the meditatorís compassion.î Not only the person
who does evil, but he also deserves compassion. ìHe too deserves the
meditatorís compassion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìEven with no such
ruin, thus ëIn reality he is unhappyí.î Now there is a person who does good. He
has not been overtaken by any one of the ruins. So he is well off. He is in
prosperity. What do you do with him? You can still practice karu”» towards him.
ì ëIn reality he is unhappyí, because he is not exempt from suffering of the
round [of becoming].î He is not exempt from suffering old age, disease and
death in the end. And so such a person can be the object of karu”» meditation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>So in fact anybody
can be the object of karu”» meditation, depending on how you regard that
person, how you look at him. But it is better to find a person who is in real
distress, who is in real suffering and practice karu”» towards that person. If
you cannot find such a person, then you may practice towards the other persons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Here also there is
the breaking down of barriers. Then one practices meditation until one gets
jh»na. This meditation can also lead to the attainment of third jh»na or fourth
jh»na.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The next one is
gladness (mudit»). Since it is gladness, its object must be people who are in
prosperity, who are in happiness. Beings who are in happiness are the objects
of mudit» meditation. You practice this towards a dear person and so on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In paragraph 85 it
says ëa boon companioní. What is ëa boon companioní?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>The P»ƒi word is so”…sahaya. ëSo”…aí means a
tavern, a drinking place. So”…sahaya means a drinking companion. That means a
very intimate and very kind relationship towards that person. Do you use this
word ëboon companioní?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: I donít think so. ëBooní is something like lucky or
a gift. In French there is ëbon vivantí which is a high liver or a drinker.
Thatís French though. Actually a drinking companion makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: When you practice compassion, what you do is to
reflect ìThis being indeed has been reduced to misery. If only he could be free
from this suffering.î That is how you practice compassion. That is in paragraph
78. When you practice karu”», you say ìMay he be free from suffering. May he
get free from this suffering.î That is the way of practicing compassion towards
beings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In mudit» what do
you say? ìThis being is indeed glad. How good! How excellent!î That is mudit».
So when you practice mudit», you say ìHe is happy. He is in prosperity. How
good! How excellent!î That is how you practice mudit» meditation. When you want
to practice mudit» meditation, you choose a person who is in happiness, who is
in prosperity. Then you say ìHe is happy. He is prosperous. How good! How
excellent!î You practice like that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìBut if his boon
companion or the dear person was happy in the past but is now unlucky and
unfortunate, then gladness can still be aroused by remembering his past
happiness.î Or ìIn the future he will again enjoy similar successî and so on.
You can still practice mudit» towards that person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then the is
breaking down of the barriers and so on. This meditation also leads to third
jh»na or fourth jh»na.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The last one is
upekkh» (equanimity). ìOne who wants to develop equanimity must have already
obtained the triple or quadruple jh»na in loving-kindness, and so on.î That is
if you want to attain jh»na through this meditation. First you must attain
three jh»nas or four jh»nas by the practice of loving-kindness, or compassion
or gladness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìHe should emerge
from the third jh»na [in the fourfold reckoning], after he has made it
familiar, and he should see danger in the former [three divine abidings]
because they are linked with attention given to beingís enjoyment (or given to
attachment to beings) in the way beginning ëMay they be happyí and so on.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìBecause resentment
and approval are near, and because their association with joy is grossî -
actually because they are gross due to association with joy. It is not that
association with joy is gross, but they are gross. They are said to be gross
because they are associated with joy. There is sukha with them. So they are
said to be gross. ìAnd he should also see the advantage in equanimity because
it is peaceful.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>How do you practice
equanimity towards people? What do you say? It is not given here. We will meet
it later. You just say ìBeings have kamma as their property.î Just that. It is
kamma. Beings suffer or enjoy according to their kamma. Beings have kamma as their
property, as their matrix, as their relative and so on. Thinking of the law of
Kamma is one way of practicing upekkh» meditation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìTherefore he
should arouse equanimity towards the neutral person in the way already stated.
Then <u>through the neutral one</u>î - I think ëthrough the neutral oneí should
go. It should be ìThen he should break down the barriers in each case between
the three people, that is, the dear person, then the boon companion, and then
the hostile one, and lastly himself. And he should cultivate that sign, develop
and repeatedly practice it.î Here since he has attained three jh»nas or four
jh»nas with mett» meditation and others, he reaches here the fourth jh»na or
the fifth jh»na.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìBut how then? Does
this arise in one whom the third jh»na has already arisen on the basis of the
earth kasi”a, etc.? It does not.î Not anybody who has gained jh»na with other
meditation can obtain the fourth jh»na or the fifth jh»na through upekkh». He
has to have gained jh»nas through mett», karu”» or mudit» meditation. Then he
can gain the fourth jh»na or the fifth jh»na through the last one, through
upekkh» meditation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìDoes this arise in
one whom the third jh»na has already arisen on the basis of the earth, etc.? It
does not. Why not? Because of the dissimilarity of the object.î Let us say you
get the first, second, third jh»na taking the earth kasi”a, the earth disk as
object. Then the object of your jh»na is the earth disk. Here the object of
your jh»na must be beings. So there is difference of object. ìBecause of the
dissimilarity of the object. It arises only in one in whom the third jh»na has
arisen on the basis of loving-kindness, etc., because the object is similar.î
That is the end of the four divine abidings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Now comes the
general exposition. The first part has the meanings of mett», karu”», mudit»
and upekkh». ìNow as to the meaning firstly of loving-kindness, compassion,
gladness and equanimity: it fattens, thus it is loving-kindness.î The P»ƒi word
ëmejjatií really means it sticks. So it is sticky.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìIt is gluttonous
(not solvent).î When you have mett», you are as it were glued to the person.
ìIt is gluttonous is the meaning.î , not solvent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAlso: it comes
about with respect to a friend (mitta), or it is behaviour towards a friend,
thus it is loving-kindness (mett»).î The first explanation takes it that mett»
comes from the root ëmití and the suffix ët»í. The second one takes it that the
word ëmett»í comes from the word ëmittaí. Mitta is changed to mett» by a
grammatical rule. So mett» first is derived from a root and a suffix and
secondly is derived from a word and a suffix.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The second one is
karu”». It is explained here. ìWhen there is suffering in others it causes
(karoti) good peopleís hearts to be moved (kampana), thus it is compassion
(karu”»). Or alternatively, it combats (ki”ati) othersí suffering, attacks and
demolishes it, thus it is compassion.î Here whether you really demolish the
suffering of others is not important. It is immaterial. When karu”» arises in
oneís mind, it arises in this manner. It arises in this mode of wanting to
remove suffering from others. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìOr alternatively,
it is scattered (kiriyati) upon those who suffer, it is extended to them by
pervasion, thus it is compassion (karu”»).î It is the desire for beings to be
free from suffering, to be free from distress. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The next one is
mudit». ìThose endowed with it are glad (modanti), or itself is glad (modati),
or it is the mere act of being glad (modana), thus it is gladness (mudit»).î
Mudit» is just defined as gladness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Next there is
upekkh». ìIt looks on at (upekkhati), abandoning such interestedness as
thinking ëMay they be free from enmityí and having recourse to neutrality, thus
it is equanimity (upekkh»).î Equanimity is not indifference. It takes beings as
object. It is just impartiality. It is not disregarding them all together. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then there is
discussion of the characteristics etc. of each one. ìLoving-kindness is
characterized here as promoting the aspect of welfare.î That means actually
occurring in the mode of desiring welfare. ìIts function is to prefer welfare.
It is manifested as the removal of annoyance.î I just want to say ëill willí
here. Its proximate cause is seeing lovableness in beings. It succeeds when it
makes ill will subside, and it fails when it provides (selfish) affection.î
ëSelfishí is put in parentheses. Is there unselfish affection? Here what is
meant is attachment. If you have attachment or lobha, you fail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Compassion actually
is desire to remove suffering from others. ìCompassion is characterized as
promoting the aspect of allaying suffering. Its function resides in not bearing
otherís suffering. It is manifested as non-cruelty. Its proximate cause is to
see helplessness in those overwhelmed by suffering. It succeeds when it makes
cruelty subside and it fails when it produces sorrow.î This is very important.
ìIt fails when it produces sorrow.î When you practice compassion, you just
practice compassion and you donít go into feeling sorry. That is very
important. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>When we see some
people injured by some person for example, we are not only sorry for them, but
we may be angry with the person who inflicted pain on them. When we do that, we
are going beyond the scope of compassion. We are getting into akusala,
unwholesome mental states. Compassion is a wholesome mental state, a highly
developed wholesome mental state. When we practice compassion, we just have the
desire for them to be free from suffering. We cannot say that we suffer with
them because if we suffer with them, we have unwholesome mental states in our
mind. We do not suffer with them. We have compassion for them. We sympathize
with them. That is important in karu”». Many people confuse karu”» with this
enemy, sorrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìGladness is
characterized as gladness (produced by otherís success). Its function resides
in being unenvious. It is manifested as the elimination of <u>aversion (boredom</u>).î
We were talking about aversion and boredom on my way here. The P»ƒi word used
is ëaratií. ëRatií means delight and ëaí means not. So it is non-delight in
other peopleís, other beingsí success etc. I donít think that we can call it
boredom. Perhaps aversion also is not so good here. Can you think of another
word which means non-delight?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>Mudit» is the
opposite of envy actually. When you envy somebody, you are not pleased with his
success or his prosperity. You donít take delight in his success. The word
ëaratií here means that, not taking delight in other peopleís success and so
on. ìit succeeds when it makes non-delight subside, and it fails when it
produces merriment.î That is merriment with attachment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Sometimes you say sympathetic joy for gladness?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Yes. Sympathetic joy and some also translate it as
altruistic joy. Sympathetic joy may be better because ëgladnessí can mean any
kind of gladness. Maybe here the translator wanted to be literal. ëMudit»í just
means gladness, but I think sympathetic joy is a better word for it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìEquanimity is
characterized as promoting the aspect of neutrality towards beingsî and so on.
ìIts proximate cause is seeing ownership of deeds (kamma) thus: ëBeings are
owners of their deeds. Whose [if not theirs] is the choice by which they will
become happy, or will get free from suffering, or will not fall away<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>from the success they have reached?î ëWill
get free from sufferingí refers to karu”» (compassion). ëWill not fall away
from the success they have reachedí refers to mudit». When you practice mudit»,
you may say ìMay they not fall away from this prosperity, or this success, or
this happiness.î You can say like that too. On the other page it said you may
say ìThis being is indeed glad. How good! How excellent!î You can say either
way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìIt succeeds when
it makes resentment and approval subside (Resentment is dosa and approval is
lobha.), and it fails when it produces the equanimity of unknowing.î ëThe
equanimity of unknowingí is the indifference of ignorance or just ignorance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThe general
purpose of these four divine abidings is the bliss of insight and an excellent
(form of future) existence. That peculiar to each is respectively the
warding<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>off of ill will and so on.î This
paragraph is not difficult to understand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The next paragraph
is the near and far enemies. Each one has two kinds of enemies, the near enemy
and the far enemy. ìThe divine abiding of loving-kindness has greed as its near
enemy.î That is why it is very important when you practice loving-kindness that
you do not have greed or attachment for that person. Sometimes they are very
similar. So you may take one for the other. So the near enemy is greed or
attachment since both share in seeing the good things, seeing virtues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìGreed behaves like
a foe who keeps close by a man, and it easily finds an opportunity. So
loving-kindness should be well protected from it. And ill will which is
dissimilar to the similar greed, is its far enemy like a foe ensconced in a
rock wilderness. So loving-kindness must be practiced free from fear (free from
danger) of that; for it is<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>not possible
to practice loving-kindness and feel anger simultaneously.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìCompassion has
grief based on the home life (That is feeling sorry.) as its near enemy, since
both share in seeing failure.î Cruelty is the far enemy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Now sympathetic joy
or gladness (mudit») - its near enemy is joy based on the home life. That means
becoming merry, joyful with attachment. ìAnd aversion (boredom) - or
non-delight- which is dissimilar to the similar joy, is its far enemy.î So
something like envy is its far enemy. So gladness should be practiced free from
fear or danger of that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìEquanimity has the
equanimity of unknowing based on the home life as its near enemy.î That is not
knowing, ignorance. It is ignorance that is not accompanied by pleasurable
feeling or displeasurable feeling. So this ignorance is accompanied by
indifferent feeling and shares in ignoring faults and virtues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAnd greed and
resentment, which are dissimilar to the similar unknowing are its far enemies.î
Its far enemies are greed and resentment. ìTherefore equanimity must be
practiced free from fear of that.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Each of these has
two enemies, the near enemy and the far enemy. We should be careful with both
the near enemy and the far enemy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìNow zeal (chanda)
consisting in desire to act is the beginning of all these things. Suppression
of the hindrances, etc., is the middle. Absorption is the end.î So jh»na is the
end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìTheir object is a
single living being or many living beings, as a mental object consisting in a
concept.î Because beings are a concept it is called a ëconceptí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThe extension of
the object takes place either in access or in absorption. Here is the order of
it. Just as a skilled ploughman first delimits an area and then does his
ploughing, so first a single dwelling should be delimited and loving-kindness
developed towards all beings there in the way beginning ëIn this dwelling may
all beings be free from enmityí.î Then when you have gained experience with
that, you may extend your range of loving-kindness by taking two dwellings,
three dwellings, four dwellings and so on, until the whole village, the
district, the kingdom, one direction and so on up to one world sphere, or even
beyond that. You develop loving-kindness to beings in such areas. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>That is why when I
teach loving-kindness, I teach in two ways. The first is by way of person: ìMay
I be well, happy and peaceful. May my teachers be well, happy and peaceful. May
my parents be well, happy and peaceful.î and so on. The other way is: ìMay all
beings in this building be well, happy and peaceful. May all beings in this area,
in this city, in this county, in this state, in this country, in this world, in
this universe be well, happy and peaceful.î And then ìMay all beings in general
be well, happy and peaceful.î The meditation is extended little by little.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Now the outcome,
what kind of results you can get from the practice of these four divine
abidings. ìJust as the immaterial states are the outcome of the kasi”as, and
the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception is the outcome of
concentration, and Fruition Attainment is the outcome of insight, and the
attainment of cessation is the outcome of serenity coupled with insight, so the
divine abiding of equanimity is the outcome of the first three divine
abidings.î In order to be successful in the fourth one you first have to be
successful in the first three divine abidings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìFor just as the
gable rafters cannot be placed in the air without having first set up the
scaffolding and built the framework of beams, so it is not possible to develop
the fourth jh»na in these without having already developed the third jh»na in
them.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In paragraph 104 it
says that immaterial states are the outcome of the kasi”as. ëKasi”aí really
means jh»na developed on the kasi”a. You take the kasi”a as the object of
meditation. Then you practice meditation and get jh»na. If you do not get
r|p»vacara jh»na, then you do not get ar|p»vacara jh»nas. That is why it says
the immaterial states are the outcome of the kasi”a jh»nas. ìThe base
consisting of neither perception nor non-perception is the outcome of
concentration.î The ar|p»vacara jh»na is the outcome the third ar|p»vacara
jh»na concentration. ìFruition Attainment is the outcome of insight.î When you
practice vipassan» meditation and become enlightened, you gain Fruition Attainment.
So Fruition Attainment is the outcome of insight meditation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThe attainment of
cessation is the outcome of serenity coupled with insight.î There is an
attainment called ëcessation attainmentí. That means the cessation of mental
activities. It is a very highly developed type of jh»na. In order to get into
that jh»na you must first have all the eight or nine jh»nas. You enter into
first jh»na and emerge from it. Then you enter into second jh»na, third jh»na
and so on until you reach the fourth ar|p»vacara jh»na. After emerging from the
first jh»na, you practice vipassan». Then you enter into the second jh»na (That
is samatha or serenity meditation.) and practice vipassan» on that jh»na or the
factors of jh»na. So here vipassan» and samatha go in a coupled way. It is
stated here as the outcome of serenity coupled with insight. The explanation of
the attainment will be given at the end of the book.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Now questions -
ìAnd here it may be asked: But why are loving-kindness, compassion, gladness
and equanimity, called divine abidings?î The P»ƒi word for divine abiding is
ëbrahm» vih»raí. ëVih»raí means living. Here it is translated as abiding. The
word ëbrahm»í has two meanings here. One meaning is the best and the other
meaning is faultless, so immaculate. These abidings are the best because they
are the right attitude towards beings. These are the right attitudes which we
should have towards beings. Therefore they are called ëthe bestí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAnd just as Brahm»
Gods abide with immaculate minds, so the meditators who associate themselves
with these abidings abide on an equal footing with Brahm» Gods.î The Brahmas
have immaculate minds. So their minds are not contaminated by some of the
mental defilements. A person who practices any one of these meditations is like
a Brahm». That is because the Brahm» Gods in the world of Brahm»s always
practice these four divine abidings. They live with these four divine abidings.
They have no other thing to do. So these meditations are called ëbrahm»
vih»raí. It is the abiding like that of the brahm»s. They are called divine
abidings in the sense of the best and in the sense of immaculate. They are the
best way of abiding or the faultless way of abiding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Why are they only
four? The answer that is given is that the way of purity is fourfold.
ìLoving-kindness is the way to purity for one who has much ill will, compassion
is that for one who has much cruelty, gladness is that one for one who has much
non-delight, and equanimity is that for one who has much greed.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAlso attention
given to beings is only fourfold, that is to say, as bringing welfare, as
removing suffering, as being glad at their success, and as unconcern, [that is
to say, impartial neutrality.]î That is the second.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAnd one abiding in
the measureless states should practice loving-kindness and the rest like a
mother with four sons, namely, a child, an invalid, one in the flush of youth,
and one busy with his own affairs; for she wants the child to grow up, wants
the invalid to get well, wants the one in the flush of youth to enjoy for long
the benefits of youth, and is not at all bothered about the one who is busy
with his own affairs. That is why the measureless states are only four as ëdue
to paths to purity and other sets of fourí.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then the order -
the order is just loving-kindness, compassion, gladness and equanimity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Now why are they
called measureless? In paragraph 110 ìFor their scope is measureless beings.î
That means their object is beings without measure, without exception. All of
them occur with a measureless scope for their scope is measureless beings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìInstead of
assuming a measure such as ëloving-kindness, etc., should be developed only
towards a single being, or in an area of such an extentí, they occur with
universal pervasion.î What does that mean? Then when you practice
loving-kindness towards a person, it cannot be called measureless? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The translation is
a little off the mark. What is meant here or what is written by the original
author is that even when you are practicing towards one person, it can be
called measureless because you do not limit your loving-kindness to one part of
the body.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>That is what is meant here.
ìEven in regard to a single being they occur with universal pervasion without
assuming a measure as ëloving-kindness should be developed in this much part of
himí.î So it is not like ìMay his head be well, happy and peaceful. May the
upper part of his body be well, happy and peacefulî and so on. You take the
whole being. So even with regard to a single person it can be called
measureless. Thatís what is meant here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The next topic is
producing three jh»nas and four jh»nas. The first three can produce how many
jh»nas? Three or four. The last one can produce the fourth or the fifth, only
one jh»na. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>There is a
discussion here with an opponent. Beginning with paragraph 112 there is an
argument and counterargument. The opponent pointed to a Sutta. He took the
Sutta to mean that all four or five jh»nas can be obtained by the practice of
mett», karu”» and mudit». The form we see in that Sutta may point to that if
you are not really familiar with Abhidhamma. Buddha said that after you
practice loving-kindness, you should go on making this loving-kindness with
vitakka and vic»ra, then without vitakka but with vic»ra and so on. So when you
read it superficially, you also may think that you can get all four or five
jh»nas through mett» meditation and so on. That is not so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>So the author said:
ìHe should be told: Do not put it like that. For if that were so, then
contemplation of the body, etc., would also have quadruple and quintuple
jh»na.î The Buddha taught about contemplation of the body also in the same way,
but contemplation of the body can only produce the first jh»na, not the other
jh»nas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThere is not even
the first jh»na in the contemplation of feeling <u>or in the other two.î</u>
ëOr in the other twoí is wrong. In its place we should say ìBut there is not
even the first jh»na in the contemplation of feeling, let alone the second and
so on.î When you practice feeling contemplation, you cannot get even the first
jh»na, let alone the second, third, fourth and fifth. ìSo do not misrepresent
the Blessed One by adherence to the letter.î The he explained this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In paragraph 114
about five lines down it says ìbut the Blessed One had <u>no</u> <u>confidence</u>
yet in that bhikkhu.î That was the word about which I was talking to you.
Actually the Buddha scolded that monk by saying ìSo too, some misguided men
merely question me and when the Dhamma is expounded [to them], they still fancy
that they need not follow me.î So that monk asked the Buddha to teach him, and
he did not practice. Then again he asked the Buddha to teach him. The Buddha
saw that he had the capability to become an Arahant, so this time the Buddha
taught him again. So can you give me another word like scold? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Chastise?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Chastise, yes, very good. So the Buddha chastised
him. It is not that the Buddha had no confidence in him. He misread the word.
Actually it is the right word but with an accent. So the Buddha chastised the
monk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>When you read the
Sutta, it seems to mean that you can practice loving-kindness meditation and
then you can get first, second, third, fourth and fifth jh»nas. However what
the Buddha meant there is that you practice mett» meditation and you may get
the first jh»na, second jh»na or third jh»na, but do not be content with that.
Try to get higher jh»nas by taking other subjects of meditation, not mett»
meditation. If you want to get the fourth or fifth jh»na, you have to practice
another kind of meditation, not mett» meditation. By the practice of mett»
meditation you can only get the third or fourth jh»na. That is what is meant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In footnote 17
ìMere unification of the mind: the kind of concentration (sam»dh»na) that is <u>undeveloped</u>î
- I think that is ënot too developedí is better, not ëundevelopedí because it
is a little developed, but not developed enough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Next we will go to
paragraph 119, the highest limit of each. ìAnd while they are twofold by way of
the triple-quadruple jh»na and the single remaining jh»na, still they should be
understood to be distinguishable in each case by a different efficacy
consisting in having ë<u>beauty as the highestí</u>, etc., for they are so
described in the Haliddavasana Sutta.î ëBeauty in the highestí is not a good
translation for the word. It is liberation with the beautiful as object. Here
ëliberationí means jh»nas, jh»nas which take pleasant things as object. ìSo
loving-kindness is the basic support for the liberation with the beautiful as
object.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìOne who abides in
compassion has to come to know thoroughly the danger in materiality, since
compassion is aroused in him when he sees suffering of beings that has as its <u>material
sign</u> (I think ëmaterial signí should go.) cause, form beaten with sticks,
and so on.î ëFormí means a body.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In paragraph 123
there is a lot of existent and non-existent things in that passage. What we
should keep in mind is that happiness (sukha) and pain (dukkha) are said to be
existent because they belong to paramattha. They belong to reality. Sukha as
well as dukkha are among the mental factors. Sukha is pleasurable feeling and
dukkha is displeasurable feeling. They are among the 52 mental factors or
mental states. Therefore they are said to be existent things. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>A being is non-existent
according to ultimate reality or in the ultimate sense. A being is just a
combination of mind and matter or a combination of the five aggregates. When we
say ëa beingí, it is non-existent. And when we say ësukhaí and ëdukkhaí, they
are existent. If you keep that in mind, I think you will understand paragraph
123.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Upekkh» is not
interested in the happiness of beings or in the suffering of beings. It takes
just the beings as an object, not the happiness or the suffering of beings, not
the sukha or dukkha of beings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††† </span>A person who
practices upekkh» meditation becomes skilled in taking what is non-existent,
that is beings, as object. So it is easier for such a person to take the
non-existent, the other kinds if non-existent things as object, that is the
base, which is non-existent as to individual essence<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>of consciousness, which is a reality. The
third ar|p»vacara jh»na (the third immaterial jh»na) takes the non-existence of
the first ar|p»vacara jh»na.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Non-existence
itself is non-existent. Non-existence is a concept. It is not reality. A person
who is skilled in taking concept as object when he practices upekkh» meditation
will find it easy to take the non-existent or nothingness of the first
ar|p»vacara consciousness when he tries to get the immaterial jh»nas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In order to get the
third ar|p»vacara jh»na you have to take the absence of the first aru»p»vacara
jh»na as object. You know that the ar|p»vacara jh»nas are the immaterial
jh»nas. Most of the jh»nas that we are talking about are the material jh»nas.
How to get the immaterial jh»nas will be described in the next chapter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Immaterial jh»na is formless jh»na?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Formless jh»na, thatís right. In order to get the
third formless jh»na you have to meditate on the absence of the first formless
jh»na. That absence is nothing. That is just a concept. If you are skilled in
taking concept as object when you practice upekkh» meditation, then you will
find it easier here to take nothingness as object. That is what is explained in
paragraph 123. The sentences are long and involved, so it is not easy to
understand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>So please keep in
mind that when it says ëexistentí here it means sukha and dukkha. And when it
says ënon-existentí it means beings because beings are non-existent in the
ultimate sense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>OK. The others are
not difficult to understand. Footnote 20 is very good because even in the
Burmese edition there is a mistake. In the Sinhalese edition the reading is
right and he took the Sinhalese edition here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>You may not
understand. ìReading in both cases ëavijjam»na-gahana-dakkha— citta—î, not
dukkha—. Dukkha and dakkha have two very different meanings. ëDakkhaí means
skill and ëdukkhaí means suffering. So here the correct reading should be
dakkha and not dukkha. There is just the difference of an ëaí and ëuí. He
detected this. That is very good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>By the practice of
these you fulfill the ten p»ramit»s. In Therav»da Buddhism there are ten
p»ramit»s to be fulfilled by Bodhisattas and any person. These p»ramit»s are
mentioned in paragraph 124. ìAnd to all beings they give gifts.î That means
giving. That is the first p»ramit». ìAnd in order to avoid doing harm to beings
they undertake the precepts of virtue.î That is the second p»ramit». The first
is d»na and the second is s la. ìThey practice renunciation for the purpose of
perfecting their virtue.î That is the third p»ramit». ìThey cleanse their
understanding (Pa““» that is the fourth.) for the purpose of non-confusion
about what is good and bad for beings. They constantly arouse energy (viriya)
having beingsí welfare and happiness at heart. When they have acquired heroic
fortitude through supreme energy, they become patient (khanti) with beingsí
many kinds of faults. They do not deceive (That means truthfulness.) when
promising ëWe shall give you this; we shall do this for you.í They are
unshakably resolute upon beingsí welfare and happiness.î Resoluteness is the
eighth p»ramit». In P»ƒi it is called ëadhi‘‘h»naí, firmness or resolution.
ìThrough unshakable loving-kindness (That is the ninth.) they place them first
[before themselves].î Actually what it means is they do favor first. The P»ƒi
word is pubbak»ri. ëPubbaí means first and ëk»rií means doing. ëThey do firstí
means that they do not wait for you to ask a favor, they do first. So ìThrough
unshakable loving-kindness they do favor first. Through equanimity (the tenth
p»ramit») they expect no reward. Having fulfilled the [ten] perfections, these
[divine abidings] then perfect all the good states classed as the ten powers,
the four kinds of fearlessness, the six kinds of knowledge not shared [by
disciples] and the eighteen states of the Enlightened One. This is how they
bring to perfection all the good states beginning with giving.î These ten
p»ramit»s can be fulfilled by the practice of these four divine abidings.</p>
