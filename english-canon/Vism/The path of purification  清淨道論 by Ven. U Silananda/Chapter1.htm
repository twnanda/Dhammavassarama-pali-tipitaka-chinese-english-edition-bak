</span>This book was written in <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> language.
Actually <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> was not the name of the language. It
was the name of a category of <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> literature which
are called ‘Texts’. The word ‘<span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span>’ is used in
contradistinction from the <span class=SpellE>AÔÔhakathÈs</span> (Commentaries)
and <span class=SpellE>TikÈs</span> (Sub-Commentaries). The language came to be
known as <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> at a later date. The word ‘<span
class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span>’ can mean the Texts and also the language in which the
texts are recorded. The Texts are comprised of <span class=SpellE>Vinaya</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Sutta</span> and <span class=SpellE>Abhidhamma</span>. They
are called ‘<span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span>’. The Commentaries are called ‘<span

The name given is <span class=SpellE>BhadantÈcariya</span> <span class=SpellE>Buddhaghosa</span>.
Actually his personal name was <span class=SpellE>Buddhaghosa</span>. The word
in front is <span class=SpellE>BhadantÈcariya</span>. ‘<span class=SpellE>BhadantÈ</span>’
means venerable and <span class=GramE>‘<span class=SpellE>Œcariya</span>’<span

name is the venerable teacher <span class=SpellE>Buddhaghosa</span>. <span
class=SpellE>Buddhaghosa</span> was his personal name. ‘Buddha’ means the
Buddha and ‘<span class=SpellE>Ghosa</span>’ means voice. So ‘<span

It is called a ‘common Commentary of the Texts’. That means it quotes copiously

in the <span class=SpellE>SaÑyutta</span> <span class=SpellE>NikÈya</span>.

first is <span class=SpellE>sÊla</span>. The second is <span class=SpellE>samÈdhi</span>.

</span>The first chapter deals with the virtue of monks. At first the author
gives us a stanza from the <span class=SpellE>SaÑyutta</span> <span

on the basis of this stanza which describes <span class=SpellE>sÊla</span>, <span
class=SpellE>samÈdhi</span> and <span class=SpellE>paÒÒÈ</span>. “When a wise
man, established well in virtue, develops consciousness and understanding, then

</span>This stanza was in response to a question asked by a deity. The deity
asked the Buddha: “The inner tangle and the outer tangle, this generation is

answer was that first you were to be well established in virtue, in moral
conduct, in <span class=SpellE>sila</span>. Then you develop consciousness.

meditation. Then you develop understanding. That is you practice <span
class=SpellE>vipassanÈ</span> meditation. If you practice <span class=SpellE>vipassanÈ</span>
meditation, you will succeed in disentangling this tangle. You will succeed in
destroying this craving. When craving is destroyed, when craving is eradicated,
there will be no tangle of craving. So Buddha taught this deity to first be
well established in virtue. Then he was told to practice meditation or <span

</span>Then the detailed explanation of the stanza is given in paragraph 7 -
“established well in virtue, a man, wise, develops consciousness and
understanding” and so on. Now let us see the explanation of the word ‘wise’.
“Wise: possessing the kind of understanding that is born of <span class=SpellE>kamma</span>
by means of a rebirth-linking with triple root-cause.” You are familiar with
the roots, <span class=SpellE>lobha</span>, <span class=SpellE>dosa</span>, <span
class=SpellE>moha</span> and their <span class=GramE>opposites</span> <span
class=SpellE>alobha</span>, <span class=SpellE>adosa</span>, and <span
class=SpellE>amoha</span>. A <span class=SpellE>relinking</span> consciousness
may be accompanied by two roots (<span class=SpellE>alobha</span> and <span
class=SpellE>adosa</span>) or by three roots (<span class=SpellE>alobha</span>,
<span class=SpellE>adosa</span> and <span class=SpellE>amoha</span>). When it
is accompanied by three roots, a person is called a ‘three root person’. Only
these three root persons can become enlightened in that particular life. If our
<span class=SpellE>relinking</span> consciousness is only accompanied by two
roots, non-attachment and non-hatred, we cannot hope to get enlightenment in
this life. A ‘wise man’ means a person that is born with three roots. The <span
class=SpellE>relinking</span> consciousness has all three roots. Understanding
or wisdom (<span class=SpellE>amoha</span>) is included in his <span
class=SpellE>relinking</span> consciousness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class=SpellE>adosa</span> and <span class=SpellE>amoha</span>. Only two

‘understanding’ here. Rather than saying ‘protective understanding’ we should
say ‘understanding engaged in keeping meditation’. That means when you practice

</span>“He sees fear (<span class=SpellE>bhayaÑ</span> <span class=SpellE>ikkhati</span>)

word ‘<span class=SpellE>bhikkhu</span>’ is translated as monk. Most of the
Buddha’s <span class=SpellE>suttas</span> are taught to monks. So you find the
Buddha addressing monks very often. In one of the <span class=SpellE>Suttas</span>,
the <span class=SpellE>Sutta</span> on the foundations of mindfulness, the
Commentary explained that anybody who practices meditation and who sees danger
in existence can be called a ‘<span class=SpellE>bhikkhu</span>’, a ‘monk’. <span
class=SpellE>Bhikkhu</span> is derived from ‘<span class=SpellE>bhi</span>’ and
‘<span class=SpellE>ikkhu</span>’. ‘<span class=SpellE>Bhi</span>’ here means
fear or danger. ‘<span class=SpellE>Ikkhu</span>’ means to see. So the meaning
is one who sees danger in existence can be called a ‘<span class=SpellE>bhikkhu</span>’.
In this case not only ordained monks is meant, but anyone who sees danger in
existence or in becoming can be called a ‘<span class=SpellE>bhikkhu</span>’.
Such a person will be able to cut this tangle and become an <span class=SpellE>Arahant</span>.

we abstain from killing living beings, abstain from stealing and so on,
consciousness arises in our minds. What kind of consciousness arises? <span

Together with that wholesome consciousness mental states or mental factors
arise. Among these mental factors there is one that is called ‘volition’, ‘<span

“It is either a coordinating, meaning non-inconsistency of bodily actions etc.
due to virtuousness.” ‘Non-inconsistency’ really means non-scattering of one’s
actions. That means if we do bad actions, then our actions are said to be
scattered, non-coordinated. I think ‘scattered’ is better than ‘inconsistency’.
‘Consistence’ means that it must not be different from others or something like
that. If you are consistent, it means that you do this thing always. It can be
a bad habit. Here it means that your actions are not scattered when you have <span

exhorted to be very strict with regard to their rules. They are exhorted not to
break even a small rule. It is said that one should see danger even in the
smallest transgression. In the same way if you are going to practice
meditation, then you have to clear the bases. You have to establish a firm
foundation of moral purity first. As a lay person you take precepts, at least
five precepts and you keep them. You are not to break any one of these rules.
You are to keep them intact. You may be exhorted not to break any of these

restraint is virtue, and non-transgression is virtue. This he explained

the formation of wholesome states. So the two basic meanings of the word are
given there. One is coordinating and the other is the basis for holding up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Next the author gives the characteristic,
function, manifestation and proximate cause of virtue. It is customary with <span
class=SpellE>TheravÈda</span> authors that whenever there is something to be
studied or to be understood that they explain that thing according to its
characteristic, its function, its manifestation and its proximate cause. In <span
class=SpellE>Abhidhamma</span> also <span class=SpellE>citta</span>, the 52 <span
class=SpellE>cetasikas</span> and so on are explained with reference to their
characteristics, functions, manifestations and proximate causes. The
characteristic, function, manifestation and proximate cause of virtue are given
in paragraphs 20-22.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Then the author gives the benefits of
virtue, the benefits of having pure virtue or pure <span class=SpellE>sÊla</span>.
Then he describes the different kinds of virtue which takes up the rest of the
first chapter. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>This week we will begin with the benefits of
virtue. In paragraph 23 the author first begins with a quote from the <span
class=SpellE>AÓguttara</span> <span class=SpellE>NikÈya</span>. Do you see
A.v.1? <span class=GramE>‘A’ means <span class=SpellE>AÓguttara</span> <span
class=SpellE>NikÈya</span>.</span> It is the name of one of the five
collections. The translation of <span class=SpellE>AÓguttara</span> <span
class=SpellE>NikÈya</span> is Gradual Sayings. There are five volumes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Further down in paragraph 23 you see
D.ii.86. ‘D’ means <span class=SpellE>DÊgha</span> <span class=SpellE>NikÈya</span>.
It is another collection. The translation of this collection is called
Dialogues of the Buddha. There are three volumes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>A little further down you will see M.i.33.
‘M’ means <span class=SpellE>Majjhima</span> <span class=SpellE>NikÈya</span>.
It is another division of <span class=SpellE>suttas</span>. The translation of
this collection is Middle Length Sayings. I hope you have read all these. These
are the benefits of virtue. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>On the next page in paragraph 24 the author
gives the benefits of virtue in verse form. <span class=GramE>About<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>six</span> lines from the bottom it says,
“Virtue does away with self-blame and the like.” ‘Self-blame and the like’ -
what are the others? The benefits of being virtuous or of having pure or good <span
class=SpellE>sÊla</span> are four. The dangers of not being virtuous of having
bad <span class=SpellE>sÊla</span> are also four. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The first of these four is self-blame or
self-reproach. When our moral conduct is impure, the first blame comes from us
because we are the first to know what we did. So self-blame or self-reproach
comes first.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Then there is the blame of others or the
reproach of others. If we do not keep our rules properly or if we break our
precepts, other people will also blame us. There is the blame of others or the
reproach of others. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The third disadvantage of bad <span
class=SpellE>sÊla</span> is punishment. If we do not keep precepts, then we may
commit crimes. We may kill beings or we may kill human beings. We may steal and
so on. As a result of this, we will get punishment in this life. That is
another danger of having impure moral conduct. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The fourth one is having an unhappy destiny.
That means rebirth in the four woeful states or the four states of loss -
rebirth in hell, rebirth in the animal kingdom, rebirth as a hungry ghost and
rebirth as another kind of ghost. These are the four disadvantages of being
impure in moral conduct. The opposite of these are the four benefits. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“Virtue entirely does away with dread of
self-blame and the like.” Virtue entirely does away with the danger of these
four namely self-reproach, reproach of others, punishment and unhappy destiny.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Then the author gives the kinds of virtue.
Western people often say that Eastern people are fond of numbers. Here virtue
is explained as of one kind, two kinds, three kinds, five kinds. First the
author just gives a list of them. Then they are explained in detail. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>There is only one <span class=SpellE>sÊla</span>
or one kind of virtue according to the characteristic. When we take into
account the characteristic, there is only one virtue which has the
characteristic of coordinating bodily and verbal actions and upholding people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Then there are two kinds, three kinds and
five kinds of virtue. You may read the list.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>I want to make some changes in paragraph 41,
section 16. The author is explaining four kinds of virtue. He mentions natural
virtue, customary virtue, necessary virtue and virtue due to previous causes. I
think we should say ‘ingrained virtue’ instead of ‘necessary virtue’. The <span
class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> word here is <span class=SpellE>DhammatÈ</span>. That
means the way it is. That means ingrained virtue. The last one is virtue due to
previous causes. Here ‘previous causes’ means causes in previous lives. People
are virtuous because they were virtuous in their past lives too. This being
virtuous is carried over from past lives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In the detailed explanation in paragraph 26
- “Herein, keeping is accomplished by faith and energy; avoiding, by faith and
mindfulness.” In this paragraph there are two kinds of virtue. One is keeping
and one is avoiding. <span class=GramE>‘Keeping’ means following the advice
that this should not be done.</span> Most precepts are about what should not be
done. One must not <span class=GramE>kill,</span> one must not steal and so on.
Sometimes we should do this and sometimes we should not do that. If we do not
do these things, we come to some state that lacks virtue or is impure. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The ‘keeping’ is accomplished by faith and
energy. There are rules which say that the monks must do certain things at the
monastery for example. This kind of <span class=SpellE>sÊla</span> or virtue is
accomplished by faith. If you have faith or confidence in the Buddha, if you
have energy or effort, then you can keep that <span class=SpellE>sÊla</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In this translation it says that ‘avoiding’
is accomplished by faith and mindfulness. In the Burmese-<span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span>
edition and also in the <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> Text Society edition
there is no word for mindfulness. We should strike out the two words ‘and mindfulness’
here. We should just say, “Avoiding is accomplished by faith.” Only when you
have faith and when you have confidence in the Buddha and in the rules, can you
keep yourself from breaking the rules. This is accomplished through faith and
not by mindfulness. “Mindfulness” is not supported by the Commentary on this
book. We call it a Sub-Commentary. In the Sub-Commentary also only the word
‘faith’ or in <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> the word ‘<span class=SpellE>saddha</span>’
is explained <span class=GramE>and <u><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>not</u></span> mindfulness or sati. We should
say here, “Avoiding is accomplished by faith.” If you have faith or confidence
in the Buddha and his teachings, then you can follow the rules that prohibit
you from doing certain things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: What does ‘keeping
by energy’ mean?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: You have to do
something when you follow rules that say something must be done. For example
there are duties to be done for our teachers. We must get up early in the
morning before the teacher gets up. We must offer him water for washing his
face. If there is something to eat, we must offer it to him. We must do some
chores for him and so on. This is the first kind of ‘keeping’. If we do not
have faith and if we do not make effort, we will not accomplish that kind of <span
class=SpellE>sÊla</span>. So there both <span class=SpellE>sila</span> and
energy are required. Refraining from something needs only faith, not
necessarily mindfulness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In the next paragraph “that of good <span
class=SpellE>behaviour</span>” and “that of the beginning of the life of
purity” - they are terms that are directly translated from <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span>.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>About four lines down it says: “This is a
term for the virtue that has livelihood as eighth.” A couple of lines before it
<span class=GramE>says</span>: “this is a term for virtue other than that which
has livelihood as eighth.” The eight are given in the footnote. They are
refraining from three wrong bodily actions, refraining from four wrong verbal
actions and refraining from wrong livelihood. These constitute eight precepts.
These eight precepts are different from the eight precepts to be mentioned a
little later. These precepts are called those that have livelihood as eighth.
The others are different. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“This is a term for the virtue that has
livelihood as eighth. It is the initial stage of the path because it has to be
purified in the prior stage too.” I think there is no word for ‘too’ in the
original <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span>. We should leave out ‘too’. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>This <span class=SpellE>sila</span> has to
be accomplished before we take up the beginning of the life of purity. That
means before we practice meditation, we have to purify our moral conduct. So it
has to be accomplished or purified in the prior stage of the path. ‘The path’
here means the practice of meditation leading to enlightenment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In paragraph 29 four kinds of <span
class=SpellE>sÊla</span> are mentioned. “There are two kinds of dependence -
dependence through craving and dependence through false view.” Craving itself
is dependence here. False view itself is dependence here. Sometimes we have
attachment. We have <span class=SpellE>lobha</span>. We want to be reborn in a
better world. We want to be reborn as a <span class=SpellE>deva</span> or a
celestial being. Or we may want to be reborn as a human being of good family.
It is something like that. We practice <span class=SpellE>sÊla</span> in order
that we may be reborn in a better existence. That <span class=SpellE>sÊla</span>
is dependent upon craving or attachment. Because we have attachment to these
lives we do something so that we may be reborn there. So craving itself is
dependence. It is not dependence through craving, but dependence as craving we
may say.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Sometimes we have the false view that
purification is through virtuous conduct. That means we believe that we can
become purified through virtue only. That is a false view because we have to
practice virtue first, then concentration and then wisdom. Virtue alone, by
itself, will not help us to become enlightened, to become purified.
‘Purification’ here means purification of mind in the form of enlightenment.
Enlightenment can be gained only through <span class=SpellE>vipassanÈ</span>
meditation, only through practice of wisdom. That practice of wisdom is
possible only when there is concentration. And concentration can be built only
on the purification of moral conduct. Purification of moral conduct alone, by
itself, cannot lead us to emancipation or enlightenment. That is a false view.
Through this false view we practice <span class=SpellE>sÊla</span>. Here false
view is <span class=GramE>a dependence</span> for the practice of <span
class=SpellE>sÊla</span>. So there are two kinds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Let us go back a little. Do you understand the
‘Double Code’ in about the middle of paragraph 27 - <span class=GramE>“ what</span>
is included in the Double Code (the <span class=SpellE>bhikkhus</span>’ and <span
class=SpellE>bhikkhunis</span>’ <span class=SpellE>Patimokkha</span>)…”? <span
class=SpellE>Bhikkhus</span> are monks and <span class=SpellE>bhikkhunis</span>
are nuns. Rules for monks and nuns are technically called ‘<span class=SpellE>PÈÔimokkha</span>’.
The word ‘<span class=SpellE>PÈÔimokkha</span>’ is <span class=GramE>given<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>in</span> the translation. Since there are
two, it is called ‘Double Code’. There are 227 rules for monks and 311 rules
for nuns or <span class=SpellE>bhikkhunis</span>. Women have more rules than
monks have. Both belong to the beginning of the life of purity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“And that included in the duties set out in
the <span class=SpellE>Khandhakas</span> (of <span class=SpellE>Vinaya</span>)”
- you know there are three <span class=SpellE>PiÔakas</span>. The first is <span
class=SpellE>Vinaya</span> <span class=SpellE>PiÔaka</span>. That <span
class=SpellE>PiÔaka</span> consists of rules for monks and nuns and so on. <span
class=SpellE>Vinaya</span> <span class=SpellE>PiÔaka</span> is composed of the
227 rules for monks, the 311 rules for nuns, the stories leading to the laying
down of these rules and some explanations of the words in the rules. They are
called ‘<span class=SpellE>Sutta</span> <span class=SpellE>Vibha~ga</span>’. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Then there are some other books which are
called ‘<span class=SpellE>Khandhakas</span>’. ‘<span class=SpellE>Khandhaka</span>’
just means section. In the <span class=SpellE>Khandhakas</span> mostly rules
pertaining to ‘keeping’ are given. There are <span class=SpellE>Khandhakas</span>
telling how to perform the ordination ceremony, what qualifications one must
have to be ordained and so on. In another section the duties which are to be
performed for our teachers or for our pupils, or for guest monks are mentioned.
These are called ‘<span class=SpellE>Khandhakas</span>’. Included in the duties
set out in the <span class=SpellE>Khandhakas</span> is that of good <span
class=SpellE>behaviour</span>. There are two books containing these <span
class=SpellE>Khandhakas</span>. One is called ‘Great <span class=SpellE>Khandhaka</span>’
and the other is called ‘Small or Lesser <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Khandhaka</span></span><span
class=GramE>’ .</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Those are very interesting books if you are
interested in social conditions during the time of the Buddha. What utensils
they used, how they made houses, all these things are mentioned in these books.
As the number of monks grew, there were more and more problems. Sometimes those
monks were like children. They would go to the Buddha and ask him what to do.
For example monks have to prepare dye for themselves. They have to boil bark of
a tree or wood from which they would get color. Sometimes the pots would
overflow or boil over. Then they would go to the Buddha and report it to him.
They would ask him what to do and then he would say to use a filter or
something. These books are interesting. The duties and other things contained
in these books are called ‘the virtue that is of good <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>.
They are set out in the <span class=SpellE>Khandhakas</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In paragraph 32 - “In the seventh dyad all
virtue subject to cankers is mundane.” I hope you understand what ‘subject to
cankers’ is. What is ‘subject to cankers’? ‘Cankers’ means mental defilements.
‘Subject to mental defilements’ really means the object of mental defilements.
The virtue which is the object of mental defilements is called ‘mundane’ and
virtue which is not the object of mental defilements is called ‘<span
class=SpellE>supramundane</span>’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In the next paragraph - “In the first of the
triads the inferior is produced by inferior zeal, (purity of) consciousness,
energy, or inquiry.” You have to understand these four. The <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span>
word for zeal is <span class=SpellE>chanda</span>. You have met <span
class=SpellE>chanda</span> among the 52 mental factors. It is translated there
as conation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>‘<span class=SpellE>Chanda</span>’
means the will-to-do. The mere will-to-do is called ‘<span class=SpellE>chanda</span>’.
It is not desire. It is not attachment. It is just the will to do something.
Let us say you want to pick up a book. That will to pick up the book is called
‘<span class=SpellE>chanda</span>’. In the first instance that will, zeal or <span
class=SpellE>chanda</span> is inferior. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>There are four kinds of what are called ‘<span
class=SpellE>adhipati</span>’ (dominating factors). Please read The Manual of <span
class=SpellE>Abhidhamma</span>, chapter 7. In that chapter you will find these
four <span class=SpellE>adhipati</span>. These four are called ‘dominating
factors’. They arise with other mental factors and one of them predominates.
Sometimes <span class=SpellE>chanda</span> predominates. Sometimes <span
class=SpellE>citta</span> predominates and so on. They are called ‘dominating
factors’. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The next factor is (purity of)
consciousness. Here it is not necessarily ‘purity of consciousness’, but just ‘<span
class=GramE>consciousness’</span>. Then there is energy. After that we have
inquiry. ‘Inquiry’ means knowledge or understanding. It is not really inquiry
into something. The <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> word for inquiry is <span
class=SpellE>vÊmaÑsÈ</span>. <span class=SpellE>VÊmaÑsÈ</span> is translated as
inquiry. The basic meaning of <span class=SpellE>vÊmaÑsÈ</span> is inquiry.
That is correct. It is a synonym for the <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> word ‘<span
class=SpellE>paÒÒÈ</span>’ (understanding). <span class=GramE>So here sometimes
understanding, or knowledge, or wisdom predominates.</span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>If one of these four is inferior, then the <span
class=SpellE>sÊla</span> is called ‘inferior <span class=SpellE>sÊla</span>’.
When they are medium, then the <span class=SpellE>sÊla</span> is medium. When
they are superior, the <span class=SpellE>sÊla</span> is superior. Please read <span
class=GramE>The</span> manual of <span class=SpellE>Abhidhamma</span>, chapter
7, to learn more about these dominating factors. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“That motivated by craving, the purpose of
which is to enjoy continued existence is inferior.” Actually what it means here
is to enjoy better existence and to enjoy wealth or something in that
existence, <u>not continued existence</u>. It is to enjoy better existence and
to enjoy some things there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>In paragraph 35<span class=GramE>,the</span>
third line - “that practiced by the magnanimous ordinary man...” - what is
‘magnanimous ordinary man’? The <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> word is <span
class=SpellE>puthujjana</span>. <span class=SpellE>Puthujjana</span> is a
person who has not reached any of the stages of enlightenment. We may call him
an ordinary person. The usual translation of that word is <span class=SpellE>worldling</span>,
so ordinary <span class=SpellE>worldling</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: What does
‘magnanimous’ mean?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: ‘Magnanimous’ here
actually means he has good moral habits and that he is well-read. To translate
directly it is he has heard well. During the time of the Buddha and some time
thereafter there were no books. Whatever you learned, you learned from someone.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>I hope you have read these pages. I will be
picking places where I want to give you some more information. Please go to
paragraph 40. “In the second tetrad there are training precepts announced for <span
class=SpellE>bhikkhus</span> to keep irrespective of what is announced for <span
class=SpellE>bhikkhunis</span>.” ‘Irrespective of what is announced for <span
class=SpellE>bhikkhunis</span>’ - what do you understand by that? There are 227
rules for monks and 311 rules for nuns. There are rules which are common to
both monks and nuns and there are others which are not common. The monks must
keep the 227 rules and also some of the rules laid down for nuns. That is what
is meant here. So there are not just 227 rules for monks, but also some other
rules which were originally meant for nuns. Monks must also keep these rules.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>For example there is no rule among the 227
rules that monks must not sing, or dance, or go to shows and so on. However
there is that rule for the <span class=SpellE>bhikkhunis</span>. Monks must
also keep that rule even though it is not included in the 227 rules. <span
class=GramE>When we say ‘monks’ rules’, we mean these 227 rules plus some other
rules.</span> Monks must keep these rules also, even though they are not in the
rules for monks. There are rules which are common to both monks and nuns. And
there are other rules. Monks must keep those rules too. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: It is translated
poorly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: The translation is

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“The ten precepts of virtue for male and
female novices are the virtue of the not fully admitted. The five training
precepts - ten when possible - as a permanent undertaking...” - here also the
translation is a little incorrect. The five training precepts are permanent
training. They are called in <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> ‘<span
class=SpellE>niccasÊla</span>’. You know that the word ‘<span class=SpellE>anicca</span>’
is impermanent. So <span class=SpellE>nicca</span> is permanent. These precepts
are called ‘permanent <span class=SpellE>sÊla</span>’. That means if you claim
to be a follower of the Buddha, you must keep these five precepts. They must be
with you always. So they are a permanent undertaking. Ten are to be undertaken
when you can. The five are to be taken as training precepts as a permanent
undertaking, ten when possible. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>“The five training precepts - ten when
possible - as a permanent <span class=GramE>undertaking,</span> and eight as
the factors of <span class=SpellE>Uposatha</span> Day, for male and female lay
followers are the virtue of the laity.” It should say ‘eight as the factors of <span
class=SpellE>Uposatha</span>’, not day, just <span class=SpellE>Uposatha</span>.
The <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> word ‘<span class=SpellE>Uposatha</span>’
can mean two things - the observance and the day of observance. Here the day is
not meant. ‘The eight as factors of <span class=SpellE>Uposatha</span>’ means
the eight precepts - the five permanent precepts plus not eating after mid-day,
not using flowers, perfumes and so on and also not singing and dancing, and not
using luxurious beds and seats. These precepts are called ‘<span class=SpellE>Uposatha</span>
precepts’. The <span class=GramE>most<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>important</span> is not eating after mid-day. These eight precepts are
called ‘<span class=SpellE>Uposatha</span>. If it is <span class=SpellE>Uposatha</span>
for lay people, we mean these eight precepts. <span class=SpellE>Uposatha</span>
for monks is different. <span class=SpellE>Uposatha</span> for monks is just
the recitation of the 227 rules in an assembly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>So lay people should take and always keep
five precepts. If they can, they should take eight precepts on certain days of
the month. The usual days these precepts are taken are the full moon day, the
new moon day, and the eighth day of each half month. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>We go by the lunar months. The month is
divided into two halves - the bright half and the dark half. The middle of the
bright half is the eighth day. The middle of the dark half is also the eighth
day. For at least four days in the month people in Buddhist countries like </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

practice meditation. In </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

</span>they</span></span><span style='font-family:VZTime'> even spend the night
at the monastery. They only go back home the next morning. That is called ‘<span
class=SpellE>Uposatha</span>’. It is the virtue for male and female laity. For
monks as I said, they assemble at some place. One of the monks recites the <span
class=SpellE>PÈÔimokkha</span> and the other monks pay respectful attention to
his recitation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>You know there were no books in the olden
days. In order that they would not forget the rules or in order that the monks
would remember the rules, the monks had to recite the rules in this way. They
learn the rules by heart. At the <span class=SpellE>Uposatha</span> one monk
recites the rules and the other monks pay attention to the recitation. This is
called ‘<span class=SpellE>Uposatha</span> for monks’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In paragraph 42 the author explains the four
kinds of <span class=SpellE>sÊla</span> or the four kinds of virtue often
mentioned in the <span class=SpellE>Suttas</span>. For monks these are the important
kinds of virtue. These will be explained in more detail than the others. The
author gives the texts from the <span class=SpellE>Suttas</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“The virtue described by the blessed One
thus: ‘Here a <span class=SpellE>Bhikkhu</span> dwells restrained with the <span
class=SpellE>PÈÔimokkha</span> restraint possessed of the (proper) conduct and
resort, and seeing fear in the slightest fault, he trains himself by
undertaking the precepts of training’ is virtue of <span class=SpellE>PÈÔimokkha</span>
restraint.” This is one kind of <span class=SpellE>sÊla</span>. ‘Virtue of <span
class=SpellE>PÈÔimokkha</span> restraint’ means simply keeping the <span
class=SpellE>PÈÔimokkha</span> rules, keeping the 227 rules or the 311 rules,
keeping them unbroken. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Section b of paragraph 42 shows the
restraint of the sense faculties. That means restraint of eyes, ears and so on.
Strictly speaking it is not <span class=SpellE>sÊla</span> because it is not
keeping any rules. When you have restraint of sense faculties, your <span
class=SpellE>sÊla</span> is practically pure. So it is included as <span
class=SpellE>sila</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“On seeing a visible object with the eye, he
apprehends neither the signs nor the particulars through which, if he left the
eye faculty unguarded, evil and unprofitable states of covetousness and grief
might invade him; he enters upon the way of restraint, he guards the eye
faculty, undertakes the restraint of the eye faculty.” What it means is that
when you see something, you try not to get <span class=SpellE>akusala</span>
from it. That is what is meant by restraint of the senses. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example you may see a beautiful thing. If
you have no wise attention, then you will get attached to the thing and there
will be <span class=SpellE>akusala</span>. To keep yourself from getting <span
class=SpellE>akusala</span>, from getting unwholesome thoughts, you practice
mindfulness actually. The practice of mindfulness is to prevent attachment to
these objects. It does not mean that we are to close our eyes or our ears and
not look or listen to things. It does not mean that. We will be seeing things
and we will be hearing sounds. What the restraint here means is not to have <span
class=SpellE>akusala</span> when we come across these objects. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The third in section c is the virtue of
livelihood purification. For monks ‘pure livelihood’ means getting requisites by
proper means. That means by going on alms round monks get food. By picking up
pieces of cloth they can make it into a robe and wear it and so on. This is
good livelihood for monks. If monks do not follow these rules, then there is no
virtue of livelihood purification. It will also be explained in detail later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“Abstinence from such wrong livelihood as
entails transgression of the six training precepts announced with respect to
livelihood and entails the evil states beginning with ‘scheming, talking, hinting,
belittling, pursuing gain’ is the virtue of livelihood purification.” If you
have read through this chapter, you will know what these are. I am afraid that
you know more about the bad tricks monks use to obtain what they want.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The six training precepts we will find in
paragraph 60. In paragraph 60 these are given one by one. “With livelihood as
cause, with livelihood as reason, one of evil wishes, a prey to wishes, lays
claim to a higher than human state that is non-existent, not a fact, the contravention
of which is defeat.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Let us suppose that I want to be rich. I
want to possess many requisites. I want to possess many things. Even though I
have not obtained any of the stages of enlightenment, I will say that I am
enlightened or something similar. This is so that you will think much of me and
offer me many things. It is something like that. Such a breech of rules is
caused by livelihood.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Or perhaps I don’t want to go out for alms.
I want to be at the monastery and just let people bring rich food to me and so
on. This also is impure livelihood for monks. These six rules are proclaimed or
laid down with regard to monks’ livelihood.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>You see the word ‘defeat’ there. These are
technical words. ‘Defeat’ means if a monk breaks this rule, he is finished as a
monk. He is defeated as a monk. He is no longer a monk, even though he may
still go on wearing the robes, even though he may still go on admitting himself
as a monk. In fact, in reality he is not a monk the moment that he says this
and the other person understands it. There are these six rules. We will come to
these six rules later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: What happens if
the person does not understand?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: If the person
spoken to does not understand at that moment, he is not defeated. But if the
person to whom he is speaking knows at that moment that the man is saying that
he is enlightened and the monk is not really enlightened, then there is defeat.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>I think you have read what are resorts and
others for monks and what <span class=GramE>are not resorts</span> for monks.
‘Resorts’ are things which monks must engage in and things which monks must not
engage in. In paragraph 44, in about the middle of the paragraph, you will
find: “Here someone makes a livelihood by gifts of bamboo, or by gifts of
leaves, or by gifts of flowers, fruits, bathing powder, and tooth sticks, or by
flattery, or by bean-<span class=SpellE>soupery</span> (do you know that?), or
by fondling” - I will come to ‘bean-<span class=SpellE>soupery</span>’ later.
‘By fondling’ really means baby-sitting, picking up a baby and taking care of
it, not just by fondling. It is taking care of a baby. Someone leaves a baby
with a monk, and if he takes care of the baby in order to please that person,
then it is called ‘fondling’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Now ‘bean-<span class=SpellE>soupery</span>’
means having a livelihood that resembles bean-<span class=SpellE>soupery</span>.
You still don’t understand, right? Please turn to paragraph 75. “Bean-<span
class=SpellE>soupery</span> is resemblance to bean soup; for just as when beans
are being cooked only a few do not get cooked, the rest get cooked, so too the
person in whose speech only a little is true, the rest being false, is called a
‘bean soup’; his state is bean-<span class=SpellE>soupery</span>.” Most of what
such a person says is just lies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>There is an expression in English that is
somewhat similar - ‘half-baked’, but it does not mean the same thing. It does
not mean this. If most of what I say is not true and only a little of what I
say is true, then I am guilty of this ‘bean-<span class=SpellE>soupery</span>’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In paragraph 45 we have ‘resort’. We have to
understand this properly. There is proper resort and improper resort. “Herein,
what is improper resort? Here someone has ‘prostitutes as resort, or he has
widows, old maids, eunuchs, <span class=SpellE>bhikkhunis</span>, or taverns as
resort’.” ‘Having them as resort’ means being friends with them, being intimate
with them, frequenting their houses. That is what is meant by ‘having them as
resort’. So there are some places which monks must always <span class=GramE>avoid,</span>
the places of these people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Then in paragraph 49 there is another kind
of resort. “Proper resort is of three kinds: proper resort as support, proper
resort as guarding, and proper resort as anchoring.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“Herein, what is proper resort as support? A
good friend who exhibits ten instances of talk (those are given in the
footnote), in whose presence one hears what has not been heard…” and so on. ‘In
whose presence’ really means depending on whom, not just in his <span
class=GramE>presence.</span> That means from him. You hear something from him.
That is what is meant here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“...Corrects what has been heard, gets rid of
doubt, rectifies one’s view and gains confidence...” - these are the benefits
of hearing <span class=SpellE>Dhamma</span> talk. The Buddha said in one <span
class=SpellE>Sutta</span> that there are five benefits to be gained from
listening to a <span class=SpellE>Dhamma</span> talk. The first one is that you
hear what you have not heard before. There is new information. Then you correct
what has been heard. That means you can clarify what you have heard before.
When you hear it again, then you get rid of doubt. That is the third benefit.
One may rectify one’s view. If you have a wrong view, you can set it right when
you listen to the <span class=SpellE>Dhamma</span> talk. You gain confidence.
That means your mind becomes full of confidence. These are the five benefits to
be gained from listening to a <span class=SpellE>Dhamma</span> talk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span><span class=GramE>“...Or by training under
whom...” - actually ‘not by training under whom’, but by following his example.</span>
So it should be “or by whose example one grows in faith, virtue, learning,
generosity - this is called (proper) resort as support.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In the next paragraph it says, “What is
(proper) resort as guarding? Here ‘a <span class=SpellE>bhikkhu</span>, having
entered inside a house, having gone into a <span class=GramE>street’,...</span>”.
The translator always makes this mistake. The <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span>
word is <span class=SpellE>antaraghara</span>. ‘<span class=SpellE>Ghara</span>’
means house. ‘<span class=SpellE>Antara</span>’ means in, between, or within.
He translated <span class=SpellE>antaraghara</span> as inside a house because ‘<span
class=SpellE>antara</span>’ can mean inside and ‘<span class=SpellE>ghara</span>’
means house. But the real meaning is a place which has houses in it. So it
means a village. So “A <span class=SpellE>bhikkhu</span> having entered a
village, having gone into a street, goes with downcast eyes, seeing the length
of a plow yoke.” So it is not ‘inside a house’. Monks must keep their eyes down
when they go out into the village or into the town, not just inside a house.
This is a wrong rendering of the <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> word.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“Seeing the length of a plow yoke...” - in
fact it is not a plow yoke. It is a carriage yoke. A yoke is said to be about
four cubits long. That is about six feet. So a monk should look ahead about six
feet on the ground. He should not look up or sideways. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>It may be possible where it is not so
crowded. In modern cities it is impossible. You have to look. If you just look
down and walk, you will be knocked down by a car or something. But monks are
trained to keep their eyes down - “not looking at an elephant, at a horse, a
carriage, a pedestrian, a woman, a man...”and so on. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span><span class=GramE>“Seeing fear in the
slightest fault” means seeing danger in the slightest fault.</span> Even a very
slight fault or transgression can bring harm to you. Especially when you
practice meditation, this can be a great obstacle to your progress or to your
concentration. A monk is instructed to keep the rules intact. Even if he has
broken a minor rule and he has broken it intentionally, then the feeling of
guilt is always with him. This feeling of guilt will torment him when he
practices meditation. There is danger in even the slightest transgression.
Seeing danger in the slightest transgression, he keeps his <span class=SpellE>sÊla</span>
(his virtue) really pure. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>So we come to the end of <span class=SpellE>PÈÔimokkha</span>
restraint today. How many pages do we have to go through until the end of the
first chapter? <span class=GramE>58 pages.</span> So maybe we will finish the
first chapter in four weeks. Please read as much as you can.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>This week we begin with paragraph 53.
Beginning with this paragraph, there is a detailed explanation dealing with the
passage given in paragraph 42b. There are four kinds of virtue - virtue
pertaining to <span class=SpellE>PÈÔimokkha</span> restraint, virtue of the
restraint of the sense faculties, virtue of livelihood purification and virtue
concerning requisites. We have finished the first one and now we are going to
the second.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In this paragraph the author speaks of the
usage seeing with the eye, seeing the visible object with the eye. ‘Seeing with
the eye’ really means seeing with eye consciousness or seeing consciousness.
The teachers of old explained that the eye cannot see because it has no mind
and the mind cannot see because it has no sensitivity or eye; but when the
object strikes against the sensitivity of the eye, there arises the eye
consciousness or seeing consciousness. When we see something, we see with eye consciousness
or seeing consciousness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The usage of ‘seeing with the eye’ is
described as ‘accessory locution’. I don’t know what that means. In <span
class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> it is called ‘<span class=SpellE>sasambhÈrakathÈ</span>’.
The example given here is: “He shot himself with his bow”. What is the meaning
of ‘to shoot’? The meaning of the <span class=SpellE>Pali</span> word is ‘to
hit’ or ‘to pierce’. He hit him with his bow. Actually he hit him with the
arrow and not with the bow, but without the bow you cannot shoot the arrow. The
usage is that he hits him with his bow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>You
say shoot with a gun? So perhaps shooting is not correct.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: You can shoot
arrows with a bow and you can shoot bullets with a gun. ‘To shoot with a bow’
is correct. Perhaps it is more correct to say you shot him with a bow and
arrow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: That’s right. When
a monk sees a visible object, then he apprehends neither the signs nor the
particulars. ‘The sign’ here means the sign of a man or a woman. That means
when a monk sees a person, he is not to see that person as a man or as a woman
- “or any sign that is a basis for defilement such as the sign of beauty etc.,
or as it is beautiful, or it is attractive and so on.” He stops at what is
merely seen. He must train himself in just seeing and not going into
evaluations. He must not evaluate the thing which is observed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>This kind of advice is given in many <span
class=SpellE>Suttas</span> especially to <span class=SpellE>MÈlunkyÈputta</span>
and <span class=SpellE>BÈhiya</span>. Buddha said just to stop at seeing and
not to take the object as a man or as a woman, or as attractive or beautiful
and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>He does not take particulars. Here
‘particulars’ means the aspects or shape or whatever of hand, foot, laughter,
talk, looking ahead, looking aside and so on. These are called ‘particulars’.
In <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> that is <span class=SpellE>anubyaÒjana</span>.
These things make known or particularize the defilements. When we take the
particulars of what we see, the defilements grow in our minds. So we are not to
take the signs or the particulars.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“He only apprehends what is really there.”
That means he only apprehends the visible datum there, just seeing only a
visible object, and not seeing a man or a woman. That is very difficult to
achieve. That would be possible only when we practice mindfulness meditation.
Without mindfulness meditation it is very difficult to stop at just seeing, and
not seeing a man or a woman, or to stop seeing the particulars.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>For example you hear a sound from outside.
In a fraction of a second you have gathered in the particulars of the sound -
whose sound it is, where it comes from, whether it is loud or soft and so on.
It is very difficult to stop at just hearing when we hear something and at just
seeing when we see something. Long practice of <span class=SpellE>vipassanÈ</span>
meditation can help us to achieve this. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In this story the monk was not practicing <span
class=SpellE>vipassanÈ</span> meditation actually. He was practicing the
contemplation on the foulness of the body or the 32 parts of the body. Among
the 40 subjects of calm meditation there is one called ‘contemplation of the <span
class=GramE>body’.</span> It consists in contemplating on the different parts
of the body and viewing them as foul, repulsive and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>This monk was practicing this kind of
meditation, especially contemplating on the bones. He met a woman who laughed
and showed her teeth. He got the sign of bones and not the particulars of that
woman. That is why later he said: “I did not know whether a man or a woman went
this way; what I noticed was just a skeleton (a group of bones).” After that
the sign of bones came to his mind. He contemplated on the bones with <span
class=SpellE>vipassanÈ</span> as impermanent, as suffering, as without ego or
insubstantial. In this way he was able to reach <span class=SpellE>Arahantship</span>
while standing there. He had been practicing calm meditation for a long time.
At that moment he practiced <span class=SpellE>vipassanÈ</span> meditation
depending upon his subject of calm (<span class=SpellE>samatha</span>)
meditation. So he reached <span class=SpellE>Arahantship</span> through the
practice of <span class=SpellE>vipassanÈ</span> meditation actually.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In paragraph 57 and so on the author
describes when restraint and non-restraint actually arise. I hope that you
understand the passage. If you have gone through <span class=SpellE>Abhidhamma</span>,
you will easily understand. “Restraint or non-restraint is not actually in the
eye faculty or the <span class=GramE>eye, since neither mindfulness nor
forgetfulness arise</span> in dependence on eye sensitivity. On the contrary
when a visible datum as object comes into the eye’s focus, then, after the
life-continuum has arisen twice and ceased, the functional mind-element
accomplishing the function of adverting arises and ceases.” If you are familiar
with <span class=SpellE>Abhidhamma</span>, you can <span class=GramE>understanding</span>
it easily. ‘Life-continuum’ is <span class=SpellE>bhavaÓga</span>. ‘Functional
mind-element accomplishing the function of adverting’ is just the
five-sense-door-adverting (<span class=SpellE>paÒcadvÈrÈvajjana</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Do you have the diagram of the thought
process in mind? You have to understand this with reference to the thought
process. Actually moments of restraint or non-restraint only come at the
moments of <span class=SpellE>javana</span> or impulsion. Restraint is <span
class=SpellE>kusala</span> and non-restraint is <span class=SpellE>akusala</span>.
Therefore there can be restraint or non-restraint only during the moments of <span
class=SpellE>javana</span>. That is what the Commentary is telling us in these
paragraphs. In five-sense-door-adverting there is neither restraint nor
non-restraint. The same is true for seeing consciousness, receiving
consciousness and so on. Only when we reach the <span class=SpellE>javana</span>
stage or impulsion stage, will there be restraint or non-restraint. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In footnote 16 I would like to make some
corrections or additions. In the second paragraph of the footnote “There is no <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>unvirtuousness</span></span><span class=GramE> ,</span>
in other words, bodily or verbal misconduct in the five doors; consequently
non-restraint (please put non-restraint) of <span class=SpellE>unvirtuousness</span>
happens through the mind-door, and the remaining non-restraint (we should say
‘non-restraint) happens through the six doors.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“For the arising of forgetfulness and the
other three could be (‘could be’ is better than ‘would be’) in the five doors
because (They can arise in five doors as well as the mind-door.) since they are
unprofitable states (‘unprofitable states’ means ‘unwholesome states’) opposed
to mindfulness etc.; but (‘but not ‘and’) there is no arising of <span
class=SpellE>unvirtuousness</span> consisting in bodily and verbal
transgression there because five-door impulsions do not<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>give rise to intimation.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Do you remember bodily intimation and verbal
intimation among the 28 material properties? Among the 28 material properties
there are two which are called ‘bodily intimation’ and ‘verbal intimation’.
‘Bodily intimation’ means something like gesture and ‘verbal intimation’ means
not really speech but that which causes speech. They are called ‘bodily
intimation’ and ‘verbal intimation’. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The Sub-Commentaries and all the teachers of
old explain that the verbal intimation or bodily intimation can be caused only
by the <span class=SpellE>javanas</span> of the mind-door thought process, not
the five-door thought process. It is explained here as “because five-door
impulsions do not give rise to intimation.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“And the five kinds of non-restraint
beginning with <span class=SpellE>unvirtuousness</span> are stated here as the
opposite of the five kinds of restraint beginning with ‘restraint as virtue’.”
These are given in paragraph 18. You may go back and read. So restraint or
non-restraint only <span class=GramE>arise</span> at the impulsion or <span
class=SpellE>javana</span> stage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Next let us go to paragraph 60, the ‘virtue
of livelihood purification’. Are you familiar with the rules for monks?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These are called the <span class=SpellE>PÈÔimokkha</span>
rules’. There are 227 rules for monks or <span class=SpellE>bhikkhus</span> and
311 rules for nuns or <span class=SpellE>bhikkhunis</span>. When a monk or nun
transgresses these rules, they come to some kind of offense. There are seven
kinds of offenses. Six are mentioned in this passage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“With livelihood as cause, with livelihood
as reason, one of evil wishes, a prey to wishes, lays claim to a higher than
human state that is non-existent, not a fact, the contravention of which is
Defeat.” If a monk breaks this rule, he is defeated. He is no longer a monk
although he may still be wearing robes and claiming that he is a monk. In
reality he is not a monk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The next one is an offense entailing a
meeting of the Order. That is the second gravest offense. When a monk comes to
this offense, then he has to approach the <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Sa~</span>gha</span>
or at least four monks in the initial stages. Finally there needs to be twenty
monks to perform an act of <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Sa~</span>gha</span>.
In order to get rid of that offense a meeting of the Order is required. That is
the second gravest offense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The third one is a serious offense. This one
can be gotten rid of just by making a confession. <span class=GramE>If a monk
says, not referring to himself directly, “The monk who lives in your monastery
that you have donated is an <span class=SpellE>Arahant</span>.”</span> Actually
he wants to say, “I am an <span class=SpellE>Arahant</span>.” He comes to this
offense. He is not really an <span class=SpellE>Arahant</span> and he does not
directly say that he is an <span class=SpellE>Arahant</span>. But he says that
the monk who lives in your monastery is an <span class=SpellE>Arahant</span>.
If the person to whom he is speaking understands what he is saying, then he
comes to this offense. It says in this <span class=GramE>translation :</span>
“The contravention of which is a serious offense in one who is aware of it.”
‘Who is aware of it’ does not give the meaning of the <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span>.
Actually it means if the other person understands at that very moment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The <span class=SpellE>Vinaya</span> or
Disciplinary Rules for monks is very much like law, the secular law. The monk
only comes to this offense when the person understands at that very moment. If
he does not understand immediately and perhaps he thinks about it later and
understands, then the monk does not come to that offense. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: You mean the
person he is talking to?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: That’s right. Yes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: If the person he
is talking to thinks he is an <span class=SpellE>Arahant</span>, then it’s OK?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: That’s OK if the
person doesn’t believe him. If the person knows that he is referring to
himself, then there is this offense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Now let us go to the next one. “With
livelihood as cause, with livelihood as reason, a <span class=SpellE>bhikkhu</span>
who is not sick eats superior food (I would say ‘rich food’) that he has
ordered for his own use.” ‘Order’ here means to ask for. A monk must not ask
people to give to him. His asking or begging is by standing silently. We pick
up our bowls and stand in front of a house silently. That is our begging. It is
called ‘<span class=SpellE>Ariyan</span> <span class=GramE>begging’</span> or
‘Noble begging’. We don’t say anything. We don’t say, “Please give food to us”
or whatever. With our bowls we stand at the entrance of a house. Then lay
people come out and give us what they have. So ‘order’ here means just asking.
A monk must not ask.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“The contravention of which is an offense
requiring expiation” - what is expiation? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: Forgiveness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Actually it is
forgiveness by confession. Monks make confessions to each other. It is not a
confession like in Catholicism. We confess to each other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“With livelihood as cause, with livelihood
as reason, a <span class=SpellE>bhikkhu</span> who is not sick eats rich food
that she has asked for her own use, the contravention of which is an offense
requiring confession.” Here it should be ‘special confession’, not just confession.
There are two kinds of confession that we make according to which rules we have
broken. The contravention of this rule requires a special confession to get rid
of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: So for a <span
class=SpellE>bhikkhuni</span> to do the same act is more of an offense?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Not necessarily.
There are some rules for monks also for which they must make special
confession. Sometimes breaking the rule incurs different offenses for monks
than for nuns.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>These are rules laid down with regard to
livelihood for monks. Actually to purify his livelihood a monk must go out for
alms. He must not do any other thing like fortune telling or reading palms and
all these things. These are the six rules laid down especially with reference
to the livelihood of a monk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Then there are other things given in the <span
class=SpellE>Visuddhi</span> <span class=SpellE>Magga</span>. The author took
them from another book called ‘<span class=SpellE>MahÈ</span> <span
class=SpellE>Niddesa</span>’. It tells about ‘scheming’ and other things. If
you have read all these pages, you know how crafty monks were in those days.
They are not difficult to understand. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let us
go to paragraph 74. “Suggesting is insinuating by specifying thus, ‘That family
alone understands me’.” That is not correct. The correct meaning here is: “That
family knows me only and not others.” The monk wants to impress others. So ‘I
am the only one that the family knows’. It should be ‘that family knows me
only’ and not ‘that family alone understands me’. If that family alone
understands me, then I am not impressive. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In paragraph 78 “And here there should be
told the story of the <span class=SpellE>bhikkhu</span> supported by a family.”
Here also it is not that the <span class=SpellE>bhikkhu</span> is supported by
a family, but it is a <span class=SpellE>bhikkhu</span> who frequents families,
who visits families quite often. This is so he may become acquainted with them
in order to get some things from them. The translation should be ‘the <span
class=SpellE>bhikkhu</span> who frequents families’ not ‘supported by a
family’. Venerable <span class=SpellE>NÈÓamoli</span> always makes this
mistake. The <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> word is <span class=SpellE>Kulapaka</span>.
‘Kula’ means family. ‘<span class=SpellE>Upaka</span>’ means approaching. So it
means approaching families. That means visiting the families to get acquainted
with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>This is not a good quality for a monk. A
monk should not visit families very often. When a monk is referred to as ‘one
who frequents families’, it is a kind of censure. The monk in this story is
very cunning. In the end he gets what he wants. The woman became very
frustrated and said: “There is no hoodwinking the <span class=SpellE>shaveling</span>.”
She could not deceive the monk. So she had to give the monk what there was in
the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Let me read footnote 24. “You are a donkey,
you belong to the states of loss, you belong to hell, you are a beast, <span
class=GramE>there</span> is not even a happy or an unhappy destiny to be
expected for you.” That also is not correct. If someone were to say to me that
there is neither a happy nor an unhappy destiny for me, I would be very glad
because this is true only for an <span class=SpellE>Arahant</span>. These
however are words of abuse. What it really means is that there is not a happy
destiny for you. There is only an unhappy destiny for you. You are going to
hell. There is not a happy destiny for you. Only an unhappy destiny is to be
expected for you. It is taken from other books, not directly from the <span
class=SpellE>Visuddhi</span> <span class=SpellE>Magga</span>. These are some
words of abuse contemporary with the Buddha such as “You are a thief, you are a
fool, <span class=GramE>you</span> are an idiot” and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In paragraph 85 towards the bottom of the
paragraph “Herein, reflecting wisely is reflecting as the means and as the way,
by knowing, by reviewing, is the meaning.” With regard to the four requisites
the monks have to make reflection whenever they get any one of the four
requisites and also when they make use of them. When we put on our robes, we
have to reflect on it like “I put on the robe to ward off cold, to ward off
heat, to avoid bites by insects.” When we eat also, we make reflection, “I eat
this not to beautify myself, not to take pride in my strength, just enough to
keep me going in order to practice what the Buddha taught.” and so on. So
reflection is meant here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> word used
here is <span class=SpellE>yoniso</span> <span class=SpellE>paÔisankhÈ</span>.
It is the explanation of these words. So ‘reflecting as the means and as the
way’ really means reflecting by proper means or knowing by proper means,
knowing what is the way. The meaning is just reviewing or reflecting with
wisdom, with understanding. So reflecting wisely he uses the robe and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In paragraph 86 “For protection: for the
purpose of warding off, for the purpose of eliminating so that it may not
arouse affliction in the body. For when the body is afflicted by cold, the
distracted mind cannot be wisely exerted. That is why the Blessed One permitted
the robe to be used for protection from cold. <span class=GramE>So in each
instance, except that from heat means from the heat of fire, the origin of
which should be understood as forest fires and so on.”</span> Actually it is
not the ‘origin’ but the “occurrence of which should be understood as forest
fires and so on.” It is not origin. It should be occurrence or happening. The <span
class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> word is <span class=SpellE>saÑbhava</span>. ‘<span
class=SpellE>SaÑbhava</span>’ can mean a cause or just happening. Here it means
happening. The example of fire can be seen in a forest fire or a house fire and
so on. ‘Fire’ means that kind of fire.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In paragraph 90 “And here the clause neither
for amusement is stated for the purpose of abandoning support for delusion.”
Instead of ‘support’ we may say ‘basis for delusion’. <span class=GramE>Then
farther</span> down “Nor for smartening nor for embellishment is said for the
purpose of preventing the arising of fetters for another” - what does that
mean? We should reflect this way in order not to have defilements and also so
that other people will not have defilements for us. For example if w <span
class=GramE>take</span> food for smartening our self, for embellishing our
self, then we will become attractive. So this may arouse defilements in other
people as well. So instead of saying “the arising of fetters for another” we
should say “the arising of fetters for others.” That means for others as well
as <span class=GramE>ourselves</span>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>At the end of paragraph 91 “...for the
endurance and continuance of this body can be understood to mean” we should put
‘also’ after ‘to mean’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In paragraph 92 about the middle of the
paragraph “For while this <span class=SpellE>bhikkhu</span> is engaged in
crossing the desert of existence by means of devotion to the three trainings” -
that means the practice of the three trainings. You know the three trainings. <span
class=SpellE>SÊla</span>, <span class=SpellE>samÈdhi</span> and <span
class=SpellE>paÒÒÈ</span> are called ‘the three trainings’. ‘Devotion to’
really means ‘practice of’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“For while this <span class=SpellE>bhikkhu</span>
is engaged in crossing the desert of existence by means of the practice of the
three trainings depending on bodily strength whose necessary condition is the
use of alms food, he makes use of it to assist the life of purity just as those
seeking to cross the desert used their child’s flesh.” It refers to a <span
class=SpellE>Sutta</span> in the <span class=SpellE>SaÑyutta</span> <span
class=SpellE>NikÈya</span>. You may read that story in the Book of Kindred
Sayings, the second volume page 68. The reference given here is for the
original <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> text. In the English version it is in
volume two <span class=GramE>page</span> 68. It is not a real story. Buddha
gave it just as an example. You should view food in this way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Two people and a child were going through
the desert. There <span class=GramE>was insufficient food supplies</span>, so
they could not make it to the end. The supplies dwindled so that they had
nothing to eat. They discussed among themselves. If we cross over to a safe
place, we can get a new baby. If we kill the baby and eat it, we can cross the
desert. It was not expressly said in the <span class=SpellE>Sutta</span> that
they killed the baby. The Commentary explained here that they did not kill the
baby as though it were a real story. The father sent the baby to the mother and
the mother sent the baby to the father. Going back and forth the child died. So
the idea is that if you eat the flesh of your own child, you eat it because you
have to, not because you want to. That is the point here. “Those seeking to
cross the desert used their child’s flesh, just as those seeking to cross a
river use a raft, and just as those seeking to cross the ocean use a ship.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>At the bottom of paragraph 94 there is a
verse. “With four or five lumps still to eat, let him then end by drinking
water; for energetic <span class=SpellE>bhikkhus</span>’ needs, this should
suffice to live in comfort.” This is a stanza much quoted by our teachers or by
monks who want to advise other monks not to be greedy in eating. “With four or
five lumps still to eat, let him then end by drinking water.” <span
class=GramE>So one doesn’t eat until one is full.</span> Leave about four or
five lumps. Drink water instead. This way you will be comfortable. This is
true. If you eat too much especially when you are on a retreat and have to
meditate, you will find it very difficult to meditate. It is better not to eat
until you are full, but to eat a little less and to drink water instead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“For energetic <span class=SpellE>bhikkhus</span>’
needs this should suffice to live in comfort.” ‘Energetic <span class=SpellE>bhikkhus</span>’
really means a monk who has sent his mind to <span class=SpellE>NibbÈna</span>
or to the attainment of <span class=SpellE>NibbÈna</span>. The <span
class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> word is translated here differently by Western people
from the traditional teachers. According to the traditional teachers the word
means one who has directed his mind to the attainment of <span class=SpellE>NibbÈna</span>.
Western scholars translate it to mean as having made effort or energetic. The <span
class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> word is <span class=SpellE>pahitata</span>. It can
have both meanings - one who has sent or directed his mind to <span
class=SpellE>NibbÈna</span> or one who has made effort. The second meaning is
preferred by Western scholars. So here it says “for energetic <span
class=SpellE>bhikkhus</span>’ needs”. Here ‘energetic’ really means one who
practices meditation for the purpose of attaining <span class=SpellE>NibbÈna</span>.
“This should suffice to live in comfort.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>A meditating monk should not eat much.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Now let us look at resting place or dwelling
place. What is a ‘lean-to’?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: It is like a tent,
a very rickety tent. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: the <span
class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> word is <span class=SpellE>aÉÉhayoga</span>.
Traditionally it is a building that has a roof in only one part. It is
something like a lean-to. There are five kinds of dwellings for monks. One is a
monastery. It is called a ‘<span class=SpellE>vihÈra</span>’ in <span
class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span>. Then there is a lean-to and there are three more. The
<span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> word for a dwelling place for monks is <span
class=SpellE>senÈsana</span>. ‘<span class=SpellE>Sena</span>’ comes from the
root which means ‘to sleep’ or to ‘lie down’. <span class=SpellE>Œsana</span>
comes from the root which means ‘to sit’. A place where a monk lies down or
sleeps or a place where a monk sits is called his place, his dwelling place,
his <span class=SpellE>senÈsana</span>. When a monk makes use of the dwelling
place, that is when he enters the building or when he goes out of the building,
then he must make this reflection: “I use this dwelling place to ward of the
cold, to ward off heat, to ward off bites of insects” and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The last one is the reflection on medicine.
These are called ‘the four requisites of monks’ - food, clothing, dwelling
place, and medicine. In paragraph 96 it says, “Any work of a medical man such
as oil, honey, ghee, etc., that is suitable for one who is sick, is what is
meant.” The word ‘ghee’ is not in the <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> original.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In <span class=SpellE>Vinaya</span> butter,
oil, ghee, honey and molasses are called ‘medicine’. These five are termed
medicine in <span class=SpellE>Vinaya</span>. They can be taken as medicine.
Monks can take honey or ghee in the afternoon, but not as food, only as
medicine. “Any requisite for life consisting of oil, honey, molasses, ghee etc<span
class=GramE>., that is allowed by a medical man as suitable for the sick,</span>
is what is meant.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In paragraph 97 in the second part there is
the explanation of the <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> word ‘<span class=SpellE>paccaya</span>’.
“<span class=GramE>the</span> word meaning here is this: because breathing
things go, move, proceed, using (what they use) in dependence on these robes
etc., these robes, etc., are therefore called requisites.” In fact instead of
‘move, proceed’ we should say ‘live’. <span class=GramE>‘Breathing things’
means living beings.</span> <span class=GramE>So living beings live in
dependence upon these robes and other things, using them.</span> That is why
they are called ‘<span class=SpellE>paccaya</span>’ in <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span>.
It is not important that you understand the meaning of the word ‘<span
class=SpellE>paccaya</span>’. If you know that it means requisites here, it is
enough.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In the next paragraph “So, in this fourfold
virtue<span class=GramE>,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
class=SpellE>PÈÔimokkha</span></span> restraint has to be undertaken by means
of faith. <span class=GramE>For that is accomplished by faith, since the
announcing of training precepts is outside the disciples’ province.”</span> It
is very important. That is why we cannot change the rules. We cannot add
anything to the rules and we cannot take anything out of the rules because the
announcing or laying down of rules is not in the province of disciples. We
cannot do that. Only the Buddha can do that. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>If a monk has no faith or devotion to the
Buddha’s teachings, he will not want to keep all these rules. That is why the <span
class=SpellE>PÈÔimokkha</span> restraint or the first virtue is to be
undertaken by means of faith, by means of devotion to the Buddha. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“The evidence here is the refusal of the
request to (allow disciples to) announce training precepts.” Those in the
brackets are to be stricken out. This refers to <span class=SpellE>Vinaya</span>.
Venerable <span class=SpellE>SÈriputta</span> asked the Buddha how the
dispensation of different <span class=SpellE>Buddhas</span> fared. The
dispensation of some <span class=SpellE>Buddhas</span> lasted long and the
dispensation of other <span class=SpellE>Buddhas</span> did not last so long.
Buddha answered that there were precepts and so on when the dispensation lasted
long. So Venerable <span class=SpellE>SÈriputta</span> requested the Buddha to
lay down rules - “Please lay down rules so that the dispensation of the Buddha
may endure long.” The Buddha said, “No. It is not time.” What the Buddha meant
to say was that Venerable <span class=SpellE>SÈriputta</span> did not know when
to lay down rules and that he did. So the laying down of rules is not in the
province of disciples. The words in the brackets are not in the original. They
were put in by the translator wrongly. The evidence here is the refusal of the
request to announce precepts or to lay down rules.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“Having therefore undertaken through faith
the training precepts without exception as announced, one should completely
perfect them without regard (even) for life.” Let’s put in the word ‘even’, so
‘even for life’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“For this is said: ‘<span class=GramE>As</span>
a hen guards her eggs, or as a yak her tail, or like a darling child, or like
an only eye - so you who are engaged your virtue to protect, be prudent at all
times and ever scrupulous’.” ‘Be prudent’ really means <span class=GramE>be</span>
fond of your virtue. ‘Scrupulous’ or the <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> word
here means to have respect for the rules, the Buddha, the <span class=SpellE>Dhamma</span>,
the <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>Sa~</span>gha</span> and so on. Then we
have the story. It is not difficult to understand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In paragraph 99 it says, “He augmented his
insight.” I hope you understand that. What’s that?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: He saw into the
future?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Actually he
practiced <span class=SpellE>vipassanÈ</span> meditation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In the second story “Also they bound another
Elder in <span class=SpellE>TambapaÓÓi</span> Island (<span class=SpellE>SrÏ</span>
Lanka) with string creepers and made him lie down. When a forest fire came and
the creepers were not cut...” - no, this is not correct. Here it should be
“When the forest fire came, without cutting the creepers, he established
insight.” He was bound with creepers and when the forest fire came, he could
easily cut the creepers and escape, but to cut the creepers means to break the
rule of the Buddha. So he would sooner give up his life than break the rules of
the Buddha. So without cutting the creepers, he practiced meditation. He became
an <span class=SpellE>Arahant</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>“When a forest fire came, without cutting
the creepers, he established insight and attained <span class=SpellE>NibbÈna</span>
simultaneously with his death.” ‘Simultaneously’ means almost simultaneously,
not at the same moment. Mind works very fast. <span class=GramE>So the two came
almost simultaneously.</span> He became an <span class=SpellE>Arahant</span>
and then he died.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The advice given with regard to this story
is: “Maintain the rules of conduct pure, renouncing life if there be need,
rather than break virtue’s restraint by the worlds’ <span class=SpellE>saviour</span>
decreed.” So you should give up your life rather than breaking the rules laid
down by the Buddha.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Do you have any questions?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: I am a little
curious about all this which is essentially asceticism. The Buddha renounced
asceticism. How are these two resolved?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: When it says the
Buddha renounced asceticism, it means that he renounced unnecessarily
inflicting pain on oneself or self-mortification. For example when he was in
the forest practicing to become the Buddha, he reduced his food little by
little. At first he went out for alms and ate that food. Then he took fruit
from trees and ate that. Later he took only the fruit that had fallen. Later on
he took only the fruit from the tree under which he was living. So little by
little he reduced eating so that his body became very thin, emaciated. It was
unnecessarily inflicting suffering upon <span class=GramE>himself</span>. That
asceticism Buddha refused or denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Ascetic practices given here are not that
severe, not that rigorous. They are things such as eating in one bowl only or
when you go out for alms, you do not skip any house. These are called ‘ascetic
practices’, but they are not like those practiced by the other hermits or sages
during the Buddha’s time. We will come to the ascetic practices in the second
chapter. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>One thing that I want to say is that when I
went to the Zen Center in Japan I saw that they rinsed the bowls and then drank
the water from the bowls. It reminded me of one of the ascetic practices that <span
class=SpellE>TheravÈda</span> monks practice. That practice is to eat in one
bowl only. If you are to use one bowl only, then you eat in that bowl and you
drink in that bowl. So <span class=SpellE>i</span> think there are some
practices carried to countries far away from India. They have changed a little
and so they seem to become very different practices, but I think there is
something common in both practices.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: In the <span
class=SpellE>Zendo</span> we eat that way and wash our bowls. You are always
served. It is like alms. The food just comes. It is served to you. We don’t do
begging, but in the way that we eat in the <span class=SpellE>Zendo</span> it
is very similar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Yes. That’s right.
When monks are invited to the houses of lay people during the time of the
Buddha and even in the present time in <span class=SpellE>SrÏ</span> Lanka, the
monks sit in a row on the floor. The lay people take food and put it in their
bowls like you eat in Zen Centers. That is the practice in <span class=SpellE>SrÏ</span>
Lanka and also in India. But in Myanmar it is different. We can see many
similarities or common practices that have become a little changed depending on
the country and on the people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: The original
intention seems to be the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: These are all <span
class=SpellE>dhuta~ga</span>. ‘<span class=SpellE>Dhuta~ga</span>’ means to
shake off. These practices are undertaken to shake off defilements. They
develop good qualities like fewness of wants, non-attachment to food and all
these things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: By that particular
act you keep reminding yourself of why you are eating and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: You always have to
be on your guard to avoid mental defilements from coming to your mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: Many people talk
about not liking their job or not feeling good about their livelihood. We can
see here how monks are warned to be careful. So that is a reflection in our
more complex society how we need to be careful in our <span class=SpellE>behaviour</span>,
perhaps not in the exact same way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: That’s right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: In each act it is
so easy to be selfish.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: So try to put
Buddhism somewhere in everyday life. Be mindful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: That’s right. In
one of the <span class=SpellE>Suttas</span> in <span class=SpellE>A~guttara</span>
<span class=SpellE>NikÈya</span> daily reflections are given there. A monk or a
lay person must make these reflections: I am old. I cannot avoid getting old. I
will get disease and I cannot avoid that. One day I will die and I cannot get
away from it. All that is mine will change and disappear. I am heir to <span
class=SpellE>kamma</span>. <span class=SpellE>Kamma</span> is my only kinsman.
These reflections have to be made every day both by monks and nuns and lay
people. This is so they can get rid of pride in their youth, pride in their
belongings and so on. That is a very good <span class=SpellE>Sutta</span> both
for monks and for lay people. This is in the <span class=SpellE>A~guttara</span>
<span class=SpellE>NikÈya</span>, the Gradual Sayings. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: But don’t you
think that there might be some problem for some people who are depressed? If
you do that too much, you might jump off the Golden Gate Bridge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: That’s right. You
have to follow the Middle Way. These reflections are to be made not to get
depressed. It is to get rid of pride in yourself, or in your appearance, or in
your body. It is for the purpose of getting rid of undesirable mental habits.
They are not to be carried too far.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>You know once when the Buddha taught about
the foulness of the body, monks got so disgusted with their bodies that they
killed themselves and they asked other people to kill them. That really
happened during the time of the Buddha. Buddha knew it would happen, but he
could not avoid it. It is explained in the Commentaries that the <span
class=SpellE>kamma</span> that these monks did together in the past got
opportunity to give result at that time. Buddha thought that if they had to die,
let them die with this kind of meditation. It would help them get a good
rebirth. So the Buddha taught the foulness of the body meditation to them. Then
he said: “I must not be approached by any monk for 15 days.” He said that he
wanted to be alone and would only see the monk who brought food to him. After
15 days he came out of seclusion. Then he asked Venerable <span class=SpellE>Œnanda</span>
why there were fewer monks. Venerable <span class=SpellE>Œnanda</span> answered
that there were fewer monks because he had taught that meditation. <span
class=GramE>So Venerable <span class=SpellE>Œnanda</span> asked the Buddha to
teach some other kind of meditation.</span> Then the Buddha taught breathing
meditation at that time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: Is that a true
story?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Yes. That story is
in the Book of Discipline if you want to read it. I don’t have the page number.
It is given in connection with the third of the four rules of defeat. The third
rule is not to kill human beings. Killing human beings is a grave offense for
monks. That story is given there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>We were in paragraph 100. There are four
kinds of virtue or <span class=SpellE>sÊla</span>. The first is called ‘<span
class=SpellE>PÈÔimokkha</span> restraint’. These are the rules in the
disciplinary code for monks and nuns. That <span class=SpellE>PÈÔimokkha</span>
restraint is undertaken out of faith. Having faith in the Buddha and his
teaching, the monks and nuns keep these <span class=SpellE>PÈÔimokkha</span>
rules intact.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The next one is the restraint of the sense
faculties. It is to be undertaken with mindfulness. In fact the restraint of
the sense faculties is not strictly virtue or <span class=SpellE>sÊla</span>.
It is the control of one’s senses. The control of one’s senses can be done by
mindfulness or should be done by mindfulness. When one sees an object, one must
keep mindfulness with him or her, so that he or she will not get unwholesome
thoughts or unwholesome mental states with regard to that object. In order to
guard against unwholesome thoughts from entering our minds we need mindfulness.
So the second <span class=SpellE>sÊla</span> or the restraint of the sense
faculties is undertaken by mindfulness. By mindfulness one tries not to take
the signs, not to apprehend the signs, and not to apprehend the particulars.
One tries to just stop at seeing, hearing and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In paragraph 101 “When not undertaken thus,
virtue of <span class=SpellE>PÈÔimokkha</span> restraint”, a word is missing
there, “restraint <u>also</u> is <span class=SpellE>unenduring</span>.” If we
do not undertake the restraint of sense faculties with mindfulness, then the
virtue of the first one, the <span class=SpellE>PÈÔimokkha</span> restraint,
cannot endure long, cannot last long.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“It does not last, like a crop not fenced in
with branches. And it is raided by the robber defilements as a village with
open gates is by thieves.” So the <span class=SpellE>PÈÔimokkha</span>
restraint becomes enduring when the restraint of sense faculties is undertaken
by mindfulness. When we apply mindfulness and try not to take the signs and
particulars of objects, then we will not come to transgression of the rules in
the <span class=SpellE>PÈÔimokkha</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>With regard to the restraint of the sense
faculties the story of the Elder <span class=SpellE>VangÊsa</span> was given.
He went out for alms and saw a woman. He had thoughts of lust arise in his
mind. He asked Venerable <span class=SpellE>Œnanda</span> what to do. The
Venerable <span class=SpellE>Œnanda</span> said that because you perceived
mistakenly, because you saw the person as a woman these <span class=GramE>kind</span>
of thoughts arose. So try to concentrate on the formations as alien, as
suffering, as not self. If you have this attitude, this understanding, you can
extinguish this fire of lust in your mind. So the Elder expelled lust from his
mind and went on with his alms round.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Two more stories are given. These are
inspiring stories about how monks control their senses. One monk did not know
that there was a painting in the dwelling where he lived. The same monk did not
know who bowed down to him, the king or the queen. The monk always said, “May
the king be happy.” to whoever bowed down to him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In paragraph 108 “Let him not be
hungry-eyed.” The <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> word is <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>lola</span></span>. ‘Lola’ means unsteady or looking this way and
that way. That is called ‘<span class=SpellE>lola</span>’. Hungry should be
understood not in the sense of wanting to eat something, but hungry for the
visible object.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: Is it in the sense
of distraction?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Yes. Monks are
taught to keep their eyes down especially when they go to the village. They are
allowed to see about six feet in front of them. They are to keep their eyes
down. They are not to look at this thing or that thing. When your eyes are
going from this thing to that thing, it is called ‘<span class=SpellE>lola</span>’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: ‘Hungry-eyed’ is
not a common English word. It is one that is seldom used.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Maybe the word ‘<span
class=SpellE>lola</span>’ can be translated as hungry. Lola is something that
is not steady, not composed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Then there is another story about the Elder <span
class=SpellE>MahÈ</span> <span class=SpellE>Mitta</span>. These stories are not
difficult to understand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The third virtue for monks is livelihood
purification. Livelihood purification is to be undertaken by means of energy,
by means of effort because if you are lazy and if you are a monk and do not go
out for alms, then your livelihood will not be pure. Livelihood purification is
to be undertaken by means of effort or energy. In order to keep livelihood pure
a monk has to avoid wrong search or unsuitable search. In order not to resort
to such things, a monk has to go out for alms every day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In paragraph 112 it says, “And if he has got
putrid urine with mixed gall nuts...” Actually this is gall nuts soaked in
urine. It is not necessarily putrid urine, although the <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span>
word ‘<span class=SpellE>p|ti</span>’ is used here. It can just be urine,
especially cow urine. Do you know gall nut? I don’t know. The other name is <span
class=SpellE>myrobalam</span>. It is a kind of fruit or nut. It has a bitter
taste. When it is soaked in cow urine, it is supposed to be medicinal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>If a person gets that kind of gall nut or <span
class=SpellE>myrobalam</span> or the four sweets, they are supposed to be
medicine for monks. The one is not so good, but the four sweets are good
things. He who wants to keep his livelihood pure should keep what is not good
and give what is good to others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The four sweets are medicinal sweets made of
four ingredients. What are the four? In our countries, in Buddhist countries
this is very common. Almost everybody knows at least what things monks can eat
in the afternoon. These four sweet things are ghee, honey, oil and molasses.
They are mixed. If you are strict, you are not to cook them. You may put them
in the sun and stir them. Some time later the mixture becomes a little thick.
That could be eaten in the afternoon if you are weak or if there is some
ailment to be gotten rid of. The four sweets are called ‘<span class=SpellE>catumadhura</span>’.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: This last part
means that if you are offered both of these medicines and you take the bad
tasting one and leave the good tasting medicine for others, that <span
class=GramE>is</span> a virtuous act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: That’s right. Such
a monk is called ‘supreme in the Noble Ones’ heritage’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Some kinds of hinting or indicating <span
class=GramE>is</span> allowed with regard to some requisites and is not allowed
with regard to other requisites. In paragraph 113 it talks about that. “As to
robe and the other requisites, no hint, indication, roundabout talk, or
intimation, about robes and alms food is allowable for a <span class=SpellE>bhikkhu</span>
who is purifying his livelihood.” A monk must not ask for requisites, not even
hint or indicate, or use roundabout talk to get a robe or to get food.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“But a hint, indication, or roundabout talk,
about a resting place <span class=GramE>( a</span> dwelling place) is allowable

with regard to dwelling place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“<span class=GramE>herein</span>, a ‘hint’
is when one who is getting the preparing of the ground etc., done for the
purpose of (making) a resting place is asked: ‘What is being done, venerable
sir? Who is having it done? And he replies, ‘No one’.” That means there is no
one who is going to build this place. So if you can, please build. It is
something like that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is saying ‘The resting place for the community of <span class=SpellE>bhikkhus</span>
is crowded’.” The monastery is too small. It is not enough for monks or lay
people to assemble. That is roundabout talk. That means the monk wants a new
monastery or an extension to the monastery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>These are allowed with regard to resting
place or dwelling place. With regard to robes and alms food they are not
allowed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“All, however, is allowed in the case of
medicine.” Medicine is a necessity. If you have an ailment or a disease, you
really need medicine. So with regard to medicine hinting and all these others
are allowed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“But when the disease is cured, is it or is it
not allowed <span class=GramE>to use</span> the medicine obtained in this way?”
There is a difference of opinion with regard to this. <span class=SpellE>Vinaya</span>
specialists say that it is all right, but <span class=SpellE>Suttanta</span>
specialists say no. <span class=SpellE>Vinaya</span> specialists say that
Buddha has permitted and so it is all right to use medicine obtained by hinting
and others even after the disease is cured. The <span class=SpellE>Suttanta</span>
specialists say no, although there is no offense (That means there is no
breaking of a certain rule.) nevertheless the livelihood is sullied, therefore
it is not allowable. If you want to purify your livelihood to the utmost, do
not use them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>This has to be undertaken by means of
understanding. You have to reflect, ‘I use the robe just to ward off heat,
cold, bites of insects’ and so on. You have to use your understanding.
Therefore it is to be undertaken by means of understanding. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Now paragraph 124 “Herein, reviewing is of
two kinds: at the time of receiving requisites and at the time of using them.”
Sometimes you may receive a robe today, but perhaps you do not use it until a
month later. So there are two kinds of reviewing at receiving and at the time
of using.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“For use is blameless in one <span
class=GramE>who</span> at the time of receiving robes, etc., reviews them
either as (mere) elements or as repulsive.” Here also the translation is a
little inaccurate. Here what is meant is when the monk receives the robe and
others, he reflects or reviews them as mere elements or as <span class=GramE>repulsive.</span>
Then he puts them aside and later makes use of them. He does not just put them
aside for later use, but he puts them aside and later makes use of them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“And in one who reviews them thus at the
time of using them” - that means you have to review both at the time of
receiving and at the time of using. This passage may imply that if you review at
the time of receiving and if you do not review at the time when you are using,
it is alright. However the emphasis here must be on reviewing at both times -
both at the time of receiving and at the time when you make use of them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“Here is an explanation to settle the
matter. There are four kinds of use: use as theft, use as debt, use as
inheritance, <span class=GramE>use</span> as a master. Herein, use by one who
is <span class=SpellE>unvirtuous</span> and makes use (of requisites), even
sitting in the midst of the community, is called ‘use by theft’.” ‘<span
class=SpellE>Unvirtuous</span>’ really means a monk who has broken one of the
four most important rules. If a monk breaks one of the four most important
rules, he is no longer a monk. He may be wearing robes. He may be claiming to
be a monk. His use of requisites is said to be by theft. He is not entitled to
receive the offerings given by lay people. So it is like stealing something. It
is called ‘use as theft’. ‘<span class=SpellE>Unvirtuous</span>’ here refers to
a person who is no longer a monk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“Use without reviewing by one who is
virtuous is ‘use as a debt’.” Monks depend on lay people for these requisites.
Lay people offer these requisites to monks. Therefore monks have the
responsibility to reflect or to review on these four requisites. If a monk does
not review when accepting them or using them, then he is said to be ‘using them
as a debt’ or he is indebted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>He must review the four requisites. When?
The robe should be reviewed every time that you use it. Every time that you
pick up your robe, then you have to review the robe. “I use the robe just to
ward off heat, cold, bites of insects” and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span><span class=GramE>“The alms food (should be
reviewed) lump by lump.”</span> What do you call this? <span class=GramE>A
morsel?</span> <span class=GramE>So alms food should be reviewed at every
morsel, at every mouthful.</span> That is why talking while eating is discouraged
for monks. A monk who talks while eating is supposed to be of bad <span
class=SpellE>behaviour</span> because instead of reviewing, he is speaking.
When he is speaking, he is losing reviewing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: During the
chanting before our meals we say the first portion is for precepts, the second
portion is for <span class=SpellE>samÈdhi</span> and the third is to save all
beings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Yes. Good. You
have to be doing something while eating. I mean thinking of something. When you
eat without reviewing, you are using the food as a debt. <span class=GramE>So
alms food should be reviewed lump by lump.</span> “One who cannot do this,
should review it before the meal (That means in the morning.), after the meal,
in the first watch, in the middle watch, and in the last watch. If dawn breaks
on him without his having reviewed it, he finds himself in the position of one
who has used it as a debt.” Dawn is the beginning of one day. The new day does
not begin at midnight. The day is reckoned by dawn. When dawn breaks and a monk
<span class=GramE>does</span> not review at all, then he is said to be using
the requisites as a debt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“Also the resting place should be reviewed
each time it is used.” When you go into the monastery and when you go out of
the monastery, you must review. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“Recourse to mindfulness both in the
accepting and the use of medicine is proper.” So with regard to medicine you
have to review both accepting it and making use of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“But while this is so, though there is an
offense for one who uses it without mindfulness after mindful acceptance, there
is no offense for one who is mindful in using after accepting without
mindfulness.” You may accept it without reviewing, but when you are using, you
must really review it. That is what is meant here. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“Purification is of four kinds: purification
by Teaching, purification by restraint, purification by search, and
purification by reviewing.” This also has to do with the four virtues or four <span
class=SpellE>sÊlas</span>. The first is purification by Teaching. The word
‘Teaching’ is not correct here. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>There are two English translations of the <span
class=SpellE>Visuddhi</span> <span class=SpellE>Magga</span>. One was made by a
Burmese gentleman and the other by Venerable <span class=SpellE>NÈÓamoli</span>.
Both of them did not get the right translation here. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> word here
is <span class=SpellE>desanÈ</span>. The word ‘<span class=SpellE>desanÈ</span>’
generally means a sermon, or a teaching, or a preaching. But here <span
class=SpellE>desanÈ</span> is used in a technical sense in <span class=SpellE>Vinaya</span>.
‘<span class=SpellE>DesanÈ</span>’ in <span class=SpellE>Vinaya</span> means
revealing, or revealing one’s offenses, or confession. So it is purification by
confession. When a monk has broken a rule or rules, he confesses it to another
monk. When he confesses, he gets free from the offense of breaking that rule.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>There is a kind of <span class=SpellE>sÊla</span>
which is called ‘purification by confession’. Just by confession you can get
rid of this offense. These are minor rules in the <span class=SpellE>PÈÔimokkha</span>.
For example cutting a tree - monks are not allowed to cut trees. If a monk cuts
a tree, or plucks a flower, or picks a fruit, he comes to a minor offense. In
order to get free from that minor offense he just has to confess it to another
monk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>There are some graver offenses which need
not only confession, but which require staying under probation for a period of
time. Also there are the gravest offenses which cause a person not to be a
monk. In that case ‘giving up robes’ is called <span class=GramE>a purification</span>.
Giving up being a monk is what <span class=SpellE>i</span> mean. Becoming a <span
class=SpellE>sÈmaÓera</span> (a novice) or becoming a lay person is <span
class=GramE>called a ‘purification’</span> there. So offenses incurred with
regard to <span class=SpellE>PÈÔimokkha</span> rules can be purified by
confession. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>‘Purification by restraint’ is restraint of
sense faculties. That is called ‘purification by restraint’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The third one, ‘purification by livelihood’,
is called ‘purification by search’. That is because you have to search for
requisites, especially food. <span class=GramE>‘Search for’ means to find by
suitable means, not by asking, or begging by word of mouth.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The last one is ‘purification by reviewing’.
In order to purify the last of the four <span class=SpellE>sÊlas</span>, you
review whenever you receive a requisite or when you make use of a requisite.
These are the four purifications corresponding to the four <span class=SpellE>sÊlas</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“Use of the requisites by the seven kinds of
Trainers is called ‘use as inheritance’.” Do you know what <span class=GramE>are
Trainers</span>? You know that there are eight Noble Persons or eight kinds of
Noble Persons. There are four stages of enlightenment and eight types of
consciousness that arise at the four stages of enlightenment. They are the Path
of Stream-Entrant, the Fruition of Stream-Entrant, the Path of Once-<span
class=SpellE>Returner</span>, the Fruition of Once-<span class=SpellE>Returner</span>,
The Path of <span class=SpellE>NoÓ-Returner</span>, the Fruition of Non-<span
class=SpellE>Returner</span>, the Path of <span class=SpellE>Arahant</span>, <span
class=GramE>the</span> Fruition of <span class=SpellE>Arahant</span>. These are
the eight types of consciousness. It is said that there are eight Enlightened
Persons or eight Noble Persons. In <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> the word is <span
class=SpellE>Ariya</span>. You may be familiar with the word ‘<span
class=SpellE>ariyan</span>’. The person at the moment of Stream-Entrant Path
consciousness is called the ‘First Noble Person’. The person at the moment of
Stream-Entrant Fruition is called the ‘Second Noble Person’ and so on. There
are eight kinds of Noble Persons. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>What are Trainers? ‘Trainers’ here means
those who have attained to the lower stages of enlightenment. Briefly Trainers
are those who are not ordinary persons (<span class=SpellE>puthujjanas</span>) <span
class=GramE>nor</span> <span class=SpellE>Arahants</span>. They are
Stream-Entrants, Once-<span class=SpellE>Returners</span>, Non-<span
class=SpellE>Returners</span>, (and the <span class=SpellE>Arahant</span> at
the moment of path consciousness only). In <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> they
are called ‘<span class=SpellE>Sekhas</span>’. They are not <span class=SpellE>puthujjanas</span>
or ordinary persons. And they are not <span class=SpellE>Arahants</span>. Their
use of the requisites is called ‘use as an inheritance’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“But how then <span class=GramE>is the
Blessed One’s requisites</span> or the laity’s requisites that are used?
Although given by the laity, they actually belong to the Blessed One, because
it is by the Blessed One that they are permitted.” Buddha permitted us to
accept things from lay people. It is virtually the requisites of the Buddha and
not of the lay people. When a son makes use of his father’s belongings, his
father’s requisites, he is said to be ‘using them as an inheritance’. “That is
why it should be understood that the Blessed One’s requisites are used. The
confirmation here is in the <span class=SpellE>DhammadÈyÈda</span> <span
class=SpellE>Sutta</span>.” That <span class=SpellE>Sutta</span> is in the <span
class=SpellE>Majjhima</span> <span class=SpellE>NikÈya</span> (The Middle
Length Sayings) in the third <span class=SpellE>Sutta</span>. Buddha said in
this <span class=SpellE>Sutta</span>, “Be the inheritors of <span class=SpellE>Dhamma</span>
and not of requisites.” Buddha urged his disciples in this way. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“Use by those whose cankers are destroyed
(That means those used by <span class=SpellE>Arahants</span>) is called ‘use as
a master’: for they make use of them as masters because they have escaped the
slavery of craving.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>From among these four try to make use as a
master. That is the best one. For those ordinary people who have not yet
attained any stage of enlightenment there can be no use as an inheritance and
also of course as a master. So there are only two - use as theft and use as
debt. But the Commentary said that the use by those who keep their precepts,
who keep their virtue <span class=GramE>pure</span> could be included in the
use as inheritance because it is the opposite of the use as a debt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“For one possessed of virtue is called a
‘trainer’ too because of possessing this training.” This is stretching the
meaning of the word. The word ‘Trainer’ or the <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span>
word ‘<span class=SpellE>Sekha</span>’ means persons that are neither <span
class=SpellE>puthujjanas</span> nor <span class=SpellE>Arahants</span>, but
here with the stretching of the meaning, a person who has good <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>sÊla</span></span><span class=GramE> ,</span>
although he is a <span class=SpellE>puthujjana</span>, can be called a

know why he left it out. “For he who so does is one who does what is to be
done.” That sentence is missing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

burn.” Or “Don’t burn your tongue.” He was not eating hot food at that moment.
Still the Preceptor said, “Don’t burn your tongue.” That means don’t eat
without reviewing. He became an <span class=SpellE>Arahant</span> later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

eighty millions, then as well, <span class=GramE>and<span

thirty six again to swell. The total restraint disciplines: these rules the

class=SpellE>vicÈra</span>) thought is virtue and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In paragraph 141 “And here there is no state
called ‘abandoning’ other than the mere non-arising of the killing of living
things, etc., as stated.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>‘Abandoning’
really means not letting them arise. If they have arisen, then they have
already arisen, and you cannot do anything about them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>We come to the end of the questions and
answers - “What is Virtue? In what sense is it virtue?” and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“What is the defiling of it?” and “What is
the cleansing of it?” Monks are exhorted to keep rules very intact, to keep
their <span class=SpellE>sÊla</span> very pure. The ideal state is that the
precepts are not broken anywhere. That is explained here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“When a man has broken the training course
at the beginning or at the end in any instance of the seven classes of
offenses, his virtue is called ‘torn’, like a cloth that is cut at the edge.” His
virtue should be <span class=SpellE>untorn</span>. If it is broken at the
beginning or at the end, it is called ‘torn <span class=SpellE>sÊla</span>’. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“But when he has broken it in the middle, it
is called ‘rent’, like a cloth that is rent in the middle. When he has broken
it twice or thrice in succession, it is called ‘blotched’, like a cow whose
body is some such color as black or red with a discrepant color appearing on
the back or the belly. When he has broken it (all over) at intervals, it is
called ‘mottled’, like a cow speckled (all over) with discrepant-colored spots
at intervals. This in the first place is how there comes to be <span
class=SpellE>tornness</span> the breach that has gain, etc., as its cause.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“And likewise with the seven bonds of
sexuality” - it means the seven kinds of engagements in sexuality. “<span
class=GramE>here</span>, <span class=SpellE>brahman</span>, some ascetic or <span
class=SpellE>brahman</span> claims to lead the life of purity rightly.” It is a
little inaccurate. It should say ‘some ascetic or <span class=SpellE>brahman</span>
claiming to lead the life of purity rightly but does not.’ It should go like
that. “Some ascetic or <span class=SpellE>brahman</span> claiming to lead the
life of purity rightly but does not enter into actual sexual intercourse with
women. Yet he agrees to massage, manipulation, bathing and rubbing down by
women.’ In our country these are called ‘minor sexuality’. It is not sexual
intercourse, but they pertain to sexuality. So these seven things, massage etc.
are called ‘minor sexuality’. Although a person may not break the rule which
forbids sexual intercourse, if he is thinking of this, then his <span
class=SpellE>sÊla</span> is said to be ‘impure’. It is not broken, but it
becomes impure because he is thinking of these things. He is taking delight in
massage etc. being done to him. This is a kind of sexuality. These things are
called ‘minor sexuality’ in our country. If we want to keep <span class=SpellE>sÊla</span>
pure, then we must avoid doing these things too. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In paragraph 154 about the middle “owing to
that <span class=SpellE>unvirtuousness</span> he is ugly as hemp cloth. Contact
with him is painful because those who fall in with his views” - ‘fall in with
his views’, what is that?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What does that
mean?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: To agree with him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: The <span
class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> word means to imitate him, to follow his conduct.
Sometimes the <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> words can be misleading if you do
not know the exact formation of these words. The <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span>
word here is <span class=SpellE>diÔÔhÈnugati</span>. It could be <span
class=SpellE>diÔÔhiÈnugati</span> or <span class=SpellE>diÔÔhÈnugati</span>. It
really is <span class=SpellE>diÔÔhÈnugati</span> and not <span class=SpellE>diÔÔhiÈnugati</span>.
Venerable <span class=SpellE>NÈÓamoli</span> took it to be <span class=SpellE>diÔÔhiÈnugati</span>.
That’s why you see the word ‘view’ here. ‘<span class=SpellE>DiÔÔhi</span>’
means wrong view. Actually the <span class=SpellE>PÈÄi</span> word is to be
separated as <span class=SpellE>diÔÔhÈ</span> <span class=SpellE>Ènugati</span>.
‘<span class=SpellE>DiÔÔhÈ</span>’ means what <span class=GramE>is <span
class=SpellE>seenand</span> ‘<span class=SpellE>Ènugati</span>’ means</span>
following. So following what is seen - that means following his conduct. Is
there a good word for that?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: Imitating.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: So “Those
imitating his conduct are brought to long-lasting suffering in the states of
loss.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Paragraph 155, do you understand that
passage?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“Now the Blessed One has shown
that when the <span class=SpellE>unvirtuous</span> have their minds captured by
pleasure and satisfaction in the indulgence of the five cords of sense-desires,
in (receiving) salutation, in being honored, etc., the result of that <span
class=SpellE>kamma</span>, directly visible in all ways, is very violent pain,
with that (<span class=SpellE>kamma</span>) as its condition, capable of
producing a gush of hot blood by causing agony of the heart with the mere
recollection of it.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>I have a fresh translation of that. “Now the
Blessed One who has directly seen the result of <span class=SpellE>kamma</span>
in all ways (Buddha has seen <span class=SpellE>kamma</span> and its results in
all ways.) and wanting to show the very bitter pain to be experienced by <span
class=SpellE>unvirtuous</span> persons whose minds are captured by pleasure and
satisfaction mentioned above has said: (Then what kind of pain?) pain which is
caused by pleasure and satisfaction in the indulgence of the five cords of
sensual desires (When a person indulges in these sensual desires, then there
will come pain.)<span class=GramE>caused</span> by pleasure and satisfaction in
receiving salutation.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Suppose that I am
a monk and I have broken the most important rules. Actually I am not a monk at
all, but I claim myself to be a monk. Then I receive salutation and bowing down
from lay people. As a result of that, I may suffer in hell or in the woeful
states. “Caused by pleasure and satisfaction in receiving salutations or being
honored, etc., the result of that <span class=SpellE>kamma</span> directly
visible in all ways, is very violent pain, with that <span class=SpellE>kamma</span>
as condition, capable of producing a gush of hot blood by causing agony of
heart with the mere recollection of <span class=SpellE>unvirtuousness</span>.”
Suppose I am <span class=SpellE>unvirtuous</span>. When <span class=SpellE>i</span>
think of my <span class=SpellE>unvirtuousness</span>, I will have remorse and
depression. This can cause me to vomit blood. So it is capable of producing a
gush of hot blood by causing agony of the heart, just by mere recollection of <span
class=SpellE>unvirtuousness</span>. This kind of pain, very bitter pain, is to
be experienced by those who are <span class=SpellE>unvirtuous</span> and whose
minds are captured by pleasure and satisfaction mentioned above. It is to be
translated that way although it is a little odd.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>***Devoid of <span
class=SpellE>SayÈdaw’s</span> explanations I believe the fresh translation is
the following: “Now the Blessed One who has directly seen the result of <span
class=SpellE>kamma</span> in all ways and wanting to show the very bitter pain
to be experienced by <span class=SpellE>unvirtuous</span> persons whose minds

is caused by pleasure and satisfaction in the indulgence of the five cords of

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In paragraph 158 one word is missing. The
word ‘therefore’ should stand at the head of the paragraph. It should read
“Therefore, what pleasure has a man of broken virtue” and so on. The advantage
of being virtuous and the disadvantage of being <span class=SpellE>unvirtuous</span>,
these two are given here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Towards the end of the verses “He is not
free from any sort of terror”. It could be translated as “any sort of
danger”.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the fourth line of this
paragraph it says, “He is well set upon the road to hell”. If all the woeful
states are meant by hell, it would be all right. Here what is meant is not hell
only, but the other woeful states also. There are four woeful states.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In paragraph 159 midway through the verses
“There are no cankers here and now”. It should say “There are no dangers here
and now” not ‘cankers’. “<span class=GramE>there</span> are no dangers here and
now to plague the virtuous man at all.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>I think that is it for the first chapter.
You have seen that mostly virtue for monks or precepts for monks is what <span
class=GramE>is</span> treated mostly in this chapter. Some advice is applicable
to the virtue of lay people and also to nuns and so on. Much is only for monks.
For lay persons the keeping of five precepts is just enough. Buddha said that a
person who claims <span class=GramE>himself</span> to be a disciple of the
Buddha should keep his moral conduct pure. That means he should keep five
precepts. If you take five precepts before going to practice meditation, that
is all right. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>For lay people it is easier to have
purification of morals, purity of moral conduct, than monks. Monks have
disadvantage here. Monks have so many rules to keep. If they have broken some
rules and they do not get rid of these offenses, then that state can be a block
to their concentration and progress. They must do confession or if the offenses
are graver, they must do something like living under probation for some period
of time. It is not so easy for monks to have complete purity of morals as it is
for lay people. For lay people although they may have broken rules in the past,
before practice of meditation if they take precepts and mean seriously to keep
them, that is enough for them. Purity of morals for the practice of meditation
is easier for lay people than for monks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>OK. <span class=GramE>Any questions?</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Student: So why does anyone
want to become a monk?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: A monk has fewer
things to worry about. Monks have more time to devote to the study and
practice. That is why I said in one of the talks that those monks who study the
<span class=SpellE>Visuddhi</span> <span class=SpellE>Magga</span> either give
up their robes or go into the forest and practice meditation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
