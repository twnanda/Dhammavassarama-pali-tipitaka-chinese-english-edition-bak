<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Chapter 13</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>(Tape 27 / Ps: 1-27)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So chapter 13 is the chapter on direct knowledge. ëThe
divine ear elementí simply means divine ear. ìIt is now the turn for the
description of the divine ear.î Then the translator gave the Text. It is good
because if we do not see the Text, we would not be able to understand the
explanations given.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ì[The Text is as follows: ëHe directs, he inclines his mind
to the divine ear element. With the divine ear element, which is purified and
surpasses the human, he hears both kinds of sounds, the divine and the human,
those that are far as well as nearí.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìëHerein, with the divine ear element: it is divine here
because of its similarity to the divine; for deities have as the divine ear
element the sensitivity that is produced by kamma consisting in good conduct
and is unimpeded by bile, phlegm, blood, etc., and capable of receiving an
object even though far off because it is liberated from imperfections.î Deities
have ears too. The sensitivity in their ears is so free from imperfections, so
free from impediments that they can hear sounds far away. Also they do not have
impediments like blood, bile, phlegm and so on. So their ears are much more
sensitive than human ears.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd this ear element consisting in knowledge, which is
produced by the power of this bhikkhuís energy in development, is similar to
that, so it is ëdivineí because it is similar to the divine.î Here the
Commentary is explaining the word ëdivineí. The P»ƒi word is dibba. Here the
P»ƒi word is dibbasota. ëDibbasotaí literally means divine ear. But here what
is really meant is not divine ear. It is the knowledge which is similar to the
divine ear. ìSo it is ëdivineí because it is similar to the divine.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then there is another explanation. ìFurthermore, it is
ëdivineí because it is obtained by means of divine abiding and because it has
divine abiding as its support.î Here ëdivine abidingí means jh»nas. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student; Is it the brahm» vih»ras?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: No. No. Although ëbrahm» vih»raí is translated as
divine abiding even in this book, here ëdivine abidingí does not mean brahm»
vih»ras. It just means the four jh»nas. ìAnd because it has divine abiding as
its support.î If you do not have the four jh»nas, then you cannot get this
direct knowledge. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In our P»ƒi books there are three kinds of abiding. The
first one is dibba vih»ra. Then there is brahm» vih»ra. And the last one is
Ariya vih»ra. There are three kinds of abiding - dibba vih»ra, brahm» vih»ra,
Ariya vih»ra. ëDibba vih»raí means jh»nas. ëBrahm» vih»raí means loving-kindness,
compassion and so on. ëAriya vih»raí means Fruit attainment. After becoming an
Ariya a person enters into that attainment again and again to enjoy it. Here
ëdivine abidingí means jh»nas and not the four divine abodes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd it is an ëear elementí in the sense of hearing and in
the sense of being soulless.î The word ëelementí or<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>dh»tu is defined as something that is without
a soul, that is soulless. The Commentator is explaining the word ësota dh»tuí.
It is called ësotaí because it hears in the sense of hearing. It is called
ëdh»tuí because it is without a soul. Sometimes dh»tu is explained as something
which is without a soul, which is just a phenomenon, that is not an entity.
ìAlso it is an ëear elementí because it is like the ear element in its performance
of an ear elementís function. With that ear elementî -</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Actually it is the mind?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: It is actually knowledge (pa““»), pa““» associated
with mindfulness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: So direct knowledge -</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: All direct knowledge is pa““». ìWhich is purified:
which is quite pure through having no imperfection. And surpasses the human:
which in the hearing of sounds surpasses, stands beyond, the human ear element
by surpassing the human environment.î That means it is beyond the normal range
of hearing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHe hears both kinds of sounds: he hears the two kinds of
sounds. What two? The divine and the human, the sounds of the deities and of
human beings, is what is meant.î Here ësoundsí means the sounds of speech. That
is why it is said ìThis should be understood as partially inclusiveî, not other
sound but just the speech sounds. ìThose that are far as well as near: what is
meant is that he hears sounds that are far off, even in another world sphere,
and those that are near, even the sounds of the creature living in his own
body. This should be understood as completely inclusive.î This includes
everything - sounds of animals, sounds of insects, sounds of germs, and of
other things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBut how is this [divine ear element] aroused?î What follows
is how to practice. ìThe bhikkhu should attain jh»na as basis for direct
knowledge and emerge. Then with consciousness belonging to the preliminary work
concentration he should advert first to the gross sounds in the distance
normally within range of hearing: (so little by little) the sound in the forest
of lions, etc., or in the monastery the sound of a gong, the sound of a drum,
the sound of a conch, the sound of recitation by novices and young bhikkhus
reciting with full vigor.î If you go to a Burmese monastery, you can still hear
young monks and novices reciting loudly. You can hear from a distance everyone
learning aloud. They are memorizing actually. (One should listen to) ìthe sound
of their ordinary talk such as ëWhat, Venerable Sir?í, ëWhat, friend?í, etc., the
sound of birds, the sound of wind, the sound of footsteps, the fizzing sound of
boiling water, the sound of palm leaves drying in the sun, the sound of ants,
and so on. Beginning in this way with quite gross sounds, he should
successively advert to more and more subtle sounds. He should give attention to
the sound sign of the sounds (That just means the sound.) in the eastern
direction, in the western direction, in the northern direction, in the southern
direction, on the upper direction, in the lower direction, in the eastern
intermediate direction, in the western intermediate direction, in the northern
intermediate direction , and in the southern intermediate direction. He should
give attention to the sound sign of gross and of subtle sounds.î ëSound signí
just means the sound or here the gross or subtle aspects of sound.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThese sounds are evident even to his normal consciousness.î
That means not yet the direct knowledge consciousness but this is evident to
his normal consciousness. If you pay attention to these sounds, you will hear
them normally. ìBut they are especially evident to his preliminary work
concentration consciousness.î That is when he is doing this. After emerging
from the jh»na, he adverts to these sounds. ìAs he gives his attention to the sound
sign in this way, [<u>thinking</u>] (Let us strike out ëthinkingí.) <u>Now the</u>
<u>divine ear element will arise</u>.î He makes this mistake always. He
misunderstood the P»ƒi idiom. What is really meant here is ìWhen the divine ear
element is about to arise, then mind-door adverting arisesî and so on, not
thinking. Now the divine ear element will arise. Instead of that we should say
ìWhen the divine ear element is about to arise, then mind-door adverting arises
making one of these sounds<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>its object.î
He is describing the thought process of direct knowledge. When direct knowledge
is about to arise, first there is mind-door adverting. ìWhen that (mind-door
adverting) has ceased, then either four or five impulsions impel.î They are
sense-sphere consciousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Why the mind-door and not the five senses?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: These are out of the range of the five senses. It
is going to be direct knowledge thought process which comes through mind-door,
not through five sense doors. ìFour or five impulsions impel, the first three,
or four of which are of the sense-sphere and are called preliminary work,
access, conformity and change-of-lineage, while the fourth or the fifth is the
fine material sphere absorption consciousness (This is direct knowledge
consciousness.) belonging to the fourth jh»na.î So direct knowledge
consciousness is actually fourth jh»na consciousness, but not the ordinary
fourth jh»na consciousness. Ordinary fourth jh»na consciousness takes the
object of meditation like a kasi”a and so on. Here it takes sound as an object
because it is the divine ear element.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHerein, it is the knowledge arisen together with the
absorption consciousness that is called the divine ear element.î The ëdivine
ear elementí really means knowledge or pa““».</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAfter that [absorption has been reached, the divine ear
element] becomes merged in that <u>ear</u> [of knowledge.î Sometimes it is
unfortunate that the same word has two very different meanings. The word for
ear is sota. The same word can mean stream or flow. Here it should be ìThe
divine ear element becomes merged in that stream of knowledge or that flow of
knowledge.î The same word is used here in two different senses. In fact the
P»ƒi word used is ìfalls into the stream of knowledge, into the flow of
knowledge.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìWhen consolidating it, he should extend it by delimiting a
single finger-breadth thus ëI will hear sounds within this areaí (a very small
area), then two finger-breadths, four finger-breadths, eight finger-breadths, a
span, a ratana (= 24 finger-breadths).î We understand ratana as from the elbow
to the tip of the fingers. It is about 18 inches. A ëspaní means the distance
between the thumb and the little finger. He tries to hear sounds within the
area - ìa span, a ratana, the interior of the room, the verandah, the building,
the surrounding walk, the park belonging to the community, the alms-resort
village, the district, and so on up to the [limit of the] world sphere or even
more. This is how he should extend it by delimited stages.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìOne who has reached direct knowledge in this way hears also
by means of direct knowledge without re-entering the basic jh»na any sound that
has come within the space touched by the basic jh»naís object.î For other
sounds he doesnít have to get into basic jh»na again and do the preliminary
work. He does not have to do that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd in hearing in this way, even if there is an uproar with
sounds of conches, drums, cymbals, etc., right up to the Brahm» World he can,
if he wants to, still define each one thus.î Although all the sounds are mixed
together he can define each one: ìThis is the sound of the conches, this is the
sound of the drumsî and so on. This is the divine ear. By the power of the
divine ear element a person can hear sounds far away, out of reach of the human
ear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now penetration of mind - ìAs to the explanation of
knowledge of penetration of minds, [the Text is as follows: ëHe directs, he
inclines his mind to the knowledge of penetration of minds (reading minds). He
penetrates with his mind the minds of other beings, of other persons, and understands
them thus: he understands [the manner of] consciousnessî - actually it is the
types of consciousness - ìaffected by greed as affected by greed, and
understands [types of] consciousness unaffected by greed as unaffected by
greedî and so on. ëAffectedí really means associated with. These are the 16
kinds of consciousness. You may find these also in the Mah» Satipa‘‘h»na Sutta
in the contemplation of mind or consciousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Towards the end of paragraph 8 is the word explanation of
the P»ƒi word ëcetopariyaí. First the word ëpariyaí is explained. ìIt goes all
round, thus it is pariya or penetration. That means the delimiting.î The
meaning is that it delimits. ìThe penetration of the heart is ëpenetration of
mindsí.î In P»ƒi it is just cetaso pariya—. We can say the penetration of mind
is the penetration of minds, which is ridiculous. Actually it cannot be
translated. ìIt is penetration of hearts and that is knowledge, thus it is
knowledge of penetration of minds (cetopariya“»”a).î ëCetoí means mind. ëPariyaí
means delimiting or penetration. ë©»”aí means knowledge. ì[He directs his
consciousness] to that, is what is meant.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìOf other beings: of the rest of beings, himself excluded.
(ëOf other<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>beingsí means not of
himself.) Of other persons: this has the same meaning as the last, the wording
being varied to suit those susceptible of teaching [in another way], and for
the sake of elegance of exposition.î Sometimes words are used, although they
are synonyms, again and again so that listeners could understand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìWith his mind the minds: with his consciousness of other
beings. Having penetrated: having delimited all round. He understands: he
understands them to be of various sorts beginning with that affected by greed.î
That means with greed, without greed and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBut how is this knowledge to be aroused? That is
successfully done through the divine eye (So first one has to get the knowledge
of the divine eye.), which constitutes its preliminary work.î So the knowledge
of divine eye or the divine eye element is a preliminary to this penetration of
minds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìTherefore the bhikkhu should extend light, and he should
seek out anotherís [type of] consciousness by keeping under observation with
the divine eye the color of the blood present with the matter of the physical
heart as its support.î Footnote 5 ìThe ëmatter of the heartí is not the
heart-basis, but rather it is the heart as the piece of flesh described as
resembling a lotus bud in shape outside and like a kos»tak  fruit inside.î Here
ëheartí does not mean the heart-base which is one of the material properties.
Here it means the whole heart. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìFor when consciousness accompanied by joy is present, blood
is red like a banyan fig fruit; when consciousness accompanied by grief
(domanassa - unpleasant feeling) is present, it is blackish like a (ripe)
rose-apple fruit.î Please put ëripeí before rose-apple. Do you have rose-apple
fruits in this country? Have you seen them? Their color is a mixture of black
and purple.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: So it is more like a plum?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Yes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Yes, I have a tree at home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Itís a little sour. So here we should have a ripe
rose-apple fruit. ìWhen a consciousness with serenity is present, it is clear
like sesamum oil. So he should seek out anotherís consciousness by keeping
under observation the color of the blood in the physical heart.î He looks into
the heart and looks into the color of the blood in the heart. ìThis matter is
originated by the joy faculty.î So when he sees the color red, then he knows
that mind is accompanied by joy and so on. ìThis is originated by the grief
faculty; this is originated by the equanimity faculty and so consolidates his
knowledge of penetration of hearts.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIt is when it has been consolidated in this way that he can
gradually get to understand not only all manner (all types) of sense-sphere
consciousness but (all of) those of fine material and immaterial consciousness
(r|p»vacara and ar|p»vacara) consciousness as well by tracing one consciousness
from<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>another without any more seeing the
physical heartís matter. For this is said in the Commentary: ëWhen he wants to
know anotherís consciousness in the immaterial moods, whose matter can he
observe?î Because there is no physical heart. ìWhose material alteration
[originated] by the faculties can he look at? No oneís. The province of a
possessor of supernormal power is [simply] this, namely, wherever the
consciousness he adverts to is, there he knows it according to these 16
classes.î í16 classesí means those given in paragraph 8 - those accompanied by
greed, those not accompanied by greed and so on. ìBut this explanation [by
means of the physical heart] is for one who has not [yet] done any <u>interpreting</u>.î
ëInterpretingí really means contemplating. ëInterpretingí may be misleading.
Here it means abhinivesa. It is reflecting or contemplating. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In footnote 6 ìOf one who has not done any interpreting
(abhinivesa) reckoned as <u>study</u> for direct knowledge.î I think it is not
ëstudyí but striving for direct knowledge. It is not just studying but practicing
for direct knowledge. He left out some words that are important. Please add
after ëdirect knowledgeí ìA beginner is what is meant.î That should be added.
ìA rather special use of the word abhinivesa, perhaps more freely renderable
here as ëpracticeí.î Right. I think that is nearer to the original meaning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAs regards [the manner of consciousness <u>affected</u> by
greed (That means associated with greed.) etc., the eight [manners of] (eight
types of) consciousness accompanied by greed should be understood as [the
manner of] consciousness affected by greed. The remaining profitable and
indeterminate [manners of] consciousness in the four planes are unaffected by
greed.î You will need the citta chart. There are 12 types of akusala
consciousness and 8 are accompanied by greed, and 2 are accompanied by anger,
and the last 2 are accompanied by ignorance only. So 8 are accompanied by
greed. The remaining profitable and indeterminate types of consciousness (There
are other types of consciousness) are unaffected by greed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe 4, namely, the 2 consciousnesses accompanied by grief
and the 2 consciousnesses accompanied by uncertainty (That means doubt.) and
agitation are not included in this dyad, though some elders include them too.î
It is a little difficult to understand here. Among the 12, 8 are associated
with lobha or r»ga. Here the word ër»gaí is used. So 8 are associated with r»ga
(greed), but 4 are not associated with greed. However these 4 are not included
in this dyad. This is explained here. The Sub-Commentary also explains, but it
is not so convincing. In the Sub-Commentary it is said that these 4 types of
consciousnesses are not associated with greed, but since greed can be a
condition for these 4 types of consciousness to arise, there may be some
suspicion for those who do not know Abhidhamma that they may be accompanied by
greed. So they<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>are not included in those
accompanied by greed or those not accompanied by greed. They are left out of
this dyad all together. ìThe four, namely, the 2 consciousnesses accompanied by
grief and the 2 consciousnesses accompanied respectively by uncertainty and
agitation are not included in this dyad, though some elders include them too.î
I think we should side with some elders. Itís easier. Some elders said they
should be included with those unaffected by greed because they are not
accompanied by greed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIt is the 2 consciousnesses accompanied by grief that are
called consciousness affected by hate.î That means the two dosa m|la cittas.
ìAnd all profitable and indeterminate consciousness in the 4 planes are
unaffected by hate. The remaining 10 kinds of unprofitable consciousnesses are
not included in this dyad, though some elders include them too. Affected by
delusion.. unaffected by delusion: here only the 2, namely, that accompanied by
uncertainty and that accompanied by agitation, are affected by delusion
simplicitur [without being accompanied by the other 2 unprofitable roots].î The
last 2 types of consciousness among the 12 are affected by delusion. What are
unaffected by delusion? ìthe 2, namely, that accompanied by uncertainty and
that accompanied by agitation, are affected by delusionî - that means they are
affected by delusion only - ìwithout being accompanied by the other two
unprofitable roots.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBut [all] the 12 kinds of unprofitable consciousnesses can
also be understood as consciousness affected by delusion since delusion is
present in all kinds of unprofitable consciousnesses.î The 12 types of
unwholesome consciousness, all 12 of them are accompanied by delusion. We can
say in two ways here. ëAffected by delusioní can mean only 2, the last 2,
because they are affected by delusion only. But if we take it not as ëaffected
by delusion onlyí, then we can take all 12. ì[All] the 12 kinds of unprofitable
consciousness can also be understood as consciousness affected by delusion
since delusion is present in all kinds of unprofitable consciousnesses. The
rest are unaffected by delusion.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìCramped is that attended by stiffness and torpor. (That
means you are sleepy.) Distracted is that attended by agitation. Exalted is
that of the fine material and immaterial spheres (r|p»vacara and ar|p»vacara).
Unexalted is the rest. Surpassed is all that in the three [mundane] planes
(k»m»vacara, r|p»vacara, ar|p»vacara). Unsurpassed is the supramundane
(lokuttara). Concentrated is that attained to access and that attained to
absorption (the 2 kinds of concentration). Unconcentrated is that not attained
to either. Liberated is that attained to any [of the 5 kinds of] deliverance,
that is to say, deliverance by substitution of opposites [through insight], by
suppression [through concentration], by cutting off [by means of the Path], by
tranquilization [by means of Fruition], and by renunciation [as Nibb»na].î So
there are 5 kinds of deliverance. The first one is momentary. The second one is
temporary. The third one is total cutting off. The fourth one is stilling. Let
us say that first you put out a fire. Then you pour some more water on it so
that it is really extinguished. That is done by tranquilization. By
ërenunciationí means when a person gets enlightenment, Nibb»na is the object
there. Taking Nibb»na as object, enlightenment consciousness eradicates mental
defilements. There it is by renunciation because at the enlightenment moment
everything is renounced or given up. ìUnliberated is that which has not
attained to any of the 5 kinds of liberation.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìSo the bhikkhu who has acquired knowledge of penetration of
hearts understands all these [types of consciousness, namely] consciousness
affected by greed as affected by greedî and so on. This is how those who
possess supernormal knowledge read the minds of other people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we have the recollection of past lives. ìAs to the
explanation of knowledge of recollection of past life, [the Text is as follows:
ëHe directs, he inclines, his mind to the knowledge of recollection of past
lifeí î and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>About the middle of paragraph 13 ìHerein, to the knowledge
of recollection of past life [means] for knowledge concerning recollection of
past life. Past life is aggregates lived in the past in former births. This is
one explanation. ì ëLivedí [in that case means] lived out, undergoneî - the
Commentary explanation for the word ëundergoneí<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>is arisen again and again - ìarisen and ceased in oneís own [subjective]
continuity.î This is one explanation of the words ëpast lifeí. ëPast lifeí
means aggregates lived in the past. That means aggregates which have arisen in
oneís own continuity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now there is a second explanation. ìOr alternatively, [past
life] is <u>mental objects</u>î - no. Past life is all phenomena, not just
mental objects. The P»ƒi word used is dhamma.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>ëDhammaí does not mean mental objects, it is all phenomena. In the first
explanation only the aggregates are taken. ëPast livesí means let us say past aggregates.
In this explanation ëpast livesí means all past things - aggregates, Nibbana
and any other thing. It is wider in scope than the first one. ìOr
alternatively, [past life] is all phenomena livedî - ëlivedí means what? ìIn
that case it means lived by living in oneís [objective] resort.î Do you
understand that? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: I donít understand ëresortí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Right. ëLiving in oneís resortí just means
remembered, taken as an object.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Itís memory?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Yes. ìWhich has been cognized and delimited by
oneís own consciousness, or cognized by anotherís consciousness, tooî - here
also we have to make some changes. After ëtooí there should be a comma and the
word ëiní should start with a small ëIí, ìin the case of recollection of those
[past Enlightened Ones] who have broken the cycle, and so on.î It is a full
stop there. Then there is a capital ëTí for the next sentence. ìThese last are
only accessible to Enlightened Ones.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second explanation is that ëlivedí here is just taken as
object, so it is like remembered, and remembered by oneself as well as by
others. Let us say somebody can remember his past life. You can remember your
past life. That means the past life which you can take as an object. In that
case you can remember other people too, but<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>you cannot remember what other people experienced. That is one kind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other is ëcognized by anotherís consciousness, tooí.
That is ìin the case of recollection of those [past Enlightened Ones]î - that
means Arahants and Buddhas - ìwho have broken the cycle and so on. These last
are accessible only to Enlightened Ones.î That means only the Buddhas have such
knowledge. Disciples cannot remember what is experienced by other persons. They
can remember their own experiences in the past. Suppose I can remember my past
life. Then I can tell you that I had such a father and such a mother, but I
cannot remember what my father experienced or thought in that life. Buddhas can
remember all this. When the Buddha talked about the J»takas, he talked about his
experiences as well as other peopleís experiences.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìRecollection of past life: the mindfulness (memory) by
means of which he recollects the past life is the recollection of past life.
Knowledge is the knowledge associated with that mindfulnessî and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìManifold: of many kinds; or that has occurred in many<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>ways. Given in detail is the meaning. Past
life is the continuity lived here and there, taking the immediately previous
existence as the beginning [and working backwards].î So one begins with the immediately
preceding life and goes backward. ì He recollects: he recalls it, following it
out by the succession of aggregates, or by death and rebirth-linking.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThere are 6 kinds of people who recollect this past life.
They are: other sectarians (non-Buddhists), ordinary disciples, Great
Disciples, Chief Disciples, Pacceka Buddhas, and Buddhas.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: So anybody.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Yes, anybody. That is why jh»nas and supernormal
knowledge are not found in Buddhism only according to our books. So those who
are not Buddhist can have this kind of knowledge, but there is a difference. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHerein, other sectarians recollect only as far back as 40
eons but not beyond that.î They are limited. ìWhy? Because their understanding
is weak for lack of delimitation of mind and matter.î Because they did not
practice vipassan». ìOrdinary disciples recollect as far back as 100 eons and
as far back as 1000 eons because their understanding is strong. The 80 Great
Disciples recollect as far back as 100,000 eons. The 2 Chief Disciples
recollect as far back as an incalculable age and 100,000 eons. The Pacceka
Buddhas recollect as far back as two incalculable ages and 100,000 eons. For
such is the extent to which <u>they can convey [their minds back respectively</u>].î
The P»ƒi word used here is abhinih»ra. That means accumulating perfections. For
example if you want to become one of the Great Disciples, you have to
accumulate p»ramis (the perfections) for 100,000 eons. Since you have
accumulated for 100,000 eons when you become a Great Disciple, you can remember
all these lives, all these eons, not beyond that. It is something like if you
have lived here for only one year, you cannot remember beyond that. It is
something like that. So it is not ëthey can convey [their mind back
respectively]í. It should be ìFor such is the extent to which they have
accumulated their perfections.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAgain other sectarians only recollect the succession of
aggregates; they are unable to recollect according [only] to death and
rebirth-linking, letting go of the succession of aggregates.î When you
recollect the past life,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>then you can
recollect from this moment backwards to rebirth in this life, and then you can
go beyond rebirth to death in the previous life and so on. Ordinary persons can
go back gradually, not jumping to the relinking and then to the death in the
previous life. But Buddhas can do all that. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here it is said that other sectarians are like blind people
unable to descend upon any place they choose. ìThey go as the blind do without
letting go of their sticks (so going little by little).î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBuddhas, however, have nothing to do either with succession
of aggregates or with tracing through death and rebirth-linking; for whatever
instance they choose in many millions of eons, or more or less,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>go, is evident to them. So they go, and so
they descend with the lionís descent wherever they want.î That means a lion can
jump anywhere it wants. They donít have to go one by one. It is called ëlionís
descentí, ìwherever they want, even skipping over many millions of eons as
though they were<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>an elision in a text.î
When you recite a text, you can use peyy»la. Sometimes when we recite the
texts, we use peyy»la because we donít want to repeat it in full. It is like
the Heart Sutra.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: And so forth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: We say the word in the beginning and then the word
at the end. ìAnd just as an arrow shot by such a master of archery expert in
hair-splitting Sarabha~ga (He was a Bodhisatta, the Buddha in one of his past
lives.) always hits the target without getting . held up among trees, creepers,
etc., on its way, and so neither gets held up nor misses so too, since Buddhas
go in this way their knowledge does not get held up in intermediate births or
miss; without getting held up or missing, it seizes any instance required.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 22 is the explanation of how to go about getting
the recollection of a past life. One gets the basic jh»na. Then one emerges
from basic jh»na and then one adverts to his most recent act of sitting down
for this purpose. Then you go back little by little, next to the preparation of
the seat, to the entry into the lodging, to the putting away of the bowl and
outer robe and so on. You recollect your actions backwards from the time you
sit down backward - to the time of eating, to the time of returning from the
village, to time of wandering for alms in the village, to the time of entering
the village and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìWhile this much, however, is evident even to his normal
consciousness it is especially evident to his preliminary work consciousness.î If
you recall this with normal consciousness, you can see them clearly. With the
preliminary work consciousness you see more vividly. ìbut if anything there is
not evident, he should again attain the basic jh»na, emerge and advert.î So you
should do it again. ìBy so doing it becomes as evident as when a lamp is lit.
And so in reverse order too, he should advert to the things done on the second
day back, and on the third, fourth and fifth day, and in the ten days, and in
the fortnight, and as far back as a year.î Then for 10 years, 20 years and so
on. ìFor a wise bhikkhu is able at the first attempt to remove the
rebirth-linkingî - ëremoveí means open or something like that<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>- ìand make the mentality-materiality at the death
moment his object.î So it goes back to the death in the previous life. Then a
simile is given where it says if you donít see it, donít giver up. Try it again
and again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are on paragraph 28 the contraction and expansion of the
world cycle. That means the destruction and rebirth of the world cycle. This is
Therav»da Buddhist cosmology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHerein, one birth is the continuity of aggregates included
in a single becoming starting with rebirth-linking and ending with death.î ëOne
birthí means one life beginning with relinking and ending with death. ìSo too
with two births, and the rest.î When a monk gets this direct knowledge, he can
remember one birth, two births, three births and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBut in the case of many eons of world contraction, etc., it
should be understood that the eon of world contraction is an eon of diminution
(Actually it is the destruction of the world.) and the eon of world expansion
is an eon of increase (the beginning or reforming of the world). Herein, what <u>supersedes</u>
the contraction is included.î What does the word ësupersedeí mean? To replace?
What is meant here is that which follows the contraction. There are four periods
- the world being destroyed, the world remaining in the destroyed state, the
reforming or becoming a new world, and then remaining as a new world. There are
four periods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHerein, what follows the contraction is included in the
contraction since it is rooted in it (That means because it comes after it.);
and so too what follows the expansion is included in the expansion.î So we get
four of the world eons or four incalculables of the eons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìWhat four? The contraction, what follows the contraction,
the expansion, what follows the expansion.î There are four. They are called
ëincalculablesí because there is no saying how many millions and millions of
years they are.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHerein, there are three kinds of <u>contraction</u> (That
means destruction.) destruction due to water, destruction due to fire,
destruction due to air.î There are three causes of destruction of the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThere are three limits to the destruction: the åbhassar»
(Streaming-Radiance) Brahm» World, that of the Subhaki”ha (Refulgent-Glory),
and that of the Vehapphala (Great Fruit). When the eon contracts owing to fire,
all below åbhassar» [Brahm» world] is burnt up by fire. When it contracts owing
to water, it is all dissolved by water up to the Subhaki”ha [Brahma World].
When it contracts owing to air, it is all demolished by wind up to the
Vehapphala [Brahm» World].î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you look at this chart, you will find these worlds. This
is the diagram of the 31 planes of existence taught in Buddhism in Abhidhamma.
At the bottom we have #1 Niraya. That is hell. #2 Tiracch»na-yoni is animal
world. #3 Petti-visaya is hungry ghosts. #4 is Asura-k»ya. They are a kind of
ghost, not the same as #3. Then Manuss» is human beings. Above human beings
there are six Deva Worlds. Above the Deva Worlds are the Brahm» Worlds. The
first plane is called the first jh»na world. They are 1. Brahma-p»risajja, 2.
Brahma-purohita, 3. Mah»-brahm». The next ones (4. Paritt»bh», 5. Appam»”»bh»,
6. åbhassar») are the second jh»na planes. Then 7. Paritta-subh», 8.
Appam»na-subha, 9. Subhaki”h» are third jh»na plane. Vehapphala, Asa““a-satta,
Aviha, Atappa, Sudass», Sudass , Akani‘‘ha all belong to fourth jh»na plane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the world is destroyed by fire, the åbhassar» is the
limit there. When the world is destroyed by water, then Paritt»bh», Appam»”abh»
and åbhassar» are destroyed. Its limit is Subhaki”h». When the world is
destroyed by air, it goes up to or reaches to 10. Vehapphala. These three
planes (first jh»na plane, second jh»na plane, third jh»na plane) are subject
to destruction by air. Up through the first jh»na plane is destroyed by fire.
Up through the second jh»na plane is destroyed by water. Up through the third
jh»na plane the world is destroyed by air or wind. The upper worlds are not
destroyed when the lower worlds are destroyed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn breadth it is always one of the Buddha fields that is
destroyed. For the Buddha fields are of three kinds, that is, the field of
birth, the field of authority, and the field of scope.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHerein, the field of birth is limited by the 10,000 world-spheres
(That means something like 10,000 universes.) that quaked on the Perfect Oneís
taking rebirth-linking, and so on.î It is said that when Buddha takes
conception in his motherís womb, the 10,000 world-spheres quake, or shake, or
tremble. This happens at his birth, his enlightenment and so on. This is called
the field of birth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second one is the field of authority. ìThe field of
authority is limited by a <u>hundred</u> <u>thousand</u> million
world-spheres.î That is not right. It is a million million, not a hundred
thousand million. ìThe field of authority is limited by the million million
world-spheres where the following safeguards (paritta-chanting) are
efficacious.î That means the power of the parittas extends to these million
million world-spheres. You say the parittas here and the power of the parittas
will pervade the million million world-spheres. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThat is the Ratana Sutta (The Jewel Sutta), the Khandha
Paritta (Khandha Sutta is for snake bites and so on.), the Dhajagga Paritta (It
is found in the Sa—yutta Nik»ya. When you are afraid of something, you recite
the Dhajagga Sutta.), the å‘»n»‘iya Paritta (It is found in the D gha Nik»ya.
That is for protection against ghosts, demons and so on.), and the Mora Paritta
(That is for protection from being imprisoned.) ëMoraí means peacock. Once
Buddha was reborn as a peacock. The hunters tried to snare him. It is said that
he recited this Sutta and so he was able to escape being caught for many many
years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe field of scope is boundless.î The third field is boundless,
immeasurable. We cannot say there are a million million world-spheres or
whatever. It is boundless, ìas far as he wishes it is said. The Perfect One
knows anything anywhere that he wishes. So one of these three Buddha fields,
that is to say, the field of authority is destroyed.î When the world is
destroyed, the field of authority is destroyed. That means a million million
world-spheres. ìBut when that is being destroyed, the field of birth also gets
destroyed (because that is included in the field of authority). And that
happens simultaneously (at the same time); and when it is reconstituted, that
happens simultaneously.î These world-spheres in the field of authority are
destroyed at the same time and are reconstituted at the same time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìNow it should be understood how its destruction and
reconstitution come about thus.î This is Buddhist genesis. Whenever you see a
hundred thousand million, please correct to a million million. ìThere is a
great down-pour all over the million million world-spheres. People are
delighted, and they bring all their seeds and sow them. But when the sprouts
have grown enough for an ox to graze, then not a drop of rain falls any more <u>even
when asses bray</u>.î What is that? Actually he misunderstood the P»ƒi idiom
here. What the idiom really says here is ëthe rain bringing the bray of assesí.
That means making noises as asses do. That means there may be thunder, but not
a drop of rain falls. The noise of thunder may be similar to the noise made by
asses or donkeys. ìRain is withheld from then on. This is what the Blessed One
referred to when he said ëBhikkhus, an occasion comes when for many years, for
many hundred years, for many thousand years, for many hundred thousand years,
there is no rainí.î That is found in A”guttara Nik»ya (Gradual Sayings), Volume
4, page 64. In that Sutta Buddha talked about seven suns rising at the end of
the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 34 ìDeities come to know that at the end of a
100,000 years there will be the <u>emergence</u> of an eon.î Actually it is the
destruction of an eon, not emergence. Also a few lines down ìThey make this
announcement, ëGood sirs, good sirs, at the end of a 100,000 years from now
there will be the destruction (not emergence) of an eoní.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìWhen human beings and earth deities hear their words, they
mostly are filled with a sense of urgency. They become kind to each other and
make merit with loving-kindness, etc., and so they are reborn in the divine
world.î At the end of the world every being dies and they are reborn in the
Brahm» World.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThere they eat divine food, and they do the preliminary
work on air kasi”a and acquire jh»na.î First they are reborn in the Deva World.
Then from there they are reborn in the Brahm» World. ìOthers, however, are
reborn in a [sense-sphere] divine world through kamma to be experienced in a
future life. For there is no being traversing the round of rebirths who is
destitute of kamma to be experienced in a future life.î That means there may be
some beings who could not do anything to be reborn in that life, that is to be
reborn as a deva. But every being has a store of kamma in the past. And so as a
result of that store of kamma they are all reborn in the Deva World. Then from
the Deva World they go up to the Brahm» World. Since all the world is to be
destroyed - human world, animal world, deva world and even the Brahm» World is
to be destroyed, beings are to be reborn out of reach of this destruction. So
it is said that every being just before the destruction will be reborn in the
Brahm» World. Let us say there is a proclamation that in 100,000 years the
world is to be destroyed. So people get afraid. They become good to each other.
They practice meditation. They find that they are reborn as devas. From there
they find that they will be reborn as Brahm»s.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHowever, at the end of a long period, after the withholding
of the rain, a second sun appears.î Then a second sun appears. ìAnd this is
described by the Blessed One.î This is in the same Sutta. ëSattasuriyaí means
seven suns. The name of that Sutta is Sattasuriya. ëSattaí means seven and
ësuriyaí means sun, so seven suns.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìNow when that has appeared, there is no more telling night
from day. As one sun sets the other rises.î There is always day, no night. ìThe
world is uninterruptedly scorched by the suns. But there is no sun deity in the
eon-destruction sun as there is in the ordinary sun.î Buddhists believe that
there are guardian deities of the sun, the moon and so on. But for the second
sun<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>which arises for the destruction of
the world there is no guardian deity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìNow when the ordinary sun is present, thunder clouds and <u>mareís-tail
vapors</u> cross the skies.î What is that? Is it a usual expression in
English?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>I cannot find the P»ƒi word for
this English word in the original. The P»ƒi word is dh|masikh». ëDh|maí means
vapor or smoke. ëSikh»í means fire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBeginning with the rivulets the water in all the rivers
except the Five Great Rivers dries up.î When the second sun comes up, the water
in the small rivers dries up, but not the water in the five great rivers. They
are talking about <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
It is believed that there are five great rivers in <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
- the <st1:place>Ganges</st1:place>, Yamun» (Jumma), Sarabhu, Sarassati, and
Mah . These are the five great rivers. For <st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region>
it would be the <st1:State><st1:place>Mississippi</st1:place></st1:State>. So
the water in these five great rivers has not yet dried up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAfter that, at the end of a long period, a third sun
appears. And when that has appeared, the Great Rivers dry up too.î So there is
a third sun, fourth sun, fifth sun, sixth sun. Then what happens when the
seventh sun arises? ìAnd the million million world-spheres are the same as this
one. After that, at the end of a long period, a seventh sun appears. And when
that has appeared, the whole world-sphere together with the million million
other world-spheres catches fire.î When the seven suns arise, then everything
catches fire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìEven the summits of Sineru (That means <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>Mount</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceName>Meru</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>, the mountain believed to be
at the center of the world cycle.), a 100 leagues or more high, crumble and
vanish into space. The conflagration mounts up and invades the realm of the
Four Kings (That means the devas.). When it has burnt up all the golden
palaces, the jeweled palaces, and the crystal palaces there, it invades the
Realm of the Thirty-three. And so it goes right on up to the plane of the first
jh»na. When it has burnt three [lower] Brahm» Worlds, it stops there at the
åbhassar» World. As long as any formed thing (formation)<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>the size of an atom still exists, it does not
go out; but it goes out when all formed things have been consumed.î So nothing is
left. ìAnd like the flame that burns ghee and oil it leaves no ash.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Inaudible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: It is equally authoritative as other Suttas, but
not all things mentioned here are from the Suttas. In the Sutta the Buddha said
that at some time a second sun would appear and so on. The details are filled
in by the Commentators. They may or may not be the explanation given by the
Buddha. Maybe there are things added later by the Commentators.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So the world goes like that. ìThe upper space is now all one
with the lower space in a vast gloomy darkness. Then at the end of a long
period a great cloud arises, and at first it rains gently, and then it rains
with ever heavier deluges, like lotus stems, like rods, like pestles, like palm
trunks, more and more. And so it pours down upon all the burnt areas in the
million million world-spheres till they disappear. Then the winds (forces)
beneath and all around that water rise up and compact it and round it, like
water drops on a lotus leaf. How do they compact the great mass of water? By
making gaps; for the wind makes gaps in it here and there.î This is the
reforming, the reconstitution of the world. The world is destroyed. It remains
in the destroyed state for many eons. Then the world forms again. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the beginning of the forming of the word there is a great
rain.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>Then it flows down on the burnt
areas in the million million world-spheres. The water is formed in the air into
something like a ball. ëRound ití means made the water round like the water
drops<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>on a lotus leaf.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBeing thus compressed by the air, compacted and reduced, it
gradually subsides. As it sinks, the [lower] Brahm» World reappears in its
place.î So it is the beginning of the world again. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThen the beings that were reborn first in the Brahm» World
of Streaming Radiance (åbhassar») fall from there with the exhaustion of their
life span.î So the first beings in the present world were those who fell (that
means who died) from the Streaming Radiance realm of Brahm»s and later were
reborn here on earth. They were the first human beings in the present world.
They fell from there ìwith the exhaustion of their life span or when the merit
is exhausted, and they reappear here. They are self-luminous and wander in the
sky.î That is because there is no sun or moon yet. They have radiance of their
own and go about with that radiance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìOn eating the essential humus, as is told in the Aga““a
Sutta (That is Sutta #27 in the D gha Nik»ya), they are overcome by craving.î
There is something like a cream on the earth. When you boil milk, you get
cream. So there was something like cream on the earth. So one man was curious
about that and took some and tasted it. It is said that the taste was very
good. So they were overcome by craving. ìThey busied themselves in making lumps
of it to eat. Then their self-luminosity vanishes, and it is dark.î So this is
the downfall of human beings. ìThey are frightened when they see the darkness.
Then in order to remove their fears and give them courage, the sunís disk
appears full fifty leagues across.î The sun is said to be fifty leagues across,
about 400 miles across. ìThey are delighted to see it, thinking ëWe have
lightí, and they say ëIt has appeared in order to allay our fears and give us
courage, so let it be called ìSun (suriya)îí.î The P»ƒi word ësuraí means to be
courageous. So ësuriyaí means that which gives courage. So when the sun
appeared there was light and people were not afraid. So the sun was called
ësuriyaí. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìNow when the sun has given light for a day, it sets. Then
they are frightened again, thinking ëWe have lost the light we hadí, and they
think ëHow good if we had another light!í. As if knowing their thought, the
moonís disk appears, 49 leagues across.î So the difference between the sun and
moon is only one league because if you look from here, they appear just about
the same size.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìOn seeing it they are still more delighted, and they say
ëIt has appeared, seeming as if it knew our desire (chanda), so let it be
called ìMoon (canda)îí.î So chanda is changed to canda. ìSo they give it the
name ëMoon (canda)í.î Moon is canda in P»ƒi. It is derived from chanda which
means desire. Because of the force of the desire of the people the moon disk
appeared. That is why it is called ëdesire (canda)í. It is something like that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAfter the appearance of the moon and sun in this way, the
stars appear in their constellations. After that, night and day are made known,
and in due course, the month and half month, the season, and the year.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìOn the day the moon and sun appear, the mountains of Sineru
(<st1:place><st1:PlaceType>Mount</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName>Meru</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>),
of the World-sphere and of <st1:place>Himalayas</st1:place> appear too.î So on
the day that the moon and sun appear all the mountains appear too. ìAnd they
appear on the full-moon day of the month of Phagguna (March), neither before
nor after.î March is something like the beginning of the appearance of sun, and
moon, and mountains, and rivers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Is it also the end of the rainy season?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: It is summer there. March is the beginning of
summer. It is very hot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: When is the rainy season?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Let me see. The rains come about May although we do
not call it rainy season yet. ìHow? Just as, when millet is cooking and
bubbles<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>arise, then simultaneously, some
parts are domes, some hollow, and some flat, so too, there are mountains in the
domed places, seas in the hollow places, and continents (islands) in the flat
places.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThen as these beings make use of the essential humus,
gradually some become handsome and some ugly.î Now they eat something, and so
their appearance become different.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe handsome ones despise the ugly ones. Owing to their
contempt the essential humus vanishes (That cream vanishes.) and an outgrowth
from the soil appears. (Another thing appears for them.) Then that vanishes in
the same way and the bad»lat» creeper appears (maybe a sweet creeper). That too
vanishes in the same way and rice without red powder or husk that ripens
without tilling appears.î You donít have to till. You donít have to take off
the husk. It is ready-made, ìa clean sweet-smelling rice fruit.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThen vessels appear. They put the rice into the vessels,
which they put on the tops of stones. A flame appears spontaneously (They donít
have to make a fire. A fire just appears automatically.) and cooks it. The
cooked rice resembles jasmine flowers. It has no need of sauces and curries,
since it has whatever flavor they want to taste.î This is very good. Right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAs soon as they eat this gross food, urine and excrement
appear in them. Then wound orifices break open in themî - male and female appear
and so on and so on. This is the beginning of the world according to the
teachings of the Buddha.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At that time they do not grow any food. They just go to
trees, pluck the fruit and take it. Later on there was a lazy man. So he stole
something. When he stole something, the fruits on the trees disappeared. So
gradually things deteriorated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Later some people stole something from other persons. There
was some unruliness so they met together and elected someone to be their king.
That person happened to be our Bodhisatta. Since he was recognized by the
majority, he was called Mah» Sammata. That king was called Mah» Sammata.
ëSammataí means recognized or agreed to by all people. ìSince he was lord of
the fields, he was called Khattiya.î ëKhattiyaí means warrior caste, warrior
noble. ìSince he was lord of the fields, he was called ëKhattiyaí.î ëKhattiyaí
means warrior caste, warrior noble. ìSince he promoted othersí good righteously
and equitably, he was a king.î Now the P»ƒi word for king is r»ja. Here it is
derived from the root ra“ja which means to please. So a king is a person who
pleases his people. He makes people pleased so he is called a r»ja, a king. So
the Bodhisatta was called Mah» Sammata, Khattiya or R»ja. ìThis is how he came
to be known by these names. For the Bodhisatta himself is the first man
concerned in any wonderful innovation in the world. So after the Khattiya
circle had been established by making the Bodhisatta the first in this way, the
Brahmans and the other castes were founded in due succession.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Buddhism does not recognize the supremacy of the Brahman
caste. In Buddhist books you will find the Warrior caste put above the Brahman
caste. In Hinduism the Brahman caste comes first and the Warrior caste second.
They have the stratification of human society into four groups - priests or
Brahmans, kings and warriors, merchants, and ordinary people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHerein, the period from the time of the great cloud
heralding the eonís destruction up till the ceasing of the flames constitutes
one incalculable, and that is called the ëcontractioní.î That is the
destruction period. ìThat from the ceasing of the flames of the eon of
destruction up till the great cloud of rehabilitation, which rains down upon
the million million world-spheres constitutes the second incalculable, and that
is called ëwhat follows the contractioní. That from the time of the great cloud
of rehabilitation up till the appearance of the moon and sun constitutes the
third incalculable, and that is called the ëexpansioní. That from the
appearance of the moon and sun up till the reappearance of the great cloud of
the eon of destruction is the fourth incalculable, and that is called ëwhat
follows the expansioní.î We are in this stage, the last, the fourth stage.
ìThis, firstly is how the destruction by fire and reconstitution should be
understood.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then there is destruction by water. It is interesting here.
ìThere is this difference, however. While in the former case a second sun
appeared, in this case a great cloud of caustic waters appears.î It is like
acid rain. It could be acid rain because it destroys everything. When the world
is destroyed by water, everything is destroyed up through the three second
jh»na planes or including the three second jh»na planes. When the world is
destroyed by air, it includes the three third jh»na planes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 64 the author gives the reason for the worldís
destruction, why there is the destruction of the world. ìThe [three] roots of
the unprofitable are the reasons.î Lobha, dosa and moha are the reasons. ìWhen
any one of the roots of the unprofitable become conspicuous, the world is
destroyed accordingly. When greed is more conspicuous, it is destroyed by fire.
When hate is more conspicuous, it is destroyed by water - though some say that
it is destroyed by fire when hate is more conspicuous, and by water when greed
is more conspicuous.î So there is a difference of opinion. ìAnd when delusion
is more conspicuous, it is destroyed by wind.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìDestroyed as it is in this way, it is destroyed for seven times.î
There are three causes of destruction - fire, water and air. The world is
destroyed seven times by fire and the eighth time it is destroyed by water.
Then the world is destroyed another seven times by fire and the eighth time by
water and so on until 64. The 64<sup>th</sup> world is destroyed by air. So it
is seven times by fire and one time by water, seven times by fire and one time
by water, seven times by fire and one time by water and so on. When you reach
the 64<sup>th</sup> one, the turn of air has come. That is explained in
paragraph 65. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The person who possesses direct knowledge sees all these
world-spheres. ìNow when a bhikkhu capable of recollecting eons is recollecting
his former life, then of such eons as these he recollects many eons of world
contraction and expansion. How? In the way beginning ëThere I was..íî There I
was reborn as something, having such a name, belonging to such a clan and so
on. ìSo named: [such forenames as] Tissa, say, or Phussa. Of such a race
(ëRaceí means clan.) [such family names as] Kacc»na, say, or Kassapa. This is
said of the recollection of his own name and clan (surname) in his past
existence. But if he wants to recollect his own appearance at that time, or
whether his life was a rough or refined one, or whether pleasure or pain was
prevalent, or whether his life span was short or long, he recollects that too.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHere with such an appearance, means fair or dark. Such was
my food.î These are all details that he can recollect. ìAnd passing away from
there, I reappeared elsewhere.î So wherever he was reborn, he could remember
his past life by the power of his direct knowledge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 70 it explains in another way phrases like
ëthere I was reborní, ëpassing away from thereí, ëI appeared elsewhereí, ëI
appeared hereí, and so on. The first explanation takes the text to be in
general. If it says ìThere I was reborn, and passing away from there I
reappeared elsewhereî and so on, it refers to any eon in any life. In the
second explanation the monk goes back gradually from one life to another. Then
he may stop anywhere he likes and come back again. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is what is meant here in paragraph 71. ìFurthermore,
the words ëthere I wasí refer to the recollection of one who has cast back
retrospectively (That means going back gradually one by one.) as far as he
wishes, and the words ëand passing away from thereí refer to his reviewing
after turning forward again.î Suppose we go back from this life which is #1 to
life #2, #3, #4, #5, #6 and so on. Let us say we go back to life #10. Then we
come back through lives #10, #9, #8, #7, #6, #5 and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìConsequently the words ëI appeared elsewhereí can be
understood to be said with reference to the place of his reappearance next
before his appearance here.î That means if this life is said to be #1, then the
life before it is said to be #2. It is something like that. ëAnd passing away
from thereí refers to the second life from this life going backward. ì ëI
appeared elsewhereí can be understood to be said with reference to the place of
his reappearance.î ëI appeared elsewhereí means I appeared in the immediately
preceding past life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe words ëthere too I wasí, etc., are said in order to
show the recollection of his name, race, etc., there in the place of his
reappearance next before this appearance.î So in the second explanation ëthere
I was reborn and so namedí refers to the third, fourth, fifth lives and so on
in the past. And then ëI reappeared elsewhereí refers to the second life from
this life. ëI reappeared hereí means I was reborn in this life. So there is
this life, immediate past life and former past lives. Anywhere he wants to
remember he can remember. This is the recollection of past lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next one is the divine eye - knowledge of passing away
and reappearance of beings. They are together here. By this direct knowledge a
person can see beings passing away from one existence and being reborn in
another existence. The Text is given in full from the D gha Nik»ya. Towards the
end of paragraph 72 beginning with the words in italics &quot;Tì the knowledge
of the passing away and reappearance: cut|pap»ta“»”iya= cutiy» ca upap»te ca
“»”»ya (resolution of compound).î It cannot be translated. [The meaning is] for
the kind of knowledge by means of which beingsí passing away and reappearance
is known.î By this direct knowledge one can see beings dying from one life and
being reborn in another life. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 73 the definition of divine or the P»ƒi word
ëdibbaí is given. Earlier we had the divine ear element. Here we have the
divine eye element. The word ëdivineí is defined similarly. By the words
ëdivine abiding we should again understand the jh»nas and not the four brahm»
vih»ras. You will find the words ëdivine abidingí about eight or ten lines down
in the paragraph. ìAlso it is ëdivineí because it is obtained by means of
divine abiding (jh»nas), and because it has divine abiding as its support. And
it is ëdivineí because it greatly illuminates by discerning light. And it is
ëdivineí because it has a great range through seeing visible objects that are
behind walls, and so on.î This explanation is given following the meaning of
the root given in the grammatical treatises. That is why it says ìAll that
should be understood according to the science of grammar.î That means we should
understand this with reference to what is said in the grammatical treatises. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Sanskrit there is a book called ëDh»tupataí. That means a
list of roots and meanings. It was said to be composed by Panini. He was a very
famous Sanskrit grammarian, the most famous of the Sanskrit grammarians. Almost
everybody follows him. Even in our books there are some references to it. In
that list of roots the meaning of the root here is given as eliminating, given
as having a great range and so on. Following that given in the Dh»tupata, the explanation
is given here. ìAll that should be understood according to the science of
grammar.î That means according to the grammatical books.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next is the definition of the word ëeyeí. ìIt is an eye in
the sense of seeing. Also it is an eye since it is like an eye in its
performance of an eyeís functionî and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now let us look at footnote 17. ìHe cannot see them with the
divine eye.î It is said here that he sees beings passing away and reappearing.
He cannot see them with the divine eye actually at the death moment or at the
moment of disappearance. ìBut it is those who being on the verge of death (That
means those who are about to die.), will die now that are intended as ëpassing
awayí and those who have taken rebirth-linking and have just reappeared that
are intended by ëreappearingí.î That means one sees a little before death and a
little after relinking, not exactly at the moments of death or relinking. At
the moments of death and relinking you cannot see. The explanation is given in
the footnote from the Sub-Commentary. ìHe cannot see them with the divine eye -
with the knowledge of the divine eye - because of the extreme brevity and
extreme subtlety of the material moment in <u>anyone</u>.î Actually it should
read ëbecause of the extreme brevity and extreme subtlety of the matter of some
beingsí. The matter in human beings may be gross, and so it is not difficult to
see. But the matter in some beings, like brahm»s, is very subtle. That is why
they are referred to as fine material brahm»s. Their matter is extremely
subtle. And also the moments of death and rebirth are so brief that they cannot
be seen even with the knowledge of divine eye.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìMoreover it is present materiality that is the object of
the divine eye.î It is said that the object of the divine eye or the direct
knowledge of the divine eye is the present matter. ìAnd that is by prenascence
condition.î That means it (that materiality) must have arisen before the divine
eye arises. It must have arisen before the divine eye and still be existing at<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>the moment of the arising of the divine eye.
So it cannot be the past appearance of matter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd there is no occurrence of exalted consciousness without
adverting and preliminary work.î The divine eye is the exalted consciousness,
mahaggata consciousness. It cannot arise without the adverting (»vajjana) and
preliminary work. ìNor is materiality that is only arising able to serve as
object condition, nor that which is dissolving.&quot; So the material
properties at the moment of arising and at the moment of dissolution cannot
serve as the object. ìTherefore it is rightly said that he cannot see with the
divine eye materiality at the moments of death and reappearance.î At the
moments of death and at the moments of relinking he cannot see them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIf the knowledge of the divine eye has only
materiality<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>as its object, then why is
it said that he sees beings? It is said in this way since it is mainly
concerned with instances of materiality in a beingís continuity.î There should
be a full stop there. ëSome sayí should come after ëorí. ìOr some say that
because materiality is a reason for apprehending beings. Some say that this is
said according to conventional usage.î What he really sees is r|pa
(materiality). He does not see a being actually. ëBeingí means mind and matter
both, combined. What the divine eye sees is the present matter. This matter
cannot be seen without a being because matter is a part of a being. So it is
said in the Texts that he sees ëbeingsí. Some say that materiality is the
reason for apprehending beings. When we apprehend beings, when we see beings,
we refer to the material properties in them. That is why it is said that he
sees beings. Actually what he sees is not beings, mind and matter together, but
the material properties. So he cannot see them at the moments of death and
rebirth, but a little before death and a little after rebirth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 78 says ìFaring according to their <u>deeds</u>.î
I would like to say ëfaring according to their kammaí instead of deeds. ìFaring
according to their kamma; moving on in accordance with whatever kamma may have
been accumulated. Herein, the function of the divine eye is described by the
first expressions beginning with ëpassing awayí. But the function of knowledge
of faring according to kamma is described by this last expression.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the passages appearing in the P»ƒi Suttas with phrases
such as ëit surpasses the humaní, ëwhich is purified and superhumaní, and ëhe
sees beings passing away and reappearingí and so on, those sentences refer to
the divine eye. That is the function of the divine eye. ìbut the function of
knowledge of faring according to kamma is described by this last expression.î
ëThe last expressioní means faring according to their kamma. So in this last
passage we have functions of two direct knowledges, the divine eye and seeing
beings dying and reappearing. Although one is dependent upon the other, they
are two different functions. First he sees the beings with the divine eye. Then
he sees their kamma, faring according to their deeds. ëFaring of beings according
to their kamma or deedsí means he sees the kamma of them. First he may see the
beings in the Deva World. Then he thinks ìWhy are they reborn in this happy
state?î then he sees their good kamma. When he sees their good kamma, then
there is the direct knowledge of seeing beings dying and reappearing. Before
that it is just the function of the divine eye. The direct knowledge of divine
eye and the direct knowledge of seeing beings dying and reappearing are two
different functions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe order in which that knowledge arises is this.î This is
how the knowledge arises. ìHe gives it attention in this way, ëAfter doing what
deeds do these beings undergo this suffering?í Then knowledge that has that
kamma as its object arises in him in this way ëIt was after doing thisí.î First
he sees the beings. That is the function of divine eye. Later on he sees their
kamma and that is the function of the knowledge of beings dying and
reappearing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 80 ìThere is no special preliminary work for this.
And as in this case, so too in the case of knowledge of the future.î The divine
eye is the basis for this knowledge, the knowledge of seeing beings dying and
reappearing. No special preliminary work is needed. It is also true for
knowledge of the future, ìfor these have divine eye as their basis and their
success is dependent on that of the divine eye.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then he sees beings who are ill-conducted in body and so on.
Their moral conduct is not pure. The revilers of Noble Ones - this is
important. ìBeings desirous of harm for Noble Ones consisting of Buddhas,
Pacceka Buddhas,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>and disciples, and also
of householders who are Stream Enterersî - here the meaning is consisting of
Buddhas, Pacceka Buddhas, disciples down to householders who are Stream
Enterers. ìThey revile them with the worst accusations.î ëWorst accusationsí
really means the worst offense with regard to a monk. If you say ìYou are not a
monkî, then you are accusing him with the worst accusation, with the worst
offense. ëYou are not a monkí means you have broken the most important rules.
If you say ìYou are not a monkî or ìYou have no monkshood in youî, you are
accusing him of the worst offense. ìWith denial of their special qualities they
abuse and upbraid them is what is meant.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHerein, it should be understood that when they say, ëThey
have no asceticism, they are not asceticsí, they revile them with the worst
accusation.î Here ëasceticismí does not mean all asceticism, but is the state
of being a monk, the state of being a sama”a. ëSama”aí here is translated as
ascetic. Actually it should be a monk, a bhikkhu. If you say ìYou have no state
of a bhikkhuî or ìYou are not a bhikkhuî, then you are accusing him with the
worst accusations. You are saying that he has broken one of the four most
important rules.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd when they say, ëThey have no jh»na, or liberation, or
Path, or Fruition, etc., they revile them with denial of their special
qualities.î So you do not recognize them as possessing jh»na, liberation,
Magga, Phala and so on. ìAnd whether done knowingly or unknowingly it is in
either case reviling of Noble Ones; it is weighty kamma resembling that of
immediate result, and it is an obstacle both to heaven (That means the Deva
World.) and to the Path. But it is remediable.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then a story is given here. I think I have told this story
many times to you. ìAn Elder and a young bhikkhu, it seems, wandered for alms
in a certain village. At the first house they got only a spoonful of hot gruel.
The Elderís stomach was paining him with wind.î When we have an ache in the
stomach, we say that this is the wind. What do you call that? Colic? Pain in
the stomach?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Gas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: It is called gas, oh. The Elder had this ailment.
ìHe thought ëThis gruel is good for me; I shall drink it before it gets coldí.î
Then it says ì<u>People brought a</u> <u>wooden stool to the doorstep</u>.î
That is not correct. There were no people involved in this story. ìHe sat down
on a big piece of wood that people had brought to make a doorpostî is what is
meant. When you make a doorpost, you bring in a log. He sat down there on a big
piece of wood which people had brought to make a doorpost.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHe sat down and drank it. The other was disgusted and
remarked ëThe old man has let his hunger get the better of him and has done
what is shameful for us.î It is not ë<u>what</u> <u>he should be ashamed to doí</u>.
It is ëwhat is shameful for usí. I am ashamed of him. It is something like
that. He cannot wait until he reaches a suitable place to drink the rice gruel.
He was so hungry that he was not ashamed to do this. This was the thinking of
the young monk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe Elder for alms and on return to the monastery, he asked
the young bhikkhu ëHave you any footing in the Dispensation, friend?í - ëYes,
Venerable Sir, I am a Stream Enterer.í - ëThen, friend, do not try for higher
Paths; one whose cankers are destroyed (That means an Arahant.)<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>has been reviled by youí.î He had reviled the
Arahant in his thoughts. ìThe young bhikkhu asked for the Elderís forgiveness
and was thereby restored to his former state.î When you ask forgiveness from
him, you get rid of that offense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìSo any other one who reviles a Noble Oneî - you should put
ëany otherí between ësoí and ëoneí. ìSo any other one who reviles a Noble Oneî
- then we should strike out ëeven if he is one himselfí; that is not in the text
- ì should go to him; if he himself is senior, he should sit down in the
squatting position and get his forgiveness in this way ëI have said such and
such to the venerable one; may he forgive me. If he is junior, he should pay
homage, and sitting in the squatting position and holding out his hands palms
together, he should get his forgiveness in this way, ëI have said such and such
to you, venerable sir; forgive meí. If the other has gone away, he should get
his forgiveness either by going to him himself or by sending someone such as a
co-resident.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIf he can neither go nor send, he should go to the bhikkhu
who lives in that monastery, and, sitting down in the squatting position if
they are junior, or acting in the way already described if they are senior, he
should get forgivenessî and so on. We should do this especially when we
practice meditation, so it may not be an obstacle to our attainment through
meditation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIf it is a bhikkhu who wanders alone and it cannot be
discovered where he is living or where he has gone, he should go to a wise
bhikkhu and say ëVenerable sir, I have said such and such to the venerable one,
named so and so. When I remember it, I am remorseful. What shall I doí? He
should be told ëThink no more about it, the Elder forgives you. Set your mind
at restí. Then he should extend his hands palms together in the direction taken
by the Noble One and say ëForgive meí.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIf the Noble One has attained the final Nibb»na (That is if
the Noble One has died.), he should go to the place where the bed is, on which
he attained the final Nibb»na, and should go as far as the charnel ground to
ask forgiveness. When this has been done, there is no obstruction either to
heaven or to the Path. He becomes as he was before.î That means he gets free from
the offense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìWrong in their views: having distorted vision. Acquirers of
kamma due to wrong viewî and so on. Wrong view here is said to be of very grave
consequences. ìAcquirers of kamma due to wrong view: those who have kamma of
the various kinds acquired through wrong view, and also those who incite others
to bodily kamma, etc., rooted in wrong view. And here, though reviling of Noble
Ones has already been included by the mention of verbal misconduct, and though
wrong view has already been included by the mention of mental misconduct, it
may be understood, nevertheless, that the two are mentioned again in order to
emphasize their great responsibility.î Reviling Noble Ones is verbal misconduct
and the wrong view is mental misconduct. They are included in misconduct. They
are mentioned again because the Buddha wanted to show their greatness in
reprehensibility, because they are very grave akusala.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìReviling Noble Ones is greatly reprehensible because of the
resemblance to kamma with immediate result. For this is said ëS»riputta, just
as a bhikkhu possessing virtuous conduct, concentration and understanding could
here and now attain final knowledge, so it is in this case, I say; if he does
not abandon such talk<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>and such thoughts
and renounce such views, he will find himself in hell as surely as if he had
been carried off and put there.î If he has wrong view, he cannot be reborn in a
happy destiny. That is what is meant here. ìAnd there is nothing more
reprehensible than wrong view, according as it is said ëBhikkhus, I do not see
any one thing so reprehensible as wrong view.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìOn the break up of the body on the giving up of the
clung-to aggregatesî - that means caused by kamma. ëClung-toí means caused by
kamma. ìAfter death: in the taking up of the aggregates generated next after
that.î That means after death there is rebirth. ìOr alternatively, on the break
up of the body is on the interruption of the life faculty (That means on the
cessation of the life faculty.), and after death is beyond the death consciousness.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: I have a question about the section just before
this part. Is it saying delusion has greater consequences than greed or hate,
or is wrong view greed or hate?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Delusion accompanies every unwholesome mental
state, every unwholesome consciousness. When there is wrong view, there is also
delusion. They arise together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: So are we talking about greed, hate and delusion at
the same time or are we talking specifically about delusion in this passage,
wrong view? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Wrong view, delusion, not greed and hatred. Then
there is explanation of the words ëap»yaí and so on. They mean destiny and
places of woe and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 93 ìOr alternatively, the animal <u>generation</u>î
- I think we should say ëanimal kingdomí. ìThe animal kingdom is indicated by
the mention of states of lossî and so on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 94 ëthe bright sideí means happy destiny, heavenly
world. They are word explanations. ìAll that is a world in the sense of
crumbling and disintegrating.î The word ëlokaí, the word for world is defined
as that which is crumbling and disintegrating. That is why it is called ëlokaí.
ëLokaí means crumbling and disintegrating. ìThis is the word meaning.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThus with the divine eye, etc., is all a summing-up phrase;
the meaning here in brief is this: so with the divine eye..he sees.î Then how
to practice to get the divine eye is given. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 96 ìHowever, while he is seeing what is visible,
the turn of the preliminary work runs out. There upon the light disappears.î
First he enters into jh»na and does the preliminary work. When he does the
preliminary work, the light appears. With that light, the light of the kasi”a,
he sees what is visible. When he sees what is visible, the preliminary work
disappears. When the preliminary work disappears, there is no light and so he
does not see anything. There is something like a dilemma here. The Commentator
says that you must do it again and again so that the light becomes strong and
doesnít disappear. Then the simile of a man with a grass torch is given.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Letís go to the general section. In this section the
different kinds of objects of the seven direct knowledge are given. In
paragraph 104</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>ìThe sage has
told four object Triads</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>By means of
which one can infer </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>Just how these
seven different kinds </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>Of Direct
Knowledges occur.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The objects of direct knowledge are described with reference
to the triads given in the first book of Abhidhamma. They are explained in
footnote 20. The first one is k»m»vacara. In the footnote it says ëlimited
objectí.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>You need to understand this.
ëExalted objectí means mahaggata object. ëMeasureless objectí means lokuttara.
That means Magga, Phala, and Nibb»na. Then Magga is taken again here. ëMaggaí
means Path. The others are self-explanatory - past, future, present, internal,
external. ëNon-classifiableí really means concept (pa““atti).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are triads in the first book of Abhidhamma. The later
books follow the order of the triads and explain aggregates and others with
reference to these triads. There are 22 triads. Among them there are four
triads that deal with objects. They are taken from them. Then the Commentator
explained which objects are taken by which direct knowledge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe knowledge of Supernormal Power, occurs with respect to
seven kinds of object, that is to say, as having a limited or exalted (That
means k»m»vacara or mahaggata.), a past, future, or present, and internal or
external, object.î So there are seven kinds. So if you look at #1 on the sheet
you have 1-7. Then the detailed explanation follows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 109 ìKnowledge of the Divine Ear Element occurs
with respect to four kinds of objects, that is to say, as having a limited
(k»m»vacara), and a present, and an internal or external, object.î Then there
is an explanation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then we have Knowledge of Penetration of Minds (minds of
other persons). How many? There are eight kinds of objects - limited
(k»m»vacara), exalted (mahaggata), measureless (lokuttara), Path (Magga), past,
future, present and external. In this paragraph there is an interesting thing.
ìAnd here an ordinary man does not know a Stream Entererís consciousness,
nor<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>does a Stream Enterer know a Once
Returnerís, and so up to the Arahantís consciousness.î Lower persons cannot know
the consciousness of higher persons. ëOrdinary person means a puthujjana. A
puthujjana does not know a Stream Entererís consciousness, and a Stream Enterer
does not know the consciousness of a Once Returner and so on. ìBut an Arahant
knows the consciousness of all the others.î That is because he is the highest.
ìAnd each higher one knows the consciousness of all those below him.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHow does it have a present object?î With regard to
penetration of mind three kinds of present are mentioned - present by moment,
present by continuity and present by extent. ëPresent by momentí means the
three phases of existence (arising, presence and dissolution). That is present
by moment. ëPresent by continuityí is what is included in one or two rounds of
continuity. That is present by continuity. ìWhen someone goes to a well-lit
place after sitting in the dark, an object is not clear at first: until it
becomes clear, one or two rounds of continuity should be understood [to pass]
meanwhile.î They are explaining this because they did not have watches in those
days. In these days we would say five minutes, ten minutes or something like
that. That is present by continuity. ëPresent by extentí means one life. ìWhat
is delimited by a single becoming is called ëpresent by extentí.î There are
three kinds of present - present by moment, present by continuity and present
by extent. ìAnd here ëpresent by continuityí is used in the Commentaries while
ëpresent by extentí is used in the Suttas.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHerein some say that consciousness ëpresent by momentí is
the object of knowledge of penetration of minds.î They say that, but the
Visuddhi Magga does not approve of that because ëpresent by momentí cannot be
the object of this direct knowledge. ìWhat reason do they give? It is that the
consciousness of the possessor of supernormal power and that of the other arise
in a single moment.î Then there is a simile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThat, however, is rejected in the Commentaries as erroneous
because even if one went on adverting for a 100,000 years, there is never
co-presence of the two consciousnesses, that is to say, of that which he
adverts and that [of impulsions] with which he knows.î In order to get direct
knowledge first there is adverting. Then there is preliminary. They are two
different kinds of consciousness. They cannot arise at the same time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìEven if one went on adverting for a 100,000 years, there is
never co-presence of the two consciousnesses, that is to say, of that with
which he adverts and that [of impulsions] with which he knows, and because the
flaw of dissimilarity of objects of both adverting and impulsion where it is
not desiredî - wait a minute. We should say ìbecause of the flaw of
dissimilarity of objectsî, then we strike out ëfollows if presence [of the same
object]í. Then instead of ëtoí we say ëofí. ìThe flaw of dissimilarity of objects
of both adverting and impulsionî and then we add some words here ìwhere it is
not desired. What should be understood is that the object is present by
continuity and present by extent.î In this direct knowledge there cannot be
dissimilarity of objects. If they say direct knowledge knows the present by
moment, then there are two reasons why it is rejected. One is that two
consciousnesses cannot arise at the same time. The other is that there will be
dissimilarity of objects. That is because at the moment of adverting there is
one object which is one consciousness and at the moment of impulsion there is
another consciousness. There will be dissimilarity of objects if we take that
way. That is why it is rejected. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are many more. You can check with this sheet. In
paragraph 122 at the end of the paragraph ìAnd there tooî we should put the
word ëonlyí there - ìonly profitable and unprofitable [aggregates are the
object] of knowledge of faring according to kamma.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the last paragraph 129 is to be translated as given on
this sheet. ìHere, it is said [in the Ancient Commentary] that this knowledge
has both internal and external objects. That was said to mean that when it
knows now internal and now external objects, it is said to have internal-external
objects as well.î In the Ancient Commentary it is said this knowledge (the last
one) has both internal and external objects, but it does not mean that it can
have internal and external objects at the same time, although the wording of
their opinion appears to mean that. It says both internal and external, but
really it means sometimes he takes internal as object and sometimes he takes
external as object. So it can be said that it takes internal and external
objects, but not at the same time. OK. That is the end of this chapter. There
is so much to talk about. At least we have a general idea about what is in the
book.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Thank you very much.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Thank you so much. If you didnít ask me to teach
Visuddhi Magga, I would not be teaching for many years. I am very glad that all
of you are at least acquainted with what is in the Visuddhi Magga. It is
helpful in the study of Abhidhamma too. The next section will deal with
Abhidhamma. So if you are teaching Abhidhamma to someone, you can get much
information from The Path of Purification. The other Commentaries are not
available to people in the West. They are all in P»ƒi, not yet translated. This
book is more easily available than the other books. The only thing is where to
find what, where to find the information. It is good to make notes, to write on
index cards. The index in the book is not so helpful. It is fairly
comprehensive, but not so helpful. When you go through the book, you know what
information is helpful to remember. Then you write down on a card and keep the
card with you. Then when you want it, you can get the information easily. OK.</p>
