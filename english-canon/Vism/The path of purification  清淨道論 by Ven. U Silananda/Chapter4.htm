<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>We have had a long
break. I think we need to at least remember the third chapter which deals with
how to prepare for the practice. Before really going to the practice we have to
prepare ourselves. The first thing we have to do is to purify our virtue. That
means to keep our moral conduct clear, to take and keep the precepts. That is
the first thing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The next thing is
- please go to paragraph 28 in chapter 3 - there the steps are given. First
there is purifying virtue. The second is severing any of the ten impediments or
ten obstacles. That was dealt with in the third chapter. Then one must find a
good friend, a good meditation teacher from whom the yogi must learn about the
meditation subject. And also he should choose a subject that is suitable for
his own temperament. There is a description of the six kinds of temperaments
and what kind of temperament a person belongs to. After that the yogi should
avoid a monastery unfavorable to the development of concentration and go to
live in one that is favorable. The fourth chapter picks up there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The fourth chapter
begins with the 18 faults of a monasteries not suitable for the practice of
meditation and the 5 qualities or factors of suitable monasteries. Then the
author goes on to explain how to make a kasiÓa disk or the earth kasiÓa and how
to practice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>We begin the
fourth chapter with the 18 faults of a monastery. Before that the author states
that a person should live in a monastery not too far from where the teacher
lives because if he has doubt about the subject of meditation he could go to
the teacher and ask and let him clarify the teaching.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“If it is
inconvenient there, he can live in another monastery - a suitable one - a quarter
or a half or even a whole league distant.” A league is said to be about 8
miles. The monastery of the teacher should be at most 8 miles from where you
live so that you can walk to him in a day. People had to walk in those days as
well as go for alms along the way. It may be a quarter or a half or a whole
league away. So that means two miles, four miles or eight miles.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Student: I think Daly City is about 10 or 12 miles from
here (San Francisco).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Oh. So it may be about this difference. So if the
meditator has some doubt about his meditation subject, he can go there and ask
the teacher. Then he can go back to his monastery and practice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Then the
Commentary gives the 18 faults of a monastery. When describing how to practice
meditation, the teachers of old are very detailed in explaining how to prepare
for meditation. Maybe it is too meticulous. A monastery where a person lives
and practices should be free of these 18 faults.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The first one is
largeness. When a monastery is a large one, disturbances come up for the
practice of meditation. “<u>People</u> with varying aims collect in a large
monastery.” ‘People’ here means monks, not lay people. Monks with different
aims collect in a large monastery. They will conflict with each other. When
there are many people, people will neglect the duties - sweeping the compound,
setting up water and so on. If they are not done and the person sees that they
are not done, he should do them. And if he does not do them, then he commits an
offense of wrong-doing. It is a very minor offense, but still it is an offense.
If he has to sweep the place, put out water and so on, then his time for
meditation is reduced. So living in a monastery where monks are not doing their
own duties is not a suitable one for a person who wants to practice meditation.
If it is a large monastery and the monks do their duties and if there are no
disturbances for the practice of meditation, then he may live in a big
monastery and practice meditation. The main point is the suitability for the
practice of meditation. It may be a big monastery but if it is kept well and
the monks and novices do their own duties well and there is no disturbance or
interference for the practice of meditation, then he can live in a big
monastery. There are such big monasteries in our countries where monks live in
a very disciplined way. You don’t hear a sound although 500 monks are eating.
Such a monastery although big is suitable for the practice of meditation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The next one is a
new monastery. When a monastery is new, you have many thing to do. So it is
also not a suitable place for the practice of meditation. In paragraph 4 “let
the venerable one do the <u>ascetic duties</u>.” That really means the practice
of meditation, not the ascetic practices or other duties. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The PÈÄi word is
samaÓadhamma. ‘SamaÓa’ means an ascetic or monk. ‘Dhamma’ here means practice.
‘SamaÓadhamma’ really means the practice of meditation, not just doing duties.
Even though it is a new monastery, if others take care of what is to be done
there and let the person who wants to practice meditation practice freely, then
that is a suitable monastery for him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The next one is
the delapidated monastery. When a monastery is not in good shape, then you have
to repair and do whatever needs to be done there. Then you have little time for
meditation and so it is not a suitable monastery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The next one is a
monastery with a nearby road. If it is close to a road or a main street, <u>visitors</u>
keep coming night and day. ‘Visitors’ here means monk visitors. When visiting
monks come, you have to assign places for them. Sometimes you have to give your
place to the visiting monk. You have to go to some other place. You may have to
go to the root of a tree or a flat rock. You have to give up your place to the
visiting monk. The next day is the same. So there is no opportunity to practice
meditation. This is not a suitable place for him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Student: when you say meditation here, are you talking
about sitting or walking meditation?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Both. Any kind of meditation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Student: so then work is a kind of meditation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Here meditation is walking or sitting meditation.
Doing things at the monastery, working, cannot be done with real intense
mindfulness meditation. You may have light mindfulness doing what you are
doing, but when you are doing some work preparing the monastery, it is very
difficult to keep mindfulness, the intense mindfulness. Here it means the
intense practice of meditation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>A monastery near a
pond is the next one. People come there and drink water. “Pupils of
city-dwelling elders <u>supported</u> by the royal family come to do dyeing
work.” Here ‘supported by’ means frequenting royal families or being familiar
with or intimate with royal families. So it is not a suitable place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The next one is
near a place where there are vegetables. ‘Edible leaves’ here really means
vegetables. When there are vegetables, women may come to gather the vegetables.
They will sing and so on. So there is disturbance with sounds of the opposite
sex. There is danger to the meditation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The same is true
for a monastery with flowering shrubs or trees. People come to gather flowers
and so there is disturbance to the meditation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The next one is a
monastery with many fruits such as mangoes, rose-apples, jack-fruits and so on.
When there are many fruits, people come and pick fruits. There is disturbance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Student: What is jack-fruit? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Jack-fruit is a big tree. Some jack-fruit may be
as big as this building. The fruit has something like thorns outside. They are
not really thorns; they are protrusions outside. When you cut open the fruit,
there is meat inside and a seed. Jack-fruit is grown in tropical countries like
Burma, SrÏ Lanka, and I think it is also grown in Hawaii. Many people in this
country don’t know jack-fruit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Jack-fruit tree
was very important for monks because we used the inner core of jack-fruit to
make dye for the robes. The inner core is color between brown and yellow. It is
a dark yellow color. We chopped the inner core into small pieces. We boiled
those small pieces and got the dye. Then we dyed the robes with the dye that we
got from the jack-fruit tree. The other thing we used for making dye was the
bark of the banyan tree. That is not as good as the inner core of jack-fruit
tree. I think now jack-fruit is imported into this country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Student: What does it taste like?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Hard to say. It is sweet. If you eat too much, you
will have stomach trouble.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>And then if a
monastery is famous, if it is renowned, many people will come. Then there will
not be enough time for meditation. “But if it suits him, he can live there at
night and go elsewhere by day.” You can go somewhere else during the day and go
back at night. That you can do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“In one with a
nearby city objects of the opposite sex come into focus.” When it is close to a
city, that is a kind of disturbance. In paragraph 10 “Also <u>important people</u>
<u>spread out carpets</u> in the middle of the monastery and sit down.”
Actually they do not spread out carpets, but they sit in the middle of the
monastery, screened by curtains. That is what is meant. They will come to the
monastery, sit down and put a curtain around them. It is not just spreading
carpets. The PÈÄi word here means not a carpet but a curtain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Student: That was done to isolate them for meditation?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Not for meditation, just for isolation. Here the
‘important people’ are not monks. Lay people, a king, or ministers, or anybody
may come. They may wish to be separated or secluded from other people so they
will put the curtain around them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The next one is a
monastery nearby timber trees. The timber people come and cut down trees. So it
is not a good place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Another one is a
monastery near arable fields. When there are fields close to the monastery,
people use the monastery as a thrashing place. So there is disturbance. Also
when the monastery owns land, then the attendants of the monastery have to
avoid cattle from coming into the field or sometimes have to avoid giving water
to them. It is what is said here. “The monastery attendants impound cattle
belonging to families and deny the water supply to their crops. Then people
bring an ear of paddy and show it to the Community saying, ‘Look at your
monastery attendants work’.” and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Student: What is paddy?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: It is a kind of crop. We get rice from it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The next one is
the presence of incompatible persons. “Where there are bhikkhus living who are
incompatible and mutually hostile, when<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>they clash and it is protested ‘Venerable sirs, do not do so’ they
exclaim ‘We no longer count now that this refuse-rag wearer has come’.” They
are saying that they are nobody or something like that. It is not a good place
for a monk who wants to meditate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Then a monastery
near a land port of entry or a water port of entry may not be suitable. When a
monastery is near such a place, the monks are inconvenienced by the people
constantly arriving by ship or caravan, asking for water, for salt, and so on. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The next one is a
monastery near <u>border countries</u>. ‘Border countries’ really means
outlying districts. Mostly people living in the outlying districts are not of
religious type. They do not have faith in religion or in the Buddha, Dhamma and
Sa~gha. ‘Border countries’ really means outlying districts near the border.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The next one is a
monastery near the frontier of a kingdom. When a monk lives near the border of
a country, kings may come and attack this place and that place. Sometimes it
may fall to one king and then it may fall to another. When a monk is living
there, he might be suspected of spying. It could be dangerous for him. So it is
not suitable for him to live near a frontier and practice meditation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“Unsuitability is
that due to the risk of encountering visible data, etc., of the opposite sex as
objects or to haunting by non-human beings.” So if it is a haunted house you do
not live and meditate there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“Here is a story.
An elder lived in a forest, it seems. Then an ogress stood in the door of his
leaf hut and sang. The elder came out and stood in the door. She went to the
end of the of the walk and sang. The elder went to the end of the walk. She
stood in a chasm a hundred fathoms deep and sang. The elder recoiled. Then she
suddenly grabbed him saying, ‘Venerable sir, it is not just one or two of the
likes of you I have eaten’.” So it is not safe to practice meditation in a
haunted house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The last one is
lack of good friends. If you cannot get good friends, then you don’t live there
and practice meditation. A teacher or the equivalent of a teacher is important
for a person who practices meditation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>These are the 18
faults that a monk has to avoid to make his meditation practice successful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Then there is a
monastery which is suitable for monks to practice meditation. There are five
qualities of such a monastery or resting place. ‘Resting place’ here means a
monastery. Sometimes Venerable NÈÓamoli wanted to be very literal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Student: so it is monastery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Actually it is a monastery. It is a dwelling
place. A dwelling place for monks must not be too far or too near a village, or
a town, or a city. A monk has to go for alms. If it is too far, it is difficult
for him to go. If it is too close, it is noisy and there is disturbance. So a
monastery should be neither too far or too near the village. “It has a good
path for going and coming.” That means it has a good road. The monk can go to
the village and come back with comfort.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Number two: “It is
little frequented by day (That means seclusion.) with little sound and few
voices by night.” So it is not too crowded during the day and it is not noisy
at night. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The third factor
is: “There is little contact with gadflies, flies, wind, burning sun and
creeping things.” So there should not be many mosquitoes, gadflies and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The fourth is:
“the one who lives in that lodging easily obtains robes” and so on. The four
requisites must be easily obtainable because if a monk has to go about getting
robes and so on, then he cannot practice meditation well. The monk must live in
a place where these things are easily obtained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The fifth one is a
place where monks are living “who are learned, versed in the scriptures,
observers of the Dhamma, observers of the Vinaya, observers of the Codes.”
‘Observers’ really means holders. ‘Observer’ is a little softer. Here it means
those who have learned by heart the Dhamma, the Vinaya and the Codes. The PÈÄi
word is dhara. It is not just observers. It is those who are competent, those
who are competent in Dhamma and Vinaya. ‘Dhamma’ here means Suttas and
Abhidhamma. Vinaya means disciplinary rules. ‘Observers of the Codes’ means
‘Holders of the Codes’. ‘Codes’ means the beginning portion of Abhidhamma
PiÔaka and the rules for monks. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

remember there is a code of rules for monks, 227 rules and so on. These are
called ‘Codes’. In PÈÄi they are called ‘MÈtikÈ’. ‘MÈtikÈ’ also means the very
first section of Abhidhamma PiÔaka.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Before practicing
meditation you have to do one more thing. That is to sever the lesser
impediments. You have severed the grosser impediments. There were ten
impediments mentioned in the third chapter in paragraph 29. He should sever the
ten impediments. Then he should find a teacher, learn about meditation, avoid
the 18 faults of a monastery, and then find a monastery endowed with the five
qualities. After taking up the practice of meditation, he has to do something.
That is severing the lesser impediments. ‘Lesser impediments’ here means when
your hair is long, you have to cut it. When your nails are long, you have to
cut them. And also if your robes need to be mended, you have to do that. If
there is a stain on the bowl (That means the bowl is made of iron.) so it is
not so good, then you have to bake it again. The bed, chair etc. should be
cleaned. So everything has to be done neatly, so that when you practice
meditation, you don’t have to worry about all these things. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

lesser impediments, we embark upon the practice of meditation. But still you
have to do something. You remember that there are 40 subjects of meditation.

meditation given there, the earth kasiÓa.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

the cities you cannot get a monastery that is free from all these 18 faults.
When you go to a forest, not the deep jungle, about a mile or two away from a
village, you get a proper place for the practice of meditation. But I think the
point here is that it should be a place where you can practice meditation
without disturbance. It should be a place where you can develop concentration.
That is the main point.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

drowsy. You want to go to sleep. You may take rest for awhile. That is what is
meant by getting rid of drowsiness due to the meal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

‘Learning’ is uggaha. ‘Taking hold of’ or ‘grasping’ is uggaha. Here it means

past, then he may not need to make a kasiÓa disk. If he does not have this
experience, then he will have to make a kasiÓa disk. That is with regard to
‘made and unmade’ . ‘Unmade’ is for those who have had experience in the past

are due to the intrusion of blue, yellow, red or white.” When you make the
earth kasiÓa it must not be blue color, yellow color, red color or white color.
That is because among the ten kasiÓas there are four color kasiÓas - blue,
yellow, red and white. So in order not to mix with them the earth kasiÓa should
not be blue, yellow, red or white.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

look at the disk and practice meditation on it, you cannot help seeing color.
But you do not pay attention to color because if you pay attention to color,

of meditation which is described in maybe chapter 10 where you concentrate on

Hardness is a reality and earth is a concept. This kind of meditation takes
concept as object and not reality. So the concept should be taken into account.
Something like the shape, the thing, the earth, the round earth you look at it.

and keeping the place clean. There is internal cleanliness and external
cleanliness. The meditation room needs to be clean and neat. Also our bodies
should be clean. That is why a few pages before it said you take a bath and

maintaining balanced faculties. It is very important. When we practice

faith or confidence, effort, mindfulness, concentration, and understanding.

we get absorption or jhÈna, and also if we practice vipassanÈ we get the
realization of truth. There must be balancing of these faculties. If any one of
these faculties is in excess, then the others cannot do their function well.

another.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

impermanence of the Buddha or the teacher. They are not permanent. They will go
away one day. And so you get less attachment or less devotion to them. If there
is too much devotion, then you cannot practice meditation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

looking at this putrid body of mine?” Buddha dismissed him in this way. Elder

a monk, he thought that he must make much effort in order to obtain attainment.

up and down. He could not get concentration. He wore blisters on the soles of
his feet. After practicing for some time, he decided to leave the Order and go

study the detailed exposition of the first jhÈna. So far the yogi has prepared
and practiced until he got the access concentration. With the gaining of access
concentration he got the counterpart sign in his mind. That is the mental image
of the kasiÓa disk appears in his mind. He dwells on it again and again. He
concentrates on that mental image. When the time is ripe, there arises in him a
thought process containing jhÈna consciousness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

guiding his mind in this way, confronting the sign (that means dwelling on the
counterpart sign again and again.), [<u>then knowing</u>] ‘now absorption will
succeed’.” This is the place where most translators misunderstood the PÈÄi
idiom. The PÈÄi idiom here means just ‘when absorption is about to arise. So we
do not need the words in square brackets, ‘then knowing’. The subject of this
sentence is mind-door-adverting and not the person. Also the person does not
know when the absorption will arise. So this PÈÄi idiom is: ‘when absorption is
about to arise’. Literally translated it should be ‘when it could be said that
absorption will succeed or absorption will arise’. When absorption or jhÈna is
about to arise, what happens is that mind-door-adverting arises cutting off the
flow of the life-continuum or bhava~ga.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Please look at the
sheet today of the jhÈna thought process. I have given the diagrams of the
thought processes before. If you look at the beginning of the line the first
two are ‘Bh’. They are bhava~gas. Then M is mind-door-adverting. When
absorption is about to arise, there arises first in his mind
mind-door-adverting. After that there are five moments of impulsion or javana.
The first four belong to kÈmavacara (sense-sphere) consciousness. The fifth
javana belongs to r|pavacara (fine-material-sphere) consciousness. The first
four javanas are what we call beautiful-sense-sphere consciousness. The first
javana is called preliminary work. the second javana is called access. The
third javana is called conformity. The fourth javana is called change of
lineage. The Commentary explains that all four of these javanas can be called
by each of these names - preliminary work, access, conformity. All four can be
called by these names. If we want to give them separate names so that one
excludes the other , then the first is preliminary work, the second is access,
the third is conformity and the fourth is change of lineage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

fourth moment that the kÈmavacara lineage stops. The fifth moment becomes the

font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The second diagram
shows another variety of the thought process, but here you do not have the
preliminary work. There are three kÈmavacara javanas and the fourth is jhÈna.
So in this thought process there are three kÈmavacara javanas and then the
fourth javana is the r|pavacara jhÈna. The jhÈna arises either at the fifth
moment or at the fourth moment. In these thought processes we don not have the
normal duration of seven javanas. Usually javanas repeat themselves seven
times, but in this thought process there are only five or four javana moments.
Normally there are seven moments of javana in the thought process. These are
the moments when the object is really experienced. They are the moments when
kamma is acquired, either good kamma or bad kamma. The commentator explains all
this in paragraphs 74 &amp; 75. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In paragraphs 76
&amp; 77 another view is given of the Elder Godatta. There can be sixth and
seventh moments of javana. This Elder felt there could be six or seven javana
moments. This opinion is refuted by Venerable Buddhaghosa, the author of this
book. If the javana were to go on to the sixth or seventh moment, it would not
be able to stop as jhÈna. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>The analogy that
is given is: When a person runs fast towards a precipice, he would not be able
to stop there because he has gained momentum. In a similar manner one javana
supports the next javana. They become more and more powerful. At the third or
fourth kÈmavacara javana moments the flow of kÈmavacara consciousness can stop
and the jhÈna consciousness can arise. The common opinion of the teachers is
that jhÈna consciousness at the fifth moment or at the fourth moment and not at
the sixth or seventh moments. There must be either four kÈmavacara moments or
three kÈmavacara moments preceding the arising of the jhÈna thought moment.
This is how a jhÈna thought process arises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

says ‘quite secluded from kÈmas’ and the second phrase says ‘secluded from
akusalas’. The Commentary explains that the word ‘quite’ is to be understood in
the second phrase also. In PÈÄi usage they do not repeat a word again and
again, but let it be understood tacitly in later expressions. Here although it
does not say ‘quite secluded from kÈmas and <u>quite</u> secluded from
akusalas’, we must understand that ‘quite’ is meant in the second phrase also.
The word ‘quite’ here means something lie ‘not otherwise’. There is
definiteness here. Your mind must be secluded from kÈmas and not otherwise in
order to get jhÈna. Without seclusion from kÈmas there can be no attainment of
jhÈna. The same is true for akusala. Without being quite secluded from akusala
there can be no attainment of jhÈna. ‘Quite’ should be understood in the second
phrase also.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Vitakka and vicÈra are jhÈna factors. They are mental factors. In English we
call them ‘initial application’ and ‘sustained application’. This is why you
need a certain knowledge of Abhidhamma in order to understand this. The first
jhÈna is accompanied by vitakka and vicÈra (initial application and sustained
application). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Anything can be the object of sense desire. Sense desire is the subject arising
in our mind. The objects are something outside our mind or even within our
mind, but they cannot be the same thing at the same moment. You know we are
attached to thoughts too. Then the thought is in the mind. That thought is the
object of our sense desire. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Everything in the world can be the object. There
are six senses in Abhidhamma - eye, ear and so on. The visible object is the
object of the eye, of seeing consciousness and so on. The other objects are the
objects of the mind. Instead of saying ‘sense desires as object’ I think it
should say ‘objects of sense desires’. But we have ‘sense desires’ objects’ in
the second line of paragraph 83. I think that is correct. It is an apostrophe.
It is not a quote. There is confusion here in the typing also.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In paragraph 82
about a third of the way down we find ‘sense-desire-element’. It actually means
the realm of sense desire. We have come across this word in the past. Although
it is translated as element, what is meant is the realm of sense desire. That
means kÈmavacara realm. Sometimes translators want to be very literal. The word
‘dhÈtu’ is used. The word ‘dhÈtu’ is normally translated as element. For
example there are four great elements - earth element, water element, fire
element and wind element. The word used for these is dhÈtu. Here also the word
dhÈtu is used in a different sense, not in the sense that they are essential
parts of something. Here ‘kÈmadhÈtu’ means simply the realm of kÈma. That means
the kÈmavacara realm, the kÈmavacara world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Etcetera is missing there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Now we come to
familiar ground. There is initial application or here it is called applied
thought and sustained thought. That means initial application and sustained
application. Vitakka and vicÈra are two mental factors. The Commentary explains
one by one initial application and sustained application. It also explains the
difference between these two. They arise at the same time with the same type of
consciousness, but they have different functions. So they are different.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In paragraph 89
“And though sometimes not separate” - that means ‘though sometimes they arise
together’ with some types of consciousness. Initial thought and sustained
thought arise together with many types of consciousness. Actually with 55 kinds
of consciousness they arise together. In the second jhÈna there is no initial
application or applied thought. The same is true for the third, fourth and
fifth jhÈnas. Though sometimes not separate’ means that although in some types
of consciousness they arise together, applied thought is one thing and
sustained thought is another.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The author then
gives the analogies of the differences between vitakka and vicÈra. I have told
you about these differences when we studied Abhidhamma here. Do you remember
them? In the middle of paragraph 89 applied thought is “like a bird’s spreading
out its wings when about to soar into the air, and like a bee’s diving towards
a lotus when it is minded to follow up the scent of it. The behaviour of
sustained thought is quiet, being the near non-interference of consciousness,
like the bird’s planing with outspread wings after soaring into the air, and
like the bee’s buzzing above the lotus after it dives towards it.” Initial
application is going to the thing first and sustained application is staying on
it. There are other analogies too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: They arise together and they have different
functions. Initial application is the one that takes the mind to the object.
Sustained application is the one that keeps the mind there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: They arise together. ‘Initial application’ is not
an exact translation of the word. There is the word ‘initial’, so we may think
that vitakka comes first and then vicÈra follows. ‘Vitakka’ just means thinking
or thought. ‘VicÈra’ means going here and there. That is vicÈra. They are
together but they have different functions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Then there is the
word that we just translated here as ‘born of seclusion’. There are two
meanings for this word in PÈÄi - ‘born of seclusion’ or ‘arises in secluded
states’. That means arises with secluded states. ‘Secluded states’ really means
the jhÈna consciousness and the other mental factors. ‘Seclusion’ here means
the disappearance of hindrances. So long as there are hindrances there can be
no seclusion or there can be no arising of jhÈna consciousness. ‘Born of
seclusion’ means the disappearance of or the absence of mental hindrances.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

gives five kinds of pÊti here. These kinds of pÊti the meditators experience
during their meditation. There are said to be five kinds of such happiness, or
joy, or zest. There are minor pÊti, momentary pÊti, showering pÊti, uplifting
pÊti, and pervading pÊti. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Momentary pÊti is
a little stronger than minor pÊti. It is like flashes of lightening at
different moments. Sometimes you feel this when you practice meditation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The fourth one is
uplifting pÊti. When you have this kind of pÊti, your body can levitate. Two
stories are given here in which two persons levitated or flew through the air.

this pÊti.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

not difficult to understand. One story is about a monk and the other story is
of a girl who was left behind because she was pregnant. The girl was very
desirous of going to the pagoda festival. She got pÊti from thinking of the
people going round the pagoda and making offerings to the Buddha. She got this
uplifting pÊti and was transported to the pagoda festival. She got there before
her parents reached the place. That was by the power of uplifting pÊti.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

pervading pÊti. “the whole body is completely pervaded, like a filled bladder,

body is soaked in this kind of happiness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

also arise at the same time with some types of consciousness. Although they
arise together in this case also there is difference because pÊti is not
feeling according to Abhidhamma. PÊti belongs to formation aggregate and sukha
belongs to feeling aggregate. So they are different. Sukha is feeling (vedanÈ).
PÊti is not vedanÈ, but it is something like ‘preceding sukha’ although they
arise at the same time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

to a man exhausted in the desert who saw a pond at the edge of the woods. That
is pÊti. If he went to the woods’ shade, he would have sukha there. PÊti and
sukha are something like that. PÊti is also translated as pleasurable interest.
When you are going on a journey and you are tired and you see the pond, then
you have some kind of joy. When you have reached the pond and made use of the
water and so on, then you have the real experience of that thing. One is
interest in that thing. The other is the real experience of that thing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

alternate translation of the passage there. That is “which is accompanied by
vitakka and vicÈra, and which is with pÊti and sukha which are born of
seclusion.” The word ‘born of seclusion’ can qualify jhÈna or it can qualify
pÊti and sukha. Although it is not so important which way we take this, we must
understand this. ‘Born of seclusion’ qualifies jhÈna in the first translation.
It is jhÈna which is born of seclusion. The alternative translation is that it
is pÊti and sukha which are born of seclusion. Actually they mean the same
thing because pÊti and sukha are constituents of jhÈna.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

‘pÊtisukha’ in PÈÄi or ‘vivekajanpÊtisukha’ is interpreted in two ways. In the

by pÊti and sukha. In the alternative interpretation it is pÊti and sukha which
are born of seclusion, and it is jhÈna which is accompanied by that pÊti and
that sukha. So if pÊti and sukha are born of seclusion the jhÈna is also born
of seclusion. PÊti and sukha are part of jhÈna.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lust, ill will, stiffness and torpor, agitation and worry, and uncertainty.
They are the five mental hindrances. “For no jhÈna arises until these have been
abandoned.” There can be no jhana when there are these five mental hindrances.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

not. They cannot coexist. So in order to get jhÈna we have to abandon mental
hindrances.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

It is not a ‘higher jhÈna’. It means the first jhÈna. After you get the first
jhÈna you are not so familiar with that. You just have it. You are not well
acquainted with that jhÈna. You have to make yourself well acquainted with that

impulsions impel with that applied thought as their object.” When you review
the jhÈna factors, the javanas may run seven times. When you are reviewing in

process uninterruptedly in this way with the five jhÈna factors, then his
mastery of adverting is successful. But this mastery is found at its acme of
perfection in the Blessed One’s Twin marvel, or for others on the aforesaid
occasions. There is no quicker mastery in adverting than that.” Adverting takes
place in only four or five javana moments. Then two bhava~ga moments interrupt.

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Four or five jhÈnas will be mentioned here. You
know there is the fourfold method of the jhÈnas and the fivefold method of
jhÈnas. They mean the same thing. Fourfold method of jhÈnas is mostly mentioned
in the Suttas. We very seldom find five jhÈnas mentioned in the Suttas.
Whenever the Buddha talked about jhÈnas, he mentioned four jhÈnas. In
Abhidhamma both four jhÈnas and five jhÈnas are mentioned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

five jhÈnas depending upon the ability of the person to surmount the jhÈna
factors. There are persons who have powerful intelligence or knowledge. Such
persons are able to get rid of two factors, vitakka and vicÈra at the same
time. For them there are only four jhÈnas. There are others who can only get
rid of the jhÈna factors one at a time. First they get rid of vitakka. Then
they get rid of vicÈra. For them there are five jhÈnas. Thank you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: I don’t know. That depends upon a person’s
experience in the past. If a person has experience in the past, it may not take
too long. You know nowadays people practice some kind of kasiÓa meditation.
Even to get access concentration they have to practice about six months,
sometimes maybe longer. There are people who practice the color disk
meditation. There is a monk in Los Angeles who said he practiced this meditation.
He got the access concentration but not the absorption concentration. Also it
may depend on how intensely you practice. If you practice two or three hours a
day or if you practice eight or nine hours a day, there will be difference.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Yes. These are mentioned as sukha or happiness.
Buddha first said there is happiness people get from enjoying sense pleasures.
That is a kind of happiness although it is not in the ultimate sense. Compared
with the happiness you get from sense objects the happiness of first jhÈna is
better because there is no sense desire. You are really calm and happy. Then
the second jhÈna happiness is better than the first jhÈna happiness. There is
no initial application and sustained application to disturb your equilibrium of
mind. Then the third jhÈna is better than the second jhÈna and so on. Step by
step the Buddha pointed out that there are different kinds of happiness. Even
the highest jhÈna, the ar|pavacara jhÈna, is still not all together free from
suffering because there is the end of the jhÈna. The jhÈna cannot last forever.
JhÈna consciousness arises and then it must disappear. Then it arises and
disappears again. Even that very high form of happiness has a beginning and an
end. It is also not ultimate happiness. Ultimate happiness is freedom from all
formations. So the highest form of happiness is the happiness of NibbÈna, the
abandonment of all mental defilements. Buddha gave us the different kinds of
happiness, one above the other. JhÈna happiness is a great happiness, but still
it is not enough for the Buddha.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

way to abandoning all the mental defilements? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: It is not the inevitable path. If you read Suttas,
it seems like that. You go through these jhÈnas stage by stage. Then you change
over to vipassanÈ. When Buddha described his own attainment of Buddhahood, he
said that first he practiced breathing meditation. Then he got first, second,
third and fourth jhÈnas. Then he attained the supernormal knowledge of seeing
his past lives and so on. Only after getting two kinds of supernormal knowledge
did he practice vipassanÈ meditation. Only then did he change to vipassanÈ
meditation. Before that he practiced samatha meditation and got the jhÈnas.
Then during the last part of the night he changed to vipassanÈ meditation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

he reflected upon the twelve links of Dependent Origination and their

samatha?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Yes. The ability to see past lives comes from
samatha meditation. Only after getting jhÈnas can one get these kinds of
knowledge. We can cll them special kinds of jhÈna. Actually they are a variety
of fifth jhÈna or fourth jhÈna. After getting fifth jhÈna you have to specially
develop it in order to get these kinds of supernormal knowledge. So when you
read the Suttas it goes like you first practice samatha meditation and then you
change over to vipassanÈ meditation. But in the later Commentaries it says that
you can skip samatha and practice vipassanÈ. Those who practice in this way are
called ‘dry vipassanÈ meditators’. That means that they don’t practice samatha
meditation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

factors - initial application, sustained application, pÊti, sukha and
one-pointedness of mind. This person after getting the first jhÈna sees danger
in being close to the hindrances. By overcoming hindrances he was able to get
the first jhÈna. When he gets the first jhÈna, it is free from hindrances, but
it is with initial application and sustained application and so on. Now he
finds fault with initial application and sustained application or in PÈÄi
vitakka and vicÈra. He tries to be dispassionate towards these two factors. He
tries to eliminate them. When he is able to eliminate them, he will get the

appear gross to him as he reviews the jhÈna factors with mindfulness and full
awareness.” He enters into the first jhÈna and emerges from that jhÈna. Then he
reviews the factors in that jhÈna. There are five factors in first jhÈna. When
he reviews them, applied thought and sustained thought appear gross to him

confidence and which arouses singleness of mind” - you will find this in
paragraph 142. In PÈÄi the word used is sampasÈdanam. It means confidence or
saddha. You may remember saddha. It is one of the 52 cetasikas. Saddha is
confidence or faith. Here the jhÈna itself is called confidence or faith. It is
figuratively speaking. But the meaning is which is accompanied by confidence or
which is accompanied by faith. For this class we would say ‘which is
confidence’, but for general purposes we should say ‘which has confidence’,
that is which arises together with confidence or faith (saddha). The function
of faith or confidence is to clear the mind of doubt and others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

another explanation. That is which clarifies the mind and arouses singleness.
The PÈÄi words are given in footnote #41. The PÈÄi phrase is sampsÈdanaÑ cetaso
ekodibhÈvam. ‘Cetaso’ means of mind. That comes between the two words
‘sampasÈdanaÑ’ and ‘ekodibhÈvam’. The word ‘cetaso’ can be connected with
sampasÈdanaÑ or with ekodibhÈvam. When it is connected with the first one, then
that means clarifying the mind or which clarifies the mind. When it is
connected with the other word ‘ekodibhÈvam’, it means arouses singleness and
‘cetaso’ means of mind. So cetaso can be connected with the previous word or
the following word. That is what is being explained in paragraphs 142 and 143.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

second jhÈna is said to be conditioned by or caused by the concentration in the
first jhÈna. Or it is accompanied by concentration when it arises. Here
‘concentration’ can be taken as that which is with first jhÈna or that which is

some problems. They are all explained here. Here it is said that the second
jhÈna has confidence. That means the second jhÈna is accompanied by the
cetasika saddha (confidence). This cetasika saddha also accompanies the first
jhÈna. Please look at paragraph 144. “it might be asked: but does not this
faith exist in the first jhÈna too, and also this concentration with the name
of the ‘single[thing]’?” In the first jhÈna there arise a number of cetasikas
and among them is saddha or faith and also unification of mind or
one-pointedness of mind. Then why is only this second jhÈna said to have
confidence and singleness of mind? They are in the first jhÈna also. That
problem the Commentator or The Path of Purification solves here. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“It may be replied
as follows: It is because that first jhÈna is not fully confident owing to the
disturbance created by applied thought and sustained thought.” When there is
vitakka and vicÈra, they take the mind pushing it to this object and that
object. They tend to distract the mind. When there is vitakka and vicÈra with
the jhÈna, saddha or confidence is not good enough. It does not fully clarify.
It is not fully confident. “It is like water ruffled by ripples and wavelets.
That is why, although faith does exist in it (the first jhÈna), it is not
called ‘confidence’. And there too concentration is not fully evident because
of the lack of full confidence.” When saddha is not strong, then concentration
is also not strong there. That is why it is not called ‘arousing concentration’
or ‘arousing singleness’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

level of concentration. We will have the third and fourth stages. In later
chapters we will go to the formless jhÈnas also. This is only the second stage
of concentration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

understood as the reason why only this jhÈna is described in this way. But that
much is actually stated in the Vibha~ga too with the words ‘Confidence is
faith’.” And so on. Although confidence and concentration are present in the
first jhÈna, the first jhÈna is not described as having confidence and
concentration because they are not strong enough there. Why are they not strong
enough? Because there is the disturbance of vitakka and vicÈra. In this second
jhÈna there is no vitakka and vicÈra to disturb them, so they become strong.
That is why only this jhÈna is described as “having confidence and arousing
singleness of mind”. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

them in order to get second jhÈna. You know at first when concentration is not
strong, you need vitakka to support the mind being on the object. After getting
the second jhÈna the mind does not need vitakka to take it to the object. The

problem. Another problem is that the second jhÈna is described as without
vitakka and vicÈra. The first sentence also means that it is without vitakka
and vicÈra. Why is there repetition? We have “with the stilling (or overcoming)
of vitakka and vicÈra”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>in the first

font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The first one is
in paragraph 146. The first explanation is that in order to get higher jhÈnas
you have to eliminate the grosser factors. In order to let you understand this
the phrase is repeated here. So the phrases ‘with the stilling of vitakka and
vicÈra’ and ‘it is without vitakka and vicÈra’ are repeated. That is one
reason. It is repeated in order to show that only by eliminating the grosser
factors in the lower jhÈnas do you attain the higher jhÈnas. That is one
explanation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

explanation is that the phrase ‘with the stilling of vitakka and vicÈra’ is the
cause of this jhÈna having confidence and singleness of mind. It shows that. It
does not show the mere absence of vitakka and vicÈra, but it shows that because
of the stilling of vitakka and vicÈra this jhÈna comes to be called ‘confidence
and this jhÈna arouses singleness of mind’. To show this relationship as cause
and effect two phrases are given here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Yes, when it arises, it arises naturally. But
before the jhÈna arises, you have to meditate. While you meditate you have the
intention to get rid of vitakka and vicÈra. If you cannot eliminate vitakka and
vicÈra, you cannot get the second jhÈna. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Student: You eliminate them through more concentration?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: That’s right. You arouse dispassion towards
vitakka and vicÈra. It is just by thinking. After you emerge from jhÈna, you
review or concentrate on the jhÈna factors. Since you find fault with vitakka
and vicÈra, they appear to be gross. The others appear to be subtle. These two
gross factors you eliminate when you get the second jhÈna.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The elimination of
vitakka and vicÈra is the cause. The second jhÈna being with confidence and
arousing singleness of mind is the effect. To show this cause and effect
relationship the first phrase is given here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Then there is
another reason given. The second phrase ‘without vitakka and vicÈra’ means just
the absence of vitakka and vicÈra, nothing more. The first phrase means not
only without vitakka and vicÈra but also it is without vitakka and vicÈra
because they have been overcome. So in this case the first phrase is the cause
of the second phrase. Because vitakka and vicÈra are stilled or because they
are eliminated there are no vitakka and vicÈra in the second jhÈna. In order to
show that these two phrases are given or stated in the description of the
second jhÈna. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Then it is born of
concentration. PÊti and sukha are the same, are to be understood similarly as
in the first jhÈna. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“Born of
concentration” - here also there is a problem. The first jhÈna is also born of
concentration. If you do not have concentration, you cannot get the jhÈna, or
you cannot get even access concentration preceding jhÈna. If you do not have
concentration, you cannot get any of these jhÈna or even the stage of access.
So why is this second jhÈna described as ‘born of concentration’? Again here
concentration in the first jhÈna is not so strong as concentration in the
second jhÈna. Again the second jhÈna is stronger in concentration because it is
not disturbed by vitakka and vicÈra. When vitakka and vicÈra are eliminated,
concentration becomes very strong and the mind becomes very clear. In order to
praise the second jhÈna it is described as ‘born of concentration’. We are to
understand that not only the second jhÈna is born of concentration but also the
first jhÈna.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

stillness due to the absence of vitakka and vicÈra. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

jhÈna is declared to be gross with that very pÊti because it is mental
excitement.” When you are feeling pÊti, you are something like floating on the
surface. PÊti has the function of exciting the mind. Now this person wants his
mind to be very calm and serene. He finds fault with pÊti now. “Its factors are
weakened by the grossness of happiness (pÊti) so expressed. He can bring the

‘as well’ here are said to have the meaning of conjunction. By ‘as well’ we can
conjoin some others. They are described in the brackets. “With the distaste

third jhÈna some of the descriptions of the other jhÈnas are repeated here.
This is what the Commentary explains. Actually there are no vitakka or vicÈra
in second jhÈna much less third jhÈna. In order to show the way to get to
higher jhÈnas and in order to praise the third jhÈna it is said here also. The

equanimity” - in connection with the word ‘equanimity’ the Commentator gave us
ten kinds of (Let us use PÈÄi.) upekkhÈ. It is very important when you see the
word ‘upekkhÈ’ in PÈÄi that you understand what is meant. At least you should
know that ‘upekkha’ means feeling or it means equanimity. Equanimity is not
feeling here. Equanimity is impartiality. Impartiality is one of the cetasikas.
Feeling is also one of the cetasikas. Feeling upekkhÈ is different from
equanimity upekkhÈ. This much you have to understand. Whenever you find the
word ‘upekkhÈ’, you have to see whether it means feeling upekkhÈ or equanimity
upekkhÈ.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

‘upa’ and ‘ekkha’. That is explained in paragraph 156. “It watches [things] as

font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>There are ten
kinds of upekkhÈ. The first is called ‘six factored equanimity’. It is the
equanimity found in the minds of Arahants. “Here a bhikkhu whose cankers are
destroyed (That is an Arahant.) is neither glad nor sad on seeing a visible
object with the eye: he dwells in equanimity, mindful and fully aware.” Whether
an Arahant sees a good object or a bad object he does not feel glad or sad with
regard to that object. He is impartial to these objects. He can keep that
impartiality in the face of objects desirable and undesirable. That is one of
the qualities of the Arahants. This is because Arahants have eradicated all
mental defilements. And so they are not glad with attachment to things nor are
they repulsed by things which are undesirable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The next one is
equanimity as a divine abiding. Equanimity is one of the four divine abidings.
“He dwells intent upon one quarter with his heart endued with equanimity.” That
is not hating and not loving. It is viewing with impartiality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The next one is
equanimity as an enlightenment factor. There are seven factors of enlightenment
and equanimity is one of them. “He develops the equanimity enlightenment factor
depending on relinquishment.” So it is neutrality “in conascent states”.
Actually it is neutrality among conascent states. Neutrality is also a
conascent state. Among the conascent states arising with consciousness this is
neutrality, this is the mode of neutrality. This is one of the factors of
enlightenment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The next one is
the equanimity of energy. ‘Energy’ is called ‘equanimity’ here. Energy should
not be too much nor too little. It must be in the middle, so it is called
‘equanimity’ here. Actually it is energy or viriya - “neither over-strenuous
nor over-lax in energy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

equanimity about formations. That arises during vipassanÈ meditation. When a
person practices vipassanÈ meditation and reaches the higher stages of
vipassanÈ knowledge, then he gains this equanimity about formations. There is
“neutrality about apprehending reflexion and composure regarding the
hindrances, etc., described thus.” That means he doesn’t have to make effort to
keep his mind on the object. It is effortless observation at that moment. He is
neither attached to nor repulsed by what he sees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

jhÈna. Ten kinds of equanimity about formations arise through insight.” When

eight also are given in footnote 44. “The ‘eight kinds’ are those connected
with the eight jhÈna attainments. The ‘ten kinds’ are connected with the four
Paths, the four Fruitions, the void liberation, and the signless liberation.”
Actually the word ‘liberation’ is not used in the Commentary. It is not ‘void
liberation’ but ‘dwelling in voidness’, ‘dwelling in signlessness’. ‘Dwelling
in voidness’ means contemplating on the voidness of formations. He is still in
the stage of vipassanÈ. He is not yet at the stage of enlightenment, not at the
stage of Path and Fruition. So here ‘dwelling in voidness’ means dwelling on
voidness. ‘Dwelling in signlessness’ means dwelling on the signless formations.
When he practices vipassanÈ meditation, he takes the formations as object.
These formations he contemplates on as void. That means void of permanency,
void of satisfactoriness and void of soul or self. ‘Signlessness’ means the
same thing. These are the ten. When a person reaches that stage, he gains
equanimity about formations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

which is sukha. Since sukha arises together with other mental concomitants, the
person is said to experience sukha with the mental concomitants. The mental
concomitants are here called ‘the mental body’. In PÈÄi the word ‘kÈya’ is
used.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

third jhÈna arises it causes material properties to arise. Some matter is
caused by kamma, some by consciousness (citta), some by climate, and some by
food. When the third jhÈna citta arises, it causes material properties to arise
too. Since it is a very refined state of mind, state of consciousness, the
material properties it produces are also very fine, very subtle. Those very
fine and very subtle material properties, that tangible object the meditator or
the one who has jhÈna experiences. That feeling arises through contact of his
body with other tangible things, other tangible objects, like sitting on a soft
cushion, something like that. During the time when the third jhÈna arises, he
is said to experience mental sukha with his mental body and physical sukha with
his mental body.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

what we call ‘vedanÈ’ (feeling) is in the mind. What we call feeling or
sensations are the material properties in the body. Suppose there is pain here.
Pain is a collection of material properties here. We feel that pain. That
feeling of pain is in our mind. When we have a good touch, there is feeling.
That good touch is material properties and that we feel in our mind as sukha
(pleasurable feeling). Here also when the person gets third jhÈna, his mind is
so refined that it produces very refined material properties. These material
properties are all scattered throughout his body or pervade his body. Therefore
he feels very pleasant sensations in the body through his mind. That is why it
is described here as “experiencing sukha bodily and mental with his mental
body.” And ‘mental body’ means a group of mental concomitants or a group of
mental factors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the other, the concomitants arising together with the previous consciousness
can be a condition as repetition condition of the succeeding consciousness only
when they are of the same nature. Pleasurable must be followed by pleasurable.
Neutral must be followed by neutral. If neutral followed pleasurable, there
would be no relationship as repetition. So in this fourth jhÈna “pleasant

neither-pain-nor-pleasant feeling, and [the preliminary work] must be aroused

the Commentator is saying is the pleasurable feeling cannot be a repetition
condition for neutral feeling. In the fourth jhÈna there is neutral feeling and
not pleasurable feeling. If you look at the thought process, the jhÈna
consciousness is preceded by four or three sense-sphere javanas or impulsions.
Since in the first thought process the fifth moment, the jhÈna moment, is
accompanied by neutral feeling, the others also must be accompanied by neutral
feeling. That is what the Commentator is saying. In the first, second and third
jhÈnas the javanas are accompanied by pleasurable feeling. That is the
difference. In this thought process for fourth jhÈna, since fourth jhÈna must
be accompanied by neutral feeling, the preceding kÈmÈvacara javanas must also
be accompanied by neutral feeling. That is the only difference. That is what
the Commentator is saying.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

aroused in the case of the fourth jhÈna with neither-painful-nor-pleasant

neither-painful-nor-pleasant must arise.” It is not in the preliminary-work but
it is in the fourth jhÈna that neutral feeling must arise. Neutral feeling must
be there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Neutral feeling is feeling and sukha or happiness is feeling. If it is neutral
it cannot be happiness, and if it is happiness it cannot be neutral. Since the
fourth jhÈna is accompanied by neutral feeling, there can be no sukha feeling
there. There can be no pleasant feeling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Happiness is pleasurable feeling. Neutral feeling is said to be higher than
pleasurable feeling. So in this fourth jhÈna pleasurable feeling vanishes and
in its place neutral feeling arises. This neutral feeling is so refined that it
is almost a kind of sukha. Although it is not technically sukha, it is the kind

jhÈna. The abandonment of these four (sukha, dukkha, somanassa, domanassa)
occurs during the preliminary stage of the fourth jhÈna it would seem. During
the preliminary stage of the fourth jhÈna somanassa is abandoned. During the
preliminary stage of the first jhÈna dukkha is abandoned. At the preliminary
stage of the second jhÈna domanassa is abandoned. At the preliminary stage of

domanassa are abandoned or eliminated before the moment of fourth jhÈna. Before

true that they are abandoned in the preliminary stages. But their abandonment
there is not intensive. Their cessation in the preliminary stages is not strong
or reinforced. But at the moment of jhÈna there is reinforced cessation or
reinforced abandonment of these things, these feelings. In the Sutta passage
pointed out by the Commentator only the reinforced cessation is meant and not

either five-sense-door adverting or mind-door adverting. There can only be one
adverting. So here ‘jhÈna access which has different adverting’ means the
preliminary stage before reaching the jhana thought process. When a person
tries to get jhÈna he practices meditation. He gains first the preliminary
concentration and then access concentration. During the stage of access
concentration there are moments of this preliminary work. These moments consist
of a series<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>of thought processes. In
each thought process there is only one adverting. ‘First jhÈna access which has
different adverting’ means while a person is trying to attain the first jhÈna,

are called the jhÈna access with different adverting. If it is said with the

process. The PÈÄi word ‘nÈnÈ’ can mean many or different. Here it means
different. So ‘which has different adverting’ is what is meant here. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
