<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The next meditation is mindfulness of death.
Death is defined as the interruption of the life faculty included within the
limits of a single becoming or a single existence. It is one life - a human
life, an animal life or whatever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ëInterruptioní really means cessation or
being cut off. So it is stoppage or cessation of the life faculty. You are
familiar with the life faculty. It is j vita. It is something which keeps our
bodies alive and also there is life faculty of mind. So there are two life
faculties - physical and mental.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The first definition is what is meant here.
There are other kinds of death. ìBut death as termination (cutting off), in
other words, the Arahantís termination of the suffering of the round, is not
intended here.î When an Arahant dies, he dies and there is no more rebirth for
him. That kind of death is not meant here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìNor is momentary deathî - that means at
every moment there is death. There is one moment of thought and then it dies
and then there is another moment of thought and so on. We are dying and being
reborn every moment. That kind of death is called ëmomentary deathí.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìIn other words, the momentary dissolution
of formations, nor the ëdeathí of conventional (metaphorical) usage in such
expressions as ëdead treeí, ëdead <u>metal</u>í and so on (is not meant here).î
In the Visuddhi Magga it actually says ìthe iron is deadî, not metal. It should
be dead iron.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>There is alchemy in the East as well as in
the West. These people tried to do something to metal to make it beneficial for
people. There is a saying in Burmese ìIf you can kill the iron, you can feed
the whole country.î I donít know what that means. There is another saying ìIf
you can kill the iron, you can turn lead into gold.î It is also said that you
can cure diseases. They tried to burn these metals and make them into ashes.
Then they would mix them with honey and so on and treat people. Many people
believe such ashes can treat many kinds of diseases. So when we say ëThe iron
is dead; the copper is dead.î, we are using conventional usage. That kind of
death is not meant here. What is meant here is just the end of one life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAs intended here it is of two kinds, that
is to say, timely death and untimely death. Herein, timely death comes about
with the exhaustion of merit, or with the exhaustion of a life span, or with
both. Untimely death comes about through kamma that interrupts [other,
life-producing] kamma.î<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ëDeath through the exhaustion of merití -
that means death through the exhaustion of the force of kamma. Let us suppose
that the life span is now one hundred years. However a person whose kamma
cannot give him one hundred years may die before he reaches that age. He may
die at the age of fifty, forty, or even younger. When he dies in that way, he
is said to die through the exhaustion of merit or through the exhaustion of the
force of kamma. That is why many people die now before reaching the end of the
life span.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Sometimes people have very strong kamma.
Their kamma could make them live for one thousand years, many hundreds of
years. If they live at a time when humans only live for one hundred years, then
they will die at the end of that life span. They may have kamma which can make
them live for more than one hundred years, but since they are reborn at a time
when people live for only one hundred years, they have to die at the age of one
hundred years. That is called ëexhaustion of a life spaní.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The death through the exhaustion of both is
when a person has a kamma which will cause him to live for one hundred years,
and he is reborn at a time when people live for one hundred years, and he dies
at the age of one hundred years. That is death through both.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The last one is untimely death. That is
mostly tragic death. ìUntimely death is a term for the death of those whose
continuity is interrupted by kamma capable of causing them to fall (c»vana)
from their place at that very moment, as in the case of D|si-M»ra, Kal»bur»j»,
etc., or for the death of those whose [lifeís] continuity is interrupted by
assaults with weapons, etc., due to previous kamma.î<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Sometimes people do a very heinous offense
or crime like killing an Arahant. Such people sometimes die immediately. Here
the example of D|si-M»ra is given. He tried to kill Venerable S»riputta. One
day Venerable S»riputta shaved his head. So his head was very smooth and
shining. D|si-M»ra wanted to hit him. He hit him on the head. Venerable
S»riputta was in jh»na, in sam»patti. Nothing happened to Venerable S»riputta.
Because of that kamma D|si-M»ra died immediately.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Kal»bur»j» was a king who killed a sage who
practiced patience. There was a sage named Khantivara. He was very famous and
once he came to the city and sat in the garden or pleasure grove of the king.
The king was asleep. So his queens and concubines went to the hermit in order
to listen to the Dhamma. When the king woke up, he did not see his wives. So he
looked around. When he reached the hermit, he asked ìWhat are you?î The sage
replied ìI am a hermit.î The king asked ìWhat do you practice?î The sage
replied ìI practice patience.î The king asked ìWhat is patience?î The hermit
said that it was having forbearance with regard to whatever people may do to
you. Then the king said ìLet us see your patience.î He called his executioners
and had them cut off the hands of that sage. Then he asked him ìAre you still
patient?î The sage replied ìPatience does not lie in the hands.î Then the king
had the feet of the sage cut off and questioned him again. The sage said he was
not angry with him and that he was not upset. He said that patience was here.
The king kicked him and went away. When the king went away, a general heard
about what happened. He rushed to the sage and asked him to be angry with the
king. He said ìPlease be angry with the king because if you get angry with the
king you will suffer less.î The sage said ìPeople like me do not get angry. Let
him live long.î Because of that offense the king was swallowed by the earth. He
was consumed by the earth. Such death is called ëuntimely deathí. They have
past kamma and they have life span, but their crime is so bad that they have to
die. Sometimes they die in accidents. These are called ëuntimely deathí.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
About not getting angry, how would his kamma be less because somebody got
angry?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
It is like with regard to wholesome acts sewing seeds in a field which is
fertile and in a field which is not fertile. The effect or result of killing
differs with the being who is killed. If the being that is killed is virtuous, there
is more akusala. If the being that is killed is larger, then there is more
akusala and so on. There are variations in degree of offense with regard to the
virtue of the person being killed and also whether there is more effort needed
to kill. Killing an ant and killing an elephant are not the same; they do not
have the same degree of akusala or unwholesomeness. To kill an elephant you
have to make much effort. The more effort there is, the more akusala there is.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
So what you are saying is the general misunderstood about this thing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
No. The general did not misunderstand. The general wanted to make the offense
less damaging for the king. If the hermit becomes angry, he will be less
virtuous.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
This is a funny example. This is different from Mah»yana. The Mah»yana approach
might be to convince and help the king. The sage should get angry. That is in a
sense a play for virtue. If he wants the kingís punishment not to be so bad, he
might get ëangryí, but it would not be out of actual anger. I donít know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
But when he gets angry, it will amount to breaking some vows or something. He
might have made the vow ìI will be patient whatever people do to me.î So he
kept it until his death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
You mentioned that some people may have the kamma to live for one thousand
years, but the life span is only a hundred years. With the nine hundred years
remaining do you have some kind of credit?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: I
wish we could. No. In order for kamma to ripen and give results we need
different conditions - the time for the ripening of the kamma, the place for
the ripening of the kamma, the condition of the ripening of the kamma and so
on. When kamma gives results, it depends on these conditions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Mahasi Say»daw in one of hi talks said ìI am
afraid that many Burmese people will be reborn in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>. Why? Because they do a lot of
meritorious deeds, especially d»na. These meritorious deeds will give them
great results. </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Burma</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'> is a poor country. So when the
kamma is able to make him a billionaire, </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Burma</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'> will not have enough.î It was
something like that. In order for the kamma to give full results, it needs
favorable conditions - favorable effort made by the person, then time, many
things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
Is it possible when a person dies young, that it is ever taken as a sign of
good kamma? He might have a more favorable rebirth having died young.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
To die young is the result of not so good kamma.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
Let us say their life is miserable. They are born in the ghetto, have disease,
never have contact with the Dharma, and they die young. Then they might have a
better chance in another environment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
People are reborn as human beings as the result of wholesome kamma. This
wholesome kamma has different capabilities, different abilities, different
power. Some wholesome kamma can only give ten years. Other wholesome kamma may
give twenty years, thirty years and so on. Whenever a person is reborn as a
human being, he is said to be reborn as the result of good kamma. But that good
kamma varies. That person does not die as the result of bad kamma, but as the
result of good kamma that is not strong enough to make him live longer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
In other words children that die young do not have as much good kamma as
someone who lives to be eighty five or ninety?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
Thatís right. The recollection on death I think is not so difficult. The
Visuddhi Magga tells us how to reflect on death in different ways. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In paragraph 7 ìWhen some exercise it merely
in this way (That means death will take place, death will come, I will die one
day.), their hindrances get suppressed, their mindfulness becomes established
with death as its object, and the meditation subject reaches access.î Those are
gifted people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìBut one who finds that it does not get so
far should do his recollecting of death in eight ways, that is to say: (1) as
having the appearance of a murderer, (2) as the <u>ruin of success</u>î - not
the ëruin of successí but success and failure - ì(3) by comparison, (4) as to
sharing the body with many (That means we have to share our body with worms,
insects, germs and all these things.) (5) as to the frailty of life, (6) as
signless, (7) as to limitedness of the extent, (8) as to the shortness of the
moment.î We can reflect on death in different ways.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Towards the end of the recollection of death
there is a large footnote discussing pa““atti. We will discuss it next week.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>There are many examples given and we cannot
go to every reference. In footnote 6 many references are given - Mah»sammata,
Mandh»tu, Mah»sudassana, Daƒhanemi, Nimi, Jotika, Ja‘ila, Ugga and so on. Some
of the persons mentioned are found mostly in J»taka tales and also in the
Suttas. Then in paragraph 19 V»sudeva, Baladeva, and so on are mostly taken
from Hindu books. There is some kind of relationship between Hindu stories and
Buddhist stories. Some Hindu stories are told as Buddhist stories in the
J»takas. V»sudeva, Baladeva, Bh masena, Yuddhi‘‘hila and C»”ura are mentioned
in the J»takas, but I think they originally came from Hindu sources.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The main point here is that persons who are
of great merit, who are of great strength, who possess supernormal powers and
even the Buddha had to die. There is no point in saying we will not die.
Comparing ourselves with these persons, we reflect on death, that death will
come to us one day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>This recollection has to be done with
wisdom, has to be done with understanding. Paragraph 5 ìIf he exercises his
attention unwisely in recollecting the [possible] death of an agreeable person,
sorrow arises, as in a mother on recollecting the death of her beloved child
she bore; and gladness arises in recollecting the death of a disagreeable
person, as in enemies on recollecting the death of their enemies; and no sense
of urgency arises on recollecting the death of a neutral person, as happens in
a corpse-burner on seeing a dead body; and anxiety arises on recollecting oneís
own death, as happens in a timid person on seeing a murderer with a poised
dagger.î<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìIn all that there is neither mindfulness
nor sense of urgency nor knowledge. So he should look here and there at beings
that have been killed or have died, and advert to the death of beings already
dead but formerly seen enjoying good things, doing so with mindfulness, with a
sense of urgency and with knowledge, after which he can exercise his attention
in the way beginning 'ëDeath will take place'.î So when you practice this kind
of meditation, you have to be very careful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>It is amazing that thinking of death makes
you less afraid of death. Also the recollection on death can reduce to a very
great degree your pride or attachment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>You may have experienced being very sick or
very ill. You may have thought that you were going to die. In that case you
donít have any attachment, or any anger or whatever. You do not have any pride
in yourself. You are very humble. You are like an Arahant at that time because
you donít want anything. You are not attached to anything at that time. So
recollection on death is a very good weapon in fighting against attachment, hatred,
pride and others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>And when death really comes, you will be
able to face it with more calmness than those who do not practice this kind of
meditation. That is why the Buddha said that monks must practice this
meditation. Everyday monks must practice recollection of the Buddha,
loving-kindness meditation, foulness of the body meditation and recollection of
death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>One thing I want to say in paragraph 35 it
says ìAs to the limitedness of the extent: the extent of human life is short
now. One who lives long lives a hundred years, <u>more or less</u>.î What the
Buddha meant here is ìOne who lives long lives a hundred years, or a little
more.î It is not ëmore or lessí. That means he may live to be 120 years, 150
years, 160 years, not ëmore or lessí. So ìOne who lives long lives a hundred
years, or a little more.î There are two sentences like that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a footnote in The Path of purification giving information about concept or pa““atti.

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>concept is virtually reality in the ultimate
sense or in the highest sense. The P»ƒi words for this line is pa““atti

say someone lives or someone dies<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>we
really are talking about consciousness arising and disappearing. When we talk
about consciousness, we are talking about an ultimate reality. Here concept is
virtually ultimate reality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span><span style='mso-tab-count:2'>††††††††††††† </span>In
connection with that the translator gives information about pa““atti or
concept.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>He took this information from
the commentary on the Puggalapa““atti one of the books in Abhidhamma. There are
7 books in Abhidhamma. This Puggalapa““atti is one of them. It is the one book
in Abhidhamma that does not look like Abhidhamma. It is in fact taken from
Sutta Pi‘aka because it describes different types of beings, different types of
human beings. The book is called Puggalapa““atti (Concept of Persons).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The word ëpa““atti in P»ƒi has two meanings.
The first meaning is that which makes known or that which designates. That
which makes known or that which designates is called ën»ma pa““attií. We will
call it ëname-conceptí. That means the words which denote the things. The words
denoting the things or the names we give to different things are called ën»ma
pa““attií. This is because they make things known. When I say ìtableî, you know
the thing, a table. When I say ìmanî, you know the being, man. The names or the
words are called ëpa““attií here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The second meaning is that which is made
known, that which is designated. That is called ëattha pa““attií, thing
concept. So there are two kinds of concepts - name-concept and thing-concept.
The word or the name ëmaní is the name-concept. The person, the man himself, is
thing-concept. The being, man, is designated by or made known by the word or
the name ëmaní. We can think of many examples of this. When we say ëcarí, the
word ëcarí is name-concept and the thing which we call a car is thing-concept.
Mostly today we are going to learn about name-concepts. In that book of
Abhidhamma first the six kinds of concepts or designations are given.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The notes I have given you are the same as
the small print in this book. It is difficult to read the small print in this
book. In order to facilitate reading I made these notes. They are not new.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††† </span>There are concept of aggregates, concept of
bases, concept of elements, concept of truths, concept of faculties and concept
of persons. These are the six kinds of concepts dealt with in that book of
Abhidhamma, Puggalapa““attii.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The examples for concept of aggregates would
be aggregate of matter, or aggregate of feeling, aggregate of perception and so
on. Examples for concept of bases would be eye-base, ear-base and so on.
Examples of concept of elements are eye-element, ear-element and so on. Concept
of Truth is Noble Truth of Suffering, Noble Truth of Origin of Suffering and so
on. Concept of faculties are exemplified by eye faculty, ear faculty and so on.
For the concept of persons there are many kinds of persons mentioned in that
book. One who is ëfree from defilements at appropriate timesí is only one of
them. There are different kinds of persons mentioned in that book of
Abhidhamma. These are the concepts according to the Texts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Apart from the concepts mentioned in the
Texts there are other kinds of concepts mentioned in the Commentaries. They are
ëconcept of the existentí, ëconcept of the non-existentí, ëconcept of the
non-existent by the existentí, ëconcept of the existent by the non-existentí,
ëconcept of the existent by the existentí and ëconcept of the non-existent<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>by the non-existentí. These six are
important. These six are also mentioned in The Manual of Abhidhamma. In the
eighth chapter of The Manual of Abhidhamma these six are given.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Here ëexistentí means something which has
three phases of existence - arising, continuing and disappearing or
dissolution. These three phases or these three submoments are called the common
characteristics of all conditioned phenomena. Anything that is conditioned must
have these three characteristics - arising, continuing for some time, and then
disappearing. Anything that has these three phases of existence is called
ëexistentí. Anything that does not have these three phases is called
ënon-existentí.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>According to the teachings of Abhidhamma
only those that are mentioned in Abhidhamma like consciousness, mental states,
material properties and Nibb»na are existent. The others are non-existent. So
pa““atti is actually non-existent. Only the ultimate truths are existent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>So the concept of the existent is the name
of something which is said to be existent. Kusala or akusala, these are the
terms for wholesome or unwholesome conscioousness. These names are the concepts
of the existent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The concept of the non-existent means names
given to things or beings that are non-existent according to Abhidhamma. A man,
a woman, a house, a table, or whatever is supposed to be non-existent according
to the ultimate sense. This is because there is no woman apart from the
aggregates, no man apart from the aggregates, no house apart from the different
parts like roof, walls, doors and so on. Therefore they are called
ënon-existentí. The name ëwomaní, or the name ëmaní, or the name ëhouseí are
the names of non-existent beings or the name of a non-existent thing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Sometimes we combine these two, existent and
non-existent. Then we get four more of these concepts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The third is ëthe concept of the
non-existent by the existentí, concept of the non-existent by or with what is
existent. ëOne with the three clear visionsí is an example. You must understand
the P»ƒi word ëtivijj»í. Here ëoneí is non-existent. The person is
non-existent. ëThe three clear visionsí means knowledge, in P»ƒi abhi““». The
three clear visions are existent because they are “»”a, one of the 52 mental
states. This is a concept or designation of the non-existent by the existent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The next one is the designation of the
existent by the non-existent. ëForm of a femaleí is the example. ëFormí means
r|pa here, not a shape or something. R|pa is existent because it has its own
three phases of existence - arising, continuing and disappearing. ëFemaleí or
ëwomaní is non-existent. Therefore ëform of a femaleí, this name, this
designation is a designation of the existent by the non-existent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The next one is the concept of the existent
by the existent. Both must be found in the Abhidhamma. Eye-contact is the
example. ëEyeí here means the eye sensitivity. It is among the 28 material
properties. It is existent. Contact (phassa) is one of the 52 mental states. So
it is existent. Eye-contact is a concept of the existent by the existent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The last one is the concept of the
non-existent by the non-existent. Both must be non-existent according to
ultimate reality. A bankerís sone is the example. A son is non-existent and a
banker is also non-existent. This is the designation of the non-existent by the
non-existent. These are the six kinds of concepts mentioned in the Commentaries.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>You can give other examples following these.
For the non-existent there are a car, a house, a lamp, a kettle. For the
non-existent by the existent there are one with clear vision, one with
attachment, one with anger. For the existent by the non-existent we have form
of a female. The first must be existent and the last non-existent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student: A
cup of tea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student: A
monkís kusala<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
Right. A monkís kusala, a monkís akusala, a monkís voice you could say. Voice
is one of the 28 material properties. For the next one, eye-contact you can
substitute some other thing like eye-consciousness. Eye is existent and
consciousness is also existent. The last one, bankerís son is non-existent by
non-existent. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
(inaudible) Bumper-sticker.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
Right. This is the set of six concepts mentioned in the Commentaries. Other
lists of concepts are also given. There are concepts according to teachers.
They are not even found in the Commentaries, but they are mentioned by
teachers. There are two sets with six in each set. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>One is derivative concept. That means
depending upon something a name is given. For example the name ëbeingí is given
depending upon the combination of five aggregates. The name ëchariotí is given
depending upon the combination of various parts. Such concepts are called
derivative concepts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The second one is appositional concept. It
has sub-divisions. They are given at the end of the list. We will go to them
later. ëSecondí and ëthirdí are the examples. When we say that this is second,
then the other is third. When we say that this other is third, then the next
one is fourth and so on. That is the appositional concept.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then we have collective concept. Examples
are ëeight-footedí, ëpile of richesí. These are the names of collective things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The fourth one is additive concept. That
means adding one more. The example ëtwo, three, fourí is given. There should be
no ëoneí in the footnote because there is nothing added there. From two onward
we have adding, so two, three, four. In the Commentary also it is given as
ëtwo, three, fourí.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then there is verisimilar concept. That
means the names of those things that are taught in Abhidhamma. Such things as
earth-element, water-element, consciousness, mental factors are all examples of
the verisimilar concept.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The sixth one is continuity concept. That is
the name given depending upon the continuity of a being. Examples are
octagenerarian and nonagenerarian (an eighty year old man, a ninety year old
man) and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>There is another set of six according to
teachers. There are two sets of concepts according to teachers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The first one of the second set is concept
according to function. Examples of preacher and Dhamma teacher are given. They
are names given depending upon the function done by that person. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The next one is concept according to shape
or form. Such things as thin man, round man, stout man and so on are examples.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The next one is concept according to gender.
A man, a woman are concepts according to gender. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The fourth one is concept according to
location. That is of sense-sphere. This citta belongs to k»m»vacara
sense-sphere. This citta belongs to r|p»vacara sense-sphere. Or we have
ëKosalaní. Kosalan is a native of Kosala. Kosala is the name of a place. So we
can put here ëAmericaní.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then there is concept as Proper name. That
is oneís own name. The examples are all names in P»ƒi - Tissa, N»ma, Sumana. So
you can put any name you like, your own name there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The last one is the concept of the unconditioned.
That is the name of things that are not conditioned. Examples are cessation and
Nibb»na. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The appositional concept is sub-divided into
eight. Maybe we can add many more. The first one is apposition of reference.
That is like with reference to the second the other is called the third. Then
we have long and short. That means for example that one foot is long compared
to six inches. One foot is short compared to two feet and so on. This is called
apposition of reference. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The second one is apposition of what is in
the hand. If you have an umbrella in the hand, you are called ë the man with
umbrella-in-handí.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>If you have a kettle
in your hand, then you are ëthe person with the kettle-in-your-handí and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then there is apposition of association. The
example is ëearring-wearerí or jacket-wearer. You can say anything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then there is apposition proximity with the
example of ë</span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>These are the different kinds of concepts
taught in the Texts, Commentaries and also taught by the teachers. According to
the teachings of Abhidhamma concepts do not have the three phases of existence.
We cannot say that a concept has time. It has no existence or no reality. It
exists only in our minds. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>It might be similar to chemists saying that
there is no such thing as water apart from the two elements combined together.
In the sense of chemistry there is no water but just oxygen and hydrogen. So
water is a concept. Hydrogen and oxygen are ultimate realities according to
chemistry. According to chemistry water has no existence of its own. It is just
a combination of two elements. In the same way a man or a woman has no real
existence. They exist only in the minds of people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

dhamma without individual essence.î We cannot say that a concept has this
individual essence, this characteristic, or that individual essence, that
characteristic. They are just concepts. They just exist in our minds. They are
not ultimate reality. These are the concepts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>We have to understand two kinds of truths -
conventional truth and the ultimate truth. On the conventional level we use
words denoting concepts like man, woman, table, house. On the ultimate level we
use words like consciousness, contact, feeling and so on. There are these two
kinds of truth, conventional truth and ultimate truth. ëConventional truthí is
called pa““atti in P»ƒi. It has many divisions. Name-concept and thing-concept
are the primary divisions. Everything we see around us, including ourselves, is
concept. The things with which we and other things are composed, the things
with which we are made, are the ultimate truths. The five aggregates are
ultimate truth, but a man or a woman is not ultimate reality, but conventional
truth. These are the different kinds of concepts taught in Abhidhamma.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

many more are there?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
Cessation, Nibb»na, deathless - anything which denotes Nibb»na. We have to
understand that unconditioned and the supramundane are different. There are
types of consciousness belonging to the supramundane level such as Path
consciousness and Fruition consciousness. Although they are supramundane, they
are still conditioned. They need conditions to arise. They are not
unconditioned although they take the unconditioned as object, the unconditioned
which is Nibb»na as object. So if we want to give some more examples, we have
to find some more names for Nibb»na, things like extinction of suffering,
destruction of cankers, things like that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Now we go to the next section, mindfulness
occupied with the body. It begins with a quotation from the Suttas where Buddha
praised the practice of mindfulness occupied with the body or mindfulness of
the body. ìBhikkhus, when one thing is developed and repeatedly practiced, it
leads to a supreme sense of urgency, to supreme benefit, to supreme surcease of
bondage, to supreme mindfulness and full-awareness, to acquisition of knowledge
and vision, to a happy life here and now, to realization of the Fruit of clear
vision and deliverance. What is that one thing? It is mindfulness occupied with
the body.î<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then there is a quote from another Sutta.
ìBhikkhus, they savor the deathless who savor mindfulness occupied with the
body; they do not savor the deathless who do not savor mindfulness occupied
with the body.î<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>What
this actually means is that when people practice mindfulness occupied with the
body, they do not stop at just mindfulness occupied with the body. After
practicing mindfulness occupied with the body, they practice vipassan». That is
why they are said to savor the deathless or Nibb»na.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

savored mindfulness occupied with the body; they have not savored.. They have
neglected.. They have not neglected.. They have missed.. They have found the
deathless who have found mindfulness occupied with the body. And it has been
described in fourteen sections in the passage beginning ëAnd how developed,
bhikkhu, how repeatedly practiced is mindfulness occupied with the body of
great fruit, of great benefit? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, gone to the
forestí..î and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

praise of mindfulness of the body. We are <u>not</u> to understand that <u>only</u>
mindfulness of the body is the best. There are different kinds of meditation.We
have come through many kinds of meditation. Any meditation if we practice
properly will lead to the attainment of the deathless or the attainment of
Nibb»na.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

want to say that only mindfulness of the body is the thing to practice, not
other kinds of meditation because here the Buddha said that those that savor
mindfulness of the body savor the deathless. In fact every kind of meditation,
even samatha meditation when made the basis for vipassan», can help people get
enlightenment. Any kind of meditation is good for practice. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Mindfulness occupied with the body is
described in fourteen sections in the Mah» Satipa‘‘h»na Sutta. There are four
foundations of mindfulness. They are contemplation of the body, contemplation
of feeling, contemplation of consciousness, and contemplation of dhamma
objects.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Contemplation of the body is described in
fourteen sections in the Mah» Satipa‘‘h»na Sutta. All of them could be called
mindfulness occupied with the body. Some sections or some meditationss have
their own names. For example there is breathing meditation. This section of the
Sutta is called ëbreathing meditationí or in P»ƒi ë»n»p»nasatií meditation. We
donít call it ëk»yag»tasatií which is the original word for mindfulness
occupied with the body. Mindfulness of the body covers all these fourteen
sections - breathing, postures of the body, small activities of the body, 32
parts of the body (We are going to study them.), four elements, and nine
cemetery meditations. They are all described under the heading of mindfulness
of the body.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

sections in the passage beginning ëAnd how developed, bhikkhu, how repeatedly

The Mah» Satipa‘‘h»na Sutta can be found in two collections, in the Collection
of Long Suttas and in the Collection of Middle Length Suttas. The Great
Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness appeared twice in the Tipi‘aka.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

breathing, on postures, on the four kinds of full-awareness, on attention
directed to repulsiveness (This is the 32 parts of the body.), on attention
directed to elements (four great elements), and on the nine charnel-ground

sections on postures, on the four kinds of full-awareness, and on attention

four kinds of full-awareness, and the section on attention to elements.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

charnel-ground contemplations, as stated there, deal with that particular phase
of insight knowledge called Contemplation of Danger.î Actually I would say
ìContemplation of Flaws or Faultsî, not necessarily danger. When we practice
the charnel-ground meditation, we find fault with our bodies. We might have
thought of our bodies as beautiful, as pretty, as desirable. When we practice
this kind of meditation, we find fault with our bodies. The body is just a
group of filthy things that have come together. It is something like that. So
it deals with insight knowledge. In the beginning it may be samatha meditation,
but ultimately it becomes vipassan». <o:p></o:p></span></p>

bloated,etc., that might be implied there has already been explained in the
Description of Foulness(Ch.VI). So there are only the two that is, the sections
on breathing and on directing attention to repulsiveness, that, as stated
there, deal with concentration (ëConcentrationí here means samatha
meditation.).î According to this the sections on breathing meditation and
repulsiveness meditation are samatha meditation. They are treated as samatha
meditation in the Visuddhi Magga. ìOf these, two, the section on breathing is a
separate meditation subject, namely Mindfulness of Breathing.î This will come
later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìWhat is intended here as Mindfulness
Occupied with the Body is the 32 aspects.î According to this meditation there
are 32 parts. We human beings are made up of 32 parts. When we practice this
meditation, we try to see these 32 parts as repulsive and so on. That is to get
rid of attachment to our bodies and to get rid of attachment to the bodies of
other people as well. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

with. The one which is missing in the Texts is mentioned in a book which is
called Pa‘isambhid»magga. That book is said to have been preached by Venerable

book called Mah» Niddesa. They are called post-Canonical books or scriptures.
But in our countries we just include them with the Texts because we believe
they were uttered during the time of the Buddha and that Buddha accepted them

Although the word ëcarcassí is used, we should understand that it is not a dead
body. We try to see in our living body head hairs, body hairs and so on. We try
to see the repulsiveness of these things because such vile things as the head

with two and three Pi‘akasî - that means they know two Pi‘akas and three
Pi‘akas. So they are learned persons. But this monk, this elder, is telling
them to recite the 32 parts. Actually they must have already learned these 32
parts, but they accept his advice. ìAlthough they were familiar respectively
with two and three Pi‘akas, it was only at the end of four months recitation of
the meditation subject that they became Stream Enterers.î Actually it means
they became Stream Enterers just reciting the 32 parts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>They became Stream Enterers not just by
recitation. First they did the recitation. Then they review each part as foul
or loathsome. Then they develop vipassan» on it. Without vipassan» there can be
no Stream Entry. Although it would appear here that they just recite and become
Sot»pannas, that is not the case. For four months they recite this back and
forth, back and forth. Then they got the counterpart sign and so on. Then they
became Sot»pannas after practicing vipassan» on it. Without vipassan» there can
be no Stream Entry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ëPadakkhi”agg»hit» means ëtaking with respectí. These two were learned monks.
But when the teacher told them ìYou recite the 32 parts for four months.î, they
did not say that they had already learned it or that they did not need to
recite it.They had too much respect for the teacher to refuse. So following
with respect the advice of the teacher, they recited for four months and during
that time they became Stream Enterers.î ëWith right apprehension [of the text]í
is not the right translation of the P»ƒi word.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The first part is the 32 parts. Head hairs,
body hairs, nails, teeth and skin are the skin pentad, that is they are the
five ending with skin. The next one is flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow and
kidney. That is the five ending with kidney. Then there are the five ending
with lungs. After that there are the five ending with the brain. And then there
are six ending with fat. The last is six ending with urine. The 32 parts are
divided into groups of five, five, five, five, six and six. Recitation should
be done this way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>There is another book, another Commentary
written by the same author. It is the Commentary on the second book of

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The recitation I give on these notes are the
combination of the statements found in two Commentaries, in The Path of
Purification and the Sammohavinosan . In The Path of Purification there is no
mention of how many days you are to recite each group, not how to recite
forward and backwards, and so on. There in the other book the method is given.
So I combined these two into one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>It will take how many days? 165 days to
recite. So you have to spend five and a half months just reciting verbally.

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>For the first one we say ìHead hairs, body
hairs, nails, teeth, skin.î Forward this way you recite for five days. ìHead
hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skinî you say thousands and thousands of

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
Yes, just verbal recitation. But when you recite the verbal recitation, you
also must know the meaning of the words. That meaning must soak into your mind.
Next will come mental recitation. The verbal recitation alone will take 165
days.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then you must go forward and backwards. That
is you say ìHead hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin; skin, teeth, nails,
body hairs, head hairs.î You go back and forth , back and forth for five days.
The skin pentad will take 15 days.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then the next pentad is the kidney pentad.
Then you say ìFlesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneyî forward for five days.
However when you say backwards, you say not only these five, but the previous
five as well. Backwards for the kidney pentad is ìKidney, bone marrow, bones,
sinews, flesh, skin, teeth, nails, body hairs, head hairs.î If you look at the
notes, I put numbers because it is very boring to type these words again and
again, even the numbers. The kidney pentad for the last five days is
ì6,7,8,9,10, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.î<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

two pentads and recite them for 15 days. For the first five days you recite
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,,9,10. That is forward. For the second five days you recite
backwards 10,9,8,7,6,,4,3,2,1. For the last five days you recite forward and
backward 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10; 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1. That is 15 days.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

11,12,13,14,15 for the first five days. Then backward you go back to number
one. So for five days you recite 15.14,13,12,11,10, 9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1. For the
third five days you recite forward and backward.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>After each pentad you combine with the
previous pentads. So you combine two pentads, three pentads, four pentads, five
groups together, and six groups together. If you do it this way, it will take
165 days.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
You do this the whole day?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
That is a good question. Most of the day. If you are a monk, you have to go out
for alms. Still you can do mental recitation. Monks are taught or instructed to
go with meditation when they go for alms in the village or in the city. If a
monk goes without meditation, he is not supposed to be a practicing monk. You
go to the village or the city with some kind of meditation. Sometimes you may
be practicing mindfulness and sometimes this kind of meditation. So you
practice almost the whole day because this is intense practice. It is not just
saying for a few minutes and then giving up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>This is how to do verbal recitation. ìThe
recitation should be done verbally in this way a hundred times, a thousand
times, even a hundred thousand times. For it is through verbal recitation that
the meditation subject becomes familiar (If you spend 165 days, it cannot but
become familiar.), and the mind being thus prevented from runnign here and
there , the parts become evident and seem like [the fingers of] a pair of
clasped hands, like a row of fence posts.î<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThe mental recitation should be done just
as it is done verbally. For the verbal recitation is a condition for the mental
recitation, and the mental recitation is a condition for the penetration of the
characteristic [of foulness].î When you recite it again and again, the sign of
foulness will beee evident to your mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAs to delimitation: there are two kinds of
delimitation, that is, delimitation of the similar and delimitation of the
dissimilar. Herein, delimitation of the similar should be understood in this
way: This part is delimited above and below and around by this.î This is called
ëdelimitation of the similarí. It is like saying this cup is delimited by the
kettle on this side and it is delimited on the other side by the microphone. It
is something like that. That is called ëdelimitation of the similarí.
Delimitation of the dissimilar is as an example : This is head hair and not
body hair. And when you come to body hair: This is body hair, not head hair.
Delimiting in that way is called ëdelimitation of the dissimilarí.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ëDissimilarí here just means ënot similarí.

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìWhen the teacher tells the skill in

of elements. For in the Mah» Satipa‘‘h»na Sutta it is expounded only as

actually. The first twenty belong to the earth element and the remaining ones
belong to the water element. With regard to elements they are mentioned there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

meditation, you cannot get second jh»na and so on. You can get only first
jh»na. But in the Sutta four jh»nas are mentioned. Four jh»nas are mentioned
because for that monk these parts appear as color, not as parts of the body.
When they appear to him as color, he picks up the color kasi”a meditation.
Color kasi”a meditation can lead to all four or five jh»nas. That is why it is
said here ìfour jh»nas are expounded with reference to one to whom it has
appeared as a color [kasi”a].î<o:p></o:p></span></p>

expounded as elements; if we divide them into two kinds of elements and we try
to contemplate on those elements, it is insight meditation. It is a serenity
meditation that is expounded as repulsiveness. When you try to see the
repulsiveness of these things, it is samatha meditation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Today we begin with the tenfold skill in
giving attention. The first set of instructions is recitation. First we are to
do verbal recitation and then mental recitation. Then we are to view them as to
color, as to shape, as to direction, as to location, as to delimitation. These
are called ëthe sevenfold skill in learningí. First we have to learn the
meditation subject. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Now comes the tenfold skill in giving
attention. The tenfold skill in giving attention is: 1. Following the order, 2.
Not too quickly, 3. Not too slowly, 4. Warding off distraction, 5. Surmounting
the concept, 6. Successive learning, 7. Absorption, 8-10. The three Discourses
or three Suttantas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>First following the order - ìFrom the time
of beginning the recitation attention should be given following the serial
order without skipping.î You must go from 1 to 32 and then back from 32 to 1.
You are not to skip any one of them when you recite.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The second is that when you recite you are
not to do too quickly. When you do it too quickly, you will not remember them.
ìFor just as when a man sets out on a three-league journey, even if he has
already done the journey out and back a hundred times rapidly without taking
note of [turnings] to be taken and avoided, though he may finish his journey,
he still has to ask how to get there.î We may go to a place many times, but we
may not know how to go there especially when we are not driving. So you are not
to go too quickly so that you may remember all of them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The third is to recite not too slowly. If
you do it too slowly, you will not come to the end of the recitation, just like
a man ìwho loiters along the way among trees, rocks, pools, etc., does not
finish the journey in a day. So too if the meditator gives his attention to the
meditation subject too slowly, he does not get to the end and it does not get
to the end and it does not become a condition for distinction.î ëCondition for
distinctioní means condition for progress. ëDistinctioní here means progress in
meditation including the realization of truth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The P»ƒi word is ëvisesaí. This word is used
many times with regard to meditation. It means something new or something
special. That means when we practice meditation, we discover one thing after
another. These discoveries are called ëvisesaí or special. Before we practiced
meditation, we did not know about breathing or the parts of the body. After we
practice meditation, we get sam»dhi or concentration. And so we begin to see
things differently from when we did not meditate. These things are called
ëdistinctionsí or ëspecial attainmentsí. This word will appear again and again
in this book. Here it is translated as distinction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then we have warding off distraction. ìHe
must ward off [temptation] to drop the meditation subject and to let his mind
get distracted among the variety of external objects.î So he must pay attention
to the parts of the body and not let his mind be distracted to other objects.
When the mind is often distracted, the meditator will not get to the stage of
realization. Here it is compared to a man going on a one-foot-wide cliff path.
He must be very careful and he must not be distracted because if he is
distracted, he will fall down from the cliff and he may die. ìSo he should give
his attention to warding off distraction.î<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAs to surmounting the concept: this [name]
concept beginning with ëhead hairs, body hairsí must be surmounted and
consciousness established on [the aspect] ërepulsiveí.î In the beginning we
cannot avoid concepts because we live in the conventional world. So we have to
use conventional terms like head hair, body hair and so on. In the beginning we
will be seeing the hair, nails, teeth, skin which are called ëconceptsí. But we
have to surmount, we have to go beyond the convention, beyond the concepts. If
we just see the head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin and so on, if we
just see the picture or the appearance of these parts, we will not get the
notion that the are repulsive. The purpose of this meditation is to arouse
repulsiveness of these parts. So we have to go beyond the concept of head
hairs, body hairs and so on. When a person begins to meditate and after some
time gets enough concentration, he will be able to surmount the concept and
establish his mind on the repulsiveness of these parts. We have to arrive at
the repulsiveness of these parts, not just stopping at the parts. It is not
merely learning these parts, but trying to see repulsiveness in these parts. It
is not like medical students.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then the next one is successive leaving. ìIn
giving his attention he should eventually leave out any [parts] that do not
appear to him.î That means that do not appear to his mind clearly, that which
he does not see clearly in his mind. Although the meditator tries to see all of
them clearly, some parts may not be clear to him or he may not see clearly some
parts. In giving his attention he should eventually leave out any parts that do
not appear to him clearly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìFor when a beginner gives his attention to
head hairs, his attention then carries on until it arrives at the last part.î
Because he is familiar with these 32 parts (he recites and pays attention.),
then his mind goes to the end and then goes back and forth. But some parts may
not appear to his mind clearly. He should drop those which do not appear
clearly in his mind. He must take only those that are clear to him. This is
called ësuccessive leavingí. So he leaves one after the other until he arrives
at the last one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAs he persists in giving attention thus,
some parts appear to him and others do not. Then he should work on those that
have appeared till one out of any two appears the clearer.î He drops them, one
by one, until there are only two left which are the most clear for him. Then he
tries to find out which is clearer among these two.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>He should arouse absorption by again and
again giving attention to the one that has appeared thus.î Eventually he ends
with one part which is the most clear for him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then a simile is given here with 32 palms, a
monkey and so on. Also another simile is given in paragraph 70. A monk goes on
almsround where there are 32 families or 32 houses. ëAlms-food-eaterí simply
means a monk goes on almsround. Most monks in the olden days and even now go
for alms every morning. Such a monk here is called ëalms-food-eaterí. Actually
whether a monk eats food brought by his devotees at the monastery or if he goes
to the village and collects alms, he eats alms-food. Every monk is an
alms-food-eater. But here ëalms-food-eaterí really means a monk who goes out
for alms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>I do not want to use the word ëbegí because
monks do not beg. The P»ƒi word ëbhikkhuí means one who begs. Here ëbeggingí
means going round the village silently. Whatever is given to the monk, he just
accepts. He does not say ìPlease give me food.î or something like that. Monks
are not allowed to do that. So ëalms-food-eaterí means a monk who goes for alms
in the village every day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>So he might go to a village with 32
families. He might pick up two lots of alms at the first house. So he will drop
one house. If he gets three lots at one house, then he will drop two houses and
so on. On the third day he got his bowl full at the first house. Therefore he
will not go any further. He will go to the sitting hall and eat. That is the
simile. In the same way the meditator must go through the 32 parts and drop one
by one the parts that are not clear to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In paragraph 71 we have the application of
this simile. ìThe 32 aspects are like the village with 32 families. The
meditator is like the alms-food-eater. The meditatorís preliminary work is like
the alms-food-eaterís going to live near the village.î Actually it should be
ìliving near the villageî or ìliving depending on the village.î<o:p></o:p></span></p>

means jh»na. Absorption part by part, there are 32 parts. Taking one part and
practicing meditation on it, you can get jh»na. ìThen intention here is this:
it should be understood that absorption is brought about in each one of the
parts.î So you can get 32 kinds of jh»na if you take one part at a time. Let us
say you take head hairs as the part. You practice on it and get jh»na. Then you
can take body hairs as the object of meditation. Then you practice meditation
on it and you may get jh»na. At the end of it we have the story of a monk who
gained jh»na dwelling on all of the 32 parts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

these three Suttas, these three Discourses. They are from the Sutta Pi‘aka,

another Sutta.), and on skill in the Enlightenment Factors (That is still
another Sutta.) which have as their purpose linking energy with concentration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

three signs that should be given attention from time to time by a bhikkhu
intent on higher consciousness.î ëHigher consciousnessí here means both samatha

that means a monk who is practicing samatha meditation or vipassan» meditation
should give attention from time to time to the three signs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The first is the sign of concentration. ëThe
sign of concentrationí really means just concentration or the object of
concentration. In the Sub-Commentary it says that ëthe sign of concentrationí

concentration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

gives attention only to the sign of concentration, then his consciousness may
conduce to idleness.î Too much concentration causes idleness, or lethargy, or sometimes
sleepiness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
Is that for both samatha and vipassan»? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
Yes, it is for both samatha and vipassan». Too much concentration can cause
sleepiness. ëToo much concentrationí means concentration in excess of exertion
or effort. When you get too much concentration, you simply lose exertion or
effort. Your exertion becomes less. In that case too much concentration leads
to idleness, leads to sleepiness or something similar. You feel lethargic. Too
much concentration is actually as bad as too little concentration because as we
have learned in the previous chapters, they must be balanced. The five
faculties must be balanced when we practice meditation. And especially
concentration must be balanced with effort.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Too much effort will cause what? Too much
effort will cause agitation. If effort or exertion is in excess of
concentration, agitation will come in. When there is too much energy, too much
viriya, there is agitation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
So an example of this would be Venerable ånanda near his enlightenment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
Oh, yes. Venerable ånanda was practicing meditation to become an Arahant. He
was too eager. So he put forth too much effort. He walked up and down
practicing meditation in order to become an Arahant. He could not achieve
anything by that practice. Later when he stopped and reviewed his practice, he
saw that he had too much effort. So he slowed down. Then he was able to attain
Arahantship. Too much effort also is not good.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìIf a bhikkhu intent on higher consciousness
gives attention only to the sign of equanimity, then his consciousness may not
become rightly concentrated for the destruction of cankers.î It leads to
delusion, to not knowing, to ignorance. This is so because equanimity is close
to ignoring. When you ignore something, you become ignorant. But equanimity is
not ignoring actually. Equanimity takes the object, the thing, and is not
attached to it nor is it repulsed by it. That is what is called ëequanimityí.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>There is another thing which is wrongly
called equanimity. Actually it is not. Sometimes when you ignore something, you
may say that you have equanimity about that thing. That is not equanimity. That
is just ignoring. Too much equanimity can lead to ignoring. Then there can be
no more destruction of cankers or mental defilements. So a monk should pay
attention from time to time to the sign of concentration, to the sign of
exertion, and to the sign of equanimity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then there is the simile of a goldsmith. Let
us look at the second Sutta in paragraph 77. &quot;Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu
possesses six things, he is able to realize the supreme coolness (coolness of
mind). What six? Here, bhikkhus, when consciousness should be restrained, he
restrains it.î There are times when you have to restrain your mind. You are too
elated or too happy with your practice. If you are too elated or too happy, you
will lose concentration. At that time you must suppress or restrain your mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìWhen consciousness should be restrained, he
restrains it; when consciousness should be exerted, he exerts it; when
consciousness should be encouraged, he encourages it; when consciousness should
be looked upon with equanimity, he looks on at it with equanimity. He is
resolute on the superior [state to be attained], he delights in Nibb»na.
Possessing these six things a bhikkhu is able to realize the supreme coolness.î
So a person must know when to encourage his mind, when to suppress his mind,
when to exert his mind and all these things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then the third Sutta is called The Skill in
the Enlightenment Factors. It is already dealt with in the explanation of skill
in absorption, in chapter 4, paragraphs 51 &amp; 57. ìBhikkhus, when the mind
is slack, that is not the time for developing the tranquillity enlightenment
factor.î<o:p></o:p></span></p>

book, it is described in detail, in a very serious manner. Before you practice
this meditation, first you have to learn the 32 parts by heart. Then you
recite. Then you have to learn these skills, skills in learning and skills in

each distinction.î As he reaches each stage, he may go to his teacher and ask

Kasi”a, and go to live in a suitable one. Then he should sever the minor
impediments and set about the preliminary work for giving attention to
repulsiveness.î So he should prepare properly for the practice of meditation.
He should avoid the unsuitable monasteries and live in a monastery that is
suitable for meditation. He should sever minor impediments. If his hair is
long, he should cut his hair. If his nails are long, he should cut his nails.

apprehend the [learning] sign in head hairs. How? (Then comes the description
of the practice.) The color should be defined first by plucking out one or two
head hairs and placing them on the palm of the hand. He can also look at them
in the hair-cutting place (In the monastery we cut the hair of each other. The
cut hair may still be at that place. So he may go there and pick up a hair or
two and look at it.) or in a bowl of water or rice gruel. (Sometimes there may
be hair in the water or rice gruel. He may look at it.) If the ones he sees are
black when he sees them, they should be brought to mind as ëblackí; if white,
as ëwhiteí; if mixed, they should be brought to mind in accordance with those
most prevalent.î If there are more black, we say black. If there are more

first is head hairs. In the description of these 32 parts there are words which
are very difficult. Here the Commentator describes each part comparing with what
were familiar things for them in those days. Also there are names of trees and
flowers which we donít know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Let us look at head hairs. ìFirstly head
hairs are black in their normal color.î So the normal color is black; maybe
because the author was an Indian and most Eastern people have black hair, he
said that the normal color of head hairs is black. It may be different in the
West. It is said that the hairs are ìthe color of fresh ari‘‘haka seeds.î Maybe
we donít know the name of the tree called ëari‘‘hakaí. We make beads from the
seeds of this tree.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>They are black.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAs to shape, they are the shape of long
round measuring rods. As to direction, they lie in the upper directionî
ëDirectioní means the part of the body. The navel is the middle of the body. So
ëupper directioní means above the navel and ëlower directioní means below the
navel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAs to location, their location is the wet
inner skin that envelops the skull; it is bounded on both sides by the roots of
the ears, in front by the forehead, and behind by the nape of the neck. As to
delimitation, they are bounded below by the surface of their own roots, which
are fixed by entering to the amount of the tip of a rice grain (just a bit)
into the inner skin that envelops the head. They are bounded above by space,
and all round by each other. There are no two hairs together. This is the
delimitation by the similar. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Head hairs are not body hairs, and body
hairs are not head hairs; being likewise not intermixed with the remaining 31
parts the head hairs are a separate part. This is their delimitation by the
dissimilar.î There are two kinds of delimitation, by similar and by dissimilar.
By dissimilar here means that head hairs are not body hairs and body hairs are
not head hairs. They are separate. They are different.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then there is their definition as to
repulsiveness in five ways. ìHead hairs are repulsive in color as well as in
shape, odor, habitat and location.î What is ëhabitatí? What is the difference
between habitat and location?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
ëHabitatí has to do with the inter-relationship of other factors within the
same area. ëLocationí does not have that quality of inter-relatedness with
other factors within the same area. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
In the Sub-Commentary ëhabitatí or the P»ƒi word ë»sayaí is explained as an
origin or cause. If you grow some plants, the plants grow on the earth. They
get nutrition from the earth. That is called ë»sayaí. We have to differentiate
»saya from location.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Let us read paragraph 85. ìFor on seeing the
color of a head hair in a bowl of inviting rice gruel or cooked rice people are
disgusted and say ëThis has got hairs in it. Take it away.í So they are
repulsive in color. Also when people are eating at night, they are likewise
disgusted by the mere sensation of a hair-shaped akka-bark or makaci-barkfiber.
(They are the names of trees.) So they are repulsive in shape. And the odor of
head hairs, unless dressed with a smearing of oil, scented with flowers, etc.,
is most offensive. And it is still worse when they are put in the fire. Even if
head hairs are not directly repulsive in color and shape, still their odor is
directly repulsive. Just as a babyís excitement, as to color is the color of
tumeric and, as to its shape, is the shape of a piece of tumeric root, and just
as the bloated carcass of a black dog thrown on a rubbish heap, as to its
color, is the color of ripe palmyra fruit, and, as to its shape, is the shape
of a [mandolin-shaped] drum left face down, and its fangs are like jasmine
buds, and so even if both these are not directly repulsive in color and shape,
still the odor is directly repulsive.î <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Now instead of ëbutí we can say ëandí or we
can just delete ëbutí. ìJust as pot herbs that grow on village sewage in a
filthy place (This is a description with regard to habitat.) are disgusting to
civilized people and unusable, so also head hairs are disgusting since they
grow on the sewage of pus, blood, urine, dung, bile, phlegm, and the like.î
They grow out of them. ìThis is the repulsive aspect of the habitat.î<o:p></o:p></span></p>

on. This is the repulsive aspect of their location.î Their location is
repulsive and also their habitat or origin is repulsive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ìBut as to color, the skin itself is white; and its whiteness becomes evident

ëexactly 300í. It means ëaboutí. We should say ìThere are about 300 bones.î
Please go back to paragraph 89 in chapter 6. ìThis is the bodyís nature: it is
a collection of over 300 bones.î So there are more than 300 bones. So here the
word does not mean ëexactlyí but ëaboutí 300 bones. Some bones are not
mentioned in the list. There are more than 300 bones in the body. The
Commentary explains the bones in detail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

looks like kidneys. ìAs to direction, it lies in the upper direction.î
That<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>is what is bothering me. ëUpper

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
Yes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
Let us go on. ìAs to location, it is to be found on either side of the heart
flesh.î But the heart is here and the kidneys are down there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
Yes, but when you do an echogram or when you do a CAT scan, you can see its
real location as being raised at the back. The diaphragm is not flat. The
diaphragm is of curved nature because of the liver, because of the kidneys. The
nature of the diaphragm is such that a very special x-ray technique used when
you take an echogram. The kidneys are at the sides of the heart.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
Oh. ìAs to location, it is to be found on either side of the heart flesh, being
fastened by a stout sinew that starts out with one root from the neck and
divides into two after going a short way.î So the translation ëkidneyí is
acceptable?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student: I
think it is acceptable. The heart is not in a<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>stationary position. The heart is pumping. When it is contracted, it is
shortened. Then it is above the level of the kidney. When it is expanded
receiving the inflow of blood, then the heart is enlarged and pushed downwards.
At that time the kidneys are at the sides of the heart. So it is dynamic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
So this description is fairly scientific. I wonder how they knew this. If you

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The next one is heart. In Buddhist
Abhidhamma the heart is said to be the seat of many types of consciousness.
About the middle of the paragraph it talks about this. ìInside it there is a
hollow the size of a Poona seedís bed where half a pasta (ëPastaí means a
handful.) of blood is kept, with which as their support the mind element and
mind consciousness element occur.î There are 89 types of consciousness. Out of
89 ten have their own location or their own base for arising. For example the
two types of seeing consciousness have the eyes as their base. Two types of
hearing consciousness have the ears as their base and so on for the five
senses. Almost all of the other types of consciousness depend upon the heart.
Here ëmind elementí and ëmind consciousness elementí mean types of
consciousness other than the ten - 2 seeing, 2 hearing, 2 smelling, 2 tasting,
and 2 touching. (The four ar|p»vacara vip»ka are also excepted.) The heart or
actually the blood in the heart is the seat of consciousness according to
Abhidhamma.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
Slow in understanding or slow in physical movement? If it means slow in
understanding, it is correct. Here it is mentioned in contrast with those
possessed of understanding. So it is contrasting those who are not intelligent

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

ëmidriffí? I look it up in the dictionary. Midriff is defined as a part of the
body, the diaphragm. I think that will do. The other meaning is that it is the
middle outer portion of the front of the human body extending roughly from just
below the breast to the waist-line. That is just outer. In Burmese it is translated
as ëmembraneí.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student
There is a long explanation of this, but it is true. The brain has its own fluid.
It has spinal fluid. It has its own canals. The formations of these brain
fluids are somewhat screened and filtered, like the kidneys filter and screen
our blood to form urine. The mucus is the screened product of the brain. Urine
is the screened product of the kidneys.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
So this is correct that it oozes or trickles out of the brain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
It is somewhat correct.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

The next one is oil of the joints. It is oil that stays in the joints. It is
translated by Venerable ©»”aponika as synovial fluid. I looked that word up in
the dictionary. It said synovia is a clear, viscid, lubricating fluid secreted
by membranes in joint cavities, sheets of tendons, and bursas. It is called
synovial fluid. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
Particularly in the knee joints when you get older, the fluid is somewhat
reduced. When you sit and stand up, you can hear creaking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
Yes. It is mentioned here. When a man gets up or sits down, moves forward or
backward, bends or stretches, then his bones creak. When I walk there is a
creak in the ankle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

am not happy with the description of the bladder here. About five lines down it
say ìWhile the urinary secretion from the body enters the bladder, its way of
entry is not evident.î There are two pipes going into the bladder from the
kidneys, right?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Yes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
Here it says that its way of entry is not evident, but it is very clear that
urine enters the bladder from the kidneys by way of these pipes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
It may mean that its way of entry is not evident. Actually it is difficult to
explain. It is not evident. If it is evident there will be reflux. The nature
is so arranged that the entry is not visible. The entry is not evident. If it
were evident, the urine from the bladder can reflux back when it is full. The
mechanism is so arranged that it is not evident.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
So it is not like water dripping from a pipe?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
No. Because if the bladder is full the urine will be refluxed back to the
kidney. It never happens in a normal person. Only when the entrance is ruined
or damaged is there a reflux.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:

give you only the first jh»na because it is so gross. It is so gross that you
need initial application (vitakka) for your mind to be on the object, just as
you need a pole to keep a boat in a swift current. That is why you cannot get

is interesting. The mindfulness of<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†

other countries. Those who practice vipassan» meditation actually begin with
some kind of mindfulness on breathing meditation. One begins with keeping the
mind on the breath. Or as a variation of keeping the mind on the breath one
keeps the mind on the rising and falling movements of the abdomen. That is also
breathing meditation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

Purification, mindfulness of the breath is treated as tranquillity or serenity meditation
(samatha meditation) and not as vipassan» meditation. So the description that
follows, most of the description, is for tranquillity meditation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

different Suttas in the Sutta Pi‘aka or the Basket of Discourses. The author

development of mindfulness of breathing as a meditation subject. It has been
recommended by the Blessed One thus: ëAnd, bhikkhus, this concentration through
mindfulness of breathing, when developed and practiced much, is both peaceful
and sublime, it is an unadulterated blissful abiding, and it banishes at once
and stills evil unprofitable thoughts as soon as they ariseí.î That is from one

described by the Blessed One as having 16 bases thus (or 16 methods mentioned
in the Sutta): ëAnd how developed, bhikkhus, how practiced much is

objectí.), ever mindful, he breathes in; mindful he breathes out.î Here also we
should say ëeverí - ìever mindful he breathes in; ever mindful he breathes
out.î This is the basic practice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in each set. They deal with the three remaining kinds of foundations of
mindfulness. There are four foundations of mindfulness - contemplation on the
body, contemplation on the feelings, contemplation on consciousness, contemplation
on dhamma objects. The first four have to do with contemplation on the body.
The second four deal with feelings. The third four is contemplation on
consciousness and the fourth four is contemplation on dhamma objects. We will

peacefulness with kasi”a meditation or foulness meditation you have to do some
work before you get peacefulness. With kasi”a meditation you have to prepare a

also you have to look at a corpse and so on. Only after that do you get

Historically the Commentaries we now use were written at a monastery called
ëThe Great Monasteryí, in Anur»dhapura which is in Sri Lanka. At one time some
monks went away from The Great Monastery which was the central place of
learning for monks at that time. They divided themselves from The Great
Monastery. They founded two monasteries. One was to the north of The Great
Monastery and one I think was to the east of The Great Monastery. The large
stupas can still be seen in Anur»dhapura. ëUttara Monasteryí here means the
monastery called ëAbhayagirií. It is not known as Northern Monastery actually.
Northern Monastery is not the name. Since that monastery is located to the

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In paragraph 150 we have ìas soon as they
arise.î The P»ƒi word here is like saying ëeach and every one that arisesí. In
P»ƒi the word is repeated. That means something that arises and arises. It is
something like that. So here ìeach and every thought that arisesî. Here ëariseí
does not mean that it really arises, but it is in a latent state. There is a
potential for these unwholesome or unprofitable thoughts to arise. And so it is
explained by ìwhenever they are not suppressedî. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>There are three kinds of abandonment of
unwholesome mental states. The first one is by substitution. That means you
substitute something wholesome for something unwholesome. When you have
wholesome thoughts, you do not have unwholesome thoughts. That is abandoning by
substitution. We say it is momentary abandoning. Just for one moment you may
abandon the unwholesome thought. The next one is abandoning by suppression or
temporary abandoning. In that case the abandoning lasts longer than in the
first one. The last one is total cutting off, total eradication. That is the
last abandonment. So there are three kinds of abandoning. Here what is meant is
the second abandoning, abandoning by suppression. Here the meditation can
abandon or banish the unprofitable thoughts as they arise. That means not that
they really arise, but that they have the potential to arise. By the practice
of meditation their arising is blocked. They are not given chance to arise.
That is what is meant here. When unwholesome thoughts have arisen in us, then
it has arisen and we cannot do anything about that. Before arising we do not
let it arise. That is what is meant here although the word ëariseí is used.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

suppresses, at that very moment. Stills: it thoroughly calms; or else, when

partaking of penetration; it tranquilizes, is what is meant.î This or else in
the following mean the total cutting off or abandonment. Here a person reaches
the Noble Path. At the moment of Noble Path he is able to eradicate, cut off,
mental defilements or unprofitable thoughts all together. Here it is the total
cutting off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this: Bhikkhus in what way, in what manner, by what system, is concentration

ëbhikkhuí. In another Commentary, the Commentary to the Mah» Satipa‘‘h»na Sutta
(The Sutta on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness), it is stated that ëbhikkhuí
here does not necessarily mean an ordained monk, but anybody who practices
mindfulness meditation, anybody who follows the advice of the Buddha, anybody
who practices the teachings of the Buddha can be called a ëbhikkhuí. So in that
case a bhikkhu does not necessarily mean an ordained monk. Anybody who
practices meditation can be called a ëbhikkhuí. But since this book is for
bhikkhus, for monks, the commentator does not say anything about this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Buddha always addresses monks, they feel left out. They are not satisfied with
that. They do not like that. The Buddha speaks to monks and not to lay people
they think. You know, the Buddha lived with monks. So when he talked, he talked
mostly to monks. That does not mean that lay people are left out. ìHerein, here
bhikkhus, a bhikkhu means, bhikkhus, in this dispensation, a bhikkhu.î So here
it is a monk, but anybody who practices meditation, who follows the teachings
of the Buddha, can be called a monk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

supernormal knowledge of remembering past lives; then he saw people dying in

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The first one is from Abhidhamma. In
Abhidhamma it is said ìhaving gone out beyond the boundary postî. There are
gateposts outside the villages. That which is outside the gateposts is forest.
It may be very close to the village. Still it is called a ëforestí. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

That is about six feet. So five hundred multiplied by six is three thousand. In

forest explained in Abhidhamma and Vinaya. We came across this in the second

its language is different. The usage is a little different than in the Commentaries,

getting out of. Mindfulness is described here. Mindfulness must be
well-controlled and it must be getting out of opposition. ëOppositioní here

for such beings, the breathing in and out may be long. For small animals or
insects it may be very short. With regard to human beings we can understand by
way of time. Sometimes our breathing is long and sometimes our breathing is
short, long and short in time, because human beings are more or less of the

group of different parts. The breath also is a group of particles, small
particles of matter. So the breath is also called ëk»yaí. So the word ëk»yaí

going all through the body is according to this passage, then you are wrong.
This passage has to do with breathing meditation. ëBreathing meditationí means
meditation taking breathing as an object. If you look for sensations, if you
observe sensations, you are no longer watching the breath. So it is no longer
mindfulness of breathing meditation. It becomes another kind of contemplation
on the body or it may be contemplation on feeling. So in practice you can do
the sweeping of the body if you have attained a certain degree of concentration.

No. In breathing meditation as samatha meditation the object does not change.
You keep the mind at the tip of the nose and the object of the meditation is
the breath, the in-breath and out-breath. You donít pay attention to other
objects. You try to keep your mind on the object. Next week we will see how you
may count in one, out one, in two, out two and so on (in order to keep the mind

past this point, you try to see this as the beginning, middle and end of the
breath. It is like that. We cannot say that his passage means the whole body,

these three kinds of training, on that object, by means of that mindfulness, by

knowledge, and so on. Consequently the present tense is used here in the text:
He knows ëI breathe iní..he knows ëI breathe outíî He is just to know that he
is breathing in and breathing out, breathing in and breathing out. Just that.
But in this method he must apply himself or he must train himself. He must make
effort, special effort to make clear the beginning, middle and end of each
in-breath and out-breath. That is why the future tense is used - ìI shall
breathe in, I shall breathe out.î That means there is some effort involved
here, not just being mindful of in-breaths and out-breaths. In addition to
being mindful of in-breaths and out-breaths he has to know, to clearly see the

ëTranquilizing the bodily formationsí does not mean that you must deliberately
make the breath subtle. Actually you cannot do that. What is meant is just to
pay attention to the breath. When your mind calms down, the breath will become
more and more subtle. That is what is meant here. You cannot make them subtle
by breathing softly or something like that. That will come with practice. You
donít have to do it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

you know what that means? What is ëbodily formationí?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>The breath here is called ëbodily formationí.
That is why it is difficult to correctly understand in some places. The same
word is used and has different meanings. The P»ƒi word is ëk»ya sa~kh»raí. I
think you are familiar with the word ësa~kh»raí. ëK»ya sa~kh»raí is translated
as bodily formation. I donít know what ëformationí means. Is it the act of
forming or something which is formed? Or both?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Something that is formed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
Oh, something that is formed. Here it means something that is formed. ëBodily
formationí means bodily formed. That means the breath is said to be caused by
mind. There are four causes of material properties - kamma, mind, climate and
food. So mind is one of the causes of material properties. Breathing in and
breathing out is said to be caused by mind. Although breathing in and breathing
out is caused by mind, it needs the physical body to arise. If there is no
body, there can be no breathing at all. So it is described as formed by the
body. That means formed with the help of the body.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

in-breath and out-breath. For although it is consciousness-originated (although
it is caused by consciousness, mind), it is nevertheless called ëbodily
formationí since its existence is bound up with the <u>kamma</u>-<u>born</u>
body.î It is not ëkamma-born body. It is bound up with the physical body, not
necessarily kamma-born. So ìwith the physical body and it is formed with that
as the means.î If there is no physical body, there can be no breath at all. It
is said to be formed by, or made by, or maybe conditioned by the physical body.
So it is called ëbodily formationí.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
Is there any kind of body that is not kamma-born?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
There are material properties which are caused by kamma, for example the
sensitivity in the eye, sensitivity in the ear. They are caused by kamma. Voice
is caused by consciousness or mind as well as by some other causes. When a rock
hits against something, there is also noise. That is not caused by mind, but
when I speak, my voice is caused by mind. There are four causes of material
properties. Since breath is a material property, it must have a cause.
According to Abhidhamma it is caused by consciousness or is consciousness-originated.
Although it is caused by consciousness, it is not called ëconsciousness
formationí here, but it is called ëbodily formationí because it has to depend
upon the physical body for its arising. It is not necessarily kamma-born body,
but it is physical body.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Before we practice meditation or if we do
not practice meditation, our breathing is said to be gross. But when we sit
down and practice meditation and try to discern the breathing, then it becomes
more and more subtle. It will become so subtle the meditator has to investigate
whether it exists or not. Sometimes yogis are alarmed or afraid because they
say they that have stopped breathing. They are not sure that they are alive or
living at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The breathing is different from the other
objects of meditation like the kasi”as, the kasi”a disks, dead bodies and so
on. Other objects become clearer with the development of concentration. The
better your concentration becomes the clearer these objects or the images of
these objects become. It is the opposite with the breath. The better your
concentration, the more subtle the breath becomes and the more difficult it is
to see. You have to apply effort and understanding so that you do not lose it.
It will become so subtle that you will wonder whether you are breathing at all
or whether you have stopped breathing. It will reach such a state.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìWhy is that? Because previously at the time
when he has still not discerned (That means when he did not practice
meditation.) there is no concern in him, no reaction (ëNo reactioní means no
adverting, no thinking of that.) , no attention, no reviewing, to the effect
that ëI am [progressively] tranquilizing each grosser bodily formationí. But
when he has discerned, there is. So his bodily formation at the time when he
has discerned is subtle in comparison with that at the time when he has not.î
So the breathing becomes subtle, more and more subtle with the growth of
concentration. You do not have to make them subtle. You actually cannot make
them subtle, but you just keep your mind on the breath and try to discern it
thoroughly, to see clearly the beginning, the middle and the end of it. When
you reach the next stage, it will become very subtle. You do not make them
subtle, but they will become subtle. So you have to train yourself ìI shall
breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formationî, but not really tranquilizing.
They just become tranquil. They just become subtle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

given. ìIn discerning [the meditation subject the formation] is gross, and it
is subtle [by comparison] in the first jh»na access.î That means when you first
practice meditation, the breath is gross. When you reach to access
concentration, it becomes subtle. Then by comparison it is gross at that stage of
access concentration, but it is subtle at the stage of first jh»na. Then in the
first jh»na and the second jh»na access it is gross and in the second jh»na it
is subtle and so on. Grossness and subtlety are here compared with jh»na and
neighborhood of jh»na and next jh»na. So in the beginning it is gross. When you
reach the neighborhood concentration, it is subtle. Then at the neighborhood
concentration it is gross, and at the first jh»na it is subtle. Then at<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>the first jh»na it is gross and it is subtle at
the neighborhood of second jh»na. Then it is subtler in the second jh»na and so

concentration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

opinion of the D gha and Sa—yutta reciters. The second one is the opinion of
the Majjhima reciters. There is just a little difference. You know there are
Nik»ya or Collections - Collection of Long Suttas, Collection of Medium Suttas,
Collection of Miscellaneous or Kindred Suttas. There were monks who made
special study of one Collection. They may have some opinions that may be
different from those who specialize in another Collection. So there is
difference between these teachers or these reciters. So D gha and Sa—yutta
reciters think this way and Majjhima reciters think the other way. This was in

that you breathe out long. There are long breaths and short breaths. Then what?
Making clear the whole breath body. And then? Tranquilizing the breath body.

methods each. The first set is for beginners in the practice of mindfulness of

three are concerned with contemplation on feeling, contemplation on

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'> explained it in another way. You
count for some time and then you give up counting for some time. Then you pick
it up again. Then you give it up again and so on. He said that was what is
meant by making a break in the series. You may count in one, out one, in two,
out two, in three, out three, in four, out four, in five, out five. Then you
stop counting. Then again you begin counting in one, out one, in two, out two
and so on. That will make you confused about the series of counting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>So counting should not be below five nor
above ten and there should be no break in the middle. ìSo he should do his
counting without those faults.î<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìWhen counting, he should at first do it
slowly, [that is late].î I donít know where he got ëthat is lateí. It is put in
the square brackets so it is supposed to be from the Sub-Commentary. Maybe it
is Venerable ©»”amoliís addition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
Could it mean slowly or late in the sense that you are behind the count or you
are slightly anticipating the count? Sometimes people do that, getting into the
counting rather than the breath.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: I
think that just ëslowlyí makes sense here, rather than the word ëlateí because
here is shown a grain measurerís counting. When a grain measurer having filled
his measure says ìoneî and empties it and then refills it, he goes on saying
ìone, one, oneî. And there may be some rubbish or something and he has to pick
it up and throw it away, and while so doing, he may be saying ìone, oneî until
he reaches the second one. The same is true for two and so on. He may have to
do something and he may be saying ìtwo, two, twoî until he comes to the third. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìSo taking the in-breath or the out-breath,
whichever appears [most plainly], he should begin with ëone,oneí and count up
to ëten,tení, noting each as it occurs.î So the counting should be done: in one,
out one, in two, out two, in three, out three and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAs he does his counting in this way the
in-breaths and out-breaths become evident to him as they enter in and issue
out.î When they go in and come out, they become evident. They become clearer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThen he can leave off counting slowly, like
a grain measurer, and he can count quickly, as a cowherd does. For a skilled
cowherd takes pebbles his pocket and goes to the cow pen in the morning, whip
in handî and so on. What do you think of the counting of the cowherd here? I
think that in the beginning the breath only seems to be one. You say ìin, out,
in, out.î There seems to be only one breath. But when you have practiced for
some time, one breath may appear to you as a series of short breaths. That is
because one breath is a combination of small breaths. There are many breaths in
what is formerly known as one breath. In one in-breath you may count one, two,
three, four, five or something like that. I think that is what is meant here.
Otherwise the simile of the cowherd counting cows that go out of the pen at the
gate in groups, two at a time, three at a time - he may say three - but
breathing in and breathing out does not come in and go out in exactly the same
way as the cows. What is meant here I think is that formerly it seemed one
breath, but now it appears to you as many breaths. So you count in one, two,
three, four, five and going out one, two, three, four, five.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìSo he counts quickly ëthree,four,fiveí and
so up to ten. In this way the in-breaths, and out-breaths, which has already
become evident to him while he counted them in the former way, now keep moving
along quickly.î ëIn the former wayí is explained in the Sub-Commentary as ëin
the quick wayí, but that is not correct. In another Commentary it is explained
that ëin the former wayí means in the slow way. So ëin the former wayí means in
the slow way, counting like a grain measurer does.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

quickly, not apprehending them either inside or outside [the body], but

important.You do not go into the body or outside the body with the breaths, but
apprehend them just as they reach the nostril door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

three, four, five; one, two, three, four, five,
six..seven;..eight..nine;..tení.î Here also one may think it means that you
count one to five, then one to six, then one to seven, but I do not think that
is the case here. You may count one breath as one, two, three, four, five; or
one, two, three, four, five, six; or one, two, three, four, five, six, seven;
or as many as you can be aware of.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìFor as long as the meditation subject is
connected with counting, it is with the help of that very counting that the
mind becomes unified.î So counting is just to keep your mind on the breath and
to make it one-pointed or unified - ì just as a boat in a swift current is
steadied with the help of a rudder (or with the help of a pole).î<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìWhen he counts quickly, the meditation
subject becomes apparent to him as an <u>uninterrupted</u> process.î At this
stage the meditation has not reached the jh»na stage. Before reaching the jh»na
stage there are interruptions. Interruptions are unavoidable. In Abhidhamma we
learn that one thought process is followed by some moments of life-continuum
(bhava~ga). Then there is another thought process. So thought processes arise
and disappear in quick succession, but they are buffered by the arisings of
bhava~ga or life continuum. So it cannot be called ëuninterruptedí. It can be
uninterrupted only during the period of jh»na attainment. So it should say that
it appears to him as though it were an uninterrupted process. It is very close
to the uninterrupted stage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThen, knowing that it is proceeding
uninterruptedly, he can count quickly in the way just described, not discerning
the wind either inside or outside [the body]. For by<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>bringing his consciousness inside along with
the incoming breath it seems as if it were buffeted by the wind inside or
filled with fat.í That means his appears to be soiling or something like that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìBy taking his consciousness outside along
with the outgoing breath it gets distracted by the multiplicity of objects
outside.î That is why we have to keep the mind at the entrance of the nostrils
and not let it go into the body or outside the body.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìHowever, his development is successful when
he fixes his mindfulness on the place touched [ by the breaths] (That means the
tip of the nose or the upper lip.). That is why it was said above ëHe can count
quickly in the way just described, not discerning the wind either inside or
outsideí.î Strictly speaking in-breath and out-breath are said to be caused by
mind. In-breath and out-breath are the air element. The air element is caused
by kamma, caused by citta (mind), caused by climate (heat or cold), and caused
by food.The breath is said to be caused by mind. It is mind-generated.
Mind-generated material properties can only be found, only exist inside the
body and not outside. Here is the breath. When you exhale, you may feel that
the air goes out of the nose outside the body. As soon as it reaches outside
the body, it becomes generated by climate and not generated by mind. In order
to watch breathing in and breathing out closely our mind has to be here at the
tip of the nose or at the entrance of the nostril where they are really
mind-generated. After the out-breath leaves the tip of the nose, then it
becomes generated by climate or temperature. That is why the attention has to
be at the tip of the nose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìBut how long is he to go on counting?î Let
us say<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>a monk is practicing counting -
in one, out one, in two, out two and so on. ìUntil, without counting
mindfulness remains settled on the in-breaths and out-breaths as its object.î
So he is to count until he can concentrate on breathing only without counting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìFor counting is simply a device for
settling mindfulness on the in-breaths and out-breaths as object by cutting off
the external dissipation of applied thoughts.î That is vitakka. We call it
ëinitial applicationí. Initial application or applied thought has the tendency
to take mind out. In order to cut the distractions by applied thought one has
to keep the mind on the breath, on the object. This is the first stage. In the
first stage you do counting. You do this counting until you can concentrate
fully on the breaths without counting. It may take days, weeks, or maybe
months.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Now the second one. It is called
ëconnectioní, but I think ëconnectioní is not so accurate. It is following. The
P»ƒi word means following.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>That is also
a little misleading because ëfollowingí does not mean to follow the breath into
the body or outside the body, but just to be mindful of the breath. Still it is
called ëfollowingí in P»ƒi.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†</span>ìConnection (anugamana) is the uninterrupted
following of the in-breaths and out-breaths with mindfulness after counting has
been given up.î So when you can be on the breaths without counting, you give up
counting. At that moment you begin the second stage, connection or following.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAnd that is not following after the

beginning, the middle and the end of the out-breath and in-breath are described
here. For the out-breath the navel is the beginning, the heart is the middle,
and the tip of the nose is the end. For the in-breath the tip of the nose is
the beginning, the heart is its middle, and the navel is its end.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

quotation from the Pa‘isambhid»magga. This quotation is important because with
the help of this quotation we decide which is meant by ass»sa and pass»sa in
P»ƒi. Last week we found that the P»li words ëass»saí and ëpass»saí are
interpreted differently by different Commentators.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Here is the quotation from that book by the
Venerable S»riputta. It is as authorative as the words of the Buddha.
&quot;When he goes in with mindfulness after the beginning, middle and end of
the in-breath, his mind being distracted <u>internally</u>î - this word
ëinternallyí shows that the word used here means in-breath and not out-breath.
So it is correctly translated here. There is no problem here. But if you read
the P»ƒi, then you may be doubtful as to whether the word ëass»saí means the
in-breath or the out-breath. When you read this passage, you come to the
conclusion that ëass»saí must mean in-breath. It says after the beginning,
middle and end of let us say ëAí, his mind being distracted internally - when
you say the word ëinternallyí, the ëAí must mean in-breath. It cannot mean
out-breath. This is the quotation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Now it says 3-4. Actually it is not with
3-4. Here comes the overlapping or combination of two or three stages at the
same moment. ìSo when he gives attention to it by connection, he should do so
not by the beginning, middle and end (That means not following after the
beginning, middle and end) but rather by touching and fixing.î<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThere is no attention to be given to it by
touching separate from fixing as there is by counting separate from
connection.î So when we do counting and connection, there are two separate
(modes) of attention - attention to counting and attention to the breath. But
with regard to touching and fixing there are no separate (modes) of attention
apart from counting and from connection.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìBut when he is counting the breaths in the
place touched by each, he is giving attention to them by counting and
touching.î When you are counting, you are doing two stages at the same time -
counting and touching. ëTouchingí here means keeping your mind at the place
where the breath touches, where you feel the breath.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìWhen he has given up counting and is
connecting them by means of absorption, then he is said to be giving his
attention to them by connection, touching and fixing.îSo you give up counting
and are just mindful of the breaths as they come and go. At that moment there
can be connection and touching. When you reach the stage of neighborhood
concentration and jh»na concentration, then you are doing three at the same time
- connection, touching and fixing. So these two stages are not to be separated
from counting and connection.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAnd the meaning of this may be understood
through the simile of the man who cannot walk and the gate-keeper given in the
Commentaries, and through the simile of the saw given in the Pa‘isambhid».î<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìHere is the simile of the man who cannot
walk: just as a man unable to walk, who is rocking a swing for the amusement of
his children and their mother, sits at the foot of the swing post and sees both
ends and the middle of the swing plank successively coming and going yet does
not move from his place in order to see both ends and the middle, so too, when
a bhikkhu places himself with mindfulness, as it were, at the foot of the post
for anchoring [mindfulness] and rocks the swing of the in-breaths and
out-breaths; he sits down with mindfulness on the sign at that same place, and
follows with mindfulness the beginning, middle and end of the in-breaths and
out-breaths at the place touched by them as they come and go; keeping his mind
fixed there, he then sees them without moving from his place in order to see
them. This is the simile of the man who cannot walk.î He is aware of the
beginning, middle and end of the in-breaths and out-breaths, but his attention
is on the breaths and not the beginning, middle and end. He cannot help but be
aware of the beginning, middle and end, but he does not pay attention to them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The next simile is the same, the
gate-keeper. The gate-keeper is only interested in people who are at the gate
and not those who have gone inside the city or who have gone outside the city.
He is interested only in those people who are at the gate. ìSo too, the
incoming breaths that have gone inside and the outgoing breaths that have gone
outside are not this bhikkhuís concern, but they are his concern each time they
arrive at the [nostril] gate itself.î So only when they reach the nostril gate,
do they become the object of his mindfulness. This is the simile of the
gate-keeper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Next is the simile of the saw. It is more
evident in this simile that he pays attention to or keeps his attention at the
entrance of the nostrils. He pays attention to the breaths only when they reach
that place, that entrance, not going with the breath inside the body or outside
the body.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

second paragraph ì The manís mindfulness is established by the sawís teeth

have come and have gone. The sawís teeth are not the point where they touch the
log. They have gone this way or that way. That is what is meant. It is not ëas
they approach and recedeí, but it is the sawís teeth that are not at the point
of touching the log or those that have gone the other way. ìThough they are not

approach and recedeí because he must pay attention as they approach and recede,
as they come and go. But he is not to pay attention to those that have gone
into the body or to those that have gone out of the body. ìThough they are not

are used in a different sense here. ì ëEffortí: what is effort? The body and
mind of one who is energetic becomes wieldy - this is effort.î The mind and
body becoming wieldy is said to be effort here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìWhat is he task? Imperfections come to be

when your mind gets stilled, then your body also gets stilled and your breath

different from the other objects of meditation. For the other objects of

lost the breath. But he must catch the breath at the place where he formerly
caught the breaths. Instead of leaving the place, you stay stuck to the place
and let the breaths become clear again. That is what is meant here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThese are the means for doing it.î When you
think you have lost the breaths there are some things to do. ì ëWhere do these
in-breaths and out-breaths exist? Where do they not? In whom do they exist? In
whom not?í Then, as he considers thus, he finds that they do not exist in one
inside the motherís womb.î This is what is believed in those days. There are
seven kinds of people that do not breathe - the child in the motherís womb,
those drowned in water (those who have drowned), or likewise in unconscious
beings (those who have become unconscious), or it can mean those who are reborn
as mindless beings (It is explained in both ways in the Sub-Commentary.), in
the dead (Dead people donít breathe.), or in those who attain to fourth jh»na
(When a person attains the fourth jh»na, there is no breathing.) , or in those
born into a fine material or immaterial existence (That is those reborn as
brahmas. Brahmas do not breathe.) , or to those attained to cessation of
perception and feeling. There is an attainment called ëattainment of
cessationí. Actually it is cessation of mind. During that attainment the mental
activities are temporarily stopped or they are suspended as long the person
wishes. It may be one day, two days, or at most seven days. So there are these
seven kinds of beings who have no breath. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>So he should review this ìSo he should
apostrophize himself thus: ëYou with all your wisdom are certainly not inside a
motherís womb or drowned in water.î You are not any one of those seven persons.
There must be breath. So you are not without breath. ìThose in-breaths and
out-breaths are actually existent in you, only you are not able to discern them
because your understanding is dull.î Actually your understanding is sharp at
that time, but since you cannot be aware of the breath, your wisdom or pa““» is
said to be dull at that moment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThen, fixing his mind on the place normally
touched [by the breaths], he should proceed to give his attention to that.î
When you have lost the breath, you go to the same place where you have caught
it before and try to wait for it there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThese in-breaths and out-breaths occur
striking the tip of the nose in a long-nosed man.î So if you have a long nose,
they strike at the tip of the nose. If you have a short nose, the breath
strikes at the upper lip of a short-nosed man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìSo he should fix the sign thus: ëThis is
the place where they strikeí. This was why the Blessed One said: ëBhikkhus, I
do not say of one who is forgetful, who is not fully aware, [that he practices]
development of mindfulness of breathingí.î That means if you are forgetful, if
you do not have good mindfulness, you cannot practice mindfulness of breathing
meditation. Your understanding has to be sharp. Here the Buddha said if you are
forgetful, if you are not fully aware, you cannot practice mindfulness
meditation, mindfulness of breathing meditation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>But the Commentator said: ìAlthough any
meditation subject, no matter what, is successful only in one who is mindful
and fully aware, yet any meditation subject other than this one gets more
evident as he goes on giving it his attention. But this mindfulness of
breathing is difficult, difficult to develop, a field in which only the minds
of Buddhas, Pacceka Buddhas and Buddhasí sons are at home. It is no trivial
matter, nor can it be cultivated by trivial persons. In proportion as continued
attention is given to it, it becomes more peaceful and subtle. So strong
mindfulness and understanding are necessary here.î Stronger mindfulness and
understanding are needed in the practice of mindfulness of breathing meditation
than in the practice of other kinds of meditation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìJust as when doing needlework on a piece of
fine cloth a fine needle is needed, and a still finer instrument for boring the
needleís eye, so too, when developing this meditation subject, which resembles
fine cloth, both mindfulness, which is the counterpart of the needle, and the
understanding associated with it, which is the counterpart of the instrument
for boring the needleís eye, need to be strong. A bhikkhu must have the
necessary mindfulness and understanding and must look for the in-breaths and
out-breaths nowhere else than the place normally touched by them.î By just
keeping the mind at the place where they touched before, he waits for the
breathing to become evident again. Then there is a simile of a ploughman. Let
us skip that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Paragraph 214 ìWhen he does so in this way,
the sign soon appears to him.î He perseveres in keeping the mind at the tip of
the nose, and so the breathing becomes evident to him again. Then he dwells on
that sign or that breathing continuously, and so soon appears the sign of
different kinds. ìBut it is not the same for all.î The sign does not appear in
the same way for all. For one person one kind of sign will appear and for the
other person another sign will appear. There is not one sign, but many forms of
the sign.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìBut it is not the same for all; on the
contrary, some say that when it appears it does so to certain people producing
a light touch like cotton or silk-cotton or a draught. But this is the
exposition given in the commentaries: it appears to some like a star or a
cluster of gems or a cluster of pearls, to others with a rough touch like that
of silk-cotton seeds or a peg made of heartwood.î That is what some meditators
feel. They feel like something is put in the nostrils. It may even feel
difficult to breathe. ìTo others (it seems) like a long braid string or a
wreath of flowers or a puff of smoke, to others like a stretched-out cobweb or
a film of cloud or a lotus flower or a chariot wheel or the moonís disk or the
sunís disk.î Any kind of sign can appear to a person. When my father practiced
this meditation, he said the sign was like a sheet of silver. Any one of those
mentioned here or those not mentioned here may appear to a meditator. Anything
can appear as the sign of this meditation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìIn fact this resembles an occasion when a
number of bhikkhus are sitting together reciting a Suttanta. When a bhikkhu
asks ëWhat does this Sutta appear like to you?í, one says ëIt appears to me
like a great mountain torrentí, another ëTo me it is like a line of forest
treesí.î and so on. Depending on different persons there can be multiplicity or
great variety of these signs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìSimilarly this single meditation subject
appears differently because of difference in perception. It is born of
perception, its source is perception, it is produced by perception. Therefore
it should be understood that when it appears differently it is because of
difference in perception.î People have different outlooks or different notions,
so the sign appears differently to different people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAnd here, the consciousness that has
in-breath as its object is one, the consciousness that has out-breath as its
object is another, and the consciousness that has the sign as its object is
another.î This you know from Abhidhamma. Consciousness can only take one object
at a time. Consciousness that takes in-breath as object is one. And then
consciousness that takes the out-breath is another. So they are different.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAnd the consciousness that has the sign as
its object is another. For the meditation subject reaches neither absorption
nor even access in one who has not got these three things [clear] (who does not
see clearly the in-breath, the out-breath, and the sign). But it reaches access
and also absorption in one who has got these three things [clear].î<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

the meditator do? ìThe bhikkhu should go to the teacher and tell him ëVenerable
sir, such and such has appeared to meí. But [say the D gha Reciters] the
teacher should say neither ëThis is the signí nor ëThis is not the signí; after
saying ëIt happens like this, friendí.î The teacher should just say that it
happens like this. The teacher should not say that this is the sign or that
this is not the sign. That is what the D gha Reciters think.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìHe should tell him ëGo on giving it
attention again and againí; for if he were told ìIt is the signí, he might
[become complacent and] stop short at that.î That means the sign is difficult
to get. If the teacher says that he has the sign, the student might think ìOh,
Iíve got what s difficult to get and so I may slow down a little. I can
practice any time I like.î He may think something like that. ìAnd if he were
told ëIt is not the signí, he might get discouraged and give up; so he should
encourage him to keep giving it his attention without saying either. So the
D gha Reciters say, firstly.î<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ëD gha recitersí means the reciters of the
Long Discourses. You know there are Collections of Long Discourses, Middle
Length Discourses, Kindred Discourses and The Gradual Sayings. There are monks
who do special study of the Long Discourses. Other monks make special study of
the Middle Length Discourses and so on. The D gha Reciters say like this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìBut the Majjhima Reciters (those who make
special study of The Middle Length Sayings) say that he should be told ëThis is
the sign, friend. Well done. Keep giving attention to it again and againí.î
They thought there is no reason for a meditator to be discouraged or to be
complacent when he knows that he has got the sign. He practices meditation just
to attain to the jh»na stage and later on for the attainment of enlightenment.
When the teacher says ìIt is the signî, then he must be encouraged. So it is
good according to the Majjhima Reciters to tell the student that it is the
sign.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

sign as to its color, or review it as to its [specific] characteristic.î This
is because if he gives attention to its color, it will become a color
meditation and not breathing meditation. If he reviews it as to its
characteristic, it will become another kind of meditation rather than
mindfulness of breathing meditation. He should not pay attention to its color
or its characteristic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìHe should guard it as carefully as a kingís
chief queen guards the child in her womb due to become a Wheel-turning

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

absorption (Ch.4,42) and bring about evenness of energy.î That means evenness

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAs he strives thus, fourfold and fivefold
jh»na is achieved by him on that same sign in the same way as described under
the earth kasi”a.î So jh»na arises in him. Then from first jh»na he would go to
second, third, fourth and fifth jh»nas. During the moments of jh»na the mind is
very fixed, very still. This is the fourth stage, fixing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

observing. What is observing? Observing is insight is what is explained there.

mindfulness of breathing meditation as a samatha meditation. He got to the
jh»na stage. After that it will become vipassana» meditation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

upon insight by defining mentality-materiality. How?î<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Since he has jh»na, he makes the jh»na the
basis for his vipassan» meditation. He enters into jh»na. Then after emerging
from jh»na, he concentrates on the jh»na. First he embarks on insight by
defining mentality and materiality - defining this is mind, this is matter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìOn emerging from the attainment, he sees
that the in-breaths and out-breaths have the physical body and the mind as
their origin (because they are caused by mind); and that just as, when a blacksmithís
bellows are being blown, the wind moves owing to the bag and to the manís
appropriate effort, so too, in-breaths and out-breaths are due to the body and
the mind.î<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìNext, he defines the in-breaths and
out-breaths and the body as ëmaterialityí, and the consciousness and the states
associated with the consciousness as the ëimmaterialí [mind].î Do you know why
it is stated here, why it is given here? Because real vipassan» begins with
discerning mind and matter clearly. One must be able to see, not just guess, to
see clearly mind and matter through meditation. First we need concentration.
Then after concentration of mind comes the discerning of mind and matter. This
is the actual beginning of vipassan» meditation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìHaving defined mentality-materiality in
this way, he seeks its condition.î From the stage of discerning mentality and
materiality he progresses to the stage of seeing their conditions, or seeing
that they are conditioned, seeing their causes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>ìWith search he finds it and so overcomes his
doubts about the way of mentality-materialityís occurrence in the three
divisions of time.î That means the breath and the body are materiality, and
mindfulness and others are mentality. They are not uncaused or they are not
unconditioned. The breath is conditioned by mind. The consciousness and mental
factors are conditioned by each other and are also conditioned by the material
base and so on. The next stage is seeing the conditionality of things actually,
seeing the conditions of mind and matter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìHis doubts being overcome, he attributes
the three characteristics<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>[beginning
with that of suffering to mentality and materiality], comprehending [them] by
groups; he abandons the ten imperfections of insight beginning with
illumination, which arise in the first stages of the Contemplation of Rise and
Fall, and he defines as ëthe pathí the knowledge of the way that is free from
these imperfections.î This is a very brief description of the stages of
vipassan» meditation. They will be treated in detail in succeeding chapter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>After discerning conditions he discerns
what? The three characteristics - impermanence, suffering and insubstantiality.
So these three characteristics he comes to see.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìHe reaches Contemplation of Dissolution by
abandoning [attention to] arising.î At the early stage of seeing arising and
falling the impediments come in, the impediments to the progress of vipassan» -
seeing lights, feeling very happy and so on. When they arise, a yogi may think
that he has attained enlightenment. If he thinks in this way, he will not make
effort to reach higher stages. He must understand that these are not the way to
enlightenment. They are just obstacles. He has to overcome these obstacles.
When he has overcome these obstacles, he reaches the higher stages of
discerning rising and falling. So there are two stages in the discernment of
rising and falling, the lower stage and the higher stage. After reaching the
lower stage the ten impediments occur in the yogi. After conquering these ten
impediments he reaches the higher stage of discerning rise and fall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>From there he reaches another stage where he
sees only the falling, only the dissolution, only the disappearing of things.
Only the dissolution of things appears to him clearly. That is the contemplation
of dissolution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìHe reaches Contemplation of Dissolution by
abandoning [attention to] arising. When all formations have appeared as terror
owing to the contemplation of their incessant dissolution.î After that he sees
them as dangerous, as dangers. He is not afraid of them; he does not fear them.
Still he sees them as dangerous. It is different. Sometimes you are not afraid
of something, but you recognize it as dangerous. Here a yogi does not get
afraid of them. If he gets afraid of them, then he has akusala in him and not
meditation. When he sees things just disappearing, disappearing, disappearing,
he comes to see danger in disappearing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>After that he becomes dispassionate towards
them. When you see something is dangerous, you are not attached to it. You want
to get away from it. So he becomes dispassionate towards them. ìHis greed for
them fades away, and he is liberated from them.î ëLiberated from themí means he
has gotten rid of attachment, anger and delusion and has become enlightened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAfter he has [thus] reached the Four Noble
Paths in due succession and has become established in the Fruition of
Arahantship, he at last attains to the 19 kinds of Reviewing Knowledge.î After
the attainment of each stage of enlightenment there is what we call ëreviewingí
- reviewing the Path, reviewing Fruit, reviewing Nibb»na, reviewing the mental
defilements that have been eradicated and reviewing the mental defilements
which remain. There are five kinds of reviewing after the first stage, second
stage and third stage. But at the fourth stage, after becoming an Arahant,
there are only four kinds of reviewing.There are no mental defilements
remaining. For the Arahants there are only four kinds of reviewing - reviewing
of Path, Fruit, Nibb»na and defilements eradicated. So all together we have 19
kinds of reviewing knowledge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAnd he becomes fit to receive the highest
gifts from the world with its deities.î A<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†

meditation and gets jh»na. Then making that jh»na the basis for vipassan»
meditation, he practices vipassan» meditation and gradually reaches the stage
of Arahant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAt this point his development of
concentration through mindfulness of breathing, beginning with counting and

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In the stages ëobservingí means vipassan».

he is knowing happiness, he is knowing p ti at that moment. So that means at
the time of reaching jh»na happiness or p ti is said to be known clearly by way
of the object. That means because the object is clearly known at that time,
because the object is known, p ti is also known. It is not that p ti becomes
the object of jh»na. By way of the object itself we can say that p ti is also
known.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

heading of the object. The happiness included in the jh»na that has the object
is experienced ëbecause of the experiencing of the objectí. What is meant? Just
as, when a man who is looking for a snake discovers its abode, the snake is, as
it were, already discovered and caught, owing to the ease with which he will
then be able to catch it with charms and spells.î He has not yet caught the

the happiness itself is experienced too, owing to the ease with which it will
be apprehended in its specific and general characteristics.î ëSpecific
characteristicí means its characteristic which is not shared by other mental
states. ëGeneral characteristicí means its characteristic of impermanence,
suffering and no-soul nature. So when the object is clearly seen, p ti is also
said to be clearly seen. That is what is meant here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

entering upon and emerging from one of the two jh»nas accompanied by happiness,
he comprehends with insight that happiness associated with the jh»na as liable
to destruction and to fall, then at the actual time of the insight the
happiness is experienced with (by way of) non-confusion owing to the
penetration of its characteristics.î That is when he practices vipassan»
meditation on it. First he enters into the first or second jh»na. He emerges
from it. Then he takes the happiness of the jh»na factors as an object of
meditation and contemplates on it as impermanent, suffering and soulless. At
that moment he really clearly sees the happiness. ëNon-confusioní means he sees
it as it is - as impermanent, as suffering, as soulless and not otherwise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

difference here. The experiencing of bliss (sukha) must be to be through three
jh»nas.î Sukha is present in first jh»na, second jh»na and third jh»na. So here
it says ìthrough three jh»nas and that of mental formations through four.î What
is ëmental formationí here? We donít have to ask because it is explained. ìThe
mental formation consists of the two aggregates of feeling and perception.î
Here ëmental formationí means feeling and perception. So feeling and perception
are called ëmental formationí or ëcitta sa~kh»raí because they arise only when
consciousness arises. They depend upon consciousness for their arising. They
are said to be conditioned by citta, by consciousness or mind. ëMental formationí
really means mind-formed, or formed by, or conditioned by consciousness. Here
ëconditioned by consciousnessí is made to mean feeling and perception.
ëExperiencing the mental formationí means experiencing feeling and perception.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

bliss, it is said in the Pa‘isambhid» in order to show the plane of insight
here [as well]: ëBliss, there are two kinds of bliss, bodily bliss and mental
blissí. Tranquilizing the mental formation: tranquilizing the gross mental
formation; stopping it, is the meaning.î So there is experiencing bliss and
tranquilizing formations. In the first jh»na, second jh»na, third jh»na there
is sukha. During those jh»nas a person is said to experience bliss.
ëTranquilizing the gross mental formationí means tranquilizing the gross
feeling and perception.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

feeling is stated in its own form.î The P»ƒi words are ëp tispatisamvedií and
ësukhapatisamvedií. In the clause p tipatisamvedi, that is experiencing
happiness feeling is stated under the heading of happiness. Although it is says
ëhappinessí, we are to understand it to mean feeling. Do you know why he is
saying this here? Because this second tetrad has to do with contemplation on
feeling. Although it says ëexperiencing happinessí, the real thing is clearly
understanding or clearly knowing feeling. Feeling is described here under the
heading of happiness (p tŸ).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>The real

ëexperiencing blissí means experiencing the feeling. ëíExperiencing happinessí
(p ti) also means experiencing feeling. Experiencing bliss (sukha) is stated in
its own form, not under any other thing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

formations - although ëmental formationí means feeling and perception, here it
is made to mean feeling accompanied by perception. Actually it is the same
thing. It is feeling accompanied by or associated with perception. That is why
this tetrad has to do with contemplation on feeling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

clause where it is said that he is aware of p ti which is not feeling, but it
is included in the feeling contemplation. So he explained that although the
word ëp tií is mentioned, but we must understand feeling, not p ti. The second
tetrad has to do with the contemplation on feelings. This second tetrad can
only be practiced after one gets jh»nas. In order to understand this you have
to understand that the first jh»na, second jh»na are accompanied by p ti and
the third jh»na is accompanied by sukha. The fourth jh»na also is accompanied

concentration there is this momentary concentration. This is as good as the
neighborhood concentration. Concentration lasting for only a moment, that is

beginning he may have wandering of mind, going out here and there. He has to
bring it back to the main object again and again. Then a time will come with
practice when this wandering comes less frequently until it will not come at
all. The mind will not be distracted at all. Or even when there is distraction
the meditator will catch it right away. He will not be carried away by the
wandering or stray thoughts for ten seconds, twenty seconds and so on. That is
the time when the meditator is said to have gained the momentary concentration.
That means the mind is on the main object for a long time. And even if there is
wandering mind the meditator is able to catch it, is able to be mindful of it
as soon as it goes out. Sometimes you will be able to stop it before it goes
out. The moment it is about to go out, you are aware. So you can stop it before
it goes out. Such a time is called the time that a person has reached momentary
concentration. Momentary concentration is important in vipassan» meditation. It
is the counterpart of neighborhood or access concentration in samatha
meditation. With that concentration mind is concentrated. It arises through the
penetration of the characteristics of impermanence and so on. The mind is on
mind and matter and on their impermanent nature and others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

liberates the mind from hindrances. That is because if there are hindrances in

dissolution by its means sees under the heading of consciousness (He is

say ëformationsí, we mean everything in the world. Everything which is formed,
everything which is conditioned is called ëformationí here. The P»ƒi word is
sa~kh»ra. The meaning of sa~kh»ra is made by causes or produced by causes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

opposite of what is formed, namely Nibb»na, it enters into that Nibb»na.

impermanent is contemplation of impermanence and contemplation of something as
impermanent is also called ëcontemplation of impermanenceí. The P»ƒi word,
following the sequence in P»ƒi, is impermanence contemplation. ëImpermanence

something as impermanent. In fact they mean the same thing, but it is how words

wrong view should be regarded as included under the heading of perception.î In
the Commentary it is stated as ëfrom the perception of permanenceí. ëFrom the

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Let us go to the last tetrad paragraph 234.
Here contemplating impermanence - in connection with this phrase the author
gives us what it is that is impermanent, what is impermanence, what is the
contemplation of impermanence, and what is the one who contemplates
impermanence. There are four things differentiated here. The first is the
impermanent. What is the impermanent? The answer is the five aggregates. The five
aggregates are those that are impermanent because their essence is rise and
fall, and change. Their essence or their nature is to rise, to fall and to
change.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìImpermanence is the rise and fall and
change in those same aggregates.î Why do we say that the aggregates are
impermanent? Because these aggregates arise, disappear and they change.
Arising, disappearing and change is something by which we know that they are
impermanent. That is why they are called ëimpermanentí here. They rise, and
fall, and change.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìOr it is their non-existence after having
been.î That means disappearing after coming into being. Everything comes into
being and then disappears.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThe meaning is, it is the break-up of
produced aggregates through their momentary dissolution since they do not
remain in the same mode.î I am a little concerned about the word ëmomentaryí. I
looked it up in the dictionary. It has at least two meanings. The first one,
the first meaning is just for a moment. The other meaning of momentary is at every
moment or moment to moment. Here moment to moment is meant. But when we say
ëmomentary unification of mindí we mean for a short time. So there is a
difference between the ëmomentaryí used in one sentence and the ëmomentaryí
used in the other sentence. So in the expression ëmomentary unification of
mindí we mean lasting only for a moment. But here ëmomentary dissolutioní means
moment to moment dissolution, dissolving at every moment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìContemplation of impermanence is
contemplation of materiality, etc., as ëimpermanentí in virtue of that
impermanence. One contemplating impermanence possesses that contemplation. So
it is when one such as this is breathing in and breathing out that it can be
understood of him ëHe trains thus: I shall breathe in..shall breathe out
contemplating impermanenceí.î The person is the one who possesses contemplation
of impermanence. So the impermanent, impermanence, contemplation of
impermanence, and the one who possesses contemplation of impermanence - four
things are differentiated here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Footnote 65 ìWhat is called ëpermanentí is
what is lasting, eternal, like Nibb»na. What is called ëimpermanentí is what is
not permanent, and is possessed of rise and fall. He said ëthe five aggregates
are impermanentí, signifying that they are formed dhammas as to <u>meaning</u>.î
It should be ëformed dhammas as to realityí, not meaning. According to reality
they are formed dhammas, they are conditioned dhammas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

ëatthatoí means in reality. So ìthey are formed dhammas as to reality or in
realityî, not as to meaning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

coming to be after non-existence, their acquisition of an individual self
(ëIndividual selfí means just something like identity. It is not self with a
capital S.), is ëriseí. Their momentary cessation when arisen is ëfallí. Their
changedness due to aging is ëchangeí.î This is the explanation of the words.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

means going toward dissolution. That means the middle phase of existence.), in
other words, presence, which is what the term of common usage ëagingí refers

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

ëbreak in the objectí? When one misunderstands one word, then one does not
understand the whole sentence. He misunderstood the P»ƒi word ëbhedaí. ëBhedaí
can mean dissolution or break. It can also mean difference. What is meant here
is difference, difference in the thing. There are three submoments for one big
moment - the arising, going towards dissolution, and dissolution. There are
three submoments. During these three submoments one dhamma is said to be
existing. The third submoment is different from the first submoment. At the
third submoment which is different from the first submoment there is no
difference in the thing. The thing is still existing. A given thing, a given
dhamma must exist for these three submoments. At the first submoment or at the
last submoment the thing is the same. There is no difference in the thing. In
the same way there is no difference in the thing at the middle stage. This is
what the Sub-Commentary is telling us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìFor just as when the occasion of arising
dissolves and the occasion of dissolution [succeeds it] there is no <u>break</u>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

dhamma is meant, which is called ëmomentary agingí. And without any reservation
there must be no <u>break</u> (It should be difference.) in the object between
the occasions of arising and dissolution, otherwise it follows that one thing
arises and another dissolves.î One thing exists for three submoments. The third
submoment is different from the first submoment. And the second submoment is
also different from the first submoment and the third submoment. Although the
submoments are different the thing is the same because it is existing for these
three submoments. There should be no difference of object between the moments
of arising, aging and disappearing. This is what the Sub-Commentary is telling
us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
So this is a theoretical construct about how you analyze moments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
Yes, and how we explain moment to moment dissolution. According to Abhidhamma
that which has three submoments of existence is real. Otherwise it is not real.
So concepts are said not to possess these three phases of existence. We do not
know when they come into being and when they dissolve. So they have no essence
of their own, no existence of their own. Concept exists only in our minds, but
not in reality. What is real according to Abhidhamma is that which has three
phases of existence. That is why consciousness is real, mental states are real,
and material properties are real. Nibb»na is real also. Nibb»na is real, but it
has no beginning or end. So it is different from the other three.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Paragraph 235 ìContemplating fading away:
there are two kinds of fading away, that is, fading away as destruction, and
absolute fading away. Herein, fading away as destruction is the momentary
dissolution of formations.î Moment to moment dissolution of formations is
called ëfading away as destructioní or ëdissolutioní.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ì ëAbsolute fading awayí is Nibb»na.
Contemplation of fading away is insight and it is the Path (So both insight and
Path are meant here.), which occur as the seeing of these two.î So
contemplating<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>of fading away can be at
the vipassan» moments as well as at the Path moment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìContemplating relinquishment:
relinquishment is of two kinds too, that is to say, relinquishment as giving

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

contemplation is ëcontemplation of relinquishmentí. (This is the word
explanation.) For insight is called both ërelinquishment as giving upí and
ërelinquishment as entering intoí since [firstly] through substitution of
opposite qualities it gives up defilements.î Now here there is a little
inaccuracy. He gives up defilements together with resultant aggregates and the
aggregate producing kamma formations. There are three things - defilements,
resultant aggregates and aggregate producing kamma formations. These three
things are abandoned, relinquished. It is through substitution of opposites. Sometimes
people want to be literal when translating and that makes it a little more
difficult to understand. ësubstitution of opposite qualitiesí simply means
momentary abandonment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>At this moment you donít have attachment in
your mind or you donít have anger in your mind. You are substituting wholesome
states for unwholesome states. So long as the wholesome states are in your
mind, there will be no unwholesome states. This kind of abandonment is called
ësubstitution of oppositesí. In fact it is what is popularly known as momentary
abandonment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>There are three kinds of abandonment -
momentary, temporary, and absolute. Temporary abandonment comes when we get
jh»nas. During jh»nas the mental defilements can be put away for some time.
Their abandonment remains longer than the momentary abandonment. Since the
jh»nas cannot abandon the defilements absolutely or all together, they come
back when there are conditions for them. The third kind of abandonment occurs
at the moment of enlightenment, at the moment of Magga. That is the total
destruction of defilements so that they will not come back again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Here the first one is meant through the
substitution of opposite qualities. We say that vipassan» abandons mental
defilements. Vipassan» abandons mental defilements by the first way. It is just
momentary abandonment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ì[Firstly] through substitution of opposite
qualities it gives up defilements together with resultant aggregates with their
aggregate producing kamma formations, and [secondly], through seeing the
wretchedness of what is formed, it also enters into Nibb»na by inclining
towards Nibb»na, which is the opposite of the formed.î Vipassan» is here called
ëgiving upí and ëentering intoí let us say. ëGiving upí means momentarily
giving up defilements, their resultant aggregates, and then aggregate producing
kamma formations. Then it is said to enter into Nibb»na. You know that
vipassan» cannot take Nibb»na as object. Vipassan» takes formations as object.
So here what we are to understand is ìthrough seeing the wretchedness of what
is formedî - actually vipassan» sees the wretchedness of formations. ìIt also
enters into Nibb»na by inclining towards Nibb»na.î So when you see the
wretchedness of formations, you want to go to the other thing which is
unformed, which has no wretchedness of any kind. Vipassan» is said to enter
Nibb»na, but not actually. Vipassan» cannot take Nibb»na as object.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAlso the Path is called both relinquishment
as giving up defilements and relinquishment as entering into since it gives up
defilements together with resultant aggregates with their aggregate producing
kamma formations by cutting them off (That means by abandoning them all
together.), and it enters into Nibb»na by it its object.î When Magga arises it
takes Nibb»na as its object. The Path or Magga is called both ëgiving upí and
ëentering intoí.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span

can also be called relinquishing. Then we have no samatha in this case because

attainments of jh»na, and only after that one can change over to vipassan». The

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
It is not necessary to go through jh»na, right?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
Yes, thatís right. It is not necessary to go through jh»nas. Many modern
authors tend to de-emphasize jh»nas. One author says that since the jh»nas are
not mentioned in the ån»p»”asati Sutta, they are not important. But when we
study a Sutta, we have to follow the tradition. The tradition or the
Commentaries explain these four tetrads as dealing with samatha and vipassan»,
with jh»na and vipassan». Four jh»nas are mentioned in the Mah» Satipa‘‘h»na
Sutta although they are not mentioned in the ån»p»”asati Sutta. There are two
Suttas in the whole P»ƒi Canon that deal with breathing meditation and
mindfulness meditation. In the ån»p»”asati Sutta no jh»nas are mentioned. These
passages are from that Sutta. These passages however are explained with
reference to jh»nas and vipassan» in the ancient Commentaries. So you cannot
say that you do not find jh»nas in these two Suttas. In the ån»p»”asati Sutta
jh»nas are not mentioned explicitly, but they are implied. In the Mah»
Satipa‘‘h»na Sutta jh»nas are mentioned when the Buddha defined the Noble
Eightfold Path. So we cannot say that jh»nas were put into the Canon later. We
have no proof of that. We may carelessly say that anything we do not like is an
interpolation, or is added by monks, or something like that. There can be no
definite proof that a portion of the Sutta was put in later. Who knows? So it
is important to study such Suttas with the help of the ancient Commentaries. It
is safe to follow them rather than going away from them and interpreting in the
way one likes and not following the ancient tradition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Now let us look at the conclusion. First we
need to look at footnote 67. There is some explanation about abandonment or
relinquishment or giving up. ìAnd the giving up in this way is in the form of
inducing non-occurrence.î When we say that Path (Magga) eradicates defilements,
we do not really mean that it eradicates defilements. What is meant is that it
does not allow defilements to come up again, so non-occurrence. The present
defilements cannot be destroyed because they are already in our minds. And the
past defilements are already past, so we donít have to do anything about them.
They are already gone. The future things are not yet come. The Path or Magga
does not eradicate the present, nor the past, nor the future defilements, but
the arising of Magga renders them inoperative. They will not arise again. It is
like destroying the potential of things. It talks about this here. This subject
will be talked about later towards the end of the book.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In paragraph 239 in the second line we have
the words ëclear visioní and ëdeliveranceí. Here ëclear visioní means Path
(Magga). ëDeliveranceí means Fruition (Phala).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then the benefits of this meditation are
given. All of them come from the ån»p»”asati Sutta. Then there is the story of
a monk who was an Arahant and who practiced the mindfulness of breathing
meditation. He knew when he would die. He asked his companions if they had seen
how an Arahant attained Nibb»na. Some said in the sitting posture. Then he said
I will show you. He was going to die. He knew the very moment that he was going
to die. So he said that he would die or he would enter Nibb»na walking. He made
a line in the ambulatory. Then he said ìI will go to the end of the space. When
I come back and cross the line, I will die then.î He did die as he said. So
those who practice »n»p»”asati meditation can even know when their life force
will be stopped or when they are going to die. This is also a benefit of
»n»p»”asati meditation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In paragraph 241 there is the explanation of
three kinds of finals - final in becoming, final in jh»na, and final in death.
With regard to final in death there is a saying that those that arise along
with the 16<sup>th</sup> consciousness preceding the death consciousness cease
together with the death consciousness. There are four kinds of material
properties or four kinds of matter - those caused by kamma, those caused by
citta or mind, those caused by climate, and those caused by food. Those caused
by kamma must disappear at the same moment as death consciousness. At the last
submoment of death consciousness they must also disappear. This is because the
material properties caused by mind cannot live after the moment of death. What
we call life or what is translated as vital principle (j vita) or vital life
means that kamma-born quality in the material properties. That kamma-born
quality in the material properties must die with death consciousness or must
disappear with death consciousness. The life of material properties is 17 times
that of consciousness. Consciousness lasts for only one big moment or for three
submoments. So the material properties last for 17 big moments or 17 thought
moments. Since the vital principle must dissolve or disappear at the last
submoment of death consciousness, it must have arisen how many moments before?
16 moments before, 16 moments plus the death moment. At the end of the 17<sup>th</sup>
moment the life principle must disappear. Thatís why here it says the 16<sup>th</sup>
consciousness preceding the death consciousness. If you want to read more about
when the different material properties disappear in a life, you can read the
sixth chapter of The Manual of Abhidhamma.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

should go into solitary retreat and recollect the special qualities of Nibb»na,
in other words, the stilling of all suffering as follows: ëBhikkhus, in so far
as there are dhammas, whether formed or unformed (That means conditioned or
unconditioned.) fading away is pronounced the best of them, that is to say, the
disillusionment of vanity, the elimination of thirst, the abolition of
reliance, the termination of the round, the destruction of craving, fading
away, cessation, Nibb»na.î These words will be explained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìHerein, in so far as. Dhammas [means]
individual essences.î There is a long footnote here about dhammas. Footnotes
give me a headache because first I have to find the passages in the
Commentaries and then check the translation with them. The way they are written
makes it very difficult to translate them. Another problem is that English is not
my mother tongue. So it is not easy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Dhamma comes from the root ëdharí. ëDharí
means to hold. ìIn such passages as ëDhammas that are conceptsí even a
non-entity is thus called a ëdhammaí.î ëDhammaí can mean anything in the world.
Even the concepts are called ëdhammasí. Why are they called ëdhammasí? Because
they are born and affirmed by knowledge. They are carried or upheld, dhar. That
kind of dhamma is excluded by saying here ì ëDhammasí mean individual
essences.î When it is said that dhammas mean individual essences, then the
author wanted to exclude concepts from being called ëdhammasí here. Here
ëdhammasí mean those that have individual essences and not concepts. ìThat kind
of dhamma is excluded by his saying ëDhammas [mean] individual essencesí,î<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>ìThe
act of becoming which constitutes existingness in the ultimate sense, is
essence; it is with essence, thus it is an individual essence.î The P»ƒi word
ësabh»vaí, this word is also an important word. First bh»va is defined. ëBh»vaí
means becoming. The act of becoming is bh»va. Something which is with the act
of becoming is called ësabh»vaí. The ëact of becomingí means existingness in
the ultimate sense. That means having three moments of existence - arising,
aging and disappearing. Such things are called ësabh»vaí because they are with
bh»va. So in this word ësaí means with and ëbh»vaí means the act of becoming or
let us say existence. So things which have their own existence are called
ësabh»vaí. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In other places or in the footnote itself
sabh»va is explained in another way. There ësaí means oneís own and ëbh»vaí
means essence or something like that. So ësabh»vaí means oneís own essence or
oneís own nature. Or it means common essence or common nature. So ësabh»vaí can
mean different things in different contexts. If it is used as a substantive,
then it means something that has its own becoming or something that has
existence in the ultimate sense. In other places it may mean oneís own
individual nature or oneís own individual essence or common essence or common
nature.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>There are two kinds of nature, individual
and common. I am Burmese. So being Burmese is my individual essence. I am a
human being. This is my common essence, common with other beings. So ësabh»vaí
can mean these things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>So here we should not translate as
individual essences, but as some things which have individual essence. What is
ëessenceí? This is an abstract noun, right? It doesnít mean a substantive
thing. Some thing which has an individual essence or some things which have individual
essences are called ëdhammasí here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Here (footnote 68) it is a long footnote.
ìThe individual essence consisting in, say, hardness as that of earth, or
touching as that of contact, is not common to all dhammas. The generality is
the individual essence common to all consisting in impermanence, etc.î Let us
suppose we have earth element. Earth element has individual essence and general
or common essence. Its individual essence is hardness or softness. Hardness or
softness is the individual essence of earth element, not shared by other
elements or dhammas. The earth element is impermanent. Its impermanence is the
common or general essence of it. In this way we can have the specific or
individual essence and the general essence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>With regard to time Venerable ©»”amoli
quotes the M|la Æ k» in the footnote. ìThough time is determined by the kind of
consciousness [e.g. as specified in the first paragraph of the Dhammasangan ]
and is non-existent as to individual essence, yet as the <u>non-entity</u>
before and after the moment in which those [conascent and co-present] dhammas
occur, it is called the ëcontainer-adh karanaí; it is perceived (symbolized)
only as the state of a receptacle (»dh»ra-bh»va).î I wonder if he understood
it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>First we have to have a little knowledge of
Abhidhamma. In Abhidhamma it is said that on such an occasion at such a time
that, let us say, the first kusala citta arises. ëAt such a timeí, the words
ëat such a timeí in English (In P»ƒi it is one word) are put in the locative
case. ëAtí, ëon, or ëiní are in the locative case. The P»ƒi word used here is
samaya. ëSamayaí can mean time or it can mean occasion. Let us say it means
time. Why is time the location of consciousness? He is going to explain this.
ëReceptacleí and ëcontainer just mean location. Time is non-existent according
to Abhidhamma.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThough time is determined by the kind of
consciousness and is non-existent as to individual essenceî - so according to
reality time has no existence. So time is non-existent, but time is determined
by citta. That means the time when a given citta arises. It is determined by
the citta. So why can time be the location of citta? Time is non-existent. How
can it be the location of citta? The answer is when a consciousness arises
(Before it arises there is nothing and after it dissolves there is nothing.)
during the three phases of existence it is called existent. At that time
consciousness is in existence. So time is said to be the location or receptacle
of the consciousness. Actually there is no time. Time is not existent or not
existing according to ultimate reality. Although it is non-existent, it is said
to be the location of citta. Before the arising of citta there is no citta and
after the dissolution of citta there is no citta. That is why time is said to
be the location of citta. Therefore the Buddha said ìAt such a time the first
kusala citta arisesî and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student:
Would the same hold true for space?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher:
Space is also mentioned here. Space and time are said to be non-existent according
to Abhidhamma. So the translation itself is not correct here. You know you need
to be very familiar with the language because it looks the same but it has to
be understood differently. We have the words ëbh»vaí and abh»vaí. Abh»va is
misunderstood here. He translated abh»va as non-entity, but what it means is
non-existent. So time can be the location or receptacle of citta because before
the arising and after the dissolution of citta and its concomitants they do not
exist. So it is like a reference, the citta arises at this time or that time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Now in the text itself the explanation of
different words - fading away, disillusionment of vanity, and then ëon coming
to ití are used. ëOn coming to ití they are relinquished, they fade away and
son on. ëOn coming to ití really means on account of it or on taking it as
object.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ëFading awayí is not Nibb»na, but Nibb»na is
described with the words which can mean fading away. The P»ƒi word ëvir»gaí is
used here and other words as well. Vir»ga is simply translated as fading away,
but the act of fading away is not Nibb»na. Nibb»na is not fading away. Nibb»na
is something. Although Nibb»na has no existence, it is . Nibb»na is something.
When Magga Citta arises, it eradicates mental defilements. It makes mental defilements
fade away. Magga Citta only arises when it takes Nibb»na as object. If it does
not take Nibb»na as object, it cannot arise. So Nibb»na is a condition for
Magga Citta (Path Consciousness) to arise. Nibb»na is said to be instrumental
in making mental defilements fade away by Path (Magga). All these words are to
be understood in this way. Fading away, termination of the round, extinction,
whatever it says, it means Nibb»na is instrumental in the extinction of
suffering. They are to be understood in this sense. It is not that fading away
is Nibb»na, but Nibb»na is something instrumental in making defilements fade
away by Magga.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In the middle of the footnote there are the
words change-of-lineage. What the author of the Sub-Commentary was saying was that
change-of-lineage immediately precedes the moment of Path. That citta is called
ëchange-of-lineageí. That citta takes Nibb»na as object. Nibb»na which has to
be realized by or which has to be seen by the moment of change-of-lineage must
be one that has the profundity surpassing the nature of belonging to the three
periods of time. Nibb»na is timeless. Nibb»na does not belong to the present,
the past, or the future. In order for Nibb»na to be realized by
change-of-lineage it must not belong to any of the three periods. That is what
is meant there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

There are other descriptions of Nibb»na. You will find them in paragraph 248.

undecaying..the lasting..the undiversified..the deathless..the auspicious..the

words from this and say that Nibb»na is a positive state.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
