</span>It may be a relief to leave the foulness meditation behind and to come
to the recollection meditations. The six kinds of recollection meditations
mentioned in this chapter are something like devotional meditations. They are not
like the other kinds of meditation. They are unlike the kasiÓa meditation,
foulness meditation or vipassanÈ meditation. In these meditations you do a lot
of reflection. You do a lot of thinking when you practice this kind of
meditation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>There are ten recollections. They are divided into two chapters. Six are
treated in this chapter and the remaining ones will be treated in the next
chapter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>The PÈÄi word for recollection is anussati. When you read the Visuddhi
Magga or other translations sometimes you may find the language odd and not
adding much to any new understanding. That is because they are explaining the
PÈÄi word. Here the PÈÄi words are ‘anu’ and ‘sati’. You already know sati.
Sati is mindfulness or remembering. Anu is a prefix. So it has more than one
meaning. Here I think two meanings are given. “Because it arises again and
again” - that is one meaning of anu. Anu can mean again and again. “Or
alternatively, the mindfulness (sati) that is proper” - anu can also mean
proper. “It is the proper mindfulness for a clansman who has gone forth out of
faith, since it occurs only in those instances where it should occur.” So
anussati is defined as mindfulness which arises again and again or which is the
proper mindfulness for those who have gone forth. Actually it is for any
person.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student: A clansman is a monk or
a member of the Sa~gha?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: A clansman in this book
would mean a monk. But the PÈÄi word ‘kulaputta’ means just anybody, a monk or
a layman.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>The first one is the recollection of the Buddha. Actually it is the
recollection of the attributes or the qualities of the Buddha, not the
recollection of the Buddha himself. The word literally however does mean
recollection of the Buddha. “This is a term for mindfulness with the
Enlightened One’s special qualities as object.” When you practice this
meditation, you concentrate or you reflect upon the attributes or special
qualities of the Buddha. The object of this reflection meditation is the
attributes of the Buddha.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>The next one is the recollection of the Dhamma. Here also it is the
recollection of the qualities of the Dhamma. They will be treated in detail a
little later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>“This is a term for mindfulness with the special qualities of the Law’s
being well proclaimed, etc., as its object.” Dhamma is translated as law. It
will be explained in its proper place. ‘Dhamma’ means the Four Paths, the Four
Fruitions, NibbÈna and also the teachings or the scriptures. There are ten
kinds of Dhamma - Four Paths, Four Fruitions, NibbÈna, and the teachings. Some
attributes have to do with all ten and some do not have to do with all ten.
They will be explained later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>The third is the recollection of the Sa~gha. ‘Sa~gha’ here means the
community of monks who follow the Buddha’s advice and have attained
enlightenment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>“This is the term for mindfulness with the Community’s special qualities
of being entered on the good way, etc., as its object.’ When you practice this
meditation, you concentrate on the qualities of the Sa~gha. The Sa~gha is
well-behaved and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>The next one is the recollection of virtue, recollection of one’s pure
moral conduct. “This is a term for mindfulness with the special qualities of
virtue’s untorness, unblotched, etc., as its object.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>The next one is recollection of generosity. It is reflecting on one’s
own generosity and getting joy or happiness. “this is a term for mindfulness
with generosity’s special qualities of free generosity, etc., as its object.”
What is ‘free generosity’? ‘Free generosity’ means giving without any
expectations, without expecting anything in return. That is called ‘free
generosity’ in PÈÄi. The PÈÄi word is muttassacÈga. ‘CÈga’ means giving and
‘mutta’ means free. When you give, you just give. You don’t expect any results
from this act of giving.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student: How is that different
from just generosity?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: I don’t know what
generosity means in English. Is it just giving or may you expect some good
results from this giving, perhaps a good name or something in the future? Here
you just give because it is a good thing to do. You do not expect anything from
this giving.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>The next one is recollection of the deities. That means recollection of
the qualities of the deities. Before they were reborn as deities they were
human beings. They had qualities of morality, generosity and so on. One
reflects that these qualities are in me. So I am as good as they are. Comparing
or taking deities as witness one reflects on one’s own good qualities. This is
not to be proud of one’s self but to rejoice in one’s being generous, in one’s
moral conduct and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>The next one is recollection of death. “This is a term for mindfulness
with the termination of the life faculty as its object.” It simply means death.
‘Termination of the life faculty’ is a technical term. It really means death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>Mindfulness occupied with the body - you have to understand the PÈÄi
word here. The PÈÄi word is kÈyagatasati. Actually there are three words. The
three words are joined or compounded together so that they become one word.
Among these three words is the word ‘gata’. ‘Gata’ means gone or ‘gata’ means
to be somewhere. So in PÈÄi there is a difference between saying ‘gone to the
material body’ or ‘it is on the material body’. So it is explained in two ways.
“It is gone to the material body that is analyzed into head-hairs etc.” “Or it
is <u>gone into</u> the body” - I don’t like this. I just want to say “It is on
the body.” That means your mind is on the different parts of the body when you
practice this meditation. Etymologically the word ‘gata’ means gone to
something. It has another meaning which is to be. So it is the mindfulness gone
to the parts of the body or mindfulness which is on the parts of the body. They
mean the same thing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student: So ‘gata’ is the same as
that which is in TathÈgata?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Yes. That’s right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student: So it could be
‘well-gone’?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Here it is gone to. The
word is ‘kÈyagatasati’, sati which is gone to kÈya (the body) or sati which is
on the body (kÈya).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student: What does ‘TathÈgata’
mean?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: ‘TathÈ’ means thus, in
that way. ‘Gata’ means come or be.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student: So it could be thus come
or thus gone?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Yes. You know with these
words the Commentators are very fanciful. They give many meanings to one word.
You will find this today. Sometimes people say that the Commentator is not sure
which is the correct meaning of the word because he gives seven or eight
meanings for just one word. This is their ability to divide words into
different parts and explain them. They may not be natural, but still they are fond
of doing this especially when it comes to finding or explaining names for the
Buddha or words which describe the Buddha.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>A little further down “But instead of shortening [the vowel] thus in the
usual way, ‘body-gone mindfulness’(kÈyagatÈ sati)” - that means according to
PÈÄi grammar the vowel in the middle of the compound can be shortened. If it is
shortened, it will be kÈyagatasati and not kÈyagatÈsati. The Commentator is
explaining this. Here the long vowel is not shortened. So it is kÈyagatÈsati and
not kÈyagatasati.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>The next one is mindfulness of breathing. This is plain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>The last one is “the recollection arisen inspired by peace is the
recollection of peace.” This really means the recollection of the attributes of
NibbÈna. It is not taking NibbÈna as the direct object, but dwelling on the
attributes of NibbÈna.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>There are six recollections that will be treated in this chapter. Before
going to the first one, we have to understand the formula or the words
descriptive of the Buddha. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>Just recently Michael showed me the Lotus Sutra. Actually the MahÈyana
Sutras are fashioned the PÈÄi Suttas. There are many similarities in the style
of the language although MahÈyana Buddhism used and still uses Sanskrit
language. PÈÄi and Sanskrit are very close to each other. This set of names or
epithets for the Buddha are found both in TheravÈda and MahÈyana. This set of
attributes is very popular with TheravÈda Buddhists. I hope it is also with
MahÈyana Buddhists. On the devotional side we want to concentrate on the Buddha
and dwell on his attributes. It is like Christians praying to God or thinking
God. It is something like that. This set of attributes is well-known to almost
every Buddhist.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>The PÈÄi is “Itipi so BhagavÈ” and so on. It is given in paragraph 2,
the second paragraph. “That Blessed One is such since he is accomplished” and
so on. But the translation should not run like this. “The Blessed One is
accomplished” for such and such a reason. There are nine or ten attributes of
the Buddha given here. Buddha is accomplished for such and such a reason.
Buddha is enlightened for such and such a reason and so on. The reasons will be
explained in detail. Although ‘for such and such a reason’ is not again
mentioned in the formula, when you practice this meditation, you have to say
this because sometimes you do not concentrate on all nine or ten attributes.
You pick up only one which you like best. Then you concentrate on that one
attribute and say it again and again in your mind. So Buddha is accomplished
for such and such a reason and so on. Such and such a reason will be given in
the exposition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>In paragraph 3 also it should say “That Blessed One is accomplished for
such and such a reason. He is fully enlightened for such and such a reason. He
is blessed for such and such a reason.” It should go like this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>For the first one you have to understand the PÈÄi word. The PÈÄi word is
araha or arahant. This word is divided in different ways and then explained.
The meaning of this word is given in five ways. Five meanings are given for
this one word. Now let us look at how this word is cut up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>The first word is just araha. We don’t have to look to etymology for
this meaning. This word just means far away or remote. So according to this
meaning Buddha is called araha because he is far away from all trace of mental
defilements. “He stands utterly remote and far away from all defilement because
he has expunged all defilements.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student: It is called ‘Èraka’
here in the book. Is that a mistake?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: No. Originally it was
Èraka. It was changed to araha. Sometimes people pronounce words as they like,
not according to etymology. So the pronunciation may change and it becomes
araha. Sometimes the word ‘araha’ has the same meaning as the word ‘Èraka’.
‘Œraka’ means to be far away. It is very confusing. It can also mean to be
close to. It is not given here fortunately. But in the Sub-Commentary it is
given. So the first one is to be far away from, to be remote. That means the
Buddha is remote from the mental defilements.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>And here it is from all trace of mental defilements. ‘All trace’ is
important. When Buddhas abandon mental defilements, all trace of them is
abandoned. There is not even a trace of mental defilements in the minds of the
Buddhas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>Arahants are different. Arahants also eradicate mental defilements, but
they do not or cannot eradicate all traces of mental defilements. Although they
are not the mental defilements themselves, they are some results of mental
defilements, like a bad habit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>There was an Arahant who addressed any person, anybody he met as ‘wicked
person’ or something like that. He was reborn as a high caste brahmin for 500

something like that. He was an Arahant. He had no mental defilements, no dosa,
no ill will. Still he could not give up this habit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Buddhas are different. When Buddhas eradicate mental defilements, they
eradicate with all traces. Not even a little trace remains with a Buddha. That
is what makes Buddhas different from Arahants. Both of them eradicate all
mental defilements. Buddhas eradicate with all traces. The Arahants do not.
They have some kind of traces of mental defilements remaining with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>According to the second meaning the division of the word is ‘ari’ and
‘ha’. ‘hata’ means destroyed or killed. ‘Ha’ also means that. ‘Ari’ means
enemies and ‘ha’ means kill. So one who has killed the enemies is called
‘araha’. It could be called ‘ariha’, but the ‘i’ is changed to ‘a’ and so it
becomes araha. That is how the formation of the word is explained. ‘Ari’ means
enemies which again are the mental defilements. So one who has eradicated
mental defilements is called an Arahant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

craving, with its spokes consisting of formations of merit and the rest, with
its rim of aging and death, which is joined to the chariot of the triple
becoming by piercing it with the axle made of the origin of cankers.” ‘The
origin of cankers’ means cankers which are the origin, not necessarily the
origin of cankers. Cankers themselves are origin. They are origin for some
other mental defilements. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

(That is under the Bodhi Tree.) as he stood firm with the feet of energy on the
ground of virtue, wielding with the hand of faith the ax of knowledge that
destroys kamma - because the spokes are thus destroyed he is accomplished
also.” In order to understand this passage you have to look at the chart here
because it refers to the Dependent Origination. It is said here that it is a
hub made up of ignorance and craving. The whole PaÔicca SamuppÈda is viewed as
a wheel. In this wheel the hub is ignorance and craving - number one is
ignorance and number eight is craving. They are compared to the hub of a wheel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>“With its rim of aging and death” so aging and death are compared to the
rim because they come last. Aging and death are number twelve. “Which is joined
to the chariot of the triple becoming” means the triple existence - existence
in the sense-sphere, existence in the form-sphere, existence in the
formless-sphere. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>“Piercing it with the axle made of the origin of cankers” - so the
cankers are compared to the axle. Now we have the hub, the spokes, the rim, the
axle, and above the wheel is the chariot. When the spokes are destroyed, then
the whole thing is destroyed. So Buddha was called ‘araha’, one who destroys
the spokes because he destroyed the wheel of existence, the wheel of Dependent
origination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>“Or alternatively, it is the beginningless round of rebirths that is
called the ‘Wheel of the Round of Rebirths’.” The explanation here also has to
do with Dependent Origination. In Dependent origination there are what we call
twelve links, twelve factors. Number one is condition for number two, number
two is condition for number three and so on. I say ‘<u>condition</u>’ <u>not</u>
<u>the cause</u> because sometimes they are the cause and sometimes they are
not, but they are all conditions. One is condition for two, two is condition
for three, three is condition for four and so on. If you have this in mind, you
understand the following paragraph. If you don’t understand, you have to go to
Abhidhamma and read about Dependent Origination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Paragraph 16 explains how clinging is condition for kamma-becoming
process and rebirth process. I think that is interesting. “ ‘I shall enjoy
sense desires’, and with sense-desire clinging as condition he misconducts
himself in body, speech, and mind.” Clinging is a condition for good or bad
kamma. Because I want to enjoy sense desires let us say in a better existence
(I want to be reborn in a better existence. I want to be reborn as a cerlestial
being.) I will do something so that I will be reborn there. Sometimes I happen
to do something that is wrong in body, speech, or mind. Perhaps we meet with
bad teachers. Maybe they tell us if you sacrifice a human being, you will be
reborn as a deva or something like that. Because of that clinging we do good or
bad deeds. Here he misconducts himself in body, speech, or mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

That also is number ten. There are two kinds of number ten. One is action and

condition for birth, decay, and death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Ignorance is a cause, formations are causally arisen, and both these states are

condition. So ignorance as well as formations are causally arisen. Both are
causally arisen. “This is the knowledge of the causal relationship of states.
Understanding of discernment of conditions thus: ‘In the past and in the future

sa~khepa. ‘Sa~khepa’ really means in short or summarization. In Burmese we
translate it as layer. There are four layers. “Ignorance and formations are one
summarization” So in this chart number one and number two. “Consciousness,
mentality-materiality, the sixfold base, contact and feeling are another.” That
means three, four, five, six, seven. They are one layer or summarization.
“Craving, clinging,and becoming are another.” That is eight, nine and ten. “And
birth, and aging and death are another.” That is eleven and twelve. So there
are four summarizations or four layers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

number two. When you mention number one, you virtually mention number eight and
number nine because they belong to the kilesa round. So when we say one, we
mean one, eight and nine. When we say number two, we mean both number two and
number ten. So when we say number one and number two, we mean numbers one, two,
eight, nine and ten. That is why there are five in the first layer, in the

Arahants are said to have no kusala and akusala. They have neither wholesome

you do not have a hand, you cannot pick up things. If you do not have

</span>The Bodhisatta went to two teachers before he became the Buddha. He did
not follow their advice up to the attainment of Buddhahood. He discarded their
practice and went to a place and practiced by himself. So we say that the
Buddha has no teachers. This is emphasized by this ‘Sambuddha’. ‘Sambuddha’
means self-enlightened. ‘SammÈbuddha’ means rightly enlightened. So
‘SammÈsambuddha’ means rightly self-enlightened. Here ‘to know’ means to know
the Four Noble Truths.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>In paragraph 28 the author gives the things which the Buddha knew. They
are six bases, six groups of consciousness, and so on. These are topics taught
in Abhidhamma. Actually they are found in Sutta PiÔaka too, but their treatment
in full can be found in Abhidhamma.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Sometimes people take Abhidhamma to be a separate thing, not connected
with the Suttas. Actually those things found in Abhidhamma, most of them, are
found in Sutta PiÔaka. That is why we need a knowledge of Abhidhamma to
understand the Suttas. We should not treat them as separate things. We cannot
study Suttas without a knowledge of Abhidhamma if we are to understand fully
and correctly. So these are topics taught in Abhidhamma PiÔaka and Sutta PiÔaka
also.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>We will go next to the third one. “He is endowed with [clear] vision and
[virtuous] conduct.” There are two words here - vijjÈ and caraÓa. ‘VijjÈ’ means
understanding or vision and ‘caraÓa’ means conduct. So Buddha is endowed both
with clear vision and conduct.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>There are three kinds of clear vision. That means remembering past
lives, the divine eye, and destruction of defilements. They are called ‘three
clear visions’. Whenever three is mentioned, these are meant - remembering past
lives, divine eye, and destruction of defilements.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>Sometimes eight kinds of clear vision are mentioned. “The eight kinds as
stated in the AmbaÔÔha Sutta, for there eight kinds of clear vision are stated,
made up of the six kinds of direct knowledge together with insight and the
supernormal power of the mind-made [body].” There are eight kinds of clear
vision mentioned in that Sutta. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>However if you go to that Sutta, you will not find them clearly stated
because in PÈÄi when they don’t want to repeat, they just put a sign there. It
is like using three or four dots in English. In PÈÄi they use the letters
‘PA’<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>or sometimes ‘LA’. When you see
this, you understand there are some things which they do not want to repeat. So
you have to know where they first occur. If you do not know where to find them,
you are lost. Today I looked up this reference (D,1,100) and they were not
printed in the book because they were mentioned in the third AmbaÔÔha Sutta.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>This is one problem with us modern people. These books are meant to be
read from the beginning until the end, not just to pick up a Sutta in the
middle and read it. So they are meant to be studied from the beginning. I can
give you the page numbers of the English translation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>The eight are the six kinds of direct knowledge. That means performing
miracles, divine ear, reading other people’s minds, remembering past lives,
divine eye, and destruction of mental defilements. Two are mentioned here -
vipassanÈ insight and supernormal power of the mind-made body. That means you
practice jhÈna and you are able to multiply yourself. These are the eight kinds
of clear vision stated in that Sutta.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>By conduct 15 things are meant here: restraint by virtue, guarding the
doors of the sense faculties, knowledge of the right amount in eating, devotion
to wakefulness, the seven good states (They are given in the footnote), and the
four jhÈnas of the fine-material sphere. “For it is precisely by means of these
15 things that a noble disciple conducts himself, so that he goes towards the
deathless. That is why it is called ‘[virtuous] conduct’, according as it is
said.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>You have to understand the PÈÄi word ‘caraÓa’ to understand this
explanation. CaraÓa comes from the root ‘cara’. ‘Cara’ means to walk. to go. So
‘caraÓa’ means some means of going. These 15 are the means of going in the
direction of NibbÈna. That is why it says here: “It is precisely by means of
these 15 things that a noble disciple conducts himself, that he goes towards
the deathless.” That is why it is called in PÈÄi ‘caraÓa’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>Let us go to the next one in paragraph 33. Please remember here the PÈÄi
word ‘sugata’. The English translation ‘sublime’ may not make much sense here.
The first meaning of ‘su’ is good. “Su’ means good and ‘gata’ means going.
‘Sugata’ means good going. Buddha has good going. That is why Buddha is called
‘sugata’ because his going is purified and blameless. What is the good going?
That is the Noble Path. The Noble Eightfold Path is called ‘good going’. That
is the first meaning of sugata.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>The second meaning is gone to an excellent place. Here ‘gata’ means
gone, but not like in the first meaning. In the first meaning ‘gata’ means
going. In the second meaning ‘gata’ means gone to. ‘Su’ means an excellent
place. So one who has gone to an excellent place is called ‘sugata’. Here the
excellent place is NibbÈna.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>The third meaning is of having gone rightly. ‘Su’ can also mean rightly.
One who has gone rightly is called ‘sugata’. ‘Rightly’ here means not
approaching the extremes, but following the Middle Path.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>The fourth meaning is because of enunciating rightly. Here the original
word is ‘sugada’. The ‘D’ is changed to ‘T’. This is the PÈÄi grammatical
explanation. ‘Gada’ means speaking or saying. ‘Su’ means rightly. One who
speaks rightly is called ‘sugada’. So there are four meanings with regard to
this word. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>With regard to the fourth meaning a Sutta is quoted here in paragraph
35. “Such speech as the Perfect One knows to be untrue and incorrect, conducive
to harm, and displeasing and unwelcome to others, that he does not speak.” and
so on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>According to this Sutta there are
six kinds of speech. Only two of these six kinds of speech do Buddhas use.
Those six are mentioned here in the translation of the Sutta.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>In brief they are the following. The first is speech which is untrue,
harmful and displeasing. Buddhas do not use such speech. The second is speech
which is true, but harmful and displeasing to the listeners. Buddhas do not use
such speech. The third kind of speech is true, beneficial or not harmful, but
displeasing to the listeners. The Buddhas use such speech. Here in the
translation it says, “The Perfect One knows the time to expound.” That means if
it is time to say such speech, the Buddha will use such speech. It may not be
pleasing to the listener, but if it is beneficial and it is true, and it is
timely, the Buddha will say it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Student: What is the meaning of
‘harmful’ and ‘not harmful’?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: That means if you follow
his words you will get benefits. If you do not follow his words you will come
to failure. Sometimes people talk to other people, give advice to other people.
Sometimes that advice may not be conducive to success.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>So that which is true, beneficial and displeasing such speech Buddhas
use. Then the fourth one is speech that is untrue, harmful, but pleasing to
other people. Buddha never uses this kind of speech. Then the fifth one is
speech that is true, harmful and pleasing. Buddha never uses this speech. The
last one is speech that is true, beneficial and pleasing to the listeners. The
Buddha uses this kind of speech. So Buddha only uses two kinds of speech, that
which is true, beneficial and displeasing or that which is true, beneficial and
pleasing. The others the Buddha did not use. That is why Buddha is described as
‘sugata’, one who speaks rightly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Then the Buddha is the knower of the worlds, lokavid|. You may have read
this. It is something in the Commentary like Buddhist cosmology. Not all of
them can actually be found in the Suttas. Some can be found and others may have
been developed later after the death of the Buddha. If we look at the world
right now with the knowledge of modern science, then these accounts are very
different. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>There are three kinds of worlds mentioned here - the world of
formations, the world of beings and the world of location. You will find that
in paragraph 37. ‘The world of formations’ really means the world of both
animate and inanimate things, both beings and inanimate things. ‘The world of
beings’ means just beings. ‘The world of location’ means the outside world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:63.0pt'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: That is the inanimate
world like the earth, the rivers, the mountains and so on. If you can draw a
diagram of what is mentioned here, you can get a rough picture of the Buddhist
conception of the world, the sun, the moon, the universe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  
</span>In paragraph 38 I think the word ‘likewise’ should go. It should be
‘for’ or maybe ‘in detail’ because paragraph 38 and the following paragraphs
are the detailed description of how the Buddha knows the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>In paragraph 39 “But he knows all beings’ habits.” This is important.
“But he knows all beings’ habits, knows their inherent tendencies, knows their
temperaments, knows their bents, knows them as with little dust on their eyes
and with much dust on their eyes, with keen faculties and with dull faculties,
with good behaviour and with bad behaviour, easy to teach and hard to teach,
capable and incapable [of achievement], therefore this world of beings was
known to him in all ways.” Only Buddhas have this ability of knowing exactly
beings’ habits, inherent tendencies and so on. Even the Arahants do not possess
this ability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Also the footnote is very helpful and informative. You will get a view
of the Buddhist universe. You know the Buddhist universe is a round thing, not
like a globe, but it is round and it is surrounded by what we call the
‘world-cycle mountains’. So there are mountains around it. In this circle there
is water and also four great islands. We call them four great islands, maybe
the continents. It is said in the books, believe it or not, that each island
has 500 small islands. In the middle of the universe there is Mount Sineru or
Mount Meru. It is not visible to human beings. Surrounding Mount Meru there are
seven sets of concentric circles of lower mountains. In between these there is
water. These are called ‘inner oceans’. There is the outer ocean and these
seven inner oceans. Mount Meru is said to be 4000 leagues high. The first
surrounding group of mountains is 2000 leagues high. The next one is half of
that and so on. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>That is called one universe. The sun and moon are said to go around the
middle mountain at half its height. The sun and moon are only 42,000 leagues
from the earth. The size of the sun is 50 leagues and the size of the moon is
49 leagues. There is only one league difference between the size of the moon
and the size of the sun. And then the stars and planets go round them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>It is said that when the sun goes round Mount Meru it throws a shadow.
When three continents are light, one continent is dark. That is night. The
others are day. So only one quarter of the universe is dark and the other three
parts are light at one time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>There are four great islands. The southern island is called ‘JambudÊpa’.
It is the place where Buddha and all wise men and pure people are born. That
land is described as wide at one end and becoming small at the other end. That
fits with India. So India is JambudÊpa, the southern island. If India is the
southern island, then Europe should be the western island, China and Japan
should be the eastern island. And I think America should be the northern island
because when it is day in Asia, it is night here. America could be the northern
great island which is called ‘Uttarakuru’. This is the cosmology of Buddhism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Today I want you
to go back to the second paragraph of paragraph 2. In that paragraph the
qualities of the Buddha are given. How many qualities are there? Accomplished
is the first quality. Fully enlightened is the second quality. Endowed with
clear vision and virtuous conduct, that is the third. Sublime is the fourth.
Knower of the worlds is the fifth. We have gone through these five qualities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The next one is
the incomparable leader of men to be tamed. The Commentator breaks this into
two qualities. The first is just incomparable one and the second is the leader
of men to be tamed. So this can be taken as only one quality -<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>incomparable leader of men to be tamed - or
as two qualities - as incomparable and as leader of men to be tamed. So
according to this division the Commentator is going to give us an explanation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Let us go to
paragraph 46. “In the absence of anyone more distinguished for special
qualities than himself there is no one to compare with him, thus he is
incomparable.” So incomparable is taken as one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“For in this way
he surpasses the whole world in the special quality of virtue, andd also in the
special qualities of concentration, understanding, deliverance and knowledgee
and<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>vision of deliverance.” ‘Knowledge
and vision of deliverance’ means the reflection after enlightenment. When a
person gains enlightenment, first there is the Path moment, the realization
moment. Then follows the Fruit moment, two or three moments of Fruit or
Fruition consciousness. Then after that there are some bhava~gas. Then there is
reflection - reflection on the Path, reflection on Fruition, reflection on
NibbÈna, reflection on defilements eradicated, and reflection on defilements
remaining. These are called ‘the five reflections’. Among these the first three
are always done by a person who has gained enlightenment. The last two may or
may not be done by the enlightened person. These are called here ‘knowledge and
vision of deliverance’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Buddha is the best
of all beings, not only the best of human beings, but the best of all beings
including deities, MÈras, Brahmas and all. When the Buddha looked at the world,
he did not see any more perfect in virtuee than himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The next part of
this quality is ‘tamer of men who are to be tamed’ or ‘leader of men who are to
be tamed’. Paragraph 47 “He guides (sÈreti) men to be tamed (purisa-damme) thus
he is leader of men to be tamed (purisadammasÈrathi); he tames, he disciplines,
is what is meant. Herein, animal males (purisÈ) and human males and non-human
males that are not tamed but fit to be tamed (dametum yuttÈ) are ‘men to be
tamed (purisadammÈ)’.” That is the definition of ‘men to be tamed’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

references are given in the footnote. There are too many. If you try to find
out the story of each one, you have to go to many books and you have to read a
lot. These are the instances where the Buddha tamed or taught them, or in some
cases defeated them and made them see the truth. He made them become his
disciples.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

Dh|masikha, the Royal NÈga ŒravÈla, the elephant DhanapÈlaka (That was the
elephant set by AjÈtasattu to kill the Buddha.), and so on, were tamed by the
Blessed One, freed from the poison [of defilement] and established in the
refuges and the precepts of virtue.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

human males, namely Saccaka the Niganthas’ son” - he was a Jain. The Jain religion
was contemporary with the Buddha or maybe a little older. MahÈvira was their
leader. MahÈvira was like the Buddha is to Buddhists for the Jains. They are
called ‘Niganthas’ in the PÈÄi Texts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

student AmbaÔÔha” - he was a proud man. He went to the Buddha arrogantly and so
the Buddha tamed him. “PokkharasÈti (That was AmbaÔÔha’s teacher.), SoÓadaÓÉa
(a brahmin), K|Ôadanta (a brahmin), and so on, and also the non-human males,
namely the spirits (‘Spirits’ here means giants. It is a very powerful ogre.)
Œlavaka, S|ciloma and Kharaloma, Sakka Ruler of the Gods, etc., were tamed and
disciplined by variouss means.” Buddha tamed all these. And so the Buddha came
to be known as ‘leader of men to be tamed’ or ‘tamer of men to be tamed’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Then the
Commentator gives us a reference or a quotation from the Suttas about Kesi, the
horse-trainer. That Sutta is a very good one. Let me read from the Sutta. “Now
Kesi, the horse-trainer, came to visit the Exalted One and on coming to him
saluted the Exalted One and sat down to one side . As he thus sat down, the
Exalted One said to Kesi, the horse-trainer: ‘You yourself, kesi, are a trained
man, aa trainer of horses for driving. Now, Kesi, pray how do you train a
tamable horse’?” How do you train a horse?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Then he said: “As
for me, your honor, I train a horse by mildness, also by harshness, also by
both mildness and harshness.” In three ways he tamed horses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“But suppose,
Kesi, that a tamable horse does not submit to your training by mildness, nor to
the training by harshness, not to the training by both methods, what do you
do?” If a horse cannot be tamed by any of these means, what do you do?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“In such a case,

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“Why so?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

honor, the Exalted One is unsurpassed as a trainer of men for driving. How,
your honor, does the Exalted One train a tamable man?” He asks the Buddha the
same question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The Buddha said:
“For my part, Kesi, I do train a tamable man by mildness, also by harshness,
also by both together. Kesi, this is the way by mildness: This is good conduct
in body, thus is the result of good conduct in body; this is good conduct in
speech, thus is the result of good conduct in speech; this is good conduct in
thought, thus is the result of good conduct in thought. Thus are devas. Thus
are men.” That means by mildness he shows them the benefits of keeping the
precepts. By show ing the benefits of having good moral conduct that is said to
be taming by mildness, making the people want to practice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“And Kesi, this is
the way by harshness: This is bad conduct in body, thus is the result of bad
conduct in body; this is bad conduct in speech, thus is the result of bad
conduct in speech. This is bad conduct in thought, thus is the result of bad
conduct in thought.” This is showing them the bad results of bad conduct. This
is taming by harshness according to the Buddha.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“And Kesi, this is
the way by both mildness and harshness: Good conduct in body, speech and mindis
like this, and its results like this; bad conduct in body, speech and mind is
like this, and its results like this.” In this case the Buddha shows both the
benefits of good conduct and the disadvantages of bad conduct. That is Buddha’s
way of taming people by both mildness and harshness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“But, your honor,
if the man for training won’t submit to training by mildness, nor by harshness,

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“In such case,
Kesi, I destroy him.” That is the Buddha’s reply.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“But surely, the
Exalted One does not take life! And yet the Exalted One spoke thus: ‘I destroy
him, Kesi’.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“True, Kesi,
taking life does not become a TathÈgata. (‘TathÈgata’ means the Buddha.) Yet if
the man to be trained does not submit to the training by mildness, by
harshness, or by both together, then the TathÈgata thinks it is not worthwhile
to admonish that man, nor do his wise fellows in the pure life think it
worthwhile to admonish that man.” That means we just leave him alone. I don’t
give admonishment to him. I do not say anything to him. “This, Kesi, is
destruction for a man in the discipline of the Ariyan when both the TathÈgata
and his fellows in the holy life think it not worthwhile to admonish him.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Then Kesi said:
“Destroyed indeed, your honor, is a man’s welfare when both the TathÈgataa and
his fellows in the holy life think it not worthwhile to admonish him. It is
wonderful your honor. It is marvelous. May the Exalted One accept me as a
follower from this time forth, for as long as life lasts, as one who has taken
refuge with him.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>So Buddha’s way of
taming people is by mildness, by harshness, or by both together. If anybody
cannot be tamed by any of these, he just leaves them alone. This is his way of
destroying. You can find this Sutta in The Gradual Sayings, volume 2, page 116.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“Then the Blessed
One moreover further tames those already tamed (He tamed not only those who
were untamed, but he also tamed those who were already tamed.), doing so by
announcing the first jhÈna, etc., respectively to those whose virtue is
purified, etc., and also the way to the higher path to Stream-Enterers, and so
on.” He tamed or taught people who were already good, who hd already kept their
precepts. He instructed them to practice meditation and get jhÈnas and also
attainments. This is his way of taming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“Or alternatively
the words ‘incomparablee leader of men to be tamed’ can be taken together as
one clause.” Here it is only one quality of the Buddha. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“For the Blessed
One so guides men to be tamed that in a single session they may go in the eight
directions (That means the eight jhÈnas.) [by the eight liberations] without
hesitation. Thus he is called ‘the incomparable leader of men to be tamed’.” So
this quality can be two or one as you wish. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Traditionally in
our countries the qualities of the Buddha are taken to be nine. Therefore this
quality is taken as one when we practice recollection of the Buddha meditation.
When we practice this meditation, we use beads, counting beads. There are 108
beads. So that means you get twelve times in one round for the attributes of
the Buddha. That gives you one round. It is something like a timing device. So
when we use the ‘rosary’ (mala), we take ‘the incomparable leader of men to be
tamed’ as only one attribute. Maybe people like the number nine. It is supposed
to be a lucky number.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The next one is
‘teacher of gods and men’. “He teaches by means of the here and now, of the
life to come, and of the ultimate goal.” Actually we should insert one word.
“He teaches by means of the benefits here and now.” That means he shows us the
benefits here and now. He shows us the benefits in the life to come, in the
next life. He shows us the benefits of the ultimate goal. That means NibbÈna. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“According as befits
the case, thus he is the Teacher (satthar).” The PÈÄi word ‘satthar’ - when
explaining such words, such things, the Commentators make recourse to play of
words when there are similar but not identical words. The word ‘satthar’ comes
from one root. Then there is another word ‘sattha’, the leader of a caravan. In
the next paragraph that meaning is taken. “So too the Blessed One is a caravan
leader, who brings home the caravans, he gets them across a wilderness, gets
them across the wilderness of birth.” You may add any more meanings to this if
you can think of some. They may be fanciful, but to the devotees it is a way of
making their mind calm and happy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Paragraph 50 “Of
gods and men: This is said in order to denote those who are the best and also
to denote those persons capable of progress.” In this attribute it is said
‘teacher of gods and men’. What about animals? Was he not the leader of animals
also? It says here just deva (gods)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and
manusa (men) because those are the bestof the beings and also to denote those
capable of progress. That means those capable of attaining enlightenment. Only
human beings and deities are capable of attaining enlightenment, but not the
animals. They may be capable of being reborn as a human being or being reborn
as a deva. However in their life as animals they cannot get attainment. Here
the <br>
Commentator mentions only those capable of attaining enlightenment. That is why
only devas and manussa (gods and men) are mentioned. We must take it that the
Buddha is also the teacher of animals. “For the Blessed One as a teacher
bestowed his teaching upon animals as well. For even animals can, through
listening to the Blessed One’s Law (That means preaching), acquire the benefit
of a<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>[suitable rebirth as] support [for
progress].” That means that animals will not get enlightenmentt even though
they listen to the Buddha. However this meritorious deed of listening nto the
Dhamma will help them to be reborn as<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

frog is given. “MaÓÉ|ka the deity’s son” - actually it is just a deity, not a
deity’s son, although in PÈÄi it is called Devaputta. That just means a deity.
Every deity is a deity’s son. ‘MaÓÉ|ka’ is the PÈÄi word for frog. The frog was
listening to the Buddha, but he did not understand what Buddha was saying. He
may have thought this some kind of sound to be listened to. He was listening to
the Buddha when a cowherd came and accidentally killed him. Because he was killed
when he was listening to the Buddha preaching, he was reborn as a deity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

he discovered the Four Truths by himself and awakened others to them.”
Sometimes the causative meaning is put into the word. Normally the word
‘buddha’ means one who knows. We can make it to mean one who makes others know.
The causitive meaning is inherent in that. Buddha is the one who knows and who
makes others know. So here “He discovered the Four Truths by himself and
awakened others to them.” He made others discover the Four Noble Truths.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

knows the Four Noble Truths and who makes others know the Four Noble Truths. He
is the discoverer and aalso makes others discover them. Here actually it is not
only the Four Noble Truths, but anything that can be known or everything that
is to be known is known by him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this quality? The second quality is ‘fully enlightened’ and this quality is
‘enlightened’. The second quality just means he is the discoverer or he knows
everything there is to know. His power of penetration or his power of knowledge
is emphasized. In this quality not only his power of penetration but his power
of making others penetrate is emphasized. Not only his knowledge, but his
ability to make that knowledge attainable to others is stressed. This is the
difference beetween the second quality and this eighth quality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

qualities.” I would say here “It is a term or a designation given with respect
to the one who is respected and who is distinguished by his special qualities
and so is the highest of all beings.” He is distinguished by special qualities
and so he is the highest of all beings, that is the Buddha. The name bhagavÈ or
bhagavant is given to him with respect or to show him respect. Therefore he is
given the name ‘bhagavant’. It is translated as blessed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

(vantagamano bhavesu)’.” Here there are ‘bhavesu’, ‘vanta’, and ‘gamana’.
“Because in the three kinds of becoming (That means in the three kinds of
existences) [bhava], the going [gamana] (In other words craving, it really
means craving.), in other words, craving, has been rejected [vanta] by him.”
‘Vanta’ really means vomitted. Buddha vomitted going. Buddha has vomitted
craving for the three existences. That’s why he is not going to be reborn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>From these words
some syllables are taken to form the word ‘bhagavÈ’. Please look at bhavesu
vantagamano. From bhavesu we take only ‘bha’. ‘Ga’ comes from gamana and ‘va’
from vanta. Then we have bhagava. The letter ‘A’ is made long, so that we do
not have bhagava but bhagavÈ.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Then the
Commentator shows us another word which is ‘known in the world’. “Make the word
‘bhagava’, just as is done in the world.” - that means as is done in the
grammatical books with the word ‘mekhalÈ’. “Since ‘MEhanassa KHAssa mÈLŒ’ can
be said” - mekhalÈ comes from mehanassa, khassa and mÈlÈ. From mehanassa we
take ‘me’, and from khassa we take ‘kha’ and from mÈlÈ we take ‘lÈ’. So we get
mekhalÈ. It is very strange. ‘MekhalÈ’ means a girdle or a belt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It says in the
footnote that ‘Mehana’ is not in P.T.S. dictionary. The literal meaning of
mehana is private part, private organ. ‘Kha’ means a place. ‘MÈlÈ’ means a
garland. I think it is to cover the private parts that they use the girdle. So
it is called ‘mekhalÈ’ in PÈÄi or in Sanskrit. This word is to be derived from
mehanassa khassa mÈlÈ. You just take one syllable from each word and form into
one word. So we have mekhalÈ.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Now let us look at
the enefits of the recollection of the attributes of the Buddha. “As long as
[the meditator] recollects the special qualities of the Buddha in this way ‘For
this reason the Blessed One is accomplished..for this and this reason he is
blessed’, then on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greed, or obsessed
by hatred, or obsessed by delusion.” When he is contemplating on the qualities
of the Buddha, there is no greed in his mind, there is no anger in his mind,
there is no delusion in his mind. “His mind has rectitude (That means his mind
is straight.) on that occasion, being inspired by the Perfect One.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“So when he has
supressed the hindrances by preventing obsession by greed, etc., and his mind
faces the meditation subject with rectitude, then his applied thought (vitakka)
and sustained thought (vicÈra) occur with a tendency towards the Enlightened
One’s special qualities.” Vitakka takes the mind to the special qualities of
the Enlightened One and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>This meditation
cannot help us to get jhÈna. You will not get jhÈna by practicing this
meditation. In the middle of paragraph 66 “When he is blissful, his mind, with
the Enlightened One’s special qualities for its object becomes concentrated.”
So he gets good concentration dwelling on the attributes of the Buddha.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

factors eventually arise in a single moment.” ‘JhÈna factors’ really mean
vitakka, vicÈra and so on, but they do not reach the stage of jhÈna or they do
not reach the stage of r|pÈvacara jhÈna. They reach the stage of neighborhood
jhÈna. There are two kinds of jhÈnas or two kinds of concentration,
neighborhood concentration and jhÈna concentration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Student: This sentence, “But owing to the profundity of the
Enlightened One’s qualities, or else owing to his being occupied in
recollecting special qualities” and so on - the one seems to say it may be even
better than jhÈna and the other seems to say it is not as good as jhÈna. Is
that just the grasping mind trying to measure? Is it just different?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: You know Buddha’s qualities are profound. Buddha
has many qualities. Even one quality is difficult to perceive, difficult to
understand. When mind has to be occupied with such profound things, it cannot
get strong enough concentration to get jhÈna. Also there are many qualities.
You have to go from one quality to another. You have to take many objects as
the object of meditation. There is not only one object. So you are sort of
distracted. Therefore you cannot get strong concentration to reach the jhÈna
stage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

second one seems a hindrance. In the second one it seems you are distracted and
in the first one it seems like it is even better than jhÈna.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: That’s right. It is better to be dwelling on the
attributes of the Buddha than getting into jhÈna in the first part - it is something
like that. The second part says that if you have to take many qualities, you
don’t get good concentration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

devoted to this recollection of the Buddha, he is respectful and deferential
towards the Master. He attains fullness of faith, mindfulness, understanding
and merit. He has much happiness and gladness. He conquers fear and dread. He
is able to endure pain. He comes to feel as if he were living in the Master’s
presence. And his body, when the recollection of the Buddha’s special qualities
dwells in it, becomes as worthy of veneration as a shrine room.” I like that
very much. So whenever people bow down before me, I always think of the Buddha
so that I become a shrine room or something like that. When you think of the
Buddha, that means the Buddha dwells in your heart. So you are like a shrine
room, you are like a shrine. That is what I always do because if I am thinking
of some other thing and people are paying respect, then that is a bad thing for
me. I am not worthy of accepting their respect if I am thinking of some other
thing or something akusala. So I try to recollect the Buddha whenever people
pay respect to me. That way my conscience is clear. I am sort of worthy of
their respect because I am like a house where the Buddha dwells.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

about the fifth line ‘with detail’ is not correct. Here what the Commentator is
explaining is that the Buddha’s teaching is with meaning (That means
meaningful.) and also it is beautiful in wording. It should not be ‘with
detail’. So Buddha’s teachings, Buddha’s utterances are beautiful in words as
well as in meaning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>I think he is
confused with the word ‘anubyaÒjana’ when Buddha said “When you see something,
do not take the sign of it, do not take the particulars, do not take the

not take the particulars. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

‘spirit and letter’. The meaning of spirit is different. When you say you
follow the spirit of this rule, that is one thing. But here it just means the
meaning, not necessarily the spirit. The meaning and the presentation of the
words are what is meant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in this paragraph.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Paragraph 76
“Visible here and now’ - did you really find that meaning in the explanation?
Let us read. “Firstly the Noble Path is ‘visible here and now’ since it can be
seen by a Noble Person himself when he has done away with greed, etc., in his
own continuity according as it is said.” That means what? Seen by a Noble
Person himself, seen by himself. Right? The PÈÄi word means seen by himself,
seen by oneself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Now the next
meaning in paragraph 77. “Furthermore, the ninefold supramundane Dhamma is also
visible here and now, since when any one has attained it, it is visible to him
through reviewing knowledge without his having to rely on faith in another.”
That also means seeing by himself. So there is no ‘visible here and now’. The
first meaning is what? Seeing by himself. And the second meaning is seeing by
himself. The explanation is just a little different.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Let us see the
third meaning. “Or alternatively, the view that is recommended is ‘proper
view’. It conquers by means of proper view, thus it has proper view (in PÈÄi
sandiÔÔhika).” We don’t find ‘visible here and now’, right? The third
explanation is that Dhamma is called ‘sandiÔÔhika’ because it conquers by means
of proper view.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>What about the
fourth one? Paragraph 79 “Or alternatively, it is seeing (dassana) that is
called the seen (diÔÔha); then diÔÔha and sandiÔÔha are identical in meaning as
‘seeing’. It is worthy of being seen (diÔÔha), thus it is ‘sandiÔÔhika’.” Here
also we actually do not have ‘here and now’ in PÈÄi in the Visuddhi Magga. So I
think it is confusing when you say ‘visible here and now’. Four explanations
are given here, but in none of these do we find ‘visible<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>here and now’. We can take any one of these
four because we cannot give all four at a time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:VZTime'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The next one is
‘not delayed’. “It has no delay in the matter of giving its own fruit, thus it
is ‘without delay’. ‘Without delay’ is thesame as ‘not delayed’. What is meant
is that instead of giving its fruit after creating a delay (using up time),
say, five days, seven days, it gives its fruit immediately next to its own
occurrence.” You have to understand the supramundane thought process. The
moment of Fruition consciousness immediately follows the Path moment. The
moments of Fruition consciousness are the results of Path consciousness. Path
gives its Fruit immediately, not after some moments, not after three days, not
after five days. The Fruition consciousness must follow immediately Path
consciousness. That is why Path consciousness is called ‘akÈlika’ (no time).
‘AkÈlika’ means no time. There is no delay in giving results. It gives results
instantly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:VZTime'>Teacher: Other dhammas no. For example in kÈmÈvacara kusala
you do meritorious deeds here and the fruit may be in the next life, or after
some years, or some months. So there is a delay in giving results in mundane
merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

look at the thought process, there are seven moments of javana. They are
followed by tadÈrammaÓa or bhava~ga. Only after that will fruit come if they
are to come that quickly. Even then there is some delay. Mundane wholesome
kamma gives results with delay but not the supramundane. This is because
supramundane Path is immediately followed by its Fruit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
