<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Chapter 20</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>(Tape 40 / Ps: 1-19)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next is the chapter on what is the path and what is not the
path. “The knowledge established by getting to know the path and the not-path
thus ‘This is the path, this is not the path’ is called ‘Purification by
knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path’.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When a person practices meditation and he advances, there
are different stages of development. He reaches a certain stage where there
arises a certain kind of illumination, or he feels elation. His practice of
meditation is very good. This will be explained later. When these states arise,
the meditator takes them to be enlightenment. If he takes them to be
enlightenment, he will not practice anymore. And so he will not gain
enlightenment at all. These are called ‘impediments’.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These impediments are a block to the meditator’s progress or
to his enlightenment. If he takes them to be the way, to be the path to
enlightenment, then he is wrong. He will not get enlightenment at all. He must
understand these are not the path to enlightenment. The path to enlightenment
is to go further and to see the impermanency, suffering and soulless nature of
things. A yogi must be able to see ‘This is correct and this is incorrect’ or
‘This is the path to enlightenment and this is not the path to enlightenment’.
This chapter deals with this. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before coming to these impediments he must do some
contemplation. Different kinds of contemplation are mentioned in this chapter.
“One who desires to accomplish this should first of all apply himself to the
inductive insight called ‘comprehension by groups’.” That means comprehending
not in detail one by one, but taking as a group, for example taking materiality
as a group and contemplating on it. It is called ‘inductive insight’ or ‘comprehension
by groups’. These two names are used in <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Sri Lanka</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That is what is said in the Commentary. You have the
footnote down there. “This, it seems is the term used by the inhabitants of
JambudÊpa (<st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>).”
Comprehension by groups seems to be the term used by Indian teachers. “However,
insight into states by means of the method beginning ‘Any materiality whatever’
is ‘Inductive Insight’. This, it seems, is the term used by the inhabitants of
TambapaÓÓidÊpa (<st1:country-region><st1:place>Sri Lanka</st1:place></st1:country-region>).”
Inductive insight and comprehension by groups mean the same thing. Different
teachers have different names for the same thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why does he have to do comprehension by groups or inductive
insight? “Because knowledge of what is the path and what is not the path
appears in connection with the appearance of illumination, etc. (That will be
explained later.), in one who has begun insight. For it is after illumination,
etc., have appeared in one who has already begun insight that there comes to be
knowledge of what is the path and what is not the path.” He must be able to
decide that these are not the path and these will not lead to enlightenment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Comprehension of groups is the beginning of insight.” This
is the first knowledge in the list of the vipassanÈ knowledges. Before that we
are not in vipassanÈ proper. At first we try to be mindful of whatever is at
the present moment. Later on we will come to see mind and matter clearly. Then
we see the cases and conditions of mind and matter. While we are doing this we
are not in the domain of vipassanÈ proper. We have not yet gone into vipassanÈ
proper. Only when we come to the comprehension by groups do we enter into the
real vipassanÈ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Comprehension by groups is the beginning of insight. That
is why it is set forth next to the Overcoming of Doubt. Besides, knowledge of
what is the path, and what is not the path arises when Full Understanding as
Investigation is occurring, and Full Understanding as Investigation comes next
to Full Understanding as the Known. So this is also a reason why one who
desires to accomplish this purification by knowledge and vision of what is the
path and what is not the path should first of all apply himself to
comprehension by groups.” He is explaining why a yogi has to do this inductive
insight or comprehension by groups.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are three kinds of full understanding. In paragraph 3
they are full understanding as the known, full understanding as investigating,
and full understanding as abandoning. These are the three kinds of full
understanding. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Herein, the understanding that occurs by observing the
specific characteristic of such and such states thus, ‘materiality (r|pa) has
the characteristic of being molested’, ‘feeling has the characteristic of being
felt’, is called ‘full understanding as the known’.” Full understanding as the
known is understanding the specific characteristics of things we observe. There
are two kinds of characteristics, the common or general<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>characteristics and the specific
characteristics of everything we observe. When we see the specific
characteristics of the things we observe, then we are said to have this
understanding of the known. NÈma has the characteristic of bending toward the
object. R|pa has the characteristic of being molested and so on. This is their
specific characteristic. They do not share this characteristic with others.
Since r|pa does not share the characteristic of being molested with nÈma and
nÈma does not share the characteristic of bending towards the object with r|pa,
these are considered their specific characteristics. However all conditioned
things in the world do have common characteristics. They are impermanency,
suffering and soullessness. When we see the specific characteristic of things,
then we have the full understanding of the known.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The understanding consisting in insight with the general
characteristics as its object that occurs in attributing a general
characteristic to those same states in the way beginning ‘Materiality is
impermanent, feeling is impermanent’ is called ‘full understanding as investigating’.”
When we see the general characteristics of things, when we see impermanency,
suffering and soulless nature of things, we are said to have ‘full
understanding as investigating’.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next one is: “The understanding consisting in insight
with the characteristics as its object that occurs as the abandoning of the
perception of permanence, etc., in those same states is called ‘full
understanding as abandoning’.” When we see, when we understand that something
is impermanent, we abandon the notion of permanence. When we see something as
dukkha (suffering), then we abandon the notion of sukha and so on. That is full
understanding as abandoning. They have different aspects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Herein, the <u>plane</u> of full understanding as the known
extends from the Delimitation of Formations (That means discriminating mind and
matter or seeing mind and matter clearly.) up to the Discernment of conditions
(Chapter 19); for in this interval the penetration of the specific
characteristics of states predominates.” ‘Plane’ here means domain, so it
should be ‘the domain of full understanding as known’.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The domain of full understanding as investigation extends
from Comprehension by Groups up to Contemplation of Rise and Fall (Chapter 21);
for in this interval the penetration of the general characteristics
predominates.” During these stages a yogi sees the general characteristics of
things, that they are impermanent and so on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The domain of full understanding as abandoning extends from
Contemplation of Dissolution onwards.” After seeing rising and falling the yogi
will see the dissolution. “For from there onwards the Seven Contemplations that
effect the abandoning of the perception of permanence, etc., predominate thus.”
These are the seven kinds of contemplation: 1. Contemplating [formations] as
impermanent, a man abandons the perception of permanence and so on. These three
kinds of full understanding we should know. Up to the last chapter a yogi has
achieved the full understanding as the known. After the full understanding as
known there must come full understanding as investigating. For that purpose the
yogi has to do inductive insight or the comprehension as groups. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we have comprehension by groups paragraph 6. “How is it
that understanding of defining past, future and present states by summarization
is knowledge of comprehension?” This is a quotation taken from the
PaÔisambhidÈmagga.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whenever matter and the mental things are described the
Buddha described them as belonging to past, present, future, as being internal
and external, as being subtle and gross, as being far and near and so on. By
taking all materiality whether past, present or future and so on and then
contemplating on that materiality as impermanent, this is one kind of
comprehension. “He defines it as painful.” That is another kind of
comprehension. “He defines it as not self.” That is another kind of
comprehension.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 9 “Herein, the abbreviation ‘the eye..(etc.).. is
aging and death’ should be understood to represent the following sets of things
elided” and so on. In the previous quotation we see mentality-materiality,
feelings, perceptions and so on. What is not directly included in this
quotation is given in paragraph 9. Herein, the abbreviation should be
understood to represent the following sets of things elided. They are not
mentioned in the quotation, but they should be understood as being included.
These are the states that occur in the doors and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One thing important is in paragraph 12, the second part.
“And as regards those that are amenable to comprehension a beginning should be
made by comprehending those among them that are obvious to and easily
discernible by the individual [meditator].” That is very important. When we
meditate, we must comprehend or we must be mindful of what is obvious, what is
prominent and what is easy to see. We don’t have to look for what is difficult
to see. Simply we cannot do that. This statement is very important. When we
practice vipassanÈ meditation, we take the object that is easy to see at that
moment, what is obvious, what is prominent at that moment. That is why although
we are concentrating on the breath, if there is a noise that is loud enough, we
pay attention to that too. That is because at that moment it is more obvious
than the breath. So we have to be mindful of that. It is following the advice
given in the Visuddhi Magga.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then we have comprehension by groups. I hope you have read
all this. Even one materiality can be comprehended in different ways. It is
impermanent in the sense of destruction. It is painful in the sense of terror.
It is not self in the sense of having no core. This is how we contemplate the
impermanent nature, suffering nature, and soulless nature of things. You may
take any materiality - past, present, future, internal, external and so on.
Then you define or try to see that this is impermanent in the sense of
destruction. That means it is destroyed, it is dissolved after coming into
existence<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and so it is impermanent and
so on. It is impermanent in the sense of destruction. It is painful (dukkha) in
the sense of terror because it is fearful. When it is painful, it is fearful.
And it is not self in the sense of having no core, having no inner core. When
you contemplate that r|pa is impermanent in the sense of destruction, this is
one kind of comprehension. If you take r|pa in different aspects, such as r|pa
in the past was impermanent in the sense of destruction, r|pa in the present is
impermanent in the sense of destruction, r|pa in the future is impermanent in
the sense of destruction and so on, in that way you can contemplate in eleven
ways on one r|pa. You may contemplate past, present, future, internal,
external, subtle, gross, inferior, superior, far, near. In this way you may
contemplate in one way or in eleven ways. You may contemplate in the same way
painful in the sense of terror and not self in the sense of having no core in
the same way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 16 we have to make some changes in about the
middle of the paragraph. “<u>For what is impermanent is painful, and it is impossible
to escape the impermanence</u> <u>or the rise and fall and oppression</u>, of
self, so how could it have the state of a doer and so on?” Here he
misunderstood<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>two words. The correct
translation should be “For that which is impermanent and painful is incapable
of preventing even its own impermanence, or oppression by rise and fall.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So when you contemplate on the no self nature
of things, then you say that there is no self, no doer, no experiencer and so
on. Also you contemplate like this: What is impermanent is painful. Right?
Whatever is impermanent is painful. And whatever is impermanent and painful is
no self. It is incapable of preventing its own impermanence and being oppressed
by rising and falling. That is the meaning here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He misunderstood the PÈÄi word ‘udayabbhayapÊÄana’. He takes
udaya to mean one thing, bhaya to mean one thing and pÊÄana to mean one thing.
But here the meaning is that first you see the arising and disappearing of
things. Something arises and disappears. When you see the arising and
disappearing of things, you see the impermanence of things. When it is
impermanent, it is oppressed by rising and falling. So you see that it is
suffering or that it is unsatisfactory. That is the explanation of it being
dukkha. It is dukkha because it is oppressed. Oppressed by what? Oppressed by
rising and falling. When you practice meditation and just see things coming and
going, coming and going, you clearly see the dukkha nature of things. So it is
not ‘rise’, ‘fall’ and ‘oppression’, but oppression by rise and fall. That
means being oppressed by rising and falling. When you see things arising and
disappearing, arising and disappearing, you see this nature of suffering or
being painful. “For that which is impermanent and painful is incapable of preventing
even its own impermanence or oppression by rise and fall.” And so it is no
self. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The word ‘anatta’ has different meanings. The direct meaning
is no self. Right? It implies that it cannot exercise any authority over
things. Insusceptibility to the exercise of authority over things is also
included in the meaning of the word ‘anatta’. When you want to see the anatta
nature of things, you do this way: This is impermanent. This is painful. That
which is painful and impermanent is no self. That means it cannot prevent
itself from being impermanent. There is no way of exercising authority. Don’t
become impermanent, don’t become painful - there is incapability of exercising
authority over these things. It is incapable of preventing its own impermanence
and its own oppression. That is contemplation of not self.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The same contemplation used for r|pa is applied to feeling
and so on. Then there is the explanation of strengthening of comprehension of
impermanence etc. In forty ways you try to see the mental and physical
phenomena as impermanent, painful, as a boil, a dart, a calamity and so on. In
paragraph 18 the list is given and in paragraph 19 the meaning of the word is
given, one by one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 19 about a third of the way down “As a disaster
because of bringing unforeseen and plentiful adversity, <u>and</u> because of”
- instead of ‘and’ there should be ‘as terror’. It should be “As terror because
of being the basis for all kinds of terror.” Otherwise you do not get forty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we practice vipassanÈ meditation, we try to be mindful
of whatever is at the present moment. That ‘whatever’ is sometimes matter or
r|pa ad sometimes mind or nÈma. Sometimes we are mindful of the breath or the
movements. At that time we are taking matter as an object and when we are
mindful of our thoughts or emotions, then we are mindful of the mind or the
mental properties. In the beginning we just try to be mindful of mind or
matter, whatever is at the present moment. After some time as the concentration
gets better, we are able to see the individual characteristics of what we
observe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So there are two kinds of characteristics we have to
understand with regard to vipassanÈ meditation. The first thing we will see is
the individual characteristics of things. So when we concentrate on the mind,
we will come to see that mind is that which inclines towards the object. So
when we watch our mind or our consciousness, it seems to go to the object. It
seems to incline towards the object. That inclination towards the object is the
characteristic of mind. When we concentrate on matter, then we will come to see
that matter has no cognizing power. It doesn’t cognize. That also we will come
to see and that is a kind of characteristic of matter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During the stages that we have just studied, during the
stages of discerning mind and matter and during the stage of discerning the
causes of mind and matter, a yogi sees the specific or the individual
characteristics of things. From that stage in order to go to the next stage, a
yogi needs to see the general characteristics or common characteristics of
things. ‘Common characteristic’ means the impermanence, suffering and soulless
nature of things. Impermanence and the others are common to all phenomena that
is all mind and matter or formations. Actually during the stage of seeing the
causes, a yogi comes to see the arising and disappearing of what he observes.
When he observes let us say anger, then he knows that it has arisen and also
when it has disappeared, he knows that it has disappeared. So he sees arising
and falling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That is direct seeing. From that direct seeing he infers the
impermanence and so on of those that he does not observe. That is those of the
past and those of the future. Chapter 20 deals with that kind of vipassanÈ,
that kind of meditation. In the beginning of that chapter it says “One who
desires to accomplish this should first of all apply himself to the inductive
insight.” So it is called ‘inductive insight’. Actually it is inferential. It
is not direct insight. Inferential insight can come only after direct insight.
So if we do not have direct insight, there can be no inferential insight. First
we must see the present thing as impermanent. Then we infer that just as this
present matter is impermanent, so the past matter must be impermanent and also
the future matter will be impermanent. From what we have seen directly, we
infer what we do not see to be impermanent, suffering and so on. In order to
develop that insight here, it is said that we must apply the inductive insight,
what is called ‘comprehension by group’. The beginning part of this chapter
deals with this insight, ‘comprehension by group’ or ‘inductive insight’. With
regard to this insight the author mentions the three kinds of full
understanding - full understanding as the known, full understanding as
investigating, and full understanding as abandoning. Actually we have gone
through these parts. So the full understanding as the known is when we see the
individual characteristics of things. Now a yogi is to go to the second stage
which is full understanding as investigating.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How does a yogi practice insight comprehension by group?
Whenever matter or something is mentioned, the Buddha mentioned or described it
as past, future, present, internal, external, gross and so on. There are eleven
of these things. The aspects of whatever kind of materiality may be seen as
past, future, present (3), internal, external (5), gross, subtle (7), inferior,
superior ( 9), far, near(11). With regard to these eleven aspects the different
kinds of materiality are described. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When a yogi does comprehension by group, he does not take
each one of the material properties separately but just the materiality as a
group as one. Then he sees materiality which belongs to the past as impermanent
and materiality which belongs to the future as impermanent and so on. When he
takes matter as a whole, not taking earth element, water element and so on
separately, then he is said to be doing comprehension by groups. Actually ‘a
group’ means just taking r|pa, I mean if it is r|pa, taking r|pa as a whole. So
a person can practice meditation on r|pa as all r|pa is impermanent. That is
one comprehension. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Or he can take r|pa with reference to the eleven aspects. So
r|pa in the past is impermanent, r|pa in the present is impermanent, and r|pa
in the future is impermanent, and then internal r|pa is impermanent, external r|pa
is impermanent and so on. If he does that way, then he said to be doing in
eleven different ways. So there can be one comprehension or there can be eleven
comprehensions. They are described in the following paragraphs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you look at paragraph 13, it says there: “Here is the
application of the directions dealing with the aggregates: ‘Any materiality
whatever, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or
subtle, inferior or superior, far or near - he defines all materiality as impermanent:
this is one kind of comprehension.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>One word is missing
there or it is stated in brief or in an elliptical way. You see only two there.
Right? Impermanent and not-self. What is missing? Dukkha or suffering is
missing. So there must be something like painful. He defines as painful and
then dots, and he defines as not-self. This is one kind of comprehension. So
this is taking r|pa as a whole.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then taking r|pa as a whole but with reference to past and
so on, we get eleven kinds of contemplation. Towards the end of paragraph 14 it
says: “And all this is impermanent in the sense of destruction. Accordingly
there is one kind of comprehension in this way; but it is effected in eleven
ways.” So it can be one kind of contemplation or eleven kinds of contemplation.
If we take r|pa as a whole, then it is one kind of contemplation. If we take
r|pa with reference to past, future, present and so on, then we get eleven ways
of contemplating on matter or materiality. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just as there is one or eleven contemplations with regard to
impermanence, there is one or eleven with regard to suffering or painfulness in
paragraph 15. The same is true with anatta (no self) in paragraph 16. So there
is one contemplation or eleven contemplations. We have one meaning of the word
‘anatta’ in paragraph 16. That is what? “In the sense of having no core.” This
is one meaning of anatta. The word ‘anatta’ has different meanings. So one
meaning is that there is no core. That is why it is called ‘anatta’. When we
say r|pa is anatta, we mean r|pa has no inner core, or substance, or whatever.
This is one meaning or interpretation of the word ‘anatta’. We will meet
another interpretation later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After doing this also with regard to the other aggregates
such as feeling and so on, the yogi is instructed to view mind and matter in
forty different ways. That is discussed in paragraph 18 and so on,
‘Strengthening of Comprehension of Impermanence, etc., in <st1:Street><st1:address>Forty
  Ways</st1:address></st1:Street>.’ They are given in brief and also each term
is defined later in paragraph 19.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These end with the sound ‘to’ in PÈÄi and so we have
aniccato, dukkhato, rogato, gandato, and so on. In <st1:country-region><st1:place>Myanmar</st1:place></st1:country-region>
these are called ‘forty tos’. You know the word ‘to’ means ‘forest’ in Burmese.
It is something like a play on words. The word ‘to’ really is the PÈÄi particle
and it is a suffix which means ‘as’, or ‘from’, or ‘because of’. Here it means
‘as’. The PÈÄi word ‘to’ is taken to mean something like a forest here. So we
have forty ‘tos’. There are forty ways of looking at mind and matter. These
forty are later divided into meaning ‘impermanent’, ‘painful’ and ‘no self’.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I said last week, we have to add or we have to make
changes somewhere in paragraph 19. At the bottom of paragraph 19 if you come up
two or three lines, you will see ‘adversity and because of being’. The word
‘and’ should be rubbed out and then ‘as terror’ should be put there. So it is
‘as terror because of being the basis for all kinds of terror’. And on page
712, about 15 lines down (in the fourth edition), the word ‘vain’ should be in
italics. That is not so important, but it should be in italics. So we get all
together forty different ways of contemplating on nÈma and r|pa actually.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 20: these are grouped with regard to impermanence,
suffering and not self.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Now there are fifty kinds of Contemplation of Impermanence
here by taking the following ten in the case of each aggregate: as impermanent,
as disintegrating, as fickle” and so on. There are twenty-five kinds of
Contemplation of Not-Self, and there are one hundred twenty-five kinds of
Contemplation of Pain by taking the rest beginning with ‘as painful, as a
disease’ and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These forty are divided into three groups - impermanence,
pain and not-self. After viewing mind and matter in this way, the yogi is
instructed to sharpen his faculties. That is if he cannot bring this
contemplation to success. If he does not succeed in contemplating in this way,
then he should sharpen his faculties by the way stated in paragraph 21. That
is: “(1) He sees the destruction of arisen formations; (2) and in that
[occupation] he makes sure of working carefully” and so on. So he has to
sharpen his faculties by these methods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then #8 says “wherein he overcomes pain by
renunciation.” What does ‘overcome pain by renunciation’ mean? Here ‘renunciation’
simply means ‘effort’. The PÈÄi word ‘nekkhamma’ is sometimes misleading.
‘Nekkhamma’ means ‘to get out of’. So here it means ‘to get out of laziness’,
which means viriya or effort. So ‘to overcome pain by renunciation’ really
means ‘to overcome pain by effort, by making effort’.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He should avoid the seven unsuitable things in the way
stated in the Description of the Earth KasiÓa (They are explained before.), and
cultivate the seven suitable things and he should comprehend the material at
one time and the immaterial at another.” At one time he should contemplate on
r|pa (matter) and at another time on nÈma or immaterial things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we have ‘Contemplation of the Material’. “While
comprehending materiality he should see how materiality is generated.” So he
should see how it arises or its arising, its generation. That should be the
object of his meditation at that time, “that is to say how this materiality is
generated by four causes beginning with kamma.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There are four causes of matter. I think you have met them before in
chapter 19, paragraph 9. Those are what? Kamma, consciousness, temperature, and
nutriment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“When materiality is being generated in any being, it is
first generated from kamma.” So the first matter that arises at the beginning
of a given life is generated by kamma or is the result of kamma. “For at the
actual moment of rebirth-linking of a child in the womb, the first thirty
instances of materiality (That means thirty material properties.) are generated
in the triple continuity, in other words<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>the decad of physical [heart] basis, body and sex.” So there are the
decads of physical heart basis, the decad of body and the decad of sex. “Those
are generated at the actual instance of rebirth-linking consciousness’ arising.
And as at the instant of its arising, so too at the instant of its presence and
at the instant of its dissolution.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are material properties generated by kamma and these
material properties generated by kamma arise at the very first moment in one’s
life. And each moment has three sub-moments. At every sub-moment also the
matter generated by kamma arises. So at every moment the kamma-born-matter
arises all through the life until very, very close to the moment of death. At
all three sub-moments the kamma-born-matter is generated. So at the first
moment, at the arising moment, there are thirty. These thirty will exist for
seventeen thought moments. At the sub-moment of presence, static moment,
another thirty are produced. So at that moment there are sixty - the first thirty
and the new thirty, so there are sixty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the dissolution moment of relinking consciousness another
thirty are produced. So at that moment there are ninety. And then at the next
moment there are one hundred-twenty and so on through seventeen thought moments.
After seventeen thought moments the number will be constant because thirty are
produced and thirty disappear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Herein the cessation of materiality is slow and its
transformation ponderous.” We should note this. This means that materiality or
matter is slow in dissolution. That means the life of matter is longer than the
life of consciousness. Matter exists seventeen times longer than a thought
moment exists. When matter arises, it will exist for, it will last for,
seventeen thought moments before it disappears. So cessation of materiality is
slow. That means materiality has a longer life than a thought moment. “And its
transformation ponderous, while the cessation of consciousness is swift and its
transformation quick.” The arising and disappearing of thought moments are
quick, just one moment or say just one big moment or three small moments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is said: “Bhikkhus, I see no other thing that is so
quickly transformed as the mind. (That is the words of the Buddha.) For the
life-continuum consciousness arises and ceases sixteen times while one material
instance endures.” Those that are produced at the first moment of relinking
will last until the seventeen thought moments. While sixteen thought moments
come and go, they exist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“With consciousness the instant of arising, instant of
presence (That means static stage.) and instant of dissolution are equal (They
are the same.).” I said that the life of a material property is seventeen
thought moments. Right? So how many small moments are there? Fifty-one small
moments. Right? In seventeen big moments there are fifty-one small moments.
There is the instant of arising, the instant of presence and the instant of
dissolution. With regard to consciousness these three instances are of equal
duration. They are equal. They are the same. But with regard to a material
property the instant of arising is one small moment or one sub-moment. The
instant of dissolution is one sub-moment. The forty-nine sub-moments between
(arising and dissolution) are one instant of presence for a material property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do you follow me? Matter lasts for fifty-one small moments
of consciousness. So the arising, the presence and the dissolution of matter is
different from the arising, the presence and the dissolution of consciousness.
Right? The arising and the dissolution (moments) of both mind and matter are
equal, just one sub-moment. The presence of consciousness is only one
sub-moment, but the presence of matter is forty-nine sub-moments. “With
consciousness the instant of arising, instant of presence, and instant of
dissolution are equal; but with materiality only the instants of arising and
dissolution are quick like those [of consciousness], while the instant of its
presence is long and lasts while sixteen consciousnesses arise and cease.” That
means after its arising there are sixteen consciousnesses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now paragraph 25, that is important. It says ‘the second
life-continuum’, but the author has not mentioned the first life-continuum.
Right? If you read it before you came to the class, I was wondering what you
would understand by that. The actual meaning here is the life-continuum as a
second consciousness arises. Relinking consciousness is the first consciousness
and then life-continuum is the second consciousness. Here the translation should
not be ‘second life-continuum’, but ‘life-continuum as a second consciousness
arises’. The PÈÄi words that you are familiar with are ‘dutiyampi’,
‘tatiyampi’. Right? When you take refuge, you say “Dutiyampi BuddhaÑ saranaÑ
gacchÈmi” and so on. From the word ‘dutiyampi’ if you take of ‘pi’, you get
‘dutiyam’. That word can be an adjective or an adverb. Here it is an adverb,
not an adjective. So in the PÈÄi it is ‘dutiyaÑ bhava~gaÑ’. ‘Bhava~ga’ means
life-continuum. ‘DutiyaÑ bhava~gaÑ’ does not mean ‘the second bhava~ga’, but it
means ‘as a second consciousness, bhava~ga arises’.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The life-continuum as second consciousness arises with the
prenascent physical [heart] basis as its support, which has already reached
presence and arose at the rebirth-linking consciousness’ instant of arising.”
That is also not accurate. What is to be at the end he put in front. Here the
translation should run like this: “The life-continuum as a second consciousness
arises with the prenascent physical [heart] basis as its support, which arose
at the rebirth-linking consciousness’ instant of arising and has already
reached presence.” The sequence should be like that. We cannot change that
sequence here because it must first arise and then it must reach the instant of
presence. That means when life-continuum arises, the heart basis which arose at
the moment of relinking has reached the instance of presence. Now here
relinking consciousness is the first citta in the thought process and the
second citta in the thought process is the life-continuum consciousness. The
heart basis arose with relinking consciousness. At the moment of the first
moment it is arising. But later on it has reached presence or the static stage.
When it is in the static stage, the second consciousness or bhava~ga arises.
That bhava~ga arises depending upon the heart basis. That is what the author is
talking about here. The life-continuum arises with the prenascent physical
heart basis as its support. That heart basis has already arisen and now it has
reached the stage of presence and at that moment the life-continuum arises. So
it arises taking the heart basis as its support. The life-continuum has<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the prenascent physical heart basis<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>as its support which arose at the
rebirth-linking consciousness’ instant of arising and has already reached
presence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now the third life-continuum is the same. The life-continuum
as a third consciousness arises. Now for your information, after relinking
consciousness there are how many arisings of life-continuum? Sixteen. So there are
sixteen life-continuum consciousnesses arising after relinking consciousness.
Here ‘the third’ means not the third life-continuum because it is really the
second life-continuum. So the life-continuum as the third consciousness arises
with prenascent physical heart basis as its support and so on. So it goes that
way . With the arising moment of first life-continuum, there arises heart
basis. When the second life-continuum arises that heart has reached its present
stage. And then it forms the basis for the second life-continuum. It is like
this. The later consciousness takes support from the heart basis which arose at
least one big moment before its arising. If you put #1, #2, #3, #4, let us say
#2 consciousness arises taking heart basis which arose with #1 consciousness as
its support. And then #3 consciousness arises taking heart basis which arose
with #2 consciousness as its support and so on. It can go all through our life.
It happens in this way throughout life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But in one who is facing death sixteen consciousnesses
arise with a single prenascent physical [heart] basis as their support, which
has already<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>reached presence.” When a
person is about to die, all kamma-born matter ceases to arise with the
seventeenth consciousness reckoned backward from the death consciousness.
Suppose there is death consciousness. We reckon backward taking death
consciousness as #1, then #2 and so on through #17. With the dissolution of
death consciousness, no more kamma-born matter is produced in that life. But
what is produced at that moment will last until the moment of death. So there
is only one heart basis at that time for these sixteen thought moments. “But in
one who is facing death sixteen consciousnesses arise with a single prenascent
physical heart basis as their support, which has already reached presence.”
This is all Abhidhamma.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The materiality that arose at the instant of arising of the
rebirth-linking consciousness ceases along with the sixteenth consciousness
after the rebirth-linking consciousness” and so on. If you understand that
materials last for seventeen thought moments, then you can understand this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next is kamma-born materiality. This is all Abhidhamma.
With regard to kamma-born materiality we are to understand how many? Six - “(1)
kamma, (2) what is originated by kamma, (3) what has kamma as its condition,
(4) what is originated by consciousness that has kamma as its condition, (5)
what is originated by nutriment that has kamma as its condition, (6) what is
originated by temperature that has kamma as its condition.” There are six kinds
to be understood with regard to kamma-born matter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here kamma is profitable and unprofitable volition. That is
very important. If we talk about kamma, we often say kamma is deeds or actions.
Actions are called ‘kamma’. But technically speaking ‘kamma’ means volitions,
profitable and unprofitable, or wholesome and unwholesome volitions, kusala and
akusala, cetanÈ in PÈÄi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What is originated by kamma is the kamma-resultant
aggregates and the seventy instances of materiality beginning with the eye
decad” and so on. You have to take it from Abhidhamma. “What has kamma as its
condition is the same [as the last] since kamma is the condition that
upholds<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>what is originated by kamma.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“ What is originated by consciousness that has kamma as its
condition is materiality originated by kamma-resultant consciousness.”
Consciousness produces matter. Right? So the matter produced by resultant
consciousness is called ‘what is originated by consciousness that has kamma as
its condition’. “What is originated by nutriment that has kamma as its
condition is so called since the nutritive-essence that has reached presence in
the instances of materiality originated by kamma originates a further
octad-with-nutritive-essence-as-eighth (That means the inseparable eight.), and
the nutritive-essence there that has reached presence also originates a further
one, and so it links up four or five occurrences of octads. What is originated
by temperature that has kamma as its condition is so called since the
kamma-born fire element that has reached presence originates an
octad-with-nutritive-essence-as-eighth” and so on. With regard to kamma-born
materiality we have to understand six things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And with regard to consciousness-born materiality how many?
Five - “(1) consciousness, (2) what is originated by consciousness, (3) what
has consciousness as its condition, (4) what is originated by nutriment that
has consciousness as its condition, (5) what is originated by temperature that
has consciousness as its condition.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Herein, Consciousness is the 89 kinds of consciousness.”
You take them from the chart at the end of the book or from The Manual of
Abhidhamma.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>“Consciousnesses
thirty two, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>And twenty six,
and nineteen too,” and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Among them there are some consciousnesses which produce not
only matter but postures and intimation, some just postures and so on. Some
types of consciousness can help us maintain a posture for a long time. That is
why when you have good concentration, you can sit for two, three hours without
feeling any discomfort, without feeling any weakness, or without feeling
sleepy, or whatever. That happens to yogis when they reach to the higher stages
of vipassanÈ meditation. Their meditation is very good and their concentration
is strong. So they can sit for a long time. Sometimes they don’t sleep at all
for one or two days, but they don’t feel any ill effects from lack of sleep.
That is because some types of consciousness have the ability to maintain the
postures or to keep our body in one posture for a long time. That is why when a
person is in trance, we call it ‘samÈpatti’ or ‘jhÈna’, he can sit for seven
days without changing his posture. So there are some types of consciousness
which help to maintain postures. I think there are two groups. “Thirty two
consciousnesses, namely, the eight profitable consciousnesses, the twelve
unprofitable, the ten functional, excluding the mind element and the two direct
knowledge consciousnesses as profitable and functional, give rise to
materiality, to postures and to intimation (three kinds).” The next twenty six
are javana moments of r|pÈvacara, ar|pÈvacara, and lokuttara. They give rise to
materiality, to postures but not to intimation and so on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 32 “What is originated by consciousness is the
three other immaterial aggregates (That is feeling, perception, and mental
formations.) and the seventeenfold materiality, namely, the sound ennead,
bodily intimation, verbal intimation” and so on. Now students of Abhidhamma do you
find any discrepancy here with The Manual of Abhidhamma? In the Manual of
Abhidhamma only fifteen are said to be born of consciousness. Right? Here they
are given as seventeen. So growth and continuity are not included in those
originated by consciousness in The Manual of Abhidhamma. But here they are also
taken to be originated by consciousness. These two will be added to other
groups too. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What has consciousness as its condition is the materiality
of fourfold origination stated thus: ‘Postnascent states of consciousness and
consciousness-concomitants are a condition, as postnascence condition, for this
prenascent body’ (Ptn 1.5).” This is from PaÔÔhÈna.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What is originated by nutriment that has consciousness as
its condition: the nutritive essence that has reached presence in
consciousness-originated material instances originates a further
octad-with-nutritive-essence-as-eighth, and thus links up two or three
occurrences of octads.” These are all Abhidhamma. If you want to understand
them, please read chapter 6 of The Manual of Abhidhamma. After reading chapter
6 when you come back here, then you will understand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nutriment-born materiality is the same - (1) nutriment, (2)
what is originated by nutriment and so on. Here also in paragraph 36 what is
originated by nutriment is stated as there are fourteen nutriment-born kinds of
materiality, but in The Manual of Abhidhamma only twelve are mentioned. Growth
and continuity are omitted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then in paragraph 37 one thing is worthy of notice. That
is nutriment smeared on the body originates materiality. Normally we think that
only food eaten through the mouth can originate materiality. But here it is
said that also nutriment smeared on the body originates materiality. So
sometimes it may be possible to smear some food on our body and the it will
cause the nutriment-born-matter to arise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Temperature-born-materiality is the same. In paragraph 40
what is originated by temperature? It is said that materiality is fifteenfold.
In The Manual of Abhidhamma only thirteen are mentioned as growth and
continuity are omitted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then “What is originated by nutriment that has
temperature as its condition: the temperature-originated nutritive essence that
has reached presence originates future octad-with-nutritive-essence-as-eighth”
and so on. Did you wonder why that the words ‘that has reached presence’ are
mentioned again and again? When consciousness or mind produces matter, it
produces at the arising moment because it is said to be strong at the arising
moment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But matter is strong only at the
presence moment. That is why it is repeatedly said ‘that has reached presence,
that has reached presence’. So matter can produce matter only when it reaches
the stage of presence, not at the arising moment, nor at the dissolution moment,
but only when it is present. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we have Comprehension of the Immaterial. So after
comprehending or contemplating on r|pa, a yogi must contemplate on nÈma or what
is immaterial. “Just as one who is comprehending the material should see the
generation of the material (or the arising of the material) so too one who is
comprehending the immaterial should see the generation of the immaterial and
that is through the eighty one mundane arisings of consciousness, that is to
say, it is kamma accumulated in a previous becoming that this immaterial
[mentality] is generated” and so on. When the arising of mentality is observed,
then it should be observed by way of eighty one mundane types of consciousness.
There are eighty nine types of consciousness and eight belong to supramundane.
And supramundane consciousnesses are not the object of vipassanÈ meditation. So
only the mundane consciousnesses are given here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The modes in which it is generated should be understood
according to the method given in the Description of the Dependent Origination.”
So in that chapter how the mind arises is given. “That same [nineteenfold
arising of consciousness is generated] as life-continuum as well” and so on.
Among the eighty nine types of consciousness there are nineteen types of
consciousness which arise as relinking, life-continuum, and death
consciousness. So these nineteen are mentioned here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“In the course of existence, eye consciousness, together
with its associated states, supported by light and caused by attention is generated
because the eye is intact and because visible data have come into focus.” In
paragraph 44 we get the four conditions for the seeing consciousness to arise.
“In the course of existence (That is after relinking), eye consciousness
together with its associated states (That means together with mental factors.)
supported by light (So there must be light.) and caused by attention (There
must be attention.) is generated because the eye is intact (There must be the
eye.) and because visible data have come into focus (There must be visible
data.).” Only when these four conditions are fulfilled, can seeing
consciousness arise. So we must have the eye, there must be something to see,
there must be light, and there must be attention. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And there is an explanation of something like a thought
process. “Next to arise is the functional mind element with that same object
accomplishing the function of adverting.” This is the explanation of a thought
process. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the bottom of the page we have some corrections to make.
“Kinds of consciousness belonging to the sense sphere, either as consciousness
accompanied by equanimity and without root-cause or as five or seven
impulsions” - even the text in the Visuddhi Magga is misleading, a little
misleading, difficult to understand. What is meant is : “Next it is generated
either as one from among the profitable, unprofitable, or functional kinds of
consciousness belonging to the sense sphere as five or seven impulsions.” We
should put ‘five or seven impulsions’ there. After the word ‘sphere’ we should
say ‘as five or seven impulsions’. And then the word ‘either should be deleted.
Instead of it we should say ‘or’. “Or as consciousness accompanied by
equanimity and without root-cause”, just that. The other words to be deleted
are ‘or as five or seven impulsions’. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You know five or seven impulsions. Normally seven javanas
arise. But in some cases when a person has fainted or something, there are five
moments of javana. So there are sometimes five javanas, but most of the time
there are seven javana (seven impulsions). Sometimes the object is so weak that
it cannot be a condition for javanas to arise. That is also called a thought
process. So there are thought processes without the arising of javanas. When it
says ‘consciousness accompanied by equanimity and without root-cause’, the
author means that. That is why in the footnote it is said that ‘This refers to
determining’. In a thought process there is accepting, receiving,
investigating, determining, and javanas. Right? The author is referring to that
when he says ‘consciousness accompanied by equanimity and without root-cause’.
That means manodvÈrÈvajjana and votthapana (determining). So not all, not every
thought process contains javanas. There can be thought processes without javanas.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 45 “This is how one meditator accomplishes the
development of understanding, progressing gradually by comprehending at one
time the material and at another time the immaterial, by attributing the three
characteristics to them.” So he should always attribute the three
characteristics (impermanence, painfulness and not self) to what he observes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Another comprehends formations by attributing the three
characteristics to them through the medium of the Material Septad and the
Immaterial Septad.” That is viewing matter in seven different ways and viewing
mind in seven different ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Viewing matter in seven ways is given in paragraph 46: “(1)
Taking up and putting down, (2) as disappearance of what grows old in each
stage, (3) as arising from nutriment, (4) as arising from temperature, (5) as
kamma-born, (6) as consciousness-originated, and (7) as natural materiality.
Hence the Ancients said: (1) ‘Taking up is rebirth-linking. Putting down is
death’.” So ‘as taking up and putting down’ means the beginning and the end of
one’s life, taking one life as a unit. When he comprehends according to this
method, he comprehends all formations in a life, all nÈma and r|pa between
relinking and death. So he contemplates on nÈma and r|pa from the moment of relinking
to death as impermanent. Why? “Because of occurrence of rise and fall, because
of change, because of temporariness, and because of preclusion of permanence.”
Please note these explanations. These are the reasons for taking something as
impermanent. These r|pas are impermanent because of the occurrence of rise and
fall, because they have arising and disappearing, because of change, because
they change, because of temporariness, so they are just temporary, they don’t
last long, and because of preclusion of permanence, that means rejection of
permanence, they are not permanent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But since arisen formations have arrived at presence and
when present are afflicted by aging, and on arriving at aging are bound to
dissolve, they therefore are painful because of continual oppression, because
of being hard to bear, because of being the basis of suffering, and because of
precluding pleasure.” These are the four reasons why something is called
‘suffering’, or ‘pain’, or ‘dukkha’. So what is the first one? Because of
continual oppression, oppression by arising and disappearing. And then because
of being hard to bear (Something painful is hard to bear.), because of being
the basis of suffering (Sometimes it is the basis for another suffering.), and
because of precluding pleasure (That means rejection of sukha. It is saying
that it is not sukha, it is dukkha).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Since no one has any power over arisen formations in the
three instances, ‘Let them not reach presence’, ‘Let those that have reached
presence not age’, and ‘Let those that have reached aging not dissolve’, and
they are void of the possibility of any power being exercised over them, they
are therefore not self because void, because ownerless, because unsusceptible
to the wielding of power, and because of precluding a self.” These are the four
reasons for being anatta. Now the first one is what? Void, because it is void,
void because it is ownerless (‘Ownerless’ really means lordless, no overlord).
The PÈÄi word ‘samika’ has two meanings, the owner of property or a lord. I
think it is better to say ‘lord’ here than ‘owner’. So there is no overlord.
Because of being unsusceptible to the wielding of power, this also is one of
the explanations given with regard to the word ‘anatta’. We met one explanation
before. What? No core. That is one explanation. And another explanation is that
we cannot exercise any power over it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So
that is another explanation of anatta. Things happen as they like and we have
no power over them. That is the meaning. ‘Because of precluding a self’ means
rejecting a self.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Oh! Let me see on the previous page 720, in the last line
there is something. “And since no one has any power over <u>arisen</u>
formations (not arisen, just formations) in the three instances, ‘Let them not
reach presence'.” Actually it is: “Let the formations that have arisen not
reach presence”, something like that. “Let those that have reached presence not
age”, and “Let those that have reached aging not dissolve” and so on.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example I want to be young; I want to be
always young. I don’t want to be sixty years of age or seventy years of age.
But I have no power over myself. I will go on aging day by day. There is no
possibility of exercising power over it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So in footnote 20 “No one, not even the Blessed One, has
such mastery; for it is impossible for anyone to alter the <u>three</u>
characteristics.” Please rub out ‘three’. It is just ‘the characteristics’, not
‘three’. “the province of supernormal power is simply the alteration of a
state.” What it means is that even the Buddha cannot change the characteristic
of something. Mind has the characteristic of bending towards an object. Right?
Even the Buddha cannot change that characteristic of mind. If it is mind, it
will always have this characteristic. Then what about when somebody performs
supernormal powers and does something which is not usual or real? It is the
alteration of a state and not the alteration of a characteristic. That means he
may make himself many persons or he may create likenesses of himself. The
alteration of a state can be done by supernormal power, but the change of
characteristic cannot be done by any power or any person at all. Not even the
Blessed One has such mastery. That means if something has the characteristic of
aging, the Buddha cannot make it not age, not get old.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“ ‘Because of precluding a self’ means because of precluding
the self conceived by those outside the Dispensation (That means those other
than the Buddhists.); for the non-existence in dhammas of any self as conceived
by outsiders is stated by the words ‘because void, <u>etc.</u>’” Please add
etc. There are void, ownerless, not susceptible to the wielding of power. “But
by this expression (That means the last one, ‘precluding self’.) [it is stated]
that they (not ‘there’) are not self because they have no such nature.” The
word ‘anatta’ here has two meanings: There is no attÈ in them. When we say r|pa
is anatta, that means there is no attÈ in r|pa. That is one meaning. The other
meaning is r|pa is not attÈ. The first meaning is there is no attÈ in it. The
second meaning is that it is not attÈ. So the translation should be “But by
this expression [it is stated] that they are not self because they have no such
nature.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 48 “Having attributed the three characteristics to
materiality allotted one hundred years for the ‘taking up’ and ‘putting down’
thus, he next attributed them according<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>to disappearance of what grows old in each stage. Herein, ‘disappearance
of what grows old in each stage’ is a name for the disappearance of the
materiality that has grown old during a stage [of life]. The meaning is that he
attributes the three characteristics by means of that.” He tries to see all of
them as impermanent, painful, and as no self.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first one is dividing a life of 100 years into three
stages, the first 33 years, the second 34 years, the third 33 years. Then the
yogi tries to see the impermanence and others of materiality in these three
stages. “The materiality occurring in the first stage ceased there without
reaching the middle stage: therefore it is impermanent; what is impermanent is
painful; what is painful is not self. Also the materiality occurring in the
middle stage ceased there without reaching the last stage: therefore it too is
impermanent<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(‘Too’ should be added after
‘it’.), and painful, and not self. Also there is no materiality occurring in
the 33 years of the last stage that is capable of outlasting death: therefore
that too is impermanent, painful, and not self.” The meditator comprehends in
that way, dividing the life into thirds. The life span is taken to be 100
years. That is why it is divided into these groups this way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a little more subtle way the life span is divided into
ten stages. In paragraph 50 the ten stages are what? “The tender decade, the
sport decade, the beauty decade, the strength decade, the understanding decade,
the decline decade, the stooping decade, the bent decade, the dotage decade,
and the prone decade.” You can find out which decade you are in. What is the
meaning of the word ‘prone’?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Lying down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Lying with face downward, or face up, or just lying
down? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Just lying down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: When you are more than 90 years old, you want to be
in bed all the time. So it is called ‘the prone decade’. The materiality of one
decade does not go on to another decade. That is how the yogi comprehends. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is ‘dotage’? Becoming like a child? It may include that
here. The PÈÄi word is ‘mom|ha’. That means a deluded state. He forgets what he
has done and so on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 53 the same 100 years is divided into 20 parts
of 5 years each. Materiality in the first 5 years ceases there and does not
reach to the second 5 years and so on. This is groups of 5 years each.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next is groups of what? 4 years. There are 25 parts. 100 is
divided into 20 parts, 25 parts and then 33 parts of 3 years each, 50 parts of
2 years each, 100 parts taking 1 year each. It becomes smaller. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then he reviews according to the three seasons. “The
materiality occurring in the four months of the Rains ceases there without reaching
the winter.” Now in <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
there are said to be three seasons and also that is true in other Asian
countries. There are the rainy season, winter and summer. We have three
seasons, not four like in the West. Or there are six seasons. Paragraph 57 describes
these as rains, autumn, winter, cool, spring and summer. That means two months
of each. Materiality at one season ceases there and does not reach to the next
season and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next is dividing the month into two parts, bright half and
dark half in paragraph 58. In paragraph 59 there is dividing the 24 hours into
night and day. In paragraph 60 we have dividing a day into six parts. What are
they? Morning, <st1:time Minute="0" Hour="12">noon</st1:time>, evening, first
watch of the night, middle watch of the night, and last watch of the night. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then in paragraph 61 we have attributing “the three
characteristics to that same materiality by means of moving forward and moving
backward, looking toward and looking away, bending and stretching thus.” These
words are mentioned in the MahÈ SatipaÔÔhÈna Sutta in the section on clear
comprehension. “The materiality occurring in the moving forward ceases there
without reaching the moving backward” and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 62 deals with six stages in one step. I didn’t ask
you to be mindful of six steps in one step because it is too many. But here six
stages are mentioned. They are ‘lifting up’, ‘shifting forward’, ‘shifting
sideways’, ‘lowering down’, ‘placing down’, and ‘fixing down’. “ ‘Lifting up is
raising the foot from the ground. ‘Shifting forward’ is shifting it to the
front. (That means moving it to the front.) ‘Shifting sideways’ is moving the
foot to one side or the other on seeing a thorn, stump, snake, and so on. (It
may not happen in every step.) ‘Lowering down’ is letting the foot down. ‘Placing
down’ is putting the foot on the ground. ‘Fixing down’ is pressing the foot on
the ground while the other foot is being lifted up.” When you want to lift up
the other foot, you press the remaining foot more firmly into the ground. That
is called ‘fixing down’. There are six<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>stages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Herein, in the ‘lifting up’ two elements, the earth element
and the water element are subordinate and sluggish while the other two are
predominate and strong.” Among the elements the water element and the earth
element are said to be heavy. Fire element and wind element are said to be
light. When you move upward the earth element is sluggish, not predominate at
that time. The wind element and fire element are predominant. When you ‘put
down’, then the earth element is predominant, but not the fire element. It is
like that. “Likewise in the ‘shifting forward’ and ‘shifting sideways’. In the
‘lowering down’ two elements, the fire element and the air element, are
subordinate and sluggish while the other two are predominate and strong.
Likewise in the ‘placing down’ and ‘fixing down’.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He attributes the three characteristics to materiality
according to ‘disappearance of what grows old in each stage’ by means of these
six parts into which he has thus divided it.” Materiality in one stage ceases
and does not reach to the second stage and so on. He tries to see or here
attribute the three characteristics to all material properties. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“When he sees formations stage by stage with insight, his
comprehension of materiality has become subtle. Here is a simile for its
subtlety.” A simile is given. The application of the simile in actual
experience is explained in paragraph 67. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then materiality arising from nutriment, arising from
temperature, kamma-born, consciousness-originated are explained. In whatever a
yogi contemplates, he contemplates on the impermanent nature, the suffering
nature, and the no self nature of these things. He tries to see them as
impermanent, as suffering, an as no self. So in many ways a yogi may see these
during the practice of meditation. These are not direct seeing. These are all
inferential vipassanÈ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There may be a little thinking or something like that here.
That is why Venerable MahÈsi SayÈdaw did not encourage this kind of practice.
Just do it for awhile. Don’t spend much time with this type of observing or
viewing of different physical or mental phenomena, attributing the three
characteristics to them because it is something like a distraction. That is
because when you are trying to see the impermanent nature and so on, you are
not really practicing mindfulness. It is something like speculating or
thinking. It will take a yogi away from the real object of meditation.
Therefore it is not encouraged. Also a yogi cannot go through all the methods
mentioned in this book. A yogi must have a good knowledge of Abhidhamma to go
through all these. Even though he may have a good knowledge of Abhidhamma, he
will not see all of them in his practice of meditation. That is because some
can only be seen by the Buddha and persons of high intellectual nature. If
during the practice of vipassanÈ you do not experience all of these, don’t
bother. It is a book, so it has to explain everything during the practice in
detail. In brief it is just applying the three characteristics to everything we
observe, everything that we take as an object of meditation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“When he discerns consciousness-originated materiality and
attributes the three characteristics to it in this way, this meaning becomes
evident to him.” Then we have verses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>“Life, person, pleasure, pain - just these
alone</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>Join in one
conscious moment that flicks by.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The PÈÄi here really means that they are associated with one
consciousness. ‘Join in one conscious moment’ means they are associated with
only one moment of consciousness and that moment is very brief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>“Gods, though
they live for four-and-eighty thousand</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>Eons, <u>are not
the same for two such moments</u>.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here the original PÈÄi means: “These gods do not exist there
associated with two consciousnesses at a time. That means however long they
live, they live for one moment at a time. They cannot live for two moments at a
time. That is what is meant here. It is not that they are ‘not the same for two
such moments’, but they do not exist with two moments of consciousness. There
is only one moment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>“Ceased
aggregates of those dead or alive</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>Are all alike,

break up meanwhile, and in future, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>Have traits no
different from those ceased before.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They have the same characteristics, the same nature of
impermanence and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>“No [world is]
born if [consciousness is] not </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>       </span>Produced” -
actually “No world is born with consciousness which is not produced.” When
there is no consciousness, there is no world living. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>“When that is
present, then it lives.” So the world lives with the presence of consciousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>“When
consciousness dissolves, the world is dead:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>The highest
sense this concept will allow.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>‘When consciousness dissolves the world is dead’ means that
we are dying at every moment. There is death at every moment because the
moments of consciousness are very brief. So at every dissolution of a moment of
consciousness we die. So we are always dying although we say that we are living.
A man lives, a woman lives, you live, I live. In fact we are always dying with
the dissolution of each brief moment of consciousness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>“When
consciousness dissolves, the world is dead:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span>The highest
sense this concept will allow.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do you know the meaning of that? It is stated in footnote
23. ‘Pm’ means the Sub-Commentary. “ ‘Pm’ and the Sinhalese translation have
been taken as guides in rendering this rather difficult verse.” Yes, it is
difficult. Now here ‘the highest concept this concept will allow’ means that
when we say that he lives, I live and so on, it is just for convenience in
speaking that he lives, you live, I live and so on. The real ultimate truth is
that we are dying at every moment. When we say that I live, he lives, we are
taking that as though it were the ultimate truth, but actually it is not. So
although it is not ultimate truth, it is like ultimate truth. ‘The highest
sense’ means ‘ultimate truth’. When we use the expression ‘I live’ or ‘he
lives’, we are talking on the conventional level. We take that conventional
level to be a real truth. Actually it is not. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>“No store of
broken states, no future stock.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are no states stored in the past and no future stock.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Everything just arises and disappears. It does not last
long.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Having attributed the three characteristics to that arising
from nutriment, etc., he again attributes the three characteristics to natural
materiality.” ‘Natural materiality’ is what? “ ‘Natural materiality’ is a name
for external materiality that is not bound up with faculties.” ‘That is not
bound up with faculties’ means that it does not belong to living beings. “And
arises with the eon of world expansion” - do you know that? Do you remember the
beginning of the world cycle and the dissolution of the world cycle? There are
four periods in the world. ‘World expansion’ means the formation stage of the
world. The world disintegrates and then stays in that stage for another period.
Then there is the arising period. That period here is called ‘ the eon of world
expansion’. That means from the beginning of the world. You can go back to the
thirteenth chapter, paragraph 38. They are outside things like iron, copper,
tin, lead, gold, silver, pearl, and so on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“That becomes evident to him by means of an asoka shoot. For
that to begin with is<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>pale pink; then in
two or three days it becomes dense red” and so on. From one stage to another
nothing is carried over or reaches to another stage. After the stage of
becoming, it dissolves. “After it has become the color of dark green leaves, as
it follows out the successive stages of such material continuity, it eventually
becomes withered foliage, and at the end of the year it breaks loose from its
stem and falls off.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Discerning that, he attributes the three characteristics to
it thus: The materiality occurring when it is pale pink ceases there without
reaching the time when it is dense red” and so on. This is how a yogi
“comprehends the formations by attributing the three characteristics to them by
means of the Material Septad.” In seven different ways he views matter or the
material property as impermanent and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In PÈÄi the word used for attributing is ‘putting on’. To
see the individual characteristics is the real thing. To see the impermanent
and so on is something we ‘put on’ the dhammas. That is why ‘putting on’ is
said in the books.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On page 719 in footnote 18 it says “When the generation of
materiality is seen its dissolution also is seen, and so he said ‘One who sees
the generation of materiality thus is said to comprehend the material at one
time’ because of the brevity of states’ occurrence.” That phrase should go
after ‘seen’ at the end of the first line - “When<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the generation of materiality is seen its
dissolution also is seen because of the brevity of states’ occurrence.” They
arise and disappear so rapidly that when you see the arising, you will not fail
to see the dissolution also. They are so brief. “For it is not the seeing of
mere generation that is called ‘comprehension’ but there must be seeing of rise
and fall besides. So too the apprehending of generation in the other
instances.” Seeing of mere generation, mere arising is not called
‘comprehension’ here. In order to be called ‘comprehension’ there must be
seeing of arising and disappearing or rise and fall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the practice of vipassanÈ a meditator goes from one stage
of knowledge to another. The first stage of that knowledge is discerning mind
and matter or defining mind and matter. That we have already done. After
gaining what is called ‘momentary concentration’, a meditator comes to see mind
and matter clearly. This is said to be the beginning of vipassanÈ knowledge.
After seeing mind and matter clearly, he sees the causes of mind and matter or
cause-effect relationship between mind and matter, between mind and mind. When
he has seen the causes and the conditions of mind and matter, he is said to
have reached the ‘Purity of Views’.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After discerning the causes and conditions of mind and
matter, he goes further in the series of vipassanÈ knowledges. That is he tries
to comprehend mind and matter clearly. At the beginning of chapter 20 it is
said that “The knowledge established by getting to know the path and the
not-path thus”, and then “One who desires to accomplish this should first of
all apply himself to the inductive insight called ‘Comprehension by Groups’”
and so on. So he applies the comprehension by groups or just the knowledge of
comprehension of mind and matter. We are just in the middle of this knowledge.
In order to comprehend mind and matter clearly and in order to practice
comprehension by groups, we are made to understand the three kinds of full
understanding, then how mind and matter are to be comprehended according to
groups, and so on, and then how to comprehend matter in different ways, and
then how to comprehend mind or mentality also in what is immaterial. So first
r|pa (matter) should be comprehended in seven different ways. That is described
in paragraph 46 and so on. That is called ‘Material Septad’, Seven Kinds of Comprehension
of Mind and Matter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we come to the Immaterial Septad. “He comprehends all
natural materiality in this way. This is how, firstly, he comprehends
formations by attributing the three characteristics to them by means of the
Material Septad.” So he comprehends all formations (That means all mind and
matter.) by attributing the three characteristics to them. That means seeing
them as impermanent, as suffering, and as no-self.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now the author gives the other seven methods. They are
called ‘The Immaterial Septad’. “The headings of what was called above ‘The
Immaterial Septad’ are these: (1) by groups, (2) by pairs, (3) by moments, (4)
by series, (5) by removal of false view, (6) by abolition of conceit, (7) by
ending of attachment.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are the seven ways to apply. So (1) ‘by group’ means
the states belonging to the Contact Pentad. You don’t know what ‘Contact
Pentad’ is, but please read footnote 24. ‘Contact Pentad’ means contact,
feeling, perception, volition, and consciousness. In this order they are
mentioned in the first book of Abhidhamma, Dhammasa~gaÓÊ. That is why they are
called ‘Contact Pentad’. So five things beginning with contact, they are
contact, feeling, perception, volition and consciousness. “Here, ‘he
comprehends by groups’ [means that] a bhikkhu considers thus: The states
belonging to the contact pentad arising in the comprehending of head hairs as
‘impermanent, painful, not self’; the states belonging to the contact pentad
arising in the comprehending of body hairs as in the contemplation of brain”
and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Now you see ‘brain’
here. In the so called ’32 parts of the body’ the brain is in the middle, not
at the end of the list. Actually only 31 parts are mentioned in the Suttas,
mentioned in the MahÈ SatipaÔÔhÈna Sutta and other Suttas. But in a book called
‘PaÔisambhidÈmagga’, which is ascribed to the Venerable SÈriputta, the brain is
added. It is added at the end, not in the middle as we do, now as we practice
meditation now. So ‘in the contemplation of brain’ means he has come to the end
of the list. “ ‘Impermanent, painful, not self’; - all these states
disintegrate section by section, term by term, like crackling sesame seeds put
into a hot pan, each without reaching the next: therefore they are impermanent,
painful, not self. This, firstly, is the method according to the Discourse on
Purification.” This one way of doing contemplation by groups.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is another way. “According to the Discourse on the
Noble Ones’ Heritages, however, he is said ‘to comprehend by groups’ when by
means of a subsequent consciousness he comprehends as ‘impermanent, painful,
not self’ that consciousness which occurred [ comprehending] materiality as
‘impermanent, painful, not self’ in the seven instances of the Material Septad
given above. As this method is more suitable we shall therefore confine
ourselves to it explaining the rest.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now in the first method a yogi takes head hairs as an object
of meditation, then body hairs, the skin, teeth, and so on. But in this method
he comprehends the consciousness itself which comprehends head hair as
impermanent and so on. Here a yogi does not go to other objects. So he is not
distracted. That is why it is said that it is more suitable. If you have to
take the head hair, body hair and so on, then at every time there is new
subject of meditation. But here you just take the consciousness which takes
them as impermanent and so on. So a yogi is not described. That is why this
method is said to be more suitable than the first one. Here 'comprehending by
groups’ means actually comprehending the consciousness which comprehends head
hairs and so on as impermanent and so on. So it is comprehending the
comprehending consciousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“(2)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By pairs: after
the bhikkhu has comprehended as ‘impermanent, painful, not self’ the
materiality of the ‘taking up and putting down’ (That really means from birth
to death.), he comprehends that first consciousness [with which he was
comprehending the materiality] too as ‘impermanent, painful, not self’ by means
of a subsequent consciousness. (Here also by one consciousness he takes another
consciousness as object of vipassanÈ meditation. And he takes that
consciousness also to be ‘impermanent’ and so on.) After he has comprehended as
impermanent, painful, not self the materiality of the ‘disappearance of what
grows old in each stage’ (That means mind and matter in one stage does not
reach to the next stage, and mind and matter in that stage also does not reach
to succeeding stages and so on. They are mentioned previously in this chapter.)
and that arising from ‘nutriment’, ‘arising from temperature’, ‘kamma-born’,
‘consciousness-originated’ and ‘natural’, he comprehends that consciousness too
as ‘impermanent, painful, not self’ by means of a subsequent consciousness. In
this way he is said to comprehend by pairs.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First he comprehends matter as ‘impermanent’ and so on. Next
he takes the consciousness that takes matter as impermanent and so on. So it is
called ‘pairs’. In the first method, ‘by groups’, he does not comprehend in
pairs; he just comprehends the consciousness which takes head hairs, body hairs
and so on as ‘impermanent’. Here he takes let us say materiality as
impermanent, and then he takes that consciousness which takes materiality as
impermanent, as impermanent by another consciousness. It goes in pairs. That is
why the second method is called ‘by pairs’.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The third method is ‘by moments’. “After the bhikkhu has
comprehended as ‘impermanent, painful, not self’ the materiality of the ‘taking
up and putting down (from birth to death)’, he comprehends that first
consciousness [with which he was comprehending the materiality] as
‘impermanent, painful, not self’ by means of a second consciousness, and that
second consciousness by means of a third, and the third by means of the fourth,
and the fourth by means of a fifth.” So it is going in a series. We have to
make corrections here. It should read “and the fourth by means of a fifth as
that too is impermanent.” So we will rub out ‘<u>and that too he comprehends’</u>.
We don’t need these five words. It should be “and the fourth by means of a
fifth as that too is impermanent”. So by the fifth consciousness he comprehends
the fourth consciousness. That fourth consciousness too is ‘impermanent,
painful and not self’. Here he does not comprehend the fifth consciousness. He
only comprehends the fourth consciousness by the fifth consciousness. So we
should say “and the fourth by means of a fifth as that too is impermanent,
painful, not self.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“After he has comprehended as ‘impermanent, painful, not
self’ the materiality of disappearance of what grows old in each stage’ and
that ‘arising from nutriment’, ‘arising from temperature’, ‘kamma-born’,
‘consciousness-originated’ and ‘natural’, he comprehends that first
consciousness as ‘impermanent, painful, not self’ by means of a second
consciousness and that second consciousness by means of a third, and the third
by means of a fourth, and the fourth by means of a fifth. Here also we should
have ‘as that too is impermanent, painful, not self’. “Comprehending thus four
[consciousnesses] from each discerning of materiality he said to comprehend by
moments.” So this is said to be ‘comprehending by moments’. There are five
consciousnesses. The first consciousness takes materiality as object. The
second consciousness takes the first consciousness as object. The third
consciousness takes the second consciousness as object. The fourth takes the
third, and the fifth takes the forth. Then he stops there. That is ‘by
moments’. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“(4) By series: after he has comprehended as ‘impermanent,
painful, not self’, the materiality of the ‘taking up and putting down’, he
comprehends that first consciousness as ‘impermanent, painful, not self’ by
means of a second consciousness, and the second by means of a third, and the third
by means of a fourth,.. and the tenth by means of the eleventh (Here we should
strike out the words ‘and that too he comprehends’.) and the tenth by means of
eleventh as that too is impermanent, painful, not self.” In the previous method
he stops at comprehending the fourth consciousness by fifth consciousness. But
here he ends by comprehending the tenth by the eleventh consciousness. He
doesn’t go beyond comprehending the tenth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“After he has comprehended as ‘impermanent, painful, not
self’ the materiality of the disappearance of what grows old in each stage” and
so on. “He comprehends that consciousness as ‘impermanent, painful, not self’
by means of a second consciousness, and the second by means of a third.. and
the tenth by means of an eleventh as impermanent, painful, not self. It would
be possible to go on comprehending it in this way with serial insight even or a
whole day.” That means taking the tenth by the eleventh, taking the eleventh by
the twelfth, taking the twelfth by the thirteenth and so on. So he could go on
for the whole day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But both the material meditation subject and the immaterial
meditation subject become familiar when the comprehending is taken as far as
the tenth consciousness. (It is enough just to take up to the tenth consciousness.)
That is why it is said that it <u>can be</u> (I think ‘should be’ is better,
not ‘it can be’.) stopped at the tenth. (So a yogi must stop at the tenth. He
must not go on beyond the tenth because that will make him distracted.) It is
when he comprehends in this way that he is said to comprehend by series.” So
that is ‘comprehension by series’. The first consciousness takes the
materiality as object and the second takes the first consciousness as object
and so on, until the eleventh consciousness takes the tenth as ‘impermanent’
and so on. Then he stops there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“(5) By removal of false view, (6) by abolition of conceit,
(7) by ending attachment: there is no individual method for any of these three.
(There is no special method.) But when he has discerned this materiality as
described above and this immateriality as described here, then he sees that
there is no living being over and above the material and the immaterial” and so
on. This is the description of removal of false view, abolition of conceit, and
the ending of attachment. This is how he comes to this by discerning the
mentality and materiality actually as impermanent, suffering and no-self.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now paragraph 83 “But in the Discourse on the Noble Ones’
Heritages” - there are two kinds of discourses mentioned by the Visuddhi Magga.
And the Sub-Commentary did not give us<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>any information about these two methods, ‘Discourse of the Noble Ones’
Heritages’ and ‘Discourse on Purification’. There seem to have been two lines
of instruction given at the time of Venerable Buddhaghosa. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“After setting forth the headings thus: ‘As removal of
[false] view, as abolition of conceit, as ending of attachment’, the following
method is set forth: ‘There is<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>no
removal of [false] view in one who takes it thus “I see with insight, my
insight”; there is removal of [false] view in one who takes it thus “Only
formations see formations with insight, comprehend, define, discern, and
delimit them”.’” So when you say ‘I see’, then there is a kind of false view
because you have not yet gotten rid of the view of ‘I’. Only when you see that
there are only formations, when you see formations with insight, then there is
the removal of false view. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There is no abolition of conceit in one who takes it thus
‘I see thoroughly with insight, I see well with insight’.” So I can see this,
maybe others cannot. “There is abolition of conceit in one who takes it thus
‘Only formations see formations with insight’,” and so on. “There is no ending
of attachment in one who is pleased with insight thus ‘I am able to see with
insight’.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sometimes when people see
this, they are attached to that seeing; they like it because this seeing is a
result of the individual’s meditation. So there is attachment to this seeing.
When one is attached to this seeing, then one cannot get rid of attachment. So
‘I am able to see with insight’ - there is no ending of attachment. But there
is ending of attachment in one who takes it thus ‘Only formations see
formations with insight, comprehend,’ and so on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“There is removal of [false] view in one who sees thus ‘If
formations were self, it would be right to take them as self; but being
not-self they are taken as self. (They are taken to be ‘self’, although in fact
they are ‘not-self’.) Therefore they are not self in the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sense of no power being exercisable over them; (They do not
lend themselves to being ordered by some power or some beings.) they are
impermanent in the sense of non-existence after having come to be; they are
painful in the sense of oppression by rise and fall.” These are always
explained with regard to being impermanent, painful, and not self. “They are
not self in the sense of no power being exercisable over them.” That is the
reason for their being anatta (not self). Non-existence after having come to
be, this is the reason for impermanence. Oppression by rise and fall, this is
the reason for being dukkha (suffering or painful). “There is abolition of
conceit in one who takes it thus ‘If formations were permanent, it would be
right to take them as permanent’ and so on.” These paragraphs explain how
conceit and others are removed or not removed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 88 “This is how he comprehends formations by
attributing the three characteristics to them by means of the Immaterial
Septad.” These are seven ways of comprehending the immaterial to be impermanent
and so on.” At this stage both material meditation subject and the immaterial
meditation subject have become familiar to him.” He was very familiar with both
matter and mind or mental things when he comes to this stage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Having thus become familiar with the material and
immaterial meditation subjects, and so having penetrated here already a part of
those 18 Principal Insights which are later on to be attained in all their
aspects by means of Full-Understanding as Abandoning starting with
Contemplation of Dissolution, he consequently abandons things opposed to what
he has already penetrated.” Now 18 principal insights are given here. Some of
them will be described in the section on Contemplation of Dissolution and others
will be explained in the next chapter. So we can just leave them here. They are
called ‘the 18 principal vipassanÈ’, 18 principal insights - contemplation of
the impermanent, contemplation of pain, contemplation of not self,
contemplation of dispassion and so on. We will come to them later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we will go to the Knowledge of Contemplation of Rise and
Fall in paragraph 93 and those following. By practicing comprehension by
groups, comprehension of matter and comprehension of mind in various ways, the
vipassanÈ knowledge in the yogi becomes strong. After that comprehending
knowledge, the yogi goes to the knowledge of contemplation of rise and fall,
contemplation of arising and disappearing. “Having purified his knowledge in
this way by abandoning the perceptions of permanence, etc., which oppose the
contemplations of impermanence, etc., he passes on from Comprehension Knowledge
and begins the task of attaining that of Contemplation of Rise and Fall, which
is expressed thus.” So from here we will from time to time look at the notes. I
think it is like a guide for the following paragraphs. After this first
comprehension knowledge he passes on to Contemplation of Rise and Fall. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“When he does so, he does it first in brief.” He does the
contemplation of rise and fall first in brief and then he does it in detail by
way of conditions and instances. So the first one is a brief method of
contemplation. “When he does so, he does it first in brief. Here is the Text:
‘How is that understanding of contemplating present ‘states’ change is
knowledge of contemplation of rise and fall? ‘Present materiality is born
[materiality] (That means materiality that has been born is present.); the
characteristic of its generation is rise, the characteristic of its change is
fall, the contemplation is knowledge’.” The present materiality is born of
materiality, which has been born, is present. Here ‘present materiality’ is
called ‘born’. That means it is included in the trio of instants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Please see footnote 30 on the next page. “Present
materiality is called ‘born materiality’; it is included in the trio of
instants [of arising, presence and dissolution] is what is meant.” ‘Materiality
that has been born is present’ means materiality that is endowed with three
instants - arising, dissolution and dissolution. That means the real present.
“But that is hard to discern at the start, so the interpreting by insight
should be done by means of presence according to continuity.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To really see the three instants (arising,
present and dissolution) is difficult. So for the beginner it is almost
impossible. Therefor the insight should be done by means of presence according
to continuity. That means the matter in one condition does not go over to
another condition. For example, when you are cold, you have certain kinds of
material properties in your body. Those do not go over to the stage when you
become warm and so on. This is called ‘presence according to continuity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are different kinds of presence (paccupanna or
present). Do you remember that? Sometimes we call the present the whole life.
We call it ‘present’. Right? Also sometimes we call ‘present’ that which lasts
for some time, like the material properties lasting for the time when we are
warm, when we are hot, and when we are cold. For all these different material
properties arise. That is continuity present. And the instant present is the
moment, the momentary present. That is actually the real present, which has the
three sub-moments of arising, present and dissolution. There are three kinds of
present. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can go to chapter 13, paragraph 111. “Present
materiality is born materiality; the characteristic ‘of its generation is rise,
the characteristic of its change is fall, the contemplation is knowledge’.” So
arising is characteristic of its generation and falling is characteristic of
its change. And contemplation is knowledge of present feeling, perception,
formations, consciousness, eye, etc. ‘Present becoming is born’ - that means
becoming that has been born is present. “The characteristic is rise, the
characteristic of change is fall. The contemplation is knowledge.” It is taken
from the PaÔisambhidÈmagga. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Did you notice that it stops with becoming? Because with
respect to ‘etc.’ you have to understand many things. Where do you find
‘becoming’? In Dependent Origination. Right. After becoming what is there?
Birth, old age and death. Right? So please read the end of footnote 30. “For
the elision represented by ‘etc.’ see chapter 20, paragraph 9.” In this case,
however, the last two members of the Dependent Origination are left out.
Although stages possessed of (Please add ‘birth’ there.) birth, aging, and
death are mentioned under the heading of birth and of aging and death in
Comprehension by Groups, etc., nevertheless here in the description of
Knowledge of Rise and Fall, if it were said ‘present birth is born; the
characteristic of its generation is rise, the characteristic of its change is
fall’, etc., it would be tantamount to an affirmation and approval of the
proposition that birth and aging and death were possessed of birth and aging
and death.” That is why they are left out. Birth, aging and death are one thing
and those having birth, aging and death are another. Let us say ignorance as an
example. Ignorance has arising, presence and dissolution. If the author does
not stop at becoming, but goes on to birth, decay and death, then they
themselves will have them or something like that. It is an absurd saying. Birth
possesses birth, aging possesses aging, and death possesses death. That is why
they are left out. So that Text ends with ‘becoming’ in order to avoid that.
Birth is the arising of things. Right? And aging is the deterioration of things
and then dissolution is the disappearing of things. So birth cannot have
another birth although ignorance or formations can have birth, decay and death.
But birth itself cannot have birth, decay and death because it itself is birth.
That is why the last two links are left out here. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 95 “In accordance with the method of this text he
sees the characteristic of generation, the birth, the arising, the aspect of
renewal, of born (‘Mentality’ is missing there.) mentality and materiality, as
‘rise’, and he sees their (not ‘<u>its</u>’) characteristic of change, their
(not ‘<u>its</u>’) destruction, their (not ‘<u>its’</u>) dissolution, as
‘fall’. If you look at the passage in paragraph 94, there is materiality, and
then there is mentioned feeling, there is perception, formations, and
consciousness. And also there are eye, ear and so on. There are many things there.
In accordance with this method in this text he sees the characteristic of
generation or arising. The birth, the arising, the aspect of renewal of born
mentality and materiality, that is both mind and matter, not only matter but
also of mind he sees. So actually the arising of mind and matter as arising he
sees. And he sees their characteristic of change, destruction and dissolution
as fall. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“He understands thus: ‘There is no heap or store of unarisen
mentality-materiality [existing] prior to its arising. When it arises, it does
not come from any heap or store; and when it ceases, it does not go in any
direction. There is nowhere any depository in the way of a heap or store or
hoard of what has ceased” and so on. Then there is the simile. “It (sound) is
brought into being owing to the lute, <u>the lute’s neck</u>, and the man’s
appropriate effort, and having been, it vanishes - so too all material and
immaterial states, not having been, are brought into being, and having been
they vanish.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now ‘the lute’s neck’ - the PÈÄi word here normally means
‘the lute’s neck. But the Sub-Commentary explains it to mean not the lute’s
neck. I think it is called ‘pick’. It is something used to play the string.
They use something. Right? It should be ‘owing to the lute, the pick, and the
man’s appropriate effort, and having been it vanishes’ and so on. The sound
arise only when the lute is played. It is not stored anywhere before it comes
into being. And it is not stored anywhere after it goes out of being. In the
same way mind and matter just arise and before arising they are not stored
anywhere, and after vanishing they are not stored anywhere. That is why at
every moment there is new mind, new matter and so on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Having given attention to rise and fall in brief thus, he
again [does so in detail].” Now it explains in detail. “He sees the rise of
‘the materiality aggregate <u>in the</u> <u>sense of</u> conditioned arising’
thus: With the arising of ignorance there is the arising of materiality.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now what is meant here is that he sees the arising
of materiality by way of its conditions or its causes. So instead of saying ‘in
the sense of conditioned arising’, we should say ‘by the nature of arising of
conditions’. With the arising of ignorance there is arising of materiality.
That means because there is ignorance there is matter. So he sees the arising
of matter by way of its cause. Because of the existence of ignorance there is
arising. With the arising of ignorance there is the arising of materiality.
With the arising of craving, with the arising of kamma there is the arising of
materiality. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“(1) He sees the rise of ‘the materiality aggregate (again)
by the nature of arising of conditions’ thus: With the arising of ignorance
there is the arising of materiality.” So these four are one group and the fifth
is a separate group. “(5) One who sees the rise of generation sees the rise of
materiality aggregate. (Here he just sees the arising of material aggregate not
by way of causes, not by way of the arising of its conditions. He just sees its
arising.) One who ‘sees the rise of the materiality aggregate sees these five
characteristics.” That means four by way of conditions, and one is called ‘by
way of instant’. We will come to that later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“ ‘He sees the fall of the materiality aggregate <u>in the
sense of conditioned cessation</u> thus (Here also we should say ‘by the nature
of cessation of conditions’.)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With the
cessation of ignorance there is the cessation of materiality. (When there is no
ignorance, there is no materiality. So with the cessation of conditions he sees
the cessation of materiality. Or depending on the cessation of causes or
conditions, he sees the cessation of materiality.) With the cessation of
craving.., with the cessation of kamma also.., he sees the fall of the
materiality aggregate - again it should be - by the nature of cessation of
conditions thus. With the cessation of nutriment there is the cessation of
materiality and so on; then (5) one who sees the characteristic of change sees
the fall of the materiality aggregate. (So when one sees change, one sees the
fall of disappearance of materiality.) One who sees the fall of the materiality
aggregate sees these five characteristics’.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Likewise: ‘He sees the rise of the feeling aggregate - the
same thing again - by the nature of arising of conditions’. And then he sees
the fall of feeling aggregates in the five ways. And as in the case of feeling
aggregate, [that is substituting ‘contact’ for the ‘nutriment’ in the case of
materiality,] so for the perception and formations aggregates. So also for the
consciousness aggregate with this difference that for the phrases containing
‘contact’ there are substituted ‘with the arising of mentality-materiality’ and
‘with the cessation of mentality-materiality’.” That is because the fifth aggregate
is consciousness aggregate. In the Dependent Origination depending on mind and
matter consciousness arises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“So there are fifty characteristics stated with the ten in
the case of each aggregate by seeing rise and fall.” There are five ways of
seeing rise and five ways of seeing fall. So all together there are ten in each
aggregate. “By means of which he gives attention in detail according to
condition and according to instant.” ‘According to condition’ means depending
on arising or cessation of conditions, he sees the arising and cessation of
five aggregates. ‘According to the moment’ means seeing the very arising and
the falling of the aggregates. Here he does not see the arising or falling of
conditions, but just the arising and falling of the aggregates themselves. That
is mentioned here as according to instant or moment. “The rise of materiality
is thus; its fall is thus; so it rises, so it falls. As he does so his
knowledge becomes clearer thus: ‘So, it seems, these states, not having been,
are brought into being; having been, they vanish’.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“When he sees rise and fall in two ways: according to
conditions and according to instants, the different Truths, aspects of
Dependent Origination, Methods, and Characteristics, become evident to him.”
Now in the book we should say ‘different Truths’ rather than ‘several Truths’.
Then the author explains what is meant by ‘according to condition’ and what is
meant by ‘according to instant’. That is in paragraph 99. And then with
paragraph 100 and so on here he explains the different Truths, aspects of
Dependent Origination and others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“When he sees rise and fall in the two ways, according to
condition and according to instant thus, the Truth of Origination becomes
evident to him (‘The Truth of Origination’ means the Second Noble Truth, the
Origin of Suffering.) through seeing rise according to condition owing to his
discovery of the progenitor. (When he sees the rise and fall in two ways,
according to condition and according to instants, then the Second Truth becomes
evident to him.) The Truth of Suffering becomes evident to him through seeing
rise and fall according to instant (now here according to instant) owing to his
discovery of the suffering <u>due to</u> birth (We should say ‘which is birth’.
Suffering and birth are the same here. It is not ‘<u>due to’</u> birth.) The
Truth of Cessation becomes evident to him through seeing fall according to
condition owing to his discovery of the non-arising of things produced by
conditions when their conditions do not arise. The Truth of Suffering becomes
evident to him too through seeing fall according to instant owing to his
discovery of the suffering which is death. And his seeing of rise and fall
becomes evident to him as the Truth of Path thus: ‘This is the mundane path’
owing to abolition of confusion about it.” So all the Four Noble Truths become
evident to him through seeing rise and fall of the aggregates in two ways:
according to condition and according to instant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The Dependent Origination in forward order becomes evident
to him through seeing rise according to condition owing to his discovery that
‘When this exists, that comes to be’. The Dependent Origination in reverse
order becomes evident to him through seeing fall according to condition owing
to his discovery that ‘When this does not exist that does not come to be’.
Dependently arisen states become evident to him through seeing rise and fall
according to instant owing to his discovery of the characteristic of the
formed; for the things possessed of rise and fall are formed and conditionally
arisen.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So seeing the five aggregates,
things, the rise and fall of five aggregates in this way makes him understand
more clearly the Dependent Origination in forward order and reverse order and
also the states mentioned in the Dependent Origination which are called
‘dependently arisen states’. That means actually all that are mentioned in the
Dependent Origination. Everything mentioned in the Dependent Origination arises
from some other conditions. So they are all dependently arisen states. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The Method of Identity becomes evident to him through
seeing rise according to condition” and so on. Do you remember the four methods
with which to understand the Dependent Origination? Go back to chapter 17,
paragraph 309. There are four methods of treating the meaning. They are Method
of Identity, the Method of Diversity, the Method of Uninterest, and the Method
of Ineluctable Regularity. So these are the four methods by which we should
understand Dependent Origination or understand things. These methods become
evident to one who sees rise and fall of aggregates in two ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The Method of Identity becomes evident to him through
seeing rise according to condition owing to his discovery of unbroken
continuity in the connection of cause with fruit.” There is connection of cause
and fruition, causes and effect. So when one sees the arising according to
condition, that means because there is this condition, there is the fruit;
because this is condition, there is fruit of it and so on. When he sees it, he
understands it by way of the Method of Identity. That means there is the
continuation of cause and effect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Then he more thoroughly abandons the annihilation view.”
When he sees this, he abandons the annihilation view; that means he abandons
the view that a being is annihilated as death. Nothing arises after death. So
he abandons this view when he sees arising according to condition. Because
there is condition there is that which arises depending on that condition. So
this condition and fruit condition and fruit connection goes on and on and on.
So there is some kind of identity in this continuity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The Method of Diversity becomes evident to him through
seeing rise according to instant (At every instant there is arising.), owing to
his discovery that each [state] is new [as it arises].” Although there is some
kind of continuity, each one is a new one. Since everything is new, new at
every moment, there is no permanency in the states. When he sees rising
according to instant, then he can abandon the eternity view that things are
permanent. That is because at every moment there is a new thing arising, and an
old thing is disappearing, and so there can be no permanency in those states.
He sees that. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The Method of Uninterestedness becomes evident to him through
seeing rise and fall according to condition owing to his discovery of the
inability of states to have mastery exercised over them. Then he more
thoroughly abandons the self-view.” If it is to be called ‘self’, then it must
be able to exercise its authority over it. But now they just rise and fall; the
states just rise and fall, and nobody can exercise authority over them, saying
to be permanent or whatever. When he sees rising and falling according to
condition, then he is able to abandon the self-view, the view that there is
permanent self.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The Method of Ineluctable Regularity becomes evident to him
through seeing rise according to condition owing to his discovery of the
arising of the fruit when the suitable conditions are there. Then he more thoroughly
abandons the moral-inefficacy-of-action view.” That means whatever you do does
not amount to kamma. So he is able to abandon that view because he sees the
arising of aggregates or arising of states according to conditions. Because of
this condition there is this fruit. And this fruit is from this condition only,
not from any other condition. So he is able to abandon the wrong view that even
though you do something, it doesn’t amount to doing anything, any kamma or
whatever. Now here we have finished the Four Methods with regard to Dependent
Origination. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The characteristic of not-self becomes evident to him
through seeing rise according to condition owing to his discovery that states
have no curiosity (‘The states that have no curiosity’ really means that they
have no effort of their own.) and that their existence depends upon
conditions.” In this paragraph there are two things that we should note. That
is characteristic of individual essence and the characteristic of what is
formed. I want you to understand these two, characteristic of individual
essence and the characteristic of what is formed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>‘Characteristic of individual essence’ means characteristics
that they do not share with any other states. Let us take as an example
contact. Contact has the characteristic of impinging on the object. That
characteristic is for contact only, not for feeling, and not for perception and
so on. So they are called the individual characteristic or the individual
essence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>‘The characteristic of what is formed’ means the
impermanent, suffering and no-self nature. They are called the characteristic
of what is formed. They are actually<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>common characteristics of conditioned phenomena. Everything that is
conditioned has these three characteristics (arising, present and dissolution).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A yogi comes to see both characteristic of individual
essence and the characteristic of what is formed when he practices vipassanÈ
meditation. These two become evident to him owing to his discovery of the
non-existence of fall at the instant of rise and the non-existence of rise at
the instant of fall. When there is rising, there is no falling. When there is
falling, there is no rising. When he discovers this, then the characteristic of
what is formed and the characteristic of individual essence become clear to
him. Here only rise and fall are mentioned, not the intermediate stage. Right?
So footnote 32 says “The inclusion of only rise and fall here is because this
kind of knowledge occurs as seeing only rise and fall, not because of non-existence
of the instant of presence.” That is because in vipassanÈ the yogis see the
rising and falling. That is why rising and falling are mentioned here, not
because the intermediate stage is non-existent. There is the intermediate stage
that is called ‘present’. But in vipassanÈ meditation only rising and
disappearing are seen by yogis. That is why these two only are mentioned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“When the different truths, aspects of the Dependent
Origination, methods, and characteristics, have become evident to him thus,
then formations appear to him as <u>perpetually renewed</u>.” I want to say
‘always new’ instead of saying ‘<u>perpetually</u> <u>renewed</u>’ because they
are not ‘renewed’. Actually at every moment there is a new phenomenon existing;
it is not that something is renewed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Then how do things stay the same? Do you mean that
all mind and matter, all states are new? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: In the place of the old one which has disappeared,
a new one takes its place. It is of the same nature, of the same kind. Let us
say something like not one glass, but many glasses as an example. So when one
glass disappears, then you put another glass there. We can say the same in the
sense that the one disappears, a glass disappears, and the one that is there
now is also a glass. But they are different. The one is removed and the other
is put in its place. In the same way one material property disappears and
another takes its place, another of the same kind or similar kind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“ ‘So these states, it seems, being previously unarisen,
arise, and being arisen, they cease’. And they are not only always new (not ‘<u>perpetually</u>’),
but they are also short-lived like dew-drops at sunrise, like a bubble on
water, like a line drawn on water, like a mustard seed on an awl’s point, like
a lightning flash. And they appear without core, like a conjuring trick, like a
mirage, like a dream, like a circle of a whirling firebrand (Some of these
similes are not mentioned in the discourses. We cannot trace them.), like a
goblin city, like froth, like a plantain trunk, and so on.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now goblin city - do you know goblin city? It is lie a city
created by goblins, or ghosts, or some spirits. Sometimes you find yourself in
a house, in a big building. Then next morning you find yourself lying on the
ground. Nothing of the house you experienced during the night can be seen. So
that kind of experience happened to many people. I don’t know if they happen
here too. So they are called ‘goblin cities’. That means just cities or
whatever that are made to appear as real to human beings. Maybe in the movies
you find some things like these. A person enters the house and he enjoys the
food in the house or whatever. And in the morning he finds himself lying on the
ground, something like that. That is called ‘goblin city’. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“At this point he has attained tender insight knowledge (It
is still tender.) called ‘Contemplation of Rise and Fall’, which has become
established by penetrating the fifty characteristics in this manner: ‘Only what
is subject to fall arises; and <u>to be arisen</u> <u>necessitates fall’</u>.”
I don’t think that is acceptable. “Only what is subject to fall arises and what
has arisen naturally falls.” It should be something like that. “With the
attainment of this he is known as a ‘beginner of insight’.” Only when you
attain to this stage are you called a ‘beginner of insight’. Before that you
are not an official beginner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we have Imperfections of Insight or Impediments of
Insight. “When a yogi reaches this stage, the ten imperfections or impurities
of insight arise in him.” These are the obstacles to progress, obstacles to the
attainment, obstacles to enlightenment. That is because if a yogi takes them to
be enlightenment, then he would not practice any further and so he will not get
to enlightenment. These are called ‘Imperfections of Insight’; in PÈÄi they are
called the ‘Impurities of Insight’. There are ten of them. “They are: (1)
illumination, (2) knowledge, (3) rapturous happiness (That means pÊti.), (4)
tranquillity, (5) bliss, (6) resolution, (7) exertion, (8) <u>assurance</u> (I
would say ‘establishment’.), (9) equanimity, (10) attachment.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So these ten things happen or arise in a person who has
reached this stage of contemplating rise and fall. These imperfections “do not
arise either in a Noble Disciple who has reached penetration [of the Truths
(That means in ones who have gained enlightenment.) or in persons erring in
virtue, neglectful of their meditation subject and idlers.” They arise only in
one who is practicing meditation, “who keeps the right course, devotes himself
continuously to his meditation subject and is a beginner of insight.” So these
ten will not arise in Noble Disciples and also will not arise in those who do
not practice meditation. There are ten. And these ten are explained one by one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So let’s go to illumination. “Illumination is illumination
due to insight. When it arises, the meditator thinks ‘Such illumination never
arose in me before. I have surely reached the Path, reached Fruition’, thus he
takes what is not Path to be the Path and what is<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>not fruition to be Fruition. When he takes
what is not the Path to be the Path and what is not Fruition to be Fruition,
the course of his insight is interrupted (because he will not practice any
more). He drops his basic meditation subject and sits enjoying the illumination.”
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But this illumination arises in one bhikkhu illuminating
only as much as the seat he is sitting on; in another, the interior of his
room; in another, the exterior of his room; in another, the whole monastery; a
quarter league.., a half league.., a league.., two leagues.., three leagues; in
another bhikkhu it arises making a single light from the earth’s surface up to
the BrahmÈ World. But in the Blessed One it arose illuminating the
ten-thousand-fold-world-element.” And then there is a story. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now please read footnote 34. “ ‘Illumination due to insight’
is the luminous materiality originated by insight consciousness, and that
originated by temperature belonging to his own continuity (That means in his
body.). Of these, that originated by insight consciousness is bright and is
found only in the meditator’s body. The other kind <u>is</u> <u>independent of
his body</u>.” I don’t want to say that. “The other kind leaves his body and
spreads all round according to the power of his knowledge.” Here the
translation is not so good. “And it is manifest to him only”, not ‘<u>too</u>’.
I would say “It is manifest to him only and he sees anything material in the
place touched by it.” So the illumination is manifest only to him. Others won’t
see the illumination. And he sees anything material in the place touched by it.
But he would see things illuminated by that bright light. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then the Sub-Commentary raises a question. Does he see
with eye consciousness or mind consciousness? Then it says it should be said to
be seeing with mind consciousness. That means he does not see with his physical
eyes, but with his mind he sees things touched by or illuminated by that bright
light. And then there comes the story of two Elders. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next is knowledge. “Knowledge is knowledge due to insight.
As he is estimating and judging material and immaterial states perhaps
knowledge that is unerring ( ‘Unerring’ means undeterred.), keen, incisive and
very sharp arises in him, like a lightning flash.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Rapturous happiness (pÊti) due to insight. Perhaps at that
time the five kinds of happiness, namely, minor happiness, momentary happiness,
showering happiness, uplifting happiness, and pervading (rapturous) happiness,
arise in him filling his whole body.” Do you remember the five mentioned in
chapter 4, paragraph 94 and so on? Then there are tranquillity, bliss,
resolution, exertion, and then assurance. Assurance is literally establishment.
So ‘assurance’ really means mindfulness. His mindfulness is very strong at this
point. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Equanimity is both equanimity about insight and equanimity
in adverting. For equanimity about insight, which is neutrality about
formations, arises strongly in him at that time. So does equanimity in
adverting in the mind door”, not ‘<u>it is also’</u>. That means<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>equanimity in adverting in the mind door also
arises strongly in him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then attachment, that is real attachment. Now paragraph
124 “Here illumination, etc., are called imperfections because they are the
basis for imperfection, not because they are [kammically] unprofitable (not because
they are akusala). But attachment is both an imperfection and the basis for
imperfection.” So the last one is real akusala because it is lobha
(attachment). The other nine are not akusala but they are grounds for akusala.
They are conditions for akusala because when the yogi has illumination, then he
will be attached to the illumination and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“As basis only they amount to ten; but with the different
ways of taking them they come to thirty.” By false view, by conceit, and by way
of attachment, they become thirty. So each one can be taken by way of false
view, by way of conceit, and by way of attachment. A skillful meditator is not
deceived by these. So he sees that they are impermanent and so on and they are
not the right path to attainment, to enlightenment. So he decides here that the
illumination and so on are not the right path, but the practice of vipassanÈ
only is the right path. He decides this. When he decides this and this
knowledge is established in him, then he is said to have reached the knowledge
and vision of what is the Path and what is not the Path. A person, a yogi,
after reaching the contemplation of rise and fall will encounter these
impediments. When he encounters these impediments, he must be able to see them
as impediments and as signs of enlightenment and so on. If he takes them to be
the signs of enlightenment, then he will stop here. He will not go any further.
And so he will be deprived of progress in insight and enlightenment. And at
this point the three truths are defined and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the end of chapter 20. It is not the end of
Contemplation of Rise and Fall. We have to go further with the Contemplation of
Rise and Fall. But one Purity ends here, that is Purification by Knowledge and
Vision of what is the Path and what is not the Path. Because the yogi is
practicing contemplation on rise and fall and when he reaches to a certain
level of the contemplation of rise and fall, these impediments come. When he is
disturbed by this impediments, he could not see rise and fall really very
clearly. So he has to practice again to see rise and fall clearly. So
contemplation of rise and fall does not end here; it will go over to the next
chapter. But the Purification of Knowledge and Vision of What is Path and What
is not the Path ends here. There is overlapping of purity and vipassanÈ
knowledge. If you look at the handout, you will see it clearly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Could you explain some way we could work with
seeing rise and fall? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: At first you do not try to see the rising and falling;
you try to get good concentration. So you try to be mindful of what is
happening at the present moment. Later on the arising and disappearing of
things you observe will become evident to you. So what is important is to get
the necessary amount of concentration. As your concentration gets better, then
you will come to see the rising and falling, rising and falling. First we have
to see the things clearly. Right? After that, we see this is arising and this
is falling or it is not arising and it is not falling. Before we see the real
arising and falling, we have to see the thing itself.</p>
