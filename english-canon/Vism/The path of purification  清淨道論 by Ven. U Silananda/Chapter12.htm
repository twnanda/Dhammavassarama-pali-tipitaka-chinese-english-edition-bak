<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Chapter 12</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>(Tape 25 / Ps: 1-44)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chapter 12 deals with the supernormal powers, direct
knowledge. We have a glimpse of direct knowledge in the previous chapter. In
this chapter the different kinds of direct knowledge are explained. In this
chapter there are a lot of stories. What we should note is that there are five
kinds of direct knowledge. In paragraph 2 they are listed as 1. Performing some
kinds of miracles, 2. The knowledge of the Divine Ear (That means hearing
sounds far away, hearing sounds that cannot normally be heard.), 3. The
knowledge of Penetration of Minds (That means reading other peopleís minds.),
4. The knowledge of Recollection of Past<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>Lives, 5. The knowledge of Passing<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>Away and Reappearance of Beings. These are called direct knowledge. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the meditator wants to achieve the supernormal powers, he
must achieve the eight attainments (the eight jh»nas) on each of the eight
kasi”as ending with the white kasi”a. That is the first eight kasi”as and the
last two are left out. What are the last two?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>Space and light. Space is left out because it cannot be the basis for
attaining immaterial jh»nas. The Sub-Commentary explains that the light kasi”a
is to be taken as the same as white kasi”a. In the Visuddhi Magga only eight
kasi”as are mentioned. The sub-Commentary says that we can also take the light
kasi”a, that it is included in the white kasi”a.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You have to make yourself very familiar with the kasi”as and
the jh»nas. There are 14 ways to make yourself familiar with these jh»nas. That
is in the order of the kasi”as, in the reverse order of the kasi”as and so on.
So you enter into jh»na on this kasi”a, and then the next jh»na on this kasi”a,
and the next jh»na on this kasi”a. Then again you enter into first jh»na on
this kasi”a and then first jh»na on another kasi”a and so on. It is in order to
make you very familiar with the jh»nas and the kasi”as that you have to go in
many different ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the end of paragraph 10 the Giribha”…avahana offering is
mentioned and there is a footnote. In P»ƒi the word for an island and a lamp is
the same. It is the word ëd paí. He took d pap|j» to mean island offering. It
is a light offering. During that festival lights are offered at different
places ìstarting with the Cetiyagiri and extending over the whole island and up
to a league in the sea.î That is light offering festival, not island offering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are many stories in this chapter. Some of the stories
have been given already in the chapters that we have read. Many may be new to
you. I want to give you the page numbers of some stories if you want to read in
more detail. At the end of paragraph 28 a reference is given for the Dhammapada
Commentary. If you have the book Buddhist Legends, you may read part 2, page
238. At the end of paragraph 29 no reference is given, but I have the
reference. Please read Buddhist Legends, part 3, page 179. Then at the end of
paragraph 32 you may read Middle Length Sayings, first volume, page 396. At the
end of paragraph 33 the reference may be found in Buddhist Legends, part 2,
page 246. For the next paragraph the reference can be found in Buddhist
Legends, part 3, page 103. For paragraph 35 the story may be found in Buddhist
Legends, part 1, page 286. Paragraph 41 the first reference can be found in
Buddhist Legends, part 3, page 319. The second reference is in Buddhist
Legends, part 3, page 327. The third reference in this paragraph may be found
in Buddhist Legends, part 1, page 256. The last reference in this paragraph may
be found in Buddhist legends, part 3, page 130. Then at the end of paragraph 42
you may find that reference in Buddhist legends, part 2, page 59. these are the
references.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the end of paragraph 41 it says ì<u>made of the seven
gems</u>.î Actually it is made of the seven precious things. The seven precious
things are gold, silver and other jewels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the part that we have covered the ten kinds of success
power (iddhi) are given. All of them are interesting. So if you have time
please study it again. There is one thing that is very interesting. In paragraph
26 ìA distinction brought about by the influence of knowledge either before the
arising of the knowledge or after it or at that moment is called success by
intervention of knowledge.î If a person is going to become an Arahant in that
life, he will not die without becoming an Arahant. The<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>knowledge of Arahantship which he is going to
acquire in that life protects him from being killed even though an attempt is
made on his life. That is a very strange thing. If you are going to become an
Arahant, you will not die without becoming an Arahant. Nothing can cause you to
be killed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first story is of Venerable Bakkula. In this story he
was swallowed by a fish. His mother was bathing him in the river and he was
swallowed by a fish. The fish was caught by a fisherman and sold to a lady. The
lady wanted to cook the fish, so she cut it open and found the child still
alive there. So he did not die in the stomach of the fish because he was
destined to reach enlightenment in that life. Thatís why he was not killed.
Normally he would not survive being swallowed by a fish.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next story is about Venerable Sa~kicca. While he was in
the womb, his mother died. As was the custom in those days they tried to
cremate the body. When they cremate the body, they use sticks. One stick hit
the child. He made a noise. When they heard the noise, they cut open the belly
of the woman and got the child. He was named Sa~kicca because he was injured by
the stick which is called in P»ƒi sa~ku. That is why he was called Sa~kicca.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So many stories are given. There is also the story of
Bh|tap»la. Also those who are in attainment cannot be harmed. Such stories
begin in paragraph 30. Venerable S»riputta was in attainment and so no harm
could come to him. It is a similar case with Venerable Sa“j va and so on. I
think we had reference to the devotee Uttara some weeks back and also to
Samm»vati. They are to us miracles. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These miracles are caused by the intervention of
concentration or the intervention of knowledge and so on. These are interesting
stories. Some are not caused by any concentration or any meditation. The fact
that birds can fly is also called a success or miracle. They got that ability
just by birth, just by being born as a bird. So they can fly and we cannot. So
these ten kinds of success are mentioned in the first part of this chapter. OK.</p>

</span>(Tape 26 / Ps: 45 - 118)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Up until paragraph 45 the ten kinds of success were
described. Among them the first one is ìonly (1) success by resolve is actually
mentioned in the clause ëkinds of supernormal power (success)íî- it is from the
Texts - ìbut (2) success as transformations and (3) success as the mind-made
[body] are needed in this sense as well.î In the clause ëkinds of supernormal
power or supernormal successí we should take not only one but three of the
kinds of success mentioned above. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now the Commentator goes on explaining the other clauses in
the Text. ìTo the kinds of supernormal power: to the components of supernormal
power, or to the departments of supernormal power.î That means the constituents
of supernormal power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHe directs, he inclines, his mind: When that bhikkhuís
consciousness has become the basis for direct knowledge in the way already
described, he directs the preliminary work consciousness with the purpose of
attaining the kinds of<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>supernormal
power, he sends it in the direction of the kinds of supernormal power, leading
it away from the kasi”a as its object.î In order to do a supernormal thing
first the meditator enters into jh»nas. He makes the fourth jh»na of the
fourfold method the basis of supernormal . power or supernormal knowledge. The
bhikkhuís consciousness has become the basis for direct knowledge in the way
already described. ìHe directs the preliminary work consciousness with the
purpose of attaining the kinds of supernormal power.î After entering into the
fourth jh»na, he emerges from the fourth jh»na. Then he does the preparation work
for the supernormal knowledge. ëPreliminary work consciousnessí means
k»m»vacara (sense-sphere) consciousness. ìHe sends it in the direction of the
kinds of supernormal power.î That means he inclines his mind towards that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìInclines: makes it tend and lean towards the supernormal
power to be attained.î These are word explanations, so they are repetitive.
ìHe: the bhikkhu who has done the directing of his mind in this way. The
various: varied, of different sorts. Kinds of supernormal power: departments of
supernormal power. Wields: paccanubhoti - paccanubhavati (alternative form).î
Sometimes it cannot be translated into English or another language because the
two words are just variations. The second word is just a variation of the first
word. There is no difference in meaning. Paccanubhoti and paccanubhavati are
the same. In the first word the ëAí should be short, not long. The only
difference between the words is that one is ending in ëbhotaí and the other is
ending in ëbhavatií. It is just a grammatical peculiarity. ìThe meaning is that
he makes contact with, realizes, reaches.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Commentator is going to show us one by one the
supernormal powers a monk may perform. ìNow in order to show that variousness,
it is said: ëHaving been one, [he becomes many; having been many, he becomes
oneí.î Actually this Text has not been given in full in the Visuddhi Magga
because the Commentator takes it that his readers already know this passage. We
are lucky that the translator gives us the full Text here. That is why the
brackets appear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHaving been one, [he becomes many; having been many, he
becomes one.î That means he multiplies himself. He will create many likenesses
of himself, hundreds or thousands. &quot;He appears and vanishes. He goes
unhindered through walls, through enclosures, through mountains, as though in
open space. He dives in and out of the earth as though in water. He goes on
unbroken water as though on earth. Seated cross-legged he travels in space like
a winged bird. With his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so mighty
and powerful. He wields bodily mastery even as far as the Brahm» World.î This
is taken from the D gha Nik»ya.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now the Commentator will explain one by one. ìHerein, having
been one: having been normally one before giving effect to the supernormal
power.î A monk is only one, but here he is going to make likenesses of himself.
He is going to create images. ìHe becomes many: wanting to walk with many or
wanting to do a recital or wanting to ask questions with many, he becomes a hundred
or a thousand. But how does he do this? He accomplishes (1) the four planes,
(2) the four bases (roads), (3) the eight steps, (4) the sixteen roots of
supernormal power and then he (5) resolves with knowledge.î Here ëplanesí means
stories, as in one story, two stories high and so on. The P»ƒi word used is
bh|mi. ëBh|mií can mean planes of existence as well as floors in a building.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe four planes should be understood as the four jh»nas.î
The four jh»nas are said to be the four planes or the four stages for the
supernormal power. Four jh»nas here is according to the fourfold method.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìFor this has been said by the General of the Dhamma.î That
means the Elder S»riputta. Venerable S»riputta was called ëthe General of the
Dhammaí by other monks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìWhat are the four planes of supernormal power?î This is
taken from the Pa‘isambhid»magga. You will find the reference in the middle of
paragraph 49.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd he reaches supernormal power by becoming light,
malleable and wieldy in body after steeping himself in blissful perception and
light perception due to the pervasion of happiness and pervasion of bliss,
which is why the first three jh»nas should be understood as the accessory plane
since they lead to the obtaining of supernormal power in this manner. But the fourth
is the natural plane for obtaining supernormal power.î That means he enters
into first jh»na, second jh»na, third jh»na and fourth jh»na. ìThe fourth jh»na
is the natural plane for obtaining supernormal power.î That means the fourth
jh»na is the basis for supernormal power. Without entering into and emerging
from the fourth jh»na, nobody can exercise the supernormal powers. ëThe four
planesí mean the four jh»nas, the four material jh»nas. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe four bases (roads) should be understood as the four
bases of success.î The P»ƒi word is iddhip»da, roads to power. Here ëroadsí
means just causes of.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìFor this is said: ëWhat are the four bases for success?
Here a bhikkhu develops the basis for success (road to power) that possesses
both concentration due to zeal and the will to strive; he develops the basis
for success (road to power) that possesses both concentration due to energy and
the will to strive; he develops the basis for success (road to power) that
possesses both concentration due to [natural purity of] consciousness and the
will to strive; he develops the basis for success (road to power) that
possesses both concentration due to inquiry and the will to strive.î ëInquiryí
really means pa““» (knowledge), not just inquiring. The P»ƒi word is v ma—s».<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>The Sanskrit word is m ma—s». ëM ma—s»í means
investigation. Here ëinvestigationí does not necessarily mean just to
investigate, but it means to investigate and understand correctly. It is the
name for pa““».</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThese four bases for success lead to the obtaining of
supernormal power.. to the fearlessness due to supernormal powerî and so on.
What are these four? Did you get four?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>Zeal is one thing. The P»ƒi word is chanda. It is just the will-to-do.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>Chanda has two meanings - sometimes it is
just the will-to-do and sometimes it is the desire for sensual things. Here it
is just the will-to-do, not the desire for sensual things. The first one is
chanda. The second one is energy (viriya). The third is consciousness (citta).
And the fourth is inquiry or pa““». These four are called ëiddhip»da, roads to
power or causes of power. So a person has to develop these four qualities in
order to get supernormal power. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd here the concentration that has zeal as its cause, or
has zeal outstanding, is concentration due to zeal.î That means zeal which is
prominent. ìThis is a term for concentration obtained by giving precedence to
zeal consisting in desire to act.î It is just the desire to act. It is not
attachment to sensual things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìWill (formation) as endeavor is will to strive.î This is
the word explanation. ìThis is a term for the energy of right endeavor
accomplishing its fourfold function.î Among the 37 constituents of
enlightenment there are the four great efforts. Here they are called ëright
endeavorí. They are trying to get rid of akusala that has arisen in the past,
avoiding akusala, getting kusala, and developing kusala. With regard to akusala
there are two kinds of endeavor and also with regard to kusala there are two
kinds of endeavor. ìPossesses: is furnished with concentration due to zeal and
with the [four] instances of the will to strive.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìRoad to power (basis for success): The meaning is the total
of consciousness and its remaining concomitants [except the concentration and
the will], which are, in the sense of resolve, the road to (basis for) the
concentration due to zeal and will to strive associated with the direct
knowledge consciousness, which latter are themselves termed ëpower (success)í
either by treatment as ëproductioní or in the sense of<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>ësucceedingí or by treatment in this way,
ëbeings succeed by its means, thus they are successful; they are enriched,
promotedí.î It is still hard to understand this passage. This phrase, ëroad to
powerí, has two words, ëroadí and ëpowerí. In P»ƒi the words are ëiddhií and
ëp»daí. ëIddhií means simply energy and concentration. Here they are called
ëiddhi (success or power)í. ëP»daí really means their basis. Their basis is
what? Consciousness and its remaining concomitants. It is not accurate here. It
should be the remaining consciousness and its concomitants. In order to
understand this you have to understand supernormal power consciousness. When a
person achieves this power, there arises in his mind a kind of consciousness.
That kind of consciousness is called ësupernormal power consciousnessí. Along
with that consciousness there are mental factors, many mental factors. Among
them the two, concentration and energy, are called ëiddhií here. The
consciousness and the other mental factors are called ëroadí or ëpowerí (p»da).
By the compound word ëiddhip»daí is meant the supernormal power consciousness
and its concomitants. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe meaning is,î- ëtotal is not a good here and there is no
ëtotalí in the original - ìconsciousness and its concomitants [except the
concentration and the <u>will</u>],î - ëwillí here means actually energy, not
chanda - ìwhich are, in the sense of <u>resolve</u>,î - in the sense of basis,
not in the sense of resolve. ìIn the sense of basis the road to the
concentration due to zeal and will to strive associated with the direct

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Will to strive?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: ëWill to striveí means -</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Citta?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: No. it is energy or effort. ëWill to striveí really
means striving.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Viriya?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: The word used here is not simply viriya. There are
two compound words used here - chanda sam»dhi and padh»na sa~kh»ra. ëChanda
sam»dhií means sam»dhi caused by chanda and chanda is will. ëPadh»na sa~kh»raí
means striving, striving formation. That means viriya (energy or effort). They are
explained in paragraph 51. ìWill as endeavor is will to strive.î It is not
chanda here. It is viriya. Concentration and energy are called ëiddhií here and
consciousness and the other remaining concomitants are called ëp»da (road)í. So
ëiddhip»daí means the direct knowledge consciousness and the concomitants and
then concentration and energy. This is just the word explanation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìOr alternatively: it is arrived at by means of that thus
that is a road; it is reached, is the meaning.î That meaning is arrived at.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIddhip»da = iddhiy» p»da (resolution of compound) this is a
term for zeal, etc., according as it is said.î Iddhip»da is made to mean the
four things - will-to-do, energy, consciousness, and inquiry or pa““».</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: What is the P»ƒi word for consciousness?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Citta. Next paragraph 54 ìThe eight steps should be
understood as the eight beginning with zeal.î Actually there are only four
roads to success, but here concentration is combined with each, so we have
eight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIf a bhikkhu obtains concentration, obtains unification of
mind, supported by zeal, then the zeal is not the concentration; the
concentration is not the zeal. The zeal is one, the concentration is another.î
So we get two here, zeal and concentration. In the next sentence we have energy
and concentration. In the next we have consciousness and concentration. Last we
have inquiry and concentration. So we have eight steps or we can call them
eight causes. These eight steps one has to perform, by just trying to get into
jh»na and developing them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 55 we have the sixteen roots. ìThe mindís
unperturbedness should be understood in sixteen modes, for this is said.î Here
the sixteen modes are given. ìWhat are the sixteen roots of success (power)?î
Undejected consciousness, this is one. Unelated consciousness, this is another.
Unattracted consciousness is another and so on. There are sixteen all together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In about the middle of the paragraph ìConsciousness rid of
barriers is not perturbed by the barrier of defilement.î Here ëconsciousness
with barriersí means the distractions that come in between the moments of
sam»dhi. It is not moments of sam»dhi following one after the other. There are
something like buffers between moments of sam»dhi. When a personís sam»dhi is
not yet good, he will have these distractions or thoughts in between the
sam»dhi moments. If it is like that, it is called ëconsciousness with
barriersí. If the sam»dhi is one uninterrupted flow, it is called
ëconsciousness rid of barriersí. Here ëconsciousnessí means consciousness
accompanied by concentration, concentrated consciousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 56 ìOf course, this meaning is already established
by the words ëWhen his concentrated mindí, etc., too, but it is stated again
for the purpose of showing that the first jh»na, etc., are the <u>three</u>
planesî - let us strike out ëthreeí. There is no word for ëthreeí in the
original and it does not fit here. There are four planes, not three. So the
first jh»na, etc., are the planes of success to supernormal power, bases of,
steps of and roots of success to supernormal power. In order to show that it is
mentioned again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd the first-mentioned method is the one given in the
Suttas, but this is how it is given in the Pa‘isambhid»magga.î There are two
kinds of treatment. The one is given in the Suttas and the other is given in
the Pa‘isambhid»magga. The Pa‘isambhid»magga is said to be later than the
Suttas. It is ascribed to Venerable S»riputta. If that is true, it may not be
so much later than the Suttas. The Pa‘isambhid»magga is something like a
Commentary, but not exactly a Commentary. It resembles a Commentary on some
teachings in the Suttas. Venerable Buddhaghosa has very great respect for that
book, the Pa‘isambhid»magga. Whenever he wrote about meditation, he always
quoted from the Pa‘isambhid»magga. So we have many quotations in the Visuddhi
Magga from the Pa‘isambhid»magga. Today we will find many quotes. ìSo it is
stated again for the purpose of avoiding confusion in each of the two
instances.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 57 ìHe resolves with knowledge.î These words also
appear in paragraph 48. ìWhen he has accomplished these things consisting of
planes, bases (roads), steps, and roots, of success (to supernormal power),
then he attains jh»na as the basis for direct knowledge and emerges from it.î
Here the author is describing how one goes about it until one reaches the
direct knowledge consciousness. What is the first thing to do? He obtains jh»na
as the basis for direct knowledge and emerges from it. So first he attains
first jh»na, second jh»na, third jh»na, and the fourth jh»na. Then he makes
that a basis for direct knowledge and emerges from it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThen if he wants to become a hundred, he does the
preliminary work thus ëlet me become a hundred, let me become a hundredí.î That
is the second stage. That is called ëthe preliminary workí. That is done by
k»m»vacara consciousness, not by r|p»vacara consciousness. Then he enters into
jh»na and in jh»na only r|p»vacara consciousness arises. Then he emerges from
jh»na and does the preliminary work ëLet me become a hundred, let me become a
hundredí. He does this with cittas belonging to the sense-sphere. ìAfter which
he again attains the jh»na.î Again he enters into jh»na, the fourth jh»na, as a
basis for direct knowledge. Then he emerges from it and resolves. So he makes a
determination then. ìHe becomes<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>a
hundred simultaneously with the resolving consciousness.î That ëresolving
consciousnessí really means direct knowledge. There are four stages. First
there is the basic jh»na. Then there is preliminary work. And again there is
basic jh»na. And last there is direct knowledge. So there are four stages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIf he does not succeed in this way, he should do the
preliminary work again, and attain, emerge, and resolve, a second time. For it
is said in the Sa—yutta Commentary that it is allowable to attain once or
twice.î He may try once or twice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHerein, the basic jh»na consciousness has the sign as its
object.î ëSigní means the counterpart sign. The object of jh»nas is the
counterpart sign. The object of basic jh»na consciousness is the counterpart
sign.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBut the preliminary work consciousnesses have the hundred
as their object or the thousand as their object.î Preliminary work is done by
k»m»vacara consciousness. So the counterpart sign is not the object of these
cittas. If he wants to become a hundred, then a hundred is the object. If he
wants to become a thousand, then a thousand is the object.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd these latter are objects as appearances, not as
concepts.î ëAppearancesí means visible objects - just as visible objects and
not as concepts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe resolving consciousness has likewise the hundred as its
object or the thousand as its object.î ëResolving consciousnessí really means
direct knowledge consciousness. So it has a hundred or a thousand as its
object.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThat arises once only, next to change-of-lineage
[consciousness], as in the case of absorption consciousness already described.î
It is said that the direct knowledge consciousness arises only once and then
disappears. Jh»na consciousness at the first attainment arises only once and
then disappears. Later on when that person wants to spend some time with jh»na
only, he enters into that jh»na. At that time jh»na citta may arise in
succession for one hour, two hours, or the whole day. This direct knowledge consciousness
arises only once. It is actually a kind of fourth jh»na consciousness. It is
not the same as the fourth jh»na consciousness, but it is reckoned as fourth
jh»na consciousness. The difference is that direct knowledge consciousness does
not take the counterpart sign as object. It takes the hundred appearances or
the thousand appearances, or whatever it may be as object. That is the
difference.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: It takes the same object as the k»m»vacara
consciousness?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Same as the preliminary consciousness, right. Here
the preliminary consciousness takes a hundred or a thousand as object. The
direct knowledge consciousness also takes that object.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This page is important for Abhidhamma students when they
read the ninth chapter. In the ninth chapter the direct knowledge is treated
very briefly. Students may take something from here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Iím not understanding the difference between
appearance and concept. Appearance seems like a concept.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: ëAppearanceí means - you know paramattha (ultimate
reality). What it takes is something like color. When we see something, we
actually see color. We see with our eyes the color. Then we think we see a form
or a shape. That is we think that we see them or we see with manodv»r»vajjana
mentally the shape or form. But what we really see is the visible data. In the
same way what the preliminary consciousness takes is the visible data, not the
concept of a man, or a monk, or something like that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìNormally one, he adverts to [himself as] many or a hundred
or a thousand; having adverted, he resolves with knowledge ëLet me be manyí. He
becomes many like the Venerable C|ƒa Panthaka. Here he adverts is said with
respect only to the preliminary work. Having adverted, he resolves with
knowledge is said with respect to the knowledge of the direct knowledge
(abhi““»). Consequently he adverts to many. After that he attains <u>with</u>
the last one of the preliminary work consciousnesses.î Instead of ëwithí it
should be ëafterí the last of the preliminary work consciousnesses. There are
four or three moments of preliminary work consciousness. Then there is direct
knowledge consciousness. So it is not with the last one, but after the last one
that he attains the direct knowledge consciousness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAfter emerging from the attainment, he again adverts thus
ëLet me be manyí, after which he resolves by means of the single
[consciousness] belonging to the knowledge of direct knowledgeî - so the direct
knowledge consciousness arises only once - ìwhich has arisen next to the three,
or four, preparatory consciousnesses that have occurred (ëPreparatory
consciousnessí means preliminary consciousness.), and which has the name
resolve ëowing to its making the decisioní.î The last one is called ëresolveí.
ìThis is how the meaning should be understood here.î In a thought process for
abhi““» there will be four or three k»m»vacara thought moments and then the
fourth jh»na. That fourth jh»na is called ëabhi““»í or ëdirect knowledgeí. Then
life-continuum follows. It is so powerful that just by arising once it can
create miracles. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìlike the Venerable C|ƒa Panthaka is said in order to point
to a bodily witness of this multiple state.î ëBodily witnessí really means
direct witness. It is not hearsay. ìThat must be illustrated by this story.î I
think that I have told this story many times. C|ƒa Panthaka was born very dull.
He could not even learn a four line stanza for four months. It is said that he
learned one line in one month. Then when he went to the next line, he lost the
first one. After the fourth month he had nothing. So his brother said ìYou are
useless in this dispensation.î, and expelled him from the monastery. Now his
brother was an Arahant, but here he seemed to be angry with him. Actually he
was not useless. He was going to be an Arahant a few moments later. The elder
brother was not as wise as the Buddha. His opinion was that his younger brother
was useless because he could not learn even four lines of a stanza. If he could
not learn, he would not be able to practice. In order to practice you have to
know something. You have to learn something from the teacher. That is why he
said ìYou are useless in this dispensation.î But the Buddha would turn him into
a very useful disciple. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He became an Arahant. The next day when the others went to
take a meal at An»thapi”…ikaís house, he was left behind. At that time he was
an Arahant. The Buddha wanted to let other people know that he had become an
Arahant. At the end of the water-offering ceremony the Buddha covered his bowl.
That means pouring water on the hand of the Buddha or the one who accepts. It
is symbolic. It is like we do now at the water-pouring ceremony. The ceremony
is done before eating here in the story. In <st1:country-region><st1:place>Sri
  Lanka</st1:place></st1:country-region> they still do this way. Lay people
bring food to the monastery or invite monks to their houses. They offer food to
the monks and then one of the monks does this ceremony. Then the monks eat. But
in our country (<st1:country-region><st1:place>Myanmar</st1:place></st1:country-region>)
the ceremony is done after eating. There is a difference of customs.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here the Buddha did it before eating. When the gruel was
being given out at the end of the ceremony, he covered his bowl. He did not
accept the gruel. ìJ vaka asked ëWhat is it, Venerable Sir?í - ëThere is a
bhikkhu at the monasteryí.î So there is one bhikkhu left. Somebody was sent to
take him to that place. But at that time - </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>ìNow, having
multiplied himself</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Up to a
thousand, Panthaka</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Sat in the
pleasant mango wood</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Until the time
should be announced.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He was waiting. He had created himself into a thousand
monks. When the people went there, they saw many monks. So they went back and
reported to the Buddha ìThe monastery is crowded with bhikkhus. I do not know
which of them the lord is (which of them is C|ƒa Panthaka).î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThen the Blessed One said ëGo and catch hold of the hem of
the robe of the first one you see; tell him ìThe Master calls youî and bring
him hereí. He went and caught hold of the robe of the Elder himself.î That
means he managed to take hold of the Elder and<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>not one of the created images. Even if he took hold of the robe of one
of the images, all the images would disappear and just Venerable C|ƒa Panthaka
would remain. The man happened to take hold of the robe of the Elder himself.
ìAt once all the creations vanished.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So Venerable C|ƒa Panthaka went there and took the meal.
Then the Buddha left him to give a Dhamma talk. When he became an Arahant, he
was endowed with the supernormal knowledge and all of the jh»nas. Now he was
able to repeat all of what the Buddha had taught. It is not mentioned in this
book, but in the Dhammapada Commentary it is mentioned that the Buddha left him
to give a Dhamma talk. He gave a good talk, basing his talk on the whole of the
Tipi‘aka.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Which he could now memorize?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Right. This is the story of Venerable C|ƒa
Panthaka. We will have many stories today. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe many who were created there were just like the
possessor of the supernormal power because they were created without particular
specification.î If there is specification, they will appear as specified. If
there is no specification, all the creations will be doing as the monk does. If
he is sitting, they will all be sitting. If he is walking, they will all be
walking. However here Venerable C|ƒa Panthaka did not do that way. Here the
jh»na is entered. Then there is emergence from the jh»na and resolution. Next
the jh»na is entered. Then he emerges and resolves again and again. ìMay some
be walking, may some be sitting, may some be reciting.î It is something like
that. The meditator has to be very familiar with entering into and emerging
from jh»na. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 68 ìThe same method of explanation applied to the
clause having been many, he becomes one, but there is this difference. After
the bhikkhu has thus created a manifold state, then he again thinks, ëAs one
only I will walk about, do a recital, ask a questioní or out of fewness of
wishes he thinks ëThis is a monastery with few bhikkhus. If someone comes, he
will wonder ìWhere have all these bhikkhus who are all alike come from?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>Surely it will be one of the Elderís feats?î
and so he might get to know about meí. Meanwhile wishing ëLet me be one only,
he should attain the basic jh»na and emerge. Then after doing the preliminary
work thus ëLet me be oneí, he should again attain and emerge and then resolve thus
ëLet me be oneí. He becomes one simultaneously with the resolving
consciousness.î If he wants to become one again, he has to enter into jh»na and
emerge and make resolution. Simultaneously with the direct knowledge
consciousness he becomes one again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBut instead of doing this, he can automatically become one
again with the lapse of the predetermination.î That is he makes a resolution
ìMay there be a thousand monks for one hour or two hoursî. Then at the end of
one hour or two hours they will all disappear. If he wants the creations to
disappear before that time, then he has to enter into jh»na and get the direct
knowledge consciousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHe appears and vanishes.î So he can appear before people or
he can vanish from the view of the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìNow this possessor of supernormal power who wants to make
an appearance makes darkness into light, or he makes revealed what is hidden,
or he makes what has not come into the visual field come into the visual field.
How? If he wants to make himself or another visible even though hidden or at a
distance, he emerges from the basic jh»na and adverts thus ëLet this that is
dark become lightí or ëLet this that is hidden be revealedí and so on.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBut by whom was this miracle formerly performed? By the
Blessed One. For when the Blessed One had been invited by C|ƒa Subhadd» and was
traversing the seven league journey between S»vatthi and S»keta and with 500
palanquins created by Vissakamma (That is a god or celestial being.), he
resolved in suchwise that citizens of S»keta saw the inhabitants of S»vatthi
and citizens of S»vatthi saw the inhabitants of S»keta. And when he had
alighted in the center of the city, he split the earth in two and showed Av ci
(the hell), and he parted the sky in two and sowed the Brahm» World.î It is
Buddhaís miracle letting people in this city see people in another city, like
letting people in <st1:City><st1:place>San Francisco</st1:place></st1:City> see
people in <st1:City><st1:place>Los Angeles</st1:place></st1:City> without going
there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThis meaning should also be explained by means of the
Descent of the Gods (devorohana). When the Blessed One, it seems, had performed
the Twin Miracle and had liberated 84,000 beings from bonds, he wondered ëWhere
did the Past Enlightened Ones go to when they had finished the Twin Miracleí?î
This is a story connected with how the Buddha taught the Abhidhamma to the
celestial beings. In his seventh year Buddha went up to Tavati—s» heaven after
he had performed the Twin Miracle. I think later on we will know what the Twin
Miracle is. He went up to Tavati—s» heaven and took up residence there for the rains.
That means he observed the Vasa there for three months by human reckoning. He
taught Abhidhamma there to the deities of 10,000 world-spheres.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>ìAt the time for wandering for alms he
created an artificial Buddha to teach the Dhamma.î I think I have told you
about this story. This is what Therav»da Buddhists believe. We believe that the
Buddha went to Tavati—s» heaven and taught Abhidhamma non-stop to the celestial
beings there. When it was time to go for alms, he left a created image and went
to Uttarakur|s (northern kur|s) it is said. He took food at <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>Lake</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceName>Anotatta</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>. There Venerable S»riputta
met him. Then the Buddha would tell him in brief what portions of the
Abhidhamma he had taught. Buddha taught the deities for three months.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many people who saw the Twin Miracles did not leave that
place because the Buddha just disappeared. They were yearning to see the Buddha
again. Buddha simply disappeared from their field of vision. The people were
waiting there for the Buddha to come back. At the end of the Vasa Venerable
Mah» Moggall»na went up to the Buddha and asked where he would descend into the
world of human beings. The Buddha told him that he would appear at Sa~kassa. On
the specified day the Buddha came back to the human world. That was on the last
day of the three month rainy season retreat for monks. So it was on the full
moon day of October that he came down to the world of human beings. There was a
very grand descent into the human world. He came down three staircases made of
gold, silver and crystal. In <st1:country-region><st1:place>Myanmar</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to commemorate that event we have the festival of lights. It is believed that
when Buddha came down to the human world it was dark. Instead of offering him
food the people offered him lights. In order to commemorate that we have the
festival lights on the full moon day of October. In <st1:country-region><st1:place>Sri
  Lanka</st1:place></st1:country-region> they offer lights at Vesak, the full
moon day of May.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are other stories. One is of hiding himself or hiding
others by miraculous powers. Paragraph 82 ìBut by whom was this miracle
formerly performed? By the Blessed One. For the Blessed One so acted that when
the clansman Yasa was sitting beside him, his father did not see him.î Yasa was
a clansman who left his home during the night. He went to where the Buddha was.
It was just after the Buddha had given the first sermon. He met the Buddha
there and the Buddha taught him. He became a Sot»panna and also he became a
monk. In the morning Yasaís father came to that place. He asked the Buddha ìDid
you see my son?î Buddha said ìYou will see him. Just sit down.î Then the Buddha
taught him Dhamma and he became a Sot»panna. Only then did he show Yasa to him.
So he hid Yasa with supernormal power so that the father did not see him. That
is because if the father saw the son, he would not be able to listen to the
Dhamma. He would not be able to become a Sot»panna.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìLikewise, after traveling 2000 leagues to meet [king] Mah»
Kappina and establishing him in the fruition of Non-return and his 1000
ministers in the fruition of Stream Entry, he so acted that Queen Anoj», who
had followed the king with a 1000 women attendants and was sitting nearby, did
not see the king and his retinue.î It is the same miracle. That story you may
read in Buddhist Legends, part 2, page 167. The story is given in detail there.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìFurthermore, this was performed by the Elder Mahinda.î The
Elder Mahinda was the son of King Asoka who brought Buddhism to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Sri
  Lanka</st1:place></st1:country-region>. ìHe so acted on the day of his
arrival in Tambapa””i Island (Sri Lanka) that the king did not see the others
who had come with him.î He went with five persons, but when he first met the
king, he did not let him see the other persons. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìFurthermore, all miracles of making evident are called an
appearance, and all miracles of making unevident are called a vanishing.
Herein, in the miracle of making evident both the supernormal power and the
possessor of the supernormal power are displayed.î So power and person evident
and power and person not evident. ìThat can be illustrated with the Twin
Miracle; for in that both are displayed thus: ëHere the Perfect One performs
the Twin Miracle, which is not shared by disciplesí.î Only the Buddhas can do
the Twin Miracle. ìHe produces a mass of fire from the upper part of his body
and a shower of water from the lower part of his bodyî and so on. It is called
ëTwin Miracleí because both fire and water are produced from his body. Fire
comes out of the upper part and water comes out of the lower part, or fire may
come out of one eye and water come out of the other eye. It is called the ëTwin
Miracleí. In footnote 15 it says ìThe only book in the Tipi‘aka to mention the
Twin Miracle is the Pa‘isambhid»maggaí.î In the other books it is not
mentioned, but it is mentioned again and again in the Commentaries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the case of the miracle of making unevident only the
supernormal power is displayed not the possessor of the supernormal power. That
can be illustrated by means of the Mahaka Sutta (in the Sa—yutta Nik»ya) and
the Brahmanimantanika Sutta (in the Majjhima Nik»ya). The passage from Sa—yutta
Nik»ya is given below, so we donít have to give you a reference number. The
Brahmanimantanika is Sutta 49 of The Middle Length Sayings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here Venerable Mahaka did a miracle. A fire came out from
the gaps in the fastenings and from the keyhole and burned hay without burning
the upper robe. He put the upper robe on the hay. Then he resolved that only
the hay burn and not the upper robe. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another one is when the Buddha met the Brahm». The Brahm»ís
name was Baka. He thought that he could make himself vanish from the sight of
all others. In that Sutta it is said that he was not able to do that. So Buddha
said ìI will do it.î So Buddha disappeared from all the Brahm»s. In order that
all the Brahm»s know that he was there he said this verse:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>ìI saw the fear
in [all kinds of] becoming.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>Including
becoming that seeks non-becoming;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>And no becoming
do I recommend;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>I cling to no
delight therein at all.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When he uttered this stanza, everybody knew that he was
there, but nobody could see him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHe goes unhindered through walls, through enclosures,
through mountains, as though in open space: here through walls is beyond wallsî
and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here an interesting piece of information is in paragraph 89
with regard to the Elder Tipi‘aka C|ƒa Abhaya. He had some different opinions
about how to perform the direct knowledge. He said: ìFriends, what is the use
of attaining the space kasi”a [jh»na]? Does one who wants to create elephants,
horses, etc., attain an elephant kasi”a jh»na or a horse kasi”a jh»na, and so
on? Surely the only standard is mastery in the eight attainments, and after the
preliminary work has been done on any kasi”a, it then becomes whatever he
wishes.î But the other bhikkhus said: ìVenerable Sir, only the space kasi”a has
been given in the Text, so it should certainly be mentioned.î There was a
little difference of opinion between that Elder and the other monks. It seems
that the Elder Tipi‘aka based his opinion on his experience. The others have
much respect for the Texts so they said that the space kasi”a is in the Texts
so it should be mentioned. Then the Text is given. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 91 ìWhat if a mountain or a tree is raised in this
bhikkhuís way while he is traveling along after resolving; should he attain and
resolve again?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>- There is no harm in that.
For attaining and resolving again is like taking the Dependence in the
Preceptorís presence.î When you become a monk, you have to become dependent
upon the Preceptor. He will teach you everything. He is like a father to you.
When we are living with our preceptor, we say I regard you as my Preceptor. But
sometimes we cannot live with our Preceptor for five years. We have to move to
another place. Let us say I live with my Preceptor for one year and then I want
to go to another place for study or practice. When I go to another place, I
have to approach a teacher there, a teacher of Texts or a teacher of
meditation. Then I have to regard him as my teacher. That is called
ëDependenceí. One may say: ìReverend Sir, may you be my teacher. May you be one
on whom I depend.î That is called ëtaking Dependenceí. When you live with your
Preceptor, you donít have to take Dependence because there is the Preceptor. In
the same way here when you have done the attaining and resolving, then there is
no sense in doing that again. So this only monks can understand. Even though
you pick up a Vinaya book and read it, there will still be something you pick
up a Vinaya book and read it, there will still be something you donít
understand. Taking dependence in the Preceptorís presence really means when
living with the Preceptor, you donít have to take Dependence. You donít have to
formally regard another person as your teacher. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd because this bhikkhu has resolved ëLet there be spaceí
there will be only space there, and because of the power of his first resolve
it is impossible that another mountain or tree can have sprung up meanwhile
made by temperature.î ëTemperatureí means utu, climatic conditions. ìHowever,
if it has been created by another possessor of supernormal power and created
first, it prevailsî and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHe dives in and out of the ground. Here it is rising up out
of that is called ëdiving outí and it is sinking down into that is called
ëdiving iní.î He is normally an obtainer of the water kasi”a attainment. This
is what a monk must do to perform this miracle. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 95 on unbroken water - this is walking on water.
ìHere water that one sinks into when trodden on is called ëbrokení, the
opposite is called ëunbrokení. But one who wants to go in this way should attain
the earth kasi”a [jh»na] and emerge.î You have to enter into the appropriate
jh»na. ëThe appropriate jh»naí means that you have to practice the appropriate
kasi”a in order to get jh»na. For example you want to make water seem hard,
unbroken, or unyielding. So you have to enter the earth kasi”a jh»na. Otherwise
you will not be able to do that. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Seated cross-legged he travels in the air. ìLike a winged
bird: like a bird furnished with wings.î In the P»ƒi Texts it always says
winged bird. The Commentators explain that there may be some birds which have
no wings. So it is said here winged bird. That means a bird which has wings and
which can fly. ìOne who wants to do this should attain the earth kasi”a and
emergeî and so on. ìHere is the text: ëSeated cross-legged he travels in space
like a winged bird: he is normally an obtainer of the earth kasi”a attainmentî
and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 100 ìAnd a bhikkhu who wants to travel in space
should be an obtainer of the divine eye. Why? On the way there may be
mountains, trees, etc., that are temperature-originated (that are created by
climatic conditions), or jealous n»gas, supa””as, etc., may create them.î
Supa””a is spelled with only one ëPí. Supa””as are garudas. Garudas are
mythical birds. It is the vehicle of Vishnu, one of the gods in Hinduism. They
may create them.. ìHe will need to be able to see these. But what should be
done on seeing them? He should attain the basic jh»na and emerge, and then he
should do the preliminary work thus ëLet there be spaceí; and resolve.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBut the Elder [Tipi‘aka C|ƒa Abhaya] said ëFriends, what is
the use of attaining the attainment? Is not the mind concentrated? Hence any
area that he has resolved thus ìLet it be spaceî is space.í Though he spoke
thus, nevertheless the matter should be treated as described under the miracle
of going unhindered through wallsî and so on. So this Elder did not find any
favor with Venerable Buddhaghosa and other monks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìWith his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so
mighty and powerful.î So he could stretch out his hand and stroke the sun and
moon. ìThis supernormal power is successful simply through the jh»na that is
made the basis for direct knowledge; there is no special kasi”a attainment
here.î Any jh»na will do. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 104 we have the words ëclung toí. In the
Sub-Commentary it is explained that ëclung toí may mean just those born of
kamma and those belonging to the living body, those belonging to the bodies of
living beings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHere the Elder Tipi‘aka C|ƒa N»ga said ëBut, friends, why
does what is clung to not become small and big too? When a bhikkhu comes out
through a keyhole, does not what is clung to become small? And when he makes
his body big, does it not become big, as in he case of the Elder Mah»
Moggall»na?î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That opinion is also rejected by Venerable Buddhaghosa.
Paragraph 117 ìSo it was with reference to this enlarged form created during
this taming of Nandopananda that is was said ëWhen he makes his body big, does
it not then become big, as in the case of the Elder Mah» Moggall»na? Although
this was said the bhikkhus observed ëHe enlarges only what is not clung to
supported by what is clung toí. And only this is correct here.î The opinion of
the Elder C|ƒa N»ga was also not accepted by the monks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the monk creates a body that is bigger than his normal
body, then there is enlargement. So the question here is: does he enlarge what
is clung to or what is not clung to. Does he enlarge the r|pa born of kamma
only or does he enlarge r|pa born of others? The answer is that he does not
enlarge or he cannot enlarge what is born of kamma, but the mind-born material
properties he can enlarge by the power of his mind. Along with that the
material properties born of temperature can be enlarged. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here the reference is given to Venerable Mah» Moggall»na and
a long story follows where Venerable Mah» Moggall»na tamed the royal n»ga named
Nandopananda. Here the Elder Mah» Moggall»na transformed himself into a n»ga,
maybe a dragon or a snake. Have you read the story? The n»ga did not like a
monk flying through the air above him. He was angry. So he coiled around Mount
Meru seven times and covered it with his hood. When Buddha and his disciples
went there, some of the disciples said ìFormerly when we reached this place, we
could see Mount Meru. What has happened?î Buddha said ìThere is a n»ga. He does
not like you.î The disciple said ìLet me tame him. Let me tame him.î But the
Buddha did not allow the other monks to tame him. At last Venerable Moggall»na
said ìLet me tame him.î The Buddha said ìGo.î Buddha knew that Venerable Mah»
Moggall»na alone was able to tame that serpent because he was very powerful. So
in order to tame his Venerable Moggall»na turned himself into a n»ga, twice the
size of that n»ga. Then he coiled himself around Nandopananda fourteen times.
Then he put pressure upon him so that he was crushed between the mountain and
the monk-serpent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So when Venerable Mah» Moggall»na did that, did he enlarge
the material property born of kamma or what did he do? The answer is what? ìHe
enlarges only what is not clung to supported by what is clung to. And only this
is correct here.î So he enlarges only those born of mind or caused by mind and
those caused by temperature or climatic conditions. They are supported by what
is clung to. What is clung to is what is born of kamma. There is the
translation of the explanation given in the Sub-Commentary as a footnote. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the end of footnote 20 ìIt should be taken that it is the
consciousness-born matter that is enlarged by the influence of the supernormal
power, and the temperature-born is enlarged pari passu.î What is ëpari passuí?
It is a foreign word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: It might mean ëin passingí, not as a consequence
but along with. The P»ƒi word is ë???í and that means following that. So ëalong
withí is close to that. One can enlarge only matter born of consciousness. When
consciousness-born matter is enlarged, the temperature-born matter is also
enlarged, but one cannot enlarge kamma-born r|pa. Kamma-born matter is caused
by kamma in the past, so nothing can be done about the kamma-born material
properties. With regard to consciousness-born material properties we can do
something. Even if we donít have jh»na, our appearance is different when we are
happy from when we are sad. These are caused by citta (consciousness). So we
can enlarge consciousness-born material properties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>OK. I think that is all we will do today. Next week we will
begin with paragraph 119 and go on to the next chapter. We will have a
description of how the world ends and how the world begins, the Buddhist
genesis.</p>
