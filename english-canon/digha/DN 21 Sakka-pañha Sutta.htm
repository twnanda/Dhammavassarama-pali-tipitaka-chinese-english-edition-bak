... 
<P>Having been given leave by the Blessed One, Sakka the deva-king asked him his 
first question: "Fettered with what, dear sir -- though they think, 'May we live 
free from hostility, free from violence, free from rivalry, free from ill will, 
free from those who are hostile' -- do devas, human beings, asuras, nagas, 
gandhabbas, &amp; whatever other many kinds of beings there are, nevertheless 
live in hostility, violence, rivalry, ill will, with those who are hostile?" 
<P>Thus Sakka asked his first question of the Blessed One, and the Blessed One, 
when asked, replied: "Devas, human beings, asuras, nagas, gandhabbas, &amp; 
whatever other many kinds of beings there are, are fettered with envy &amp; 
stinginess, which is why -- even though they think, 'May we live free from 
hostility, free from violence, free from rivalry, free from ill will, free from 
those who are hostile -- they nevertheless live in hostility, violence, rivalry, 
ill will, with those who are hostile." 
<P>Thus the Blessed One answered, having been asked by Sakka the deva-king. 
Gratified, Sakka was delighted in &amp; expressed his approval of the Blessed 
One's words: "So it is, O Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-gone. Hearing the 
Blessed One's answer to my question, my doubt is now cut off, my perplexity is 
overcome." 
<P>Then Sakka, having delighted in &amp; expressed his approval of the Blessed 
One's words, asked him a further question: "But what, dear sir, is the cause of 
envy &amp; stinginess, what is their origination, what gives them birth, what is 
their source? When what exists do they come into being? When what doesn't exist 
do they not?" 
<P>"Envy &amp; stinginess have dear-&amp;-not-dear as their cause, have 
dear-&amp;-not-dear as their origination, have dear-&amp;-not-dear as what gives 
them birth, have dear-&amp;-not-dear as their source. When dear-&amp;-not-dear 
exist, they come into being. When dear-&amp;-not-dear are not, they don't." 
<P>"But what, dear sir, is the cause of dear-&amp;-not-dear, what is their 
origination, what gives them birth, what is their source? When what exists do 
they come into being? When what doesn't exist do they not?" 
<P>"Dear-&amp;-not-dear have desire as their cause, have desire as their 
origination, have desire as what gives them birth, have desire as their source. 
When desire exists, they come into being. When desire is not, they don't." 
<P>"But what, dear sir, is the cause of desire, what is its origination, what 
gives it birth, what is its source? When what exists does it come into being? 
When what doesn't exist does it not?" 
<P>"Desire has thinking as its cause, has thinking as its origination, has 
thinking as what gives it birth, has thinking as its source. When thinking 
exists, desire comes into being. When thinking is not, it doesn't." 
<P>"But what, dear sir, is the cause of thinking, what is its origination, what 
gives it birth, what is its source? When what exists does it come into being? 
When what doesn't exist does it not?" 
<P>"<A name=papanca>Thinking</A> has the perceptions &amp; categories of 
complication[<A 
href="http://www.metta.lk/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/1Digha-Nikaya/Digha2/21-sakkapanha-e2-part.htm#n1" 
name=1>1</A>] as its cause, has the perceptions &amp; categories of complication 
as its origination, has the perceptions &amp; categories of complication as what 
gives it birth, has the perceptions &amp; categories of complication as its 
source. When the perceptions &amp; categories of complication exists, thinking 
comes into being. When the perceptions &amp; categories of complication are not, 
it doesn't." 
<P>"And how has he practiced, dear sir: the monk who has practiced the practice 
leading to the right cessation of the perceptions &amp; categories of 
complication?" 
<P>"<A name=joy>Joy</A> is of two sorts, I tell you, deva-king: to be pursued 
&amp; not to be pursued. Grief is of two sorts: to be pursued &amp; not to be 
pursued. Equanimity is of two sorts: to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued. 
<P>"'Joy is of two sorts, I tell you, deva-king: to be pursued &amp; not to be 
pursued.' Thus was it said. And in reference to what was it said? When one knows 
of a feeling of joy, 'As I pursue this joy, unskillful mental qualities 
increase, and skillful mental qualities decline,' that sort of joy is not to be 
pursued. When one knows of a feeling of joy, 'As I pursue this joy, unskillful 
mental qualities decline, and skillful mental qualities increase,' that sort of 
joy is to be pursued. And this sort of joy may be accompanied by directed 
thought &amp; evaluation or free of directed thought &amp; evaluation. Of the 
two, the latter is the more refined. 'Joy is of two sorts, I tell you, 
deva-king: to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued.' Thus was it said. And in 
reference to this was it said. 
<P>"'<A name=grief>Grief</A> is of two sorts, I tell you: to be pursued &amp; 
not to be pursued.' Thus was it said. And in reference to what was it said? When 
one knows of a feeling of grief, 'As I pursue this grief, unskillful mental 
qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities decline,' that sort of grief 
is not to be pursued. When one knows of a feeling of grief, 'As I pursue this 
grief, unskillful mental qualities decline, and skillful mental qualities 
increase,' that sort of grief is to be pursued. And this sort of grief may be 
accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation or free of directed thought 
&amp; evaluation. Of the two, the latter is the more refined. 'Grief is of two 
sorts, I tell you: to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued.' Thus was it said. And 
in reference to this was it said. 
<P>"'<A name=equanimity>Equanimity</A> is of two sorts, I tell you: to be 
pursued &amp; not to be pursued.' Thus was it said. And in reference to what was 
it said? When one knows of a feeling of equanimity, 'As I pursue this 
equanimity, unskillful mental qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities 
decline,' that sort of equanimity is not to be pursued. When one knows of a 
feeling of equanimity, 'As I pursue this equanimity, unskillful mental qualities 
decline, and skillful mental qualities increase,' that sort of equanimity is to 
be pursued. And this sort of equanimity may be accompanied by directed thought 
&amp; evaluation or free of directed thought &amp; evaluation. Of the two, the 
latter is the more refined. 'Equanimity is of two sorts, I tell you: to be 
pursued &amp; not to be pursued.' Thus was it said. And in reference to this was 
it said. 
<P>"This is how he has practiced, deva-king: the monk who has practiced the 
practice leading to the right cessation of the perceptions &amp; categories of 
complication." 
<P>Thus the Blessed One answered, having been asked by Sakka the deva-king. 
Gratified, Sakka was delighted in &amp; expressed his approval of the Blessed 
One's words: "So it is, O Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-gone. Hearing the 
Blessed One's answer to my question, my doubt is now cut off, my perplexity is 
overcome." 
<P>Then Sakka, having delighted in &amp; expressed his approval of the Blessed 
One's words, asked him a further question: "But how has he practiced, dear sir: 
the monk who has practiced for restraint in the Patimokkha?" 
<P>"<A name=bodily>Bodily conduct</A> is of two sorts, I tell you, deva-king: to 
be pursued &amp; not to be pursued. Verbal conduct is of two sorts: to be 
pursued &amp; not to be pursued. Searching is of two sorts: to be pursued &amp; 
not to be pursued. 
<P>"'Bodily conduct is of two sorts, I tell you, deva-king: to be pursued &amp; 
not to be pursued.' Thus was it said. And in reference to what was it said? When 
one knows of bodily conduct, 'As I pursue this bodily conduct, unskillful mental 
qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities decline,' that sort of bodily 
conduct is not to be pursued. When one knows of bodily conduct, 'As I pursue 
this bodily conduct, unskillful mental qualities decline, and skillful mental 
qualities increase,' that sort of bodily conduct is to be pursued. 'Bodily 
conduct is of two sorts, I tell you, deva-king: to be pursued &amp; not to be 
pursued.' Thus was it said. And in reference to this was it said. 
<P>"'<A name=verbal>Verbal conduct</A> is of two sorts, I tell you, deva-king: 
to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued.' Thus was it said. And in reference to 
what was it said? When one knows of verbal conduct, 'As I pursue this verbal 
conduct, unskillful mental qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities 
decline,' that sort of verbal conduct is not to be pursued. When one knows of 
verbal conduct, 'As I pursue this verbal conduct, unskillful mental qualities 
decline, and skillful mental qualities increase,' that sort of verbal conduct is 
to be pursued. 'Verbal conduct is of two sorts, I tell you, deva-king: to be 
pursued &amp; not to be pursued.' Thus was it said. And in reference to this was 
it said. 
<P>"'<A name=searching>Searching</A> is of two sorts, I tell you, deva-king: to 
be pursued &amp; not to be pursued.' Thus was it said. And in reference to what 
was it said? When one knows of a search, 'As I pursue this search, unskillful 
mental qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities decline,' that sort of 
search is not to be pursued. When one knows of a search, 'As I pursue this 
search, unskillful mental qualities decline, and skillful mental qualities 
increase,' that sort of search is to be pursued. 'Searching is of two sorts, I 
tell you, deva-king: to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued.' Thus was it said. 
And in reference to this was it said. 
<P>"This is how has he practiced, deva-king: the monk who has practiced the 
practice for restraint in the Patimokkha." 
<P>Thus the Blessed One answered, having been asked by Sakka the deva-king. 
Gratified, Sakka was delighted in &amp; expressed his approval of the Blessed 
One's words: "So it is, O Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-gone. Hearing the 
Blessed One's answer to my question, my doubt is now cut off, my perplexity is 
overcome." 
<P>Then Sakka, having delighted in &amp; expressed his approval of the Blessed 
One's words, asked him a further question: "But how has he practiced, dear sir: 
the monk who has practiced for restraint with regard to the sense faculties?" 
<P>"<A name=forms>Forms</A> cognizable by the eye are of two sorts, I tell you, 
deva-king: to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued. Sounds cognizable by the ear 
.... Aromas cognizable by the nose .... Flavors cognizable by the tongue .... 
Tactile sensations cognizable by the body .... Ideas cognizable by the intellect 
are of two sorts: to be pursued &amp; not to be pursued." 
<P>When this was said, Sakka the deva-king said to the Blessed One, "Dear sir, I 
understand the detailed meaning of the Blessed One's brief statement. If, as one 
pursues a certain type of form cognizable by the eye, unskillful mental 
qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities decline, that sort of form 
cognizable by the eye is not to be pursued. But if, as one pursues a certain 
type of form cognizable by the eye, unskillful mental qualities decline, and 
skillful mental qualities increase, that sort of form cognizable by the eye is 
to be pursued. 
<P>"If, as one pursues a certain type of sound cognizable by the ear .... 
<P>"If, as one pursues a certain type of aroma cognizable by the nose .... 
<P>"If, as one pursues a certain type of flavor cognizable by the tongue .... 
<P>"If, as one pursues a certain type of tactile sensation cognizable by the 
body .... 
<P>"If, as one pursues a certain type of idea cognizable by the intellect, 
unskillful mental qualities increase, and skillful mental qualities decline, 
that sort of idea cognizable by the intellect is not to be pursued. But if, as 
one pursues a certain type of idea cognizable by the intellect, unskillful 
mental qualities decline, and skillful mental qualities increase, that sort of 
idea cognizable by the intellect is to be pursued. 
<P>"This is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Blessed One's brief 
statement. Hearing the Blessed One's answer to my question, my doubt is now cut 
off, my perplexity is overcome." 
<P><A name=goal>Then Sakka</A>, having delighted in &amp; expressed his approval 
of the Blessed One's words, asked him a further question: "Dear sir, do all 
priests &amp; contemplatives teach the same doctrine, adhere to the same 
precepts, desire the same thing, aim at the same goal?" 
<P>"No, deva-king, not all priests &amp; contemplatives teach the same doctrine, 
adhere to the same precepts, desire the same thing, aim at the same goal." 
<P>"Why, dear sir, don't all priests &amp; contemplatives teach the same 
doctrine, adhere to the same precepts, desire the same thing, aim at the same 
goal?" 
<P>"The world is made up of many properties, various properties. Because of the 
many &amp; various properties in the world, then whichever property living 
beings get fixated on, they become entrenched &amp; latch onto it, saying, 'Only 
this is true; anything else is worthless.' This is why not all priests &amp; 
contemplatives teach the same doctrine, adhere to the same precepts, desire the 
same thing, aim at the same goal." 
<P>"But, dear sir, are all priests &amp; contemplatives utterly complete, 
utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly holy life, utterly 
consummate?" 
<P>"No, deva-king, not all priests &amp; contemplatives are utterly complete, 
utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly holy life, utterly 
consummate." 
<P>"But why, dear sir, are not all priests &amp; contemplatives utterly 
complete, utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly holy life, utterly 
consummate?" 
<P>"Those monks who are released through the total ending of craving are the 
ones who are utterly complete, utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly 
holy life, utterly consummate. This is why not all priests &amp; contemplatives 
are utterly complete, utterly free from bonds, followers of the utterly holy 
life, utterly consummate." 
<P>Thus the Blessed One answered, having been asked by Sakka the deva-king. 
Gratified, Sakka was delighted in &amp; expressed his approval of the Blessed 
One's words: "So it is, O Blessed One. So it is, O One Well-gone. Hearing the 
Blessed One's answer to my question, my doubt is now cut off, my perplexity is 
overcome." 
<P>Then Sakka, having delighted in &amp; expressed his approval of the Blessed 
One's words, said to him: "Obsession is a disease, obsession is a boil, 
obsession is an arrow. It seduces one, drawing one into this or that state of 
being, which is why one is reborn in high states &amp; low. Whereas other 
outside priests &amp; contemplatives gave me no chance to ask them these 
questions, the Blessed One has answered at length, so that he has removed the 
arrow of my uncertainty &amp; perplexity." 
<P>"Deva-king, do you recall having asked other priests &amp; contemplatives 
these questions?" 
<P>"Yes, lord, I recall having asked other priests &amp; contemplatives these 
questions." 
<P>"If it's no inconvenience, could you tell me how they answered?" 
<P>"It's no inconvenience when sitting with the Blessed One or one who is like 
him." 
<P>"Then tell me, deva-king." 
<P>"Having gone to those whom I considered to be priests &amp; contemplatives 
living in isolated dwellings in the wilderness, I asked them these questions. 
But when asked by me, they were at a loss. Being at a loss, they asked <I>me</I> 
in return, 'What is your name?' 
<P>"Being asked, I responded, 'I, dear sir, am Sakka, the deva-king.' 
<P>"So they questioned me further, 'But what kamma did you do to attain to this 
state?' 
<P>"So I taught them the Dhamma as far as I had heard &amp; mastered it. And 
they were gratified with just this much: 'We have seen Sakka, the deva-king, and 
he has answered our questions!' So, instead of my becoming their disciple, they 
simply became mine. But I, lord, am the Blessed One's disciple, a stream-winner, 
steadfast, never again destined for states of woe, headed for self-awakening." 
<P>"Deva-king, do you recall ever having previously experienced such happiness 
&amp; joy?" 
<P>"Yes, lord, I do." 
<P>"And how do you recall ever having previously experienced such happiness 
&amp; joy?" 
<P>"Once, lord, the devas &amp; asuras were arrayed in battle. And in that 
battle the devas won, while the asuras lost. Having won the battle, as the 
victor in the battle, this thought occurred to me: 'Whatever has been the divine 
nourishment of the asuras, whatever has been the divine nourishment of the 
devas, the devas will now enjoy both of them.' But my attainment of happiness 
&amp; joy of mine was in the sphere of violence &amp; weapons. It didn't lead to 
disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge to 
self-awakening, to Unbinding. But my attainment of happiness &amp; joy on 
hearing the Blessed One's Dhamma is in the sphere of no violence, the sphere of 
no weapons. It leads to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to 
direct knowledge to self-awakening, to Unbinding." .... 
<P><A name=stream>Then Sakka</A>, the deva-king, touched the earth with his hand 
and said three times, "Homage to the Worthy One, the Blessed One, the Rightly 
Self-awakened One! Homage to the Worthy One, the Blessed One, the Rightly 
Self-awakened One! Homage to the Worthy One, the Blessed One, the Rightly 
Self-awakened One!" 
<P>While this explanation was being given, there arose to Sakka the dustless, 
stainless Dhamma eye -- "Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to 
cessation" -- as it also did to [his following of] 80,000 other devas. 
<P>Such were the questions that the Blessed One answered at Sakka's bidding. And 
so this discourse is called "Sakka's Questions." 
<P>
<HR>

<H3>Note</H3>
<P><B><A name=n1>1</A>.</B> Complication = <I>papañca.</I> The tendency of the 
mind to proliferate issues from the sense of "self." This term can also be 
translated as self-reflexive thinking, reification, falsification, distortion, 
elaboration, or exaggeration. In the discourses, it is frequently used in 
analyses of the psychology of conflict. The categories of complication stem from 
the self-reflexive thought, "I am the thinker," (see <A 
href="http://www.metta.lk/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/1Digha-Nikaya/khuddaka/suttanipata/snp4-14.html">Sn 
IV.14</A>), and include the categories of inappropriate attention (see <A 
href="http://www.metta.lk/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/1Digha-Nikaya/majjhima/mn2.html">MN 
2</A>): being/not-being, me/not-me, mine/not-mine, doer/done-to. The perceptions 
of complication include such thoughts as "This is me. This is mine. This is my 
self." These perceptions and categories turn back on the person who allows them 
to proliferate, giving rise to internal conflict &amp; strife, which then expand 
outward. For more on these terms, see <A
