the West. But in the sixth century B. C. in the Eastern valley of the Ganges, 
the question as to the ethics of teachers and teaching was one of wide interest 
and of great importance.</SPAN></P>

And it would be a danger to social order if they taught women, or any males not 
twice-born, or any twice-born males who would not share their views as to the 
ethics of teaching, and as to the privileges and prerogatives of the priest as 
teacher.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>These passages 
are much later than the Piñakas. But they, and the many others like them, give a 
fair idea of the spirit animating one section at least of the priests, and of a 
trend of opinion that doubtless had its supporters also in Piñaka times. When 
Asoka thought he had brought about such a chance in public opinion that those 
who had been very gods upon the earth had come to be gods no longer, he was very 
far from thinking right. That is a battle that is not so easily won. But the 
expression of his belief is sufficient to show that the striking idea he thought 
he had killed was far older than our existing text of Manu.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>On the other hand 
one may be permitted to doubt whether the gentle measures approved by Saïkara

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>out. The Piñakas 
themselves give ample proof that, in spite of the priests, there were not a few 
base-born people who succeeded, in that time at least, not only in getting 
taught, but in becoming teachers. And this was not the case only among the 
despised Buddhists. The numerous passages collected by Dr. Muir in his article 
in the 'Indian Antiquary' for 1877 show that the priestly literature itself-the 
law books and the epics-has preserved evidence of the lax way in which the 
strict rules as to exclusion from teaching or being taught were really carried 
out. And that is especially the case, according to the priestly tradition, in 
ancient times, as old, or older, than the rise of Buddhism.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>The fact 
doubtless is that, though there were bigots among the Brahmans, and though they 
were strong enough to establish, before the time to which our present Sutta 
refers, rules as to restriction of teaching which no one in priestly circles 
could venture formally to dispute-yet that there was also always a strong party 
in India, to which many of the more liberal minded of the Brahmans themselves 
belonged, who looked with sympathy on relaxations of these rules. The general 
practice must have been that, the hereditary priests kept the magic of the 
sacrifice, and the emoluments and privileges that went with the knowledge of it, 
in their own hands. Even the higher teaching of the mysteries of theosophy was 
to be handed down only from priest-father to son, or from priestly teacher to 
pupil. But there were many exceptions. The numerous Brahmans who were not 
priests were wont, of course, to emphasise the importance rather of birth than 
of knowledge. We have enough evidence, even in the pre-Buddhistic Upanishads, of 
others, besides the priests, being teachers of the higher wisdom. The four 
powerful kings, and the still important free clans, though they gave support to 
the Brahmans, gave also equal support to other teachers-just as, in later times, 
Hindu and Buddhist sovereigns are found supporting Buddhists and Hindus 
alike.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>Our knowledge of 
Indian views of life having been hitherto derived almost exclusively from the 
priestly books, scholars have inevitably tended to attach too great a degree of 
importance to what the priests describe as the proper state of things. As a 
matter of fact it never really prevailed. Even now the Brahmans, or those who in 
the census returns claim to be such, form only about five per cent. of the 
population. And of these the vast majority are not priests at all ; they are 
engaged in all sorts of worldly occupations<A title=""

India at any time, much less in the time of the Buddha, through the yellow 
spectacles of Saïkara, or even of the priestly compilers of Manu. As M. Barth 
said, already in 1873, in protesting against Lassen for falling into this 
mistake<A title="" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn6" 
href="http://www.metta.lk/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/1Digha-Nikaya/Digha1/12-lohicca-e.htm#_ftn6"

style="mso-special-character: footnote"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[6]<![endif]></SPAN></SPAN></A>: 
'We must distinguish, more than Lassen does, between different epochs, as well 
as between the pretensions of a caste and the real state of things. The Brahmans 
had not yet monopolised the intellectual life. Certain testimonies of the epics, 
applicable to this very period, as also the very nature of the Vedic books, show 
for example that there existed alongside of them an entire profane literature of 
great extent ™.which was certainly, at first, in other hands™™. Their teaching 
(that of the Brahmans), it is true, appears to have been in a high degree 
esoteric and exclusive.'</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>The position 
taken up by the Buddha on this question, as appears from our present Sutta (and 
such other passages as M. I, 513-.524; A. I, 277; III, 123-127 ; M. P. S. II, 32 
= A. III, 69 = V, <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">56 </I>= Mil. 144), is 
that every one should be allowed to learn ; that every one, having certain 
abilities, should be allowed to teach ; and that, if he does teach, he should 
teach all and to all; keeping nothing back, shutting no one out. But no man 
should take upon himself to teach others unless and until he have first taught 
himself, and have also acquired the faculty of imparting to others the truth he 
has gained himself.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>There can, I 
think, be very little doubt but that the great teacher is here voicing the 
opinion of many others of liberal views, his contemporaries and predecessors. He 
lays no claim, either in our Sutta or elsewhere, to any special peculiarity in 
this respect. It. is taken for granted that the arguments put into his mouth in 
our Sutta will appeal to the Brahman to whom they are addressed. And they are 
based not on any distinctively Buddhist doctrine but on general ethical 
principles accepted, or rather acceptable, by all.</SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>[224] 1. Thus 
have I heard. The Exalted One, when once passing on a tour through the Kosala 
districts with a great multitude of the members of the Order, with about five 
hundred Bhikshus, arrived at Sàlavatikà (a village surrounded by a row of Sàla 
trees). Now at that time Lohicca<A title="" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn7"

style="mso-special-character: footnote"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[7]<![endif]></SPAN></SPAN></A> 
the Brahman was established at Sàlavatikà, a spot teeming with life, with much 
grassland and woodland and corn, on a royal domain granted him by King Pasenadi 
of Kosala, as a royal gift, with power over it as if he were the king<A title=""

style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Now at that time Lohicca the Brahman was thinking of harbouring, the 
following wicked view: 'Suppose that a Samaõa or a Bràhmaõa have reached up to 
some good state (of mind), then he should tell no one else about it. For what 
can one man do for another ? To tell others would be like the man who, having 
broken through an old bond, should entangle himself in a new one. Like that, I 
say, is this (desire to declare to others); it is a form of lust. For what can 
one man do for another<A title="" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn9"

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>Now Lohicca the 
Brahman heard the news: 'They say that the Samaõa Gotama, of the sons of the 
Sàkyas, as, who went out from the Sàkya clan to adopt the religious life, has 
now arrived, with a great company of the brethren of his Order, on his tour 
through the Kosala districts, at Sàlavatikà. Now regarding that venerable 
Gotama, such is the high reputation that has been noised abroad:-that Exalted 
One is an Arahat, fully awakened, abounding, in wisdom and goodness, happy, with 
knowledge of the worlds, unsurpassed as a guide to mortals willing to be led, a 
teacher for. gods and men, an exalted one, a Buddha. He, by himself, thoroughly 
knows, and sees as it were face to face, this universe-including the worlds 
above of the gods, the Brahmàs, and the Màras; and the world below with its 
Samaõas and Bràhmaõas, its princes and peoples-and having, known it, he makes 
his knowledge known to others. The truth, lovely in its origin, lovely in its 
progress, lovely in its consummation, doth he proclaim both in the spirit and in 
the letter. The higher life doth he make known in all its fullness, and in all 
its purity. And good is it to pay visits to Arahats like that.'</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>[225] 4. Then 
Lohicca the Brahman said to Bhesikà' the barber: 'Come now, good Bhesikà, go 
where the Samaõa Gotama is staying, and, on your arrival, ask in my name as to 
whether his sickness and indisposition has abated, as to his health and vigour 
and condition of ease; and speak thus: " May the venerable Gotama, and with him 
the brethren of the Order, accept the to-morrow's meal from Lohicca the 
Brahman."'</SPAN></P>

Lohicca the Brahman, and did so even as he had been enjoined. And the Exalted 
One consented, by silence, to his request.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>6.<SPAN

</SPAN>And when Bhesikà the barber. perceived that the Exalted One had

' General Report on the Census of 1891, pp. 190, 202. The census shows that out

general spread of literacy is the long continued existence of a hereditary class 
whose object it has been to maintain their own monopoly of book learning as the 
chief buttress of their social supremacy. The opposition of the Brahmins to the 
rise of the writer class has been already mentioned; and the repugnance of both, 
in the present day, to the diffusion of learning amongst the masses, can only be 
appreciated after long experience.,</SPAN></P></DIV>
