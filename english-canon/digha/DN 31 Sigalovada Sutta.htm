Ethics: Four Discourses by the Buddha (WH 14)</I></A>, translated by Narada 
Thera (Kandy: Buddhist Publication Society, 1985).</SMALL> 
<HR>
Thus have I heard: 
<P>On one occasion the Exalted One was dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, the 
Squirrels' Sanctuary, near <A name=rajagaha>Rajagaha</A>. 
<P>Now at that time, young <A name=sigala>Sigala</A>, a householder's son, 
rising early in the morning, departing from Rajagaha, with wet clothes and wet 
hair, worshipped with joined hands the various quarters -- the East, the South, 
the West, the North, the Nadir, and the Zenith. 
<P>Then the Exalted One, having robed himself in the forenoon took bowl and 
robe, and entered Rajagaha for alms. Now he saw young Sigala worshipping thus 
and spoke to him as follows: 
<P>"Wherefore do you, young householder, rising early in the morning, departing 
from Rajagaha, with wet clothes and wet hair, worship, with joined hands these 
various quarters -- the East, the South, the West, the North, the Nadir, and the 
Zenith?" 
<P>"My father, Lord, while dying, said to me: The six quarters, dear son, you 
shall worship. And I, Lord, respecting, revering, reverencing and honouring my 
father's word, rise early in the morning, and leaving Rajagaha, with wet clothes 
and wet hair, worship with joined hands, these six quarters." 
<P>"It is not thus, young householder, the six quarters should be worshipped in 
the discipline of the noble." 
<P>"How then, Lord, should the six quarters be worshipped in the discipline of 
the noble? It is well, Lord, if the Exalted One would teach the doctrine to me 
showing how the six quarters should be worshipped in the discipline of the 
noble." 
<P>"Well, young householder, listen and bear it well in mind; I shall speak." -- 
"Very good, Lord," responded young Sigala. 
<P>And the Exalted One spoke as follows: 
<P>"Inasmuch, young householder, as the noble disciple <B>(1)</B> has eradicated 
the four vices in conduct,[<A 
href="http://www.metta.lk/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/1Digha-Nikaya/Digha3/31-sigala-e2.htm#n1" 
name=1>1</A>] <B>(2)</B> inasmuch as he commits no evil action in four ways, 
<B>(3)</B> inasmuch as he pursues not the six channels for dissipating wealth, 
he thus, avoiding these fourteen evil things, covers the six quarters, and 
enters the path leading to victory in both worlds: he is favoured in this world 
and in the world beyond. Upon the dissolution of the body, after death, he is 
born in a happy heavenly realm. 
<P><B>(1)</B> "What are <A name=4vices>the four vices</A> in conduct that he has 
eradicated? The destruction of life, householder, is a vice and so are stealing, 
sexual misconduct, and lying. These are the four vices that he has eradicated." 
<P>Thus spoke the Exalted One. And when the Master had thus spoken, he spoke yet 
again: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Killing, stealing, lying and adultery,<BR>These four evils the 
  wise never praise. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>(2)</B> "In which four ways does one commit no evil action? Led by desire 
does one commit evil. Led by anger does one commit evil. Led by ignorance does 
one commit evil. Led by fear does one commit evil.[<A 
href="http://www.metta.lk/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/1Digha-Nikaya/Digha3/31-sigala-e2.htm#n2" 
name=2>2</A>] 
<P>"But inasmuch as the noble disciple is not led by desire, anger, ignorance, 
and fear, he commits no evil." 
<P>Thus spoke the Exalted One. And when the Master had thus spoken, he spoke yet 
again: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><A name=moon>Whoever</A> through desire, hate or fear,<BR>Or 
  ignorance should transgress the Dhamma,<BR>All his glory fades away<BR>Like 
  the moon during the waning half.<BR>Whoever through desire, hate or 
  fear,<BR>Or ignorance never transgresses the Dhamma,<BR>All his glory ever 
  increases<BR>Like the moon during the waxing half. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>(3)</B> "What are the six channels for dissipating wealth which he does 
not pursue? 
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>(a)</B> "indulgence in intoxicants which cause infatuation and 
  heedlessness;<BR><B>(b)</B> sauntering in streets at unseemly 
  hours;<BR><B>(c)</B> frequenting theatrical shows;<BR><B>(d)</B> indulgence in 
  gambling which causes heedlessness;<BR><B>(e)</B> association with evil 
  companions;<BR><B>(f)</B> the habit of idleness. </BLOCKQUOTE><A 
name=intox><B>(a)</B></A> "There are, young householder, these six evil 
consequences in indulging in intoxicants which cause infatuation and 
heedlessness: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>(i) loss of wealth,<BR>(ii) increase of quarrels,<BR>(iii) 
  susceptibility to disease,<BR>(iv) earning an evil reputation,<BR>(v) 
  shameless exposure of body,<BR>(vi) weakening of intellect. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><B>(b)</B> "There are, young householder, these six evil 
consequences in sauntering in streets at unseemly hours: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>(i) he himself is unprotected and unguarded,<BR>(ii) his wife and 
  children are unprotected and unguarded,<BR>(iii) his property is unprotected 
  and unguarded,<BR>(iv) he is suspected of evil deeds,[<A

  many troubles. </BLOCKQUOTE><B>(c)</B> "There are, young householder, these six 
evil consequences in frequenting theatrical shows: 
<P>"He is ever thinking: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>(i) where is there dancing?<BR>(ii) where is there 
  singing?<BR>(iii) where is there music?<BR>(iv) where is there 
  recitation?<BR>(v) where is there playing with cymbals?<BR>(vi) where is there 
  pot-blowing?[<A

  name=4>4</A>] </BLOCKQUOTE><B>(d)</B> "There are, young householder, these six 
evil consequences in indulging in gambling: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>(i) the winner begets hate,<BR>(ii) the loser grieves for lost 
  wealth,<BR>(iii) loss of wealth,<BR>(iv) his word is not relied upon in a 
  court of law,<BR>(v) he is despised by his friends and associates,<BR>(vi) he 
  is not sought after for matrimony; for people would say he is a gambler and is 
  not fit to look after a wife. </BLOCKQUOTE><B>(e)</B> "There are, young 
householder, these six evil consequences in associating with evil companions, 
namely: any gambler, any libertine, any drunkard, any swindler, any cheat, any 
rowdy is his friend and companion. 
<P><B>(f)</B> "There are, young householder, these six evil consequences in 
being addicted to idleness: 
<P>"He does no work, saying: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>(i) that it is extremely cold,<BR>(ii) that it is extremely 
  hot,<BR>(iii) that it is too late in the evening,<BR>(iv) that it is too early 
  in the morning,<BR>(v) that he is extremely hungry,<BR>(vi) that he is too 
  full. </BLOCKQUOTE>"Living in this way, he leaves many duties undone, new wealth 
he does not get, and wealth he has acquired dwindles away." 
<P>Thus spoke the Exalted One. And when the Master had thus spoken, he spoke yet 
again: 
<P>"One is a bottle friend; one says, 'friend, friend' only to one's face; one 
is a friend and an associate only when it is advantageous. 
<P>"Sleeping till sunrise, adultery, irascibility, malevolence, evil companions, 
avarice -- these six causes ruin a man. 
<P>"The man who has evil comrades and friends is given to evil ways, to ruin 
does he fall in both worlds -- here and the next. 
<P>"Dice, women, liquor, dancing, singing, sleeping by day, sauntering at 
unseemly hours, evil companions, avarice -- these nine[<A 
href="http://www.metta.lk/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/1Digha-Nikaya/Digha3/31-sigala-e2.htm#n5" 
name=5>5</A>] causes ruin a man. 
<P>"<A name=waning>Who plays</A> with dice and drinks intoxicants, goes to women 
who are dear unto others as their own lives, associates with the mean and not 
with elders -- he declines just as the moon during the waning half. 
<P>"Who is drunk, poor, destitute, still thirsty whilst drinking, frequents the 
bars, sinks in debt as a stone in water, swiftly brings disrepute to his family. 

<P>"Who by habit sleeps by day, and keeps late hours, is ever intoxicated, and 
is licentious, is not fit to lead a household life. 
<P>"Who says it is too hot, too cold, too late, and leaves things undone, the 
opportunities for good go past such men. 
<P>"But he who does not regard cold or heat any more than a blade of grass and 
who does his duties manfully, does not fall away from happiness." 
<P>

<P>"These four, young householder, should be understood as foes in the guise of 
friends: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>(1)</B> he who appropriates a friend's 
  possessions,<BR><B>(2)</B> he who renders lip-service,<BR><B>(3)</B> he who 
  flatters,<BR><B>(4)</B> he who brings ruin. </BLOCKQUOTE><B>(1)</B> "In four 
ways, young householder, should one who appropriates be understood as a foe in 
the guise of a friend: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>(i) he appropriates his friend's wealth,<BR>(ii) he gives little 
  and asks much,<BR>(iii) he does his duty out of fear,<BR>(iv) he associates 
  for his own advantage. </BLOCKQUOTE><B>(2)</B> "In four ways, young householder,

  makes friendly profession as regards the future,<BR>(iii) he tries to gain 
  one's favour by empty words,<BR>(iv) when opportunity for service has arisen, 
  he expresses his inability. </BLOCKQUOTE><B>(3)</B> "In four ways, young 
householder, should one who flatters be understood as a foe in the guise of a 
friend:

  his friend's good deeds,<BR>(iii) he praises him in his presence,<BR>(iv) he 
  speaks ill of him in his absence. </BLOCKQUOTE><B>(4)</B> "In four ways, young

  streets at unseemly hours,<BR>(iii) he is a companion in frequenting 
  theatrical shows,<BR>(iv) he is a companion in indulging in gambling which 
  causes heedlessness." </BLOCKQUOTE>Thus spoke the Exalted One. And when the 
Master had thus spoken, he spoke yet again: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The friend who appropriates,<BR>the friend who renders 
  lip-service,<BR>the friend that flatters,<BR>the friend who brings 
  ruin,<BR>these four as enemies the wise behold,<BR>avoid them from afar as

understood as warm-hearted friends: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>(1)</B> he who is a helpmate,<BR><B>(2)</B> he who is the same 
  in happiness and sorrow,<BR><B>(3)</B> he who gives good 
  counsel,<BR><B>(4)</B> he who sympathises. </BLOCKQUOTE><B>(1)</B> "In four 
ways, young householder, should a helpmate be understood as a warm-hearted 
friend: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>(i) he guards the heedless,<BR>(ii) he protects the wealth of the 
  heedless,<BR>(iii) he becomes a refuge when you are in danger,<BR>(iv) when 
  there are commitments he provides you with double the supply needed. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><B>(2)</B> "In four ways, young householder, should one who is the 
same in happiness and sorrow be understood as a warm-hearted friend: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>(i) he reveals his secrets,<BR>(ii) he conceals one's own 
  secrets,<BR>(iii) in misfortune he does not forsake one,<BR>(iv) his life even 
  he sacrifices for one's sake. </BLOCKQUOTE><B>(3)</B> "In four ways, young 
householder, should one who gives good counsel be understood as a warm-hearted 
friend: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>(i) he restrains one from doing evil,<BR>(ii) he encourages one to

  points out the path to heaven. </BLOCKQUOTE><B>(4)</B> "In four ways, young

  in one's prosperity,<BR>(iii) he restrains others speaking ill of 
  oneself,<BR>(iv) he praises those who speak well of oneself." </BLOCKQUOTE>Thus 
spoke the Exalted One. And when the Master had thus spoken, he spoke yet again: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The friend who is a helpmate,<BR>the friend in happiness and 
  woe,<BR>the friend who gives good counsel,<BR>the friend who sympathises too 
  -- <BR>these four as friends the wise behold<BR>and cherish them

<P>"And how, young householder, does a noble disciple cover the six quarters?

employees thus ministered to as the <B>Nadir</B> show their compassion towards 
him in these five ways. Thus is the <B>Nadir</B> covered by him and made safe

<P>"In five ways, young householder, should a householder minister to ascetics 
and brahmins as the <B>Zenith</B>: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>(i) by lovable deeds,<BR>(ii) by lovable words,<BR>(iii) by 
  lovable thoughts,<BR>(iv) by keeping open house to them,<BR>(v) by supplying 
  their material needs. </BLOCKQUOTE>"The ascetics and brahmins thus ministered to 
as the <B>Zenith</B> by a householder show their compassion towards him in six 
ways: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>(i) they restrain him from evil,<BR>(ii) they persuade him to do 
  good,<BR>(iii) they love him with a kind heart,<BR>(iv) they make him hear 
  what he has not heard,<BR>(v) they clarify what he has already heard,<BR>(vi) 
  they point out the path to a heavenly state. </BLOCKQUOTE>"In these six ways do 
ascetics and brahmins show their compassion towards a householder who ministers 
to them as the <B>Zenith</B>. Thus is the <B>Zenith</B> covered by him and made 
safe and secure." Thus spoke the Exalted One. And when the Master had thus 
spoken, he spoke yet again: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The mother and father are the East,<BR>The Teachers are the 
  South,<BR>Wife and Children are the West,<BR>The friends and associates are 
  the North.<BR>
  <P>Servants and employees are the Nadir,<BR>The ascetics and brahmins are the 
  Zenith;<BR>Who is fit to lead the household life,<BR>These six quarters he 
  should salute.<BR>
  <P>Who is wise and virtuous,<BR>Gentle and keen-witted,<BR>Humble and 
  amenable,<BR>Such a one to honour may attain.<BR>
  <P>Who is energetic and not indolent,<BR>In misfortune unshaken,<BR>Flawless 
  in manner and intelligent,<BR>Such a one to honour may attain.<BR>
  <P>Who is hospitable, and friendly,<BR>Liberal and unselfish,<BR>A guide, an 
  instructor, a leader,<BR>Such a one to honour may attain.<BR>
  <P>Generosity, sweet speech,<BR>Helpfulness to others,<BR>Impartiality to 
  all,<BR>As the case demands. 
  <P>These four winning ways make the world go round,<BR>As the linchpin in a 
  moving car.<BR>If these in the world exist not,<BR>Neither mother nor father 
  will receive,<BR>Respect and honour from their children. 
  <P>Since these four winning ways<BR>The wise appraise in every way,<BR>To 
  eminence they attain,<BR>And praise they rightly gain. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>When the 
Exalted One had spoken thus, Sigala, the young householder, said as follows: 
<P>"<A name=magnif>Excellent</A>, Lord, excellent! It is as if, Lord, a man were 
to set upright that which was overturned, or were to reveal that which was 
hidden, or were to point out the way to one who had gone astray, or were to hold 
a lamp amidst the darkness, so that those who have eyes may see. Even so, has 
the doctrine been explained in various ways by the Exalted One. 
<P>"I take refuge, Lord, in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. May the 
Exalted One receive me as a lay follower; as one who has taken refuge from this 
very day to life's end."

<P><B><A name=n8>8</A>.</B> "The symbolism is deliberately chosen: as the day in 
the East, so life begins with parents' care; teacher's fees and the South are 
the same word: <I>dakkhina</I>; domestic cares follow when the youth becomes 
man, as the West holds the later daylight; North is 'beyond' <I>(uttara),</I> so 
by help of friends, etc., he gets beyond troubles." -- (Rhys Davids) <!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<A

<P><B><A name=n9>9</A>.</B> This is a sacred custom of the Aryans who never 
forgot the dead. This tradition is still faithfully observed by the Buddhists of 
Sri Lanka who make ceremonial offerings of alms to the monks on the eighth day, 
in the third month, and on each anniversary of the demise of the parents. Merit 
of these good actions is offered to the departed after such ceremony. Moreover 
after every <I>punna-kamma</I> (good action), a Buddhist never fails to think of 
his parents and offer merit. Such is the loyalty and the gratitude shown to 
parents as advised by the Buddha. <!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<A
