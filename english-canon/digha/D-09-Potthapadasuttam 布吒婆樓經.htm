<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>This Sutta, 
beginning with a discussion on the mystery of trance, passes over, by a natural 
transition, or association of ideas, to the question of soul. For trance (as is 
pointed out by Poññhapàda in &#57430; 6) had been explained by adherents of the soul 
theory as produced by the supposed fact of a 'soul' having gone away out of the 
body.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>As is well known, 
this hypothesis of a soul inside the body has been adopted,. and no doubt quite 
independently, among so many different peoples in all parts of the world that it 
may fairly be described as almost universal. It is even by no means certain that 
it has not been quite universal; in which case its adoption is probably a 
necessary result of the methods of thought possible to men in early times. But 
it is, unfortunately, very easy for us, who now no longer use the word 'soul' 
exclusively in its original sense, to misunderstand the ancient view, and to 
import into it modern conceptions<A title="" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1"

name=_ftnref1><SPAN class=MsoFootnoteReference><SPAN 
style="mso-special-character: footnote"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></SPAN></SPAN></A>. 
The oldest and simplest form of the hypothesis was frankly materialistic. The 
notion was that of a double-shadowy, no doubt, and impalpable-but still a 
physical double of the physical body; and made up, like the body, of the four 
elements.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>When the 'soul' 
was away the body lay still, without moving, apparently without life, in trance. 
or disease, or sleep. When the 'soul' came back, motion began again, and life. 
Endless were the corollaries of a theory which, however devoid of the essential 
marks of a sound scientific hypothesis, underlies every variety of early 
speculation in India, as elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>Long before the 
date of the earliest records of Indian belief this theory, among the ancestors 
of the men to whom we owe those records, had gone through a whole course of

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>details of it, as 
they held it, are nowhere set out in full, or in any detail. The hypothesis 
having been handed down from time immemorial, and being accepted by all, it was 
considered amply sufficient to refer to it in vague and indirect phraseology<A 
title="" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn2"

style="mso-special-character: footnote"><![if !supportFootnotes]>[2]<![endif]></SPAN></SPAN></A>. 
And the stage which the theory had reached before the time when our Sutta was 
composed can only be pieced together imperfectly from incidental references in 
the Upanishads.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>I have collected 
these references together in the article already referred to (J. R. A. S., 
1899), and need here only state the result. This is that the Upanishads show how 
the whole theory of the priests, as there set out, is throughout based on this 
old theory of a soul inside the body. The numerous details are full of 
inconsistencies, more especially on the point, so important to theologians, as 
to what happens to the soul after it flies away from the body. But not one of 
these inconsistent views leaves for a moment the basis of the soul theory. That 
is always taken for granted. And the different views set out in these priestly 
manuals by no means exhaust the list of speculations about the soul that must 
have been current in India when Buddhism arose, and when our Sutta was composed. 
There were almost certainly other views, allied to one or other of the 
thirty-two theories controverted above (pp. 44, 45), A careful search would no 
doubt reveal passages, even in the later priestly literature itself, 
acknowledging views which do not happen to be referred to in the Upanishads, but 
which bear the stamp of great antiquity-such passages as Mahàbhàrata XII, 11704, 
where we are told that if the soul, in departing from the body goes out by way 
of the knees, it will go to the Sàdhyas.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>However, that may 
be, it is certain that all the religions, and all the philosophies, the existing 
records show to have existed in India, in the time when Buddhism arose, are 
based on this belief in a subtle but material 'soul' inside the body, and in 
shape like the body. It would scarcely be going too far to say that all 
religions, and all philosophies, then existing in the world. were based upon it. 
Buddhism stands alone among the religions of India in ignoring the soul. The 
vigour and originality of this new departure are evident from the complete 
isolation in which Buddhism stands, in this respect, from all other religious 
systems then existing in the world. And the very great difficulty which those 
European writers, who are still steeped in animistic</SPAN></P>

how difficult it must have been for the originator of it to take so decisive and 
so far-reaching a step in religion and philosophy, at so early a period in the 
history of human thought.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>Nearly a quarter 
of a century ago I put this in the forefront of my first exposition of Buddhism. 
The publication, since then, of numerous texts has shown how the early Buddhist 
writers had previously followed precisely the same method<A title="" 
style="mso-footnote-id: ftn3"

They reserve, as is only natural, the enthusiasm of their poetry and eloquence 
for the positive side of their doctrine, for Arahatship. But the doctrine of the 
impermanence of each and every condition, physical or mental; the absence of any 
abiding principle, any entity, any <I

nissattatà, nijjãvatà, anattalakkhaõatà, na h'ettha sassato bhàvo attà và 
upalabbhati) is treated, from the numerous points of view from which it can be 
approached, in as many different Suttas.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>For the most 
part, one point only is dealt with in each text. In our Sutta it is, in the 
first place, the gradual change of mental conditions, of states of 
consciousness: and then, secondly, the point that personality, individuality 
(attapañilàbho) is only a convenient expression in common use in the world, and 
therefore made use of also by the Tathàgata, but only in such a manner that he 
is not led astray by its ambiguity, by its apparent implication of some 
permanent entity.</SPAN></P>

Tinduka trees, and known by the name of 'The Hall<A title=""

so.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>3. Now at that 
time Poññhapàda was seated with the company of the mendicants all talking with 
loud voices, with shouts and tumult, all sorts of worldly talk: to wit, tales of 
kings, of robbers, of ministers of state; tales of war, of terrors, of battles; 
talks about foods and drinks, about clothes and beds and garlands and perfumes; 
talks about relationships; talks about equipages, villages, towns, cities, and 
countries; tales about women and heroes; gossip such as that at street corners, 
and places whence water is fetched; ghost stories ; desultory chatter ; legends 
about the creation of the land or sea; and speculations about existence and 
non-existence<A title="" style="mso-footnote-id: ftn7"

Poññhapàda, the mendicant, caught sight of the Exalted One approaching in the 
distance. And at the sight of him he called the assembly to order, saying: 'Be 
still, venerable Sirs, and make no noise. Here is the Samaõa Gotama coming. Now 
that venerable one delights in quiet, and speaks in praise of quietude. How well 
it were if, seeing how quiet the assembly is, he should see fit to join us!' And 
when he spake thus, the mendicants kept silence.</SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><SPAN lang=EN-GB>5. Now the

afterwards about that. But long ago, Sir, on several occasions, when various

some said thus: " Ideas come to a man without a reason and without a cause, and

they explain the cessation of consciousness.</SPAN></P>

doubtful. It means primarily 'to go back towards, to revert,' and is so used in

to go to a place of security ; so in a secondary sense, of opinions or reasons, 
it means apparently to revert to them, fall back on them, harp on them, with the

or another, left it again, no less than seven times. (The same thing is related 
by I-Tsing of Bhart.r.ihari.) He prided himself on his keenness in 
distinguishing subtle differences in the meanings of words And his last revolt 
was owing to a discussion of that sort he had had with Mahà Koññhita. He took
