The fonts in this archive implement the CSX+ character set designed
for use in printing Indian language material in Roman script. They
are based on fonts designed by

  URW++ Design and Development Incorporated
  Poppenbuetteler Bogen 29A
  D-22399 Hamburg
  Germany

and made available under the terms of the GNU General Public License,
a copy of which is included in this archive in the file COPYING. The
chief provision of the GPL is that software licensed under it may be
freely redistributed provided the author's copyright is properly
acknowledged. As permitted under Section 2 of the GPL, I have modified
the fonts to implement the CSX+ encoding, using a program I have
written to create arbitrarily accented Type 1 PostScript fonts.
Creation of .PFM files and conversion from PostScript to TrueType was
with the program TypeTool. The modified fonts, like the originals, are
distributed under the GPL. However, the copyright remains with URW++
Design and Development Incorporated. The modified fonts were first
created on July 28-9, 1998.

The TrueType fonts are held in the files with a .TTF extension; .PFB,
.AFM and .PFM files contain the original Type 1 PostScript versions.

The particular fonts used in this archive are based on the typeface
NimbusRomNo9L, which is URW++'s name for their Times-lookalike.

The definition file used to create the modified font contains a
complete character-by-character listing: it is included in this
archive in the file CSX-PLUS.DEF.
