      width=32 border=0></A><BR>"To feel is everything!" -- so exclaimed a 
      German poet. Though these are rather exuberant words, they do point to the 
      fact that feeling is a key factor in human life. Whether people are fully 
      aware of it or not, their lives are chiefly spent in an unceasing endeavor 
      to increase their pleasant feelings and to avoid unpleasant feelings. All 
      human ambitions and strivings serve that purpose: from the simple joys of 
      a humdrum existence to the power urge of the mighty and the creative joy 
      of the great artist. All that is wanted is to have more and more of 
      pleasant feelings, because they bring with them emotional satisfaction, 
      called happiness. Such happiness may have various levels of coarseness or 
      refinement, and may reach great intensity. These emotions, on their part, 
      will produce many volitions and their actualizations. For the purpose of 
      satisfying the "pleasure principle," many heroic deeds have been 
      performed, and many more unheroic and unscrupulous ones. For providing the 
      means to pleasurable feelings, thousands of industries and services have 
      sprung up, with millions of workers. Technology and applied sciences, too, 
      serve to a large extent the growing demands for sense-enjoyment and 
      comfort. By providing questionable escape routes, these purveyors of 
      emotional and sensual happiness also try to allay painful feelings like 
      fear and anxiety. </FONT></P>
      <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 50px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 50px" align=justify><FONT 
      face=Arial>From this brief purview one may now appreciate the significance 
      of the Buddha's terse saying that <I>"all things converge on 
      feelings."</I> From such a central position of feeling it can also be 
      understood that misconceptions about feelings belong to the twenty 
      Personality Views, where the Aggregate of Feeling <I>(vedana-kkhandha)</I> 
      is in various ways identified with an assumed self. </FONT></P>
      <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 50px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 50px" align=justify><FONT 
      face=Arial>Yet, <I>feeling</I> by itself, in its primary state, is quite 
      neutral when it registers the impact of an object as pleasant, unpleasant 
      or indifferent. Only when emotional or volitional additions are admitted, 
      will there arise desire and love, aversion and hate, anxiety, fear and 
      distorting views. But that need not be so. These admixtures are not 
      inseparable parts of the respective feelings. In fact, many of the weaker 
      impressions we receive during the day stop at the mere registering of a 
      very faint and brief feeling, without any further emotional reaction. This 
      shows that the stopping at the bare feeling is psychologically possible, 
      and that it could also be done intentionally with the help of mindfulness 
      and self-restraint, even in cases when the stimulus to convert feelings 
      into emotions is strong. Through actual experience it can thus be 
      confirmed that the ever-revolving round of Dependent Origination 
      <I>(paticca-samuppada)</I> can be stopped at the point of Feeling, and 
      that there is no inherent necessity that Feeling is followed by Craving. 
      Here we encounter Feeling as a key factor on the path of liberation, and 
      therefore, the <I>Contemplation of Feeling</I> has, in Buddhist tradition, 
      always been highly regarded as an effective aid on that path. </FONT></P>
      <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 50px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 50px" align=justify><FONT 
      face=Arial>The Contemplation of Feeling is one of the four Foundations of 
      Mindfulness <I>(satipatthana)</I> and may be undertaken in the framework 
      of that meditative practice aiming at the growth of Insight 
      <I>(vipassana).</I> It is, however, essential that this Contemplation 
      should also be remembered and applied in daily life whenever feelings are 
      prone to turn into unwholesome emotions. Of course, one should not try to 
      <I>produce</I> in oneself feelings intentionally, just for the sake of 
      practice; they should rather be taken up for mindful observation only when 
      they occur. There will be many such occasions, provided the mind is alert 
      and calm enough to notice the feelings clearly at their primary stage. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 50px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 50px" align=justify><FONT 
      face=Arial>In the Contemplation of Feelings, there should first be a 
      mindful awareness of the feelings when they arise, and one should clearly 
      distinguish them as pleasant, unpleasant (painful) or neutral, 
      respectively. There is no such thing as "mixed feelings." </FONT></P>
      <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 50px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 50px" align=justify><FONT 
      face=Arial>Mindfulness should be maintained throughout the short duration 
      of that specific feeling, down to its cessation. If the vanishing point of 
      feelings is repeatedly seen with increasing clarity, it will become much 
      easier to trap, and finally to stop, those emotions, thoughts and 
      volitions, which normally follow so rapidly, and which are so often 
      habitually associated with the feelings. Pleasant feeling is habitually 
      linked with enjoyment and desire; unpleasant feeling with aversion; 
      neutral feeling with boredom and confusion, but also serving as background 
      for wrong views. But when Bare Attention is directed towards the arising 
      and vanishing of feelings, these polluting additives will be held a bay; 
      or when they have arisen they will be immediately cognized in their 
      nature, and that cognition may often be sufficient to stop them from 
      growing stronger by unopposed continuance. </FONT></P>
      <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 50px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 50px" align=justify><FONT 
      face=Arial>If feelings are seen in their bubble-like blowing up and 
      bursting, their linkage with craving or aversion will be weakened more and 
      more, until that bondage is finally broken. By that practice, attachment 
      to likes and dislikes will be reduced and thereby an inner space will be 
      provided for the growth of the finer emotions and virtues: for 
      loving-kindness and compassion, for contentment, patience and forbearance. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 50px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 50px" align=justify><FONT 
      face=Arial>In this contemplation it is of particular importance to 
      dissociate the feelings from even the faintest thoughts of "I" or "mine." 
      There should be no ego-reference, as for instance <I>"I</I> feel (and, 
      therefore, I am)." Nor should there be any thought of being the owner of 
      the feelings: "I have pleasant feelings. How happy I am!" With the 
      thought, "I want to have more of them" craving arises. Or, "I have pains. 
      How unhappy I am!" and wishing to get rid of the pains, aversion arises. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 50px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 50px" align=justify><FONT 
      face=Arial>Avoiding these wrong and unrealistic views, one should be aware 
      of the feelings as a conditioned and transient process. Mindfulness should 
      be kept alert and it should be focused on the bare fact that there is just 
      the mental function of such and such a feeling; and this awareness should 
      serve no other purpose than that of knowledge and mindfulness, as stated 
      in the Satipatthana Sutta. As long as one habitually relates the feelings 
      to a person that "has" them, and does so even during meditation, there 
      cannot be any progress in that Contemplation. </FONT></P>
      <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 50px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 50px" align=justify><FONT 
      face=Arial>To be aware of the feelings without any ego-reference will also 
      help to distinguish them clearly from the physical stimuli arousing them, 
      as well as from the subsequent mental reactions to them. Thereby the 
      meditator will be able to keep his attention focused on the feelings 
      alone, without straying into other areas. This is the purport of the 
      phrase "he contemplates feelings in the feelings" as stated in the 
      Satipatthana Sutta. At this stage of the practice, the meditator will 
      become more familiar with the Insight Knowledge of "Discerning mentality 
      and materiality" <I>(nama-rupa-pariccheda).</I> </FONT></P>
      <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 50px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 50px" align=justify><FONT 
      face=Arial>Further progress, however, will require persistence in the 
      mindful observations of the arising and passing away of every instant of 
      feeling whenever it occurs. This will lead to a deepening experience of 
      impermanence <I>(anicca),</I> being one of the main gates to final 
      liberation. When, in Insight Meditation (vipassana), the vanishing moment 
      of feelings becomes more strongly marked, the impermanent nature of the 
      feelings will impress itself very deeply on the meditator's mind. This 
      experience, gained also from other mental and bodily processes, will 
      gradually mature into the Insight Knowledge of Dissolution

      Contemplation of Feelings can unfold its full strength as an efficient 
      tool for breaking the chain of suffering at its weakest link. But from 
      this Contemplation, considerable benefits can be derived also by those 
      who, in their daily life, devote only some quiet reflection to their 
      feelings and emotions, even if done retrospectively. They will soon find 
      that feelings and emotions are "separable." Even this reflective and 
      retrospective contemplation can help them to a fuller awareness of 
      feelings and emotions when they actually occur. This again can save them 
      from being carried away by the emotional cross-currents of elation and 
      dejection. The mind will then gradually reach a higher level of firmness 
      and equipoise, just by that simple procedure of looking, or looking back 
      at, one's feelings and emotions. </FONT></P>
      <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 50px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 50px" align=justify><FONT 
      face=Arial>This, however, should not, and need not, be made a constant 
      practice, but should be taken up on suitable occasions and for a limited 
      period of time until one has become familiar with the mechanism of 
      feelings followed by emotions. Such an understanding of the process will 
      result in an increasing control over one's emotional reactions, and this 
      will happen in a natural, spontaneous way. One need not have fears that 
      one's focusing the mind on the feelings and emotions, in the manner 
      described, will lead to cold aloofness or an emotional withdrawal. On the 
      contrary, mind and heart will become more open to all those finer emotions 
      spoken of before. It will not exclude warm human relationships, nor the 
      enjoyment of beauty in art and nature. But it will remove from them the 
      fever of clinging, so that these experiences will give a deeper 
      satisfaction, as far as this world of Dukkha admits. </FONT></P>

      sensation noted as pleasant, unpleasant (painful) and neutral 
      (indifferent). Hence, it should not be confused with <I>emotion</I> which, 
      though arising from the basic feeling, adds to it likes or dislikes of

      Aggregate of Mental Formations <I>(sankhara-kkhandha).</I> Feeling is one 
      of the four mental Aggregates which arise, inseparably, in all states of 
      consciousness; the other three are perception, mental formations, and 
      consciousness. </FONT></P>
      <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 50px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 50px" align=justify><FONT 
      face=Arial>Feeling arises whenever there is the meeting of three factors, 
      i.e., sense-organ, object and consciousness. It is called the meeting of 
      these three that, in Buddhist psychology, is called sense-impression 
      (contact, impact; <I>phassa),</I> which is a mental, and not a physical 
      process. It is sixfold, as being conditioned either by of the five 
      physical senses or by mind. it is this sixfold sense-impression by which 
      the corresponding six feelings are conditioned. In the formula of the 
      Dependent Origination <I>(paticca-samuppada),</I> this is expressed by the

      the force of the water, which is the abode of aquatic animals as well as 
      dragon deities (naga), etc. Hence, for these beings, this abyss provides a 
      basis for their existence, a comfortable abode. Therefore, to call it a 
      <I>bottomless</I> pit is unrealistic and not factual, because it gives an 
      inadequate and non-evident meaning to the word. It is rather bodily pain, 
      inseparable from bodily existence, which deserves to be called a

      'pleasure' <I>(sukha),</I> on account of its being peaceful and sublime.
