<h4><A NAME="before">I. Thoughts Before Going Forth</A></h4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<b>1.</b> When, O when shall I live all alone<br>
in mountain caves, unmated with desire,<br>
clear seeing as unstable all that comes to be?<br>
This wish of mine, when indeed will it be?
<p>
<b>2.</b> When shall I, wearing the patchwork robes<br>
of colour dun, be sage, uncraving, never making mine,<br>
with greed, aversion and delusion slain<br>
and to the wild woods gone, in bliss abide?
<p>
<b>3.</b> When shall I, this body seeing clear -- <br>
unstable nest of dying and disease<br>
oppressed by age and death, dwell free from fear<br>
in the woods alone? When indeed will it be?
<p>
<b>4.</b> When indeed shall I dwell seizing the sharpened sword<br>
of wisdom made? When cut the craving creeper -- <br>
breeder of fear, bringer of pain and woe,<br>
and twining everywhere? When indeed will it be?
<p>
<b>5.</b> When lion-like in the victor's stance<br>
shall I draw quick the sage's sword<br>
of wisdom forged and fiery might<br>
quick breaking Mara with his host? When indeed will it be?
<p>
<b>6.</b> When myself exerting, shall I be seen<br>
in goodly company of those esteeming Dhamma?<br>
Those with faculties subdued who see things as they are?<br>
Those who are 'Thus'? When indeed will it be?
<p>
<b>7.</b> When indeed will weariness not worry me -- <br>
hunger, thirst and wind, heat, bugs and creeping things,<br>
while bent on my own good, the Goal,<br>
in Giribbaja's wilds? When indeed will it be?
<p>
<b>8.</b> When indeed shall I, self-mindful and composed<br>
win to that wisdom known by Him,<br>
the Greatest Sage, the Four Truths won within,<br>
so very hard to see? When indeed will it be?
<p>
<b>9.</b> When shall I, possessed of meditation's calm<br>
with wisdom see the forms innumerable,<br>
sounds, smells and tastes, touches and dhammas too,<br>
as a raging blaze? When will this be for me?
<p>
<b>10.</b> When shall I indeed, when with abusive words<br>
addressed, not be displeased because of that,<br>
and then again when praised be neither pleased<br>
because of that? When will this be for me?
<p>
<b>11.</b> When shall I indeed weigh as the same:<br>
wood, grass and creepers with these craved-for groups,<br>
both inner and external forms<br>
the dhammas numberless? When will it be for me?
<p>
<b>12.</b> When in the season of the black raincloud<br>
shall I follow the path within the wood<br>
trodden by those that See; robes moistened<br>
by new falling rain? When indeed will it be?
<p>
<b>13.</b> When in a mountain cave having heard the peacock's cry,<br>
that crested twice-born, bird down in the wood,<br>
shall I arise and collect together mind<br>
for attaining the undying? When indeed will it be?
<p>
<b>14.</b> When shall I, the Ganges and the Yamuna,<br>
the Sarasvati and the awful ocean mouth<br>
of the Balava-abyss, by psychic might<br>
untouching go across? When indeed will it be?
<p>
<b>15.</b> When shall I, like charging elephant unbound,<br>
break up desire for sensual happiness<br>
and shunning all the marks of loveliness<br>
strive in concentrated states? When indeed will it be?
<p>
<b>16.</b> When, as pauper by his debts distressed,<br>
by creditors oppressed, a treasure finds,<br>
shall I be pleased the Teaching to attain<br>
of the Greatest Sage? When indeed will it be?

<h4>II. Self-admonishments After Going Forth</h4>
<blockquote>
<b>17.</b> Long years have I been begged by you<br>
'Enough for you of this living in a house.'<br>
by now I have gone forth to homelessness<br>
what reason is there, mind, for you not to urge me on?
<p>
<b>18.</b> Was I not, O mind, assured by you indeed:<br>
'The brightly plumaged birds on Giribbaja's peaks<br>
greeting the thunder, the sound of great Indra,<br>
will bring to you joy meditating in the wood?'
<p>
<b>19.</b> Dear ones and friends and kin within the family,<br>
playing and loving, sensual pleasures of the world:<br>
all have I given up and reached at last to this,<br>
even now, O mind, you are not pleased with me.
<p>
<b>20.</b> Mine you are, mind, possessed by none but me;<br>
why then lament when comes this time to arm?<br>
Seeing all as unstable this is now renounced:<br>
longing for, desirous of the Undying State.
<p>
<b>21.</b> Said He who speaks the best, Best among mankind,<br>
man-taming trainer, Physician Great indeed:<br>
'Unsteady, likened to a monkey is the mind,<br>
extremely hard to check by not rid of lust.'
<p>
<b>22.</b> For varied, sweet, delightful are desires of sense;<br>
blind, foolish common men long have lain in them<br>
seeking after birth again, 'tis they who wish for ill,<br>
by mind they are led on to perish in hell.
<p>
<b>23.</b> 'In the jungle you should dwell, resounding with the cries<br>
of peacocks and herons, by pard and tiger hailed:<br>
Abandon longing for the body -- do not fail'<br>
So indeed my mind you used to urge me on.
<p>
<b>24.</b> 'Grow in concentrations, the faculties and powers,<br>
develop wisdom-factors by meditation deep<br>
and then with Triple Knowledge touch the Buddha-sasana.'<br>
So indeed my mind you used to urge me on.
<p>
<b>25.</b> 'Grow in the Eightfold Way for gaining the Undying<br>
leading to Release and cleansing of all stains;<br>
Plunge to the utter destruction of all Ill!'<br>
So indeed my mind you used to urge me on.
<p>
<b>26.</b> 'Thoroughly examine the craved-for groups as Ill.<br>
Abandon that from which arises ill.<br>
Here and now make you an end of ill.'<br>
So indeed my mind you used to urge me on.
<p>
<b>27.</b> 'Thoroughly see inward the impermanent as ill,<br>
the void as without self, and misery as bane,<br>
and so the mind restrain in its mental wanderings.'<br>
So indeed my mind you used to urge me on.
<p>
<b>28.</b> 'Head-shaven and unsightly, go to be reviled,<br>
among the people beg with skull-like bowl in hand.<br>
To the Greatest Sage, the Teacher's word devote yourself.'<br>
So indeed my mind you used to urge at me on.
<p>
<b>29.</b> 'Wander well-restrained among the streets and families<br>
having a mind to sensual pleasures unattached,<br>
as the full moon shining clear at night.'<br>
So indeed my mind you used to urge me on.
<p>
<b>30.</b> 'You should be a forest-dweller, almsman too,<br>
a graveyard-dweller and a rag-robe wearer too,<br>
one never lying down, delighting in austerities.'<br>
So indeed my mind you used to urge me on.
<p>
<b>31.</b> As he who having planted trees about to fruit<br>
should wish to cut a tree down to the root:<br>
that simile you made, mind, that do you desire<br>
when on me urge the unstable and the frail.
<p>
<b>32.</b> Formless one, far-traveler, a wanderer alone,<br>
no more shall I your bidding do, for sense desires<br>
are ill, leading to bitter fruit, to brooding fear:<br>
with mind Nibbana-turned I shall walk on.
<p>
<b>33.</b> Not from lack of luck did I go forth,<br>
nor shamelessness, nor caused by mind's inconstancy,<br>
nor banishment nor caused by livelihood,<br>
and therefore I agreed with you, O mind.
<p>
<b>34.</b> 'Having few wishes, disparagement's abandoning,<br>
with the stilling of all ill is praised by goodly men'<br>
so indeed, my mind, then you urged at me,<br>
but now you go back to habits made of old.
<p>
<b>35.</b> Craving, unknowing, the liked and the disliked,<br>
delighting in forms and pleasing feelings too,<br>
dear pleasures of the senses -- all have been vomited:<br>
never to that vomit can I make myself return.
<p>
<b>36.</b> In every life, O mind, your word was done by me,<br>
In many births I have not sought to anger you.<br>
That which within oneself produced by you, ingrate,<br>
long wandered on in ill create by you.
<p>
<b>37.</b> Indeed it is you, mind, makes us brahmanas,<br>
you make us noble warriors, kings and seers as well,<br>
sometimes it is merchant or workers become,<br>
or led by you indeed we come to gods' estate.
<p>
<b>38.</b> Indeed you are the cause of becoming titans too,<br>
and you are the root for becoming in the hells;<br>
sometimes there is going to birth as animals,<br>
or led by you indeed be come to ghosts' estate.
<p>
<b>39.</b> Not now will you injure me ever and again,<br>
moment by moment as though showing me a play,<br>
as with one gone mad you play with me -- <br>
but how, O mind, have you been failed by me?
<p>
<b>40.</b> Formerly this wandering mind, a wanderer,<br>
went where it wished, wherever whim or pleasure led,<br>
today I shall thoroughly restrain it<br>
as a trainer's hook the elephant in rut.
<p>
<b>41.</b> He, the Master made me see this world -- <br>
unstable, unsteady, lacking any essence;<br>
now in the Conqueror's Teaching, mind make me leap<br>
cross me over the great floods so very hard to cross!
<p>
<b>42.</b> Now it's not for you, mind, as it was before,<br>
not likely am I to return to your control -- <br>
in the Greatest Sage's Sasana I have gone forth<br>
and those like me are not by ruin wrapped.
<p>
<b>43.</b> Mountains, seas, rivers, and this wealthy world,<br>
four quarters, points between, the nadir and the heavens<br>
all the Three Becomings unstable and oppressed.<br>
Where, mind, having gone will you happily delight?
<p>
<b>44.</b> Firm, firm in my aim! What will you do, my mind?<br>
No longer in your power, mind, nor your follower.<br>
None would even handle a double-ended sack,<br>
let be a thing filled full and flowing with nine streams.
<p>
<b>45.</b> Whether peak or slopes or fair open space<br>
or forest besprinkled with fresh showers in the Rains,<br>
where frequently are found boar and antelope,<br>
there will you delight to a grotto-lodging gone.
<p>
<b>46.</b> Fair blue-throated and fair-crested, the peacock fair of tail,<br>
wing-plumes of many hues, the passengers of air,<br>
greeting the thunder with fair-sounding cries<br>
will bring to you joy meditating in the wood.
<p>
<b>47.</b> When the sky-god rains on the four inch grass<br>
and on full-flowering cloud-like woods,<br>
within the mountains like a log I'll lie<br>
and soft that seat to me as cotton down.
<p>
<b>48.</b> Thus will I do even as a master should:<br>
Let whatever is obtained be enough for me,<br>
that indeed I'll do to you as energetic man<br>
by taming makes supple a catskin bag.
<p>
<b>49.</b> Thus will I do even as a master should;<br>
Let whatever is obtained be enough for me,<br>
by energy I'll bring you in my power<br>
as a skilled trainer the elephant in rut.
<p>
<b>50.</b> With you well-tamed, no longer turning round,<br>
like to a trainer with a straight running horse,<br>
I am able to practice the safe and blissful Path<br>
ever frequented by them who guard the mind.
<p>
<b>51.</b> I'll bind you by strength to the meditation-base<br>
as elephant to post by a strong rope bound;<br>
well-guarded by me, well-grown with mindfulness,<br>
you shall, by all becomings, be without support.
<p>
<b>52.</b> With wisdom cutting off wending the wrong path,<br>
by endeavour restrained, established in the Path,<br>
having seen the origin of passing, rising too -- <br>
you will be an heir to the Speaker of the Best.
<p>
<b>53.</b> You dragged me, mind, as on an ox's round,<br>
in the power of the Four Perversions set;<br>
come now, serve the Great Sage, Compassionate,<br>
He the sure cutter of fetters and bonds.
<p>
<b>54.</b> As a deer roams in the very varied woods<br>
and goes to the pleasant crest garlanded by clouds,<br>
so there you will delight on that unentangled mount.<br>
There is no doubt, mind, you'll be established there.
<p>
<b>55.</b> Men and women enjoying any happiness<br>
controlled by thy desires and delighting in life,<br>
blind fools they are who comply with Mara's power,<br>
they driven on, O mind, servants are of thee.
