I, a monk,<br>
gone to the charnel ground,<br>
saw a woman cast away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discarded<br>
there in the cemetery.
<p>
Though some were disgusted,<br>
seeing her -- dead, evil -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lust<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appeared,<br>
as if I were blind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the oozings.
<p>
In less time than it takes<br>
for rice to cook,<br>
I got out of that place.<br>
Mindful, alert, I<br>
sat down to one side.<br>
Then apt attention arose in me,<br>
the drawbacks appeared,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disenchantment stood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at an even keel:
<p>
With that, my heart was released.<br>
See the Dhamma's true rightness!<br>
The three knowledges<br>
have been attained;<br>
the Awakened One's bidding,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; done.

Stricken by sharp, wind-like pains,<br>
you, monk, living in the forest grove<br>
-- harsh, with limited range for alms -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what, what will you do?
<p>
Suffusing my body<br>
with abundant rapture &amp; joy,<br>
&amp; enduring what's harsh,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll stay in the grove.
<p>
Developing the frames of reference,<br>
strengths, faculties,<br>
the factors of Awakening,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll stay in the grove.
<p>
Reflecting on those who are resolute,<br>
their persistence aroused,<br>
constantly firm in their effort,<br>
united in concord,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll stay in the grove.
<p>
Recollecting the One Self-awakened,<br>
self-tamed &amp; centered,<br>
untiring both day &amp; night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll stay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the grove.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I shall fasten you, mind, like an elephant at a small gate. I shall not incite you to evil, you net of sensual pleasure, body-born.
<p>
When fastened, you will not go, like an elephant not finding the gate open. Witch-mind, you will not wander again, and again, using force, delighting in evil.
<p>
As the strong hook-holder makes an untamed elephant, newly taken, turn against its will, so shall I make you turn.
<p>
As the excellent charioteer, skilled in the taming of excellent horses, tames a thoroughbred, so shall I, standing firm in the five powers, tame you.
<p>
I shall bind you with mindfulness; with purified self shall cleanse [you]. Restrained by the yoke of energy you will not go far from here, mind.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intent on quibbling,<br>
the dullard hears the Conqueror's teaching.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A NAME="ground">He's as</A> far from the True Dhamma<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as the ground is from the sky.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intent on quibbling,<br>
the dullard hears the Conqueror's teaching.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A NAME="moon">He wanes</A> from the True Dhamma,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like the moon in the dark half of the month.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intent on quibbling,<br>
the dullard hears the Conqueror's teaching.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A NAME="fish">He withers</A> away in the True Dhamma,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like a fish in next to no water.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intent on quibbling,<br>
the dullard hears the Conqueror's teaching.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A NAME="seed">He doesn't grow</A> in the True Dhamma,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like a rotten seed in a field.
<p>
But whoever hears the Conqueror's teaching<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with guarded intent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doing away with effluents -- all -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; realizing the unshakable,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attaining the foremost peace,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is -- free from effluent -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; totally unbound.
