<BLOCKQUOTE>
Since I went forth<br>
from home into homelessness,<br>
I haven't known<br>
an ignoble, aversive resolve.<br>
"May these beings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be destroyed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be slaughtered,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fall into pain" -- <br>
I've not known this resolve<br>
in this long, long time.<br>
But I have known good will,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unlimited,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fully developed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nurtured step after step,<br>
as taught by the One<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Awake:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to all, a friend;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to all, a comrade;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for all beings, sympathetic.<br>
And I develop a mind of good will,<br>
delighting in non-malevolence -- always.<br>
Unvanquished, unshaken,<br>
I gladden the mind.<br>
I develop the sublime abiding,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not frequented by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the lowly.
<p>
<A NAME="silence">Attaining</A> no-thinking,<br>
the disciple of the Rightly<br>
Self-awakened One<br>
is endowed with noble silence<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; straightaway.
<p>
<A NAME="mtn">As a</A> mountain of rock<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is unmoving,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; firmly established,<br>
so a monk, with the ending of delusion,<br>
like a mountain, doesn't quake.
<p>
<A NAME="storm">To</A> a person without blemish,<br>
constantly in search of what's pure,<br>
a hair-tip of evil<br>
seems a storm cloud.
<p>
<A NAME="fort">As a</A> frontier fortress is guarded<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; within &amp; without,<br>
you should safeguard yourselves.<br>
Don't let the moment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pass you by.
<p>
I don't delight in death,<br>
don't delight in living.<br>
I await my time<br>
like a worker his wage.<br>
I don't delight in death,<br>
don't delight in living.<br>
I await my time<br>
mindful, alert.
<p>
The Teacher has been served by me;<br>
the Awakened One's bidding,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; done;<br>
the heavy load, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; laid down;<br>
the guide to becoming, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uprooted.<br>
And the goal for which I went forth<br>
from home life into homelessness<br>
I've reached:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the end<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of all fetters.
<p>
Attain completion through heedfulness:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that is my message.<br>
So then, I'm about to be<br>
Unbound.<br>
I'm released<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; everywhere.

<A NAME="bull">Just as</A> a fine, well-bred bull<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yoked to a load,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enduring his load,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crushed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the heavy burden,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't throw down his yoke;<br>
so, too, those who are filled with discernment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- as the ocean, with water -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; don't look down on others.<br>
This is nobility among beings.
<p>
Having fallen in time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under the sway of time,<br>
having come under the sway<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of becoming-becoming,<br>
people fall subject to pain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; they grieve.
<p>
Elated by the causes of pleasure,<br>
&amp; cast down by causes of pain,<br>
fools are destroyed by both,<br>
not seeing them for what they are.<br>
While those who, in the midst of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pleasure &amp; pain<br>
have gone past the seamstress of craving,<br>
stand firm<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like a boundary pillar,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neither elated nor cast down.
<p>
Not to gain or loss<br>
not to status or honor,<br>
not to praise or blame,<br>
not to pleasure or pain:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; everywhere<br>
they do not adhere -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like a water bead<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on a lotus.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everywhere<br>
they are happy, the enlightened,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; everywhere<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; un-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; defeated.
<p>
No matter what<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the unrighteous gain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or the righteous loss,<br>
righteous loss is better<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than if there were unrighteous gain.<br>
No matter what<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the status of the unaware<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or the lowliness of those who know,<br>
the lowliness of those who know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is better,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not the status of those<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unaware.<br>
No matter what<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the praise from fools<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or the censure from those who know,<br>
the censure from those who know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is better<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than if there were praise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from fools.<br>
And as for the pleasure<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from sensuality<br>
and the pain from seclusion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the pain from seclusion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is better<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than if there were pleasure<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from sensuality.<br>
And as for living through unrighteousness<br>
and dying for righteousness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dying for righteousness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is better,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than if one were to live<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through unrighteousness.
<p>
Those who've abandoned<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sensuality &amp; anger,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whose minds are calmed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from becoming &amp; non-,<br>
go through the world<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unattached.<br>
For them there is nothing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dear or undear.<br>
Developing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the factors of Awakening,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; faculties,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; strengths,<br>
attaining the foremost peace,<br>
without fermentation, they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are entirely<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbound.
