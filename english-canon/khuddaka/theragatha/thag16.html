<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>[The bandit chief:]</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Those who<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the sake of sacrifice<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the sake of wealth<br>
we have killed in the past,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; against their will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have trembled &amp; babbled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from fear.<br>
But you -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you show no fear;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your complexion brightens.<br>
Why don't you lament<br>
in the face of what's greatly to be feared
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<br><p>
<I>[Ven. Adhimutta:]</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are no painful mental states, chieftain,<br>
in one without longing.<br>
<A NAME="death1">In one</A> whose fetters are ended,<br>
all fears are overcome.<br>
With the ending of [craving]<br>
the guide to becoming,<br>
when phenomena are seen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for what they are,<br>
then just as in the laying down of a burden,<br>
there's no fear in death.
<p>
I've lived well the holy life,<br>
well-developed the path.<br>
Death holds no fear for me.<br>
It's like the end of a disease.
<p>
I've &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lived well the holy life,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well-developed the path,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seen states of becoming<br>
as devoid of allure,<br>
like poison spit out<br>
after it's drunk.
<p>
One gone to the far shore<br>
without clinging<br>
without effluent<br>
his task completed,<br>
welcomes the ending of life,<br>
as if freed from a place of execution.<br>
Having attained the supreme Rightness,<br>
unconcerned with all the world,<br>
as if released from a burning house,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he doesn't sorrow at death.
<p>
Whatever's compounded,<br>
wherever a state of becoming's obtained,<br>
all that has no one in charge:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so says the Great Seer.<br>
Whoever discerns this,<br>
as taught by the Awakened One,<br>
would no more grasp hold of any state of becoming<br>
than he would a hot iron ball.<br>
I have no 'I was,'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no 'I will be.'<br>
Fabrications will simply go out of existence.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's to lament there in that?<br>
For one who sees, as it actually is,<br>
the pure arising of phenomena,<br>
the pure seriality of fabrications,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there's no fear.<br>
When seeing the world with discernment<br>
as on a par with grass &amp; twigs,<br>
finding no 'mine-ness,'<br>
thinking, 'There's nothing of mine,'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he feels no sorrow.<br>
Dissatisfied with this carcass,<br>
I'm unconcerned with becoming.<br>
This body will break up<br>
and there will not be another.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do as you like with this carcass.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From that I will feel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neither hatred nor love.

Hearing these awesome, hair-raising words,<br>
the young men threw down their weapons &amp; said:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
What have you done, sir,<br>
or who have you taken as mentor?<br>
Because of whose teachings<br>
is this lack of sorrow acquired?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<br><p>
<I>[Ven. Adhimutta:]</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all-knowing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all-seeing conqueror:<br>
He is my mentor.<br>
Greatly compassionate teacher,<br>
all the world's healer,<br>
this doctrine is his,<br>
unexcelled, leading to ending.<br>
Because of his teachings<br>
is this lack of sorrow acquired.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<br><p>
The bandits, hearing the good words of the seer,<br>
threw down their swords &amp; their weapons.<br>
Some relinquished their life of crime,<br>
some chose the Going Forth.<br>
Having gone forth in the teachings<br>
of the one well-gone,<br>
developing the powers &amp; factors of Awakening,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wise, happy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exultant in mind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their faculties ripened,<br>
they touched uncompounded Unbinding.
