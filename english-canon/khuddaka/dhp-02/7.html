<A name="90"></A><B>90.</B> The fever of passion exists not for him who has completed the journey, who is sorrowless and wholly set free, and has broken all ties. 
<p>
<A name="91"></A><B>91.</B> The mindful ones exert themselves. They are not attached to any home; like swans that abandon the lake, they leave home after home behind.
<p>
<A name="92"></A><B>92.</B> Those who do not accumulate and are wise regarding food, whose object is the Void, the Unconditioned Freedom -- their track cannot be traced, like that of birds in the air. 
<p>
<A name="93"></A><B>93.</B> He whose cankers are destroyed and who is not attached to food, whose object is the Void, the Unconditioned Freedom -- his path cannot be traced, like that of birds in the air.
<p>
<A name="94"></A><B>94.</B> Even the gods hold dear the wise one, whose senses are subdued like horses well trained by a charioteer, whose pride is destroyed and who is free from the cankers.
<p>
<A name="95"></A><B>95.</B> There is no more worldly existence for the wise one who, like the earth, resents nothing, who is firm as a high pillar and as pure as a deep pool free from mud.
<p>
<A name="96"></A><B>96.</B> Calm is his thought, calm his speech, and calm his deed, who, truly knowing, is wholly freed, perfectly tranquil and wise.
<p>
<A name="97"></A><B>97.</B> The man who is without blind faith, who knows the Uncreate, who has severed all links, destroyed all causes (for karma, good and evil), and thrown out all desires -- he, truly, is the most excellent of men.

<p>
<A name="98"></A><B>98.</B> Inspiring, indeed, is that place where Arahats dwell, be it a village, a forest, a vale, or a hill.
<p>
<A name="99"></A><B>99.</B> Inspiring are the forests in which worldlings find no pleasure. There the passionless will rejoice, for they seek no sensual pleasures.
