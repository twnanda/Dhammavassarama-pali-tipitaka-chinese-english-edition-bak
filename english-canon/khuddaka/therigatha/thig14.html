<h3><A NAME="1">XIV</A> -- Subha &amp; the Libertine <A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../../../icon/scrollup.gif" alt="[go to top]"></A></h3>
As Subha the nun was going through <A NAME="jivaka">Jivaka's</A> delightful mango grove, a libertine (a goldsmith's son) blocked her path, so she said to him:
<blockquote>
'What wrong have I done you<br>
that you stand in my way?<br>
It's not proper, my friend,<br>
that a man should touch<br>
a woman gone forth.<br>
I respect the Master's message,<br>
the training pointed out by the one well-gone.<br>
I am pure, without blemish:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you stand in my way?<br>
You -- your mind agitated, impassioned;<br>
I -- unagitated, unimpassioned,<br>
with a mind entirely freed:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you stand in my way?'
<p>
'You are young &amp; not bad-looking,<br>
what need do you have for going forth?<br>
Throw off your ochre robe -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, let's delight in the flowering grove.<br>
A sweetness they exude everywhere,<br>
the towering trees with their pollen.<br>
The beginning of spring is a pleasant season -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, let's delight in the flowering grove.<br>
The trees with their blossoming tips<br>
moan, as it were, in the breeze:<br>
What delight will you have<br>
if you plunge into the grove alone?<br>
Frequented by herds of wild beasts,<br>
disturbed by elephants rutting &amp; aroused:<br>
you want to go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unaccompanied<br>
into the great, lonely, frightening grove?<br>
Like a doll made of gold, you will go about,<br>
like a goddess in the gardens of heaven.<br>
With delicate, smooth <A NAME="kasi">Kasi</A> fabrics,<br>
you will shine, O beauty without compare.<br>
I would gladly do your every bidding<br>
if we were to dwell in the glade.<br>
For there is no creature dearer to me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than you, O nymph with the languid regard.<br>
If you do as I ask, happy, come live in my house.<br>
Dwelling in the calm of a palace,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have women wait on you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wear delicate Kasi fabrics,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adorn yourself with garlands &amp; creams.<br>
I will make you many &amp; varied ornaments<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of gold, jewels, &amp; pearls.<br>
Climb onto a costly bed,<br>
scented with sandalwood carvings,<br>
with a well-washed coverlet, beautiful,<br>
spread with a woolen quilt, brand new.<br>
Like a blue lotus rising from the water<br>
where no human beings dwell,<br>
you will go to old age with your limbs unseen,<br>
if you stay as you are in the holy life.'
<p>
'What do you assume of any essence,<br>
here in this cemetery grower, filled with corpses,<br>
this body destined to break up?<br>
What do you see when you look at me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you who are out of your mind?'
<p>
'Your eyes are like those of a fawn,<br>
like those of a sprite in the mountains.<br>
Seeing your eyes, my sensual delight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grows all the more.<br>
Like tips they are, of blue lotuses,<br>
in your golden face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- spotless:<br>
Seeing your eyes, my sensual delight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grows all the more.<br>
Even if you should go far away,<br>
I will think only of your pure,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long-lashed gaze,<br>
for there is nothing dearer to me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than your eyes, O nymph with the languid regard.'
<p>
'You want to stray from the road,<br>
you want the moon as a plaything,<br>
you want to jump over <A NAME="sineru">Mount Sineru</A>,<br>
you who have designs on one born of the Buddha.<br>
For there is nothing anywhere at all<br>
in the cosmos with its gods,<br>
that would be an object of passion for me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't even know what that passion would be,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for it's been killed, root &amp; all, by the path.<br>
<A NAME="embers">Like embers</A> from a pit -- scattered,<br>
<A NAME="bowl">like a bowl of poison</A> -- evaporated,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't even see what that passion would be,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for it's been killed, root &amp; all, by the path.<br>
Try to seduce one who hasn't reflected on this,<br>
or who has not followed the Master's teaching.<br>
But try it with this one who knows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and you suffer.<br>
For in the midst of praise &amp; blame,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pleasure &amp; pain,<br>
my mindfulness stands firm.<br>
Knowing the unattractiveness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of things compounded,<br>
my mind cleaves to nothing at all.<br>
I am a follower of the one well-gone,<br>
riding the vehicle of the eightfold way:<br>
My arrow removed, effluent-free,<br>
I delight, having gone to an empty dwelling.<br>
For I have seen well-painted puppets,<br>
hitched up with sticks &amp; strings,<br>
made to dance in various ways.<br>
When the sticks &amp; strings are removed,<br>
thrown away, scattered, shredded,<br>
smashed into pieces, not to be found,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in what will the mind there make its home?<br>
This body of mine, which is just like that,<br>
when devoid of dhammas doesn't function.<br>
When, devoid of dhammas, it doesn't function,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in what will the mind there make its home?<br>
<A NAME="mural">Like a mural</A> you've seen, painted on a wall,<br>
smeared with yellow orpiment,<br>
there your vision has been distorted,<br>
meaningless your human perception.<br>
<A NAME="mirage">Like an evaporated</A> mirage,<br>
<A NAME="gold">like a tree of gold</A> in a dream,<br>
<A NAME="magic">like a magic show</A> in the midst of a crowd -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you run blind after what is unreal.<br>
Resembling a ball of sealing wax,<br>
set in a hollow,<br>
with a bubble in the middle<br>
and bathed with tears,<br>
eye secretions are born there too:<br>
The parts of the eye<br>
are rolled all together<br>
in various ways.'
<p>
Plucking out her lovely eye,<br>
with mind unattached<br>
she felt no regret.
<p>
'Here, take this eye. It's yours.'
<p>
Straightaway she gave it to him.<br>
Straightaway his passion faded right there,<br>
and he begged her forgiveness.
<p>
'Be well, follower of the holy life.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This sort of thing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; won't happen again.<br>
Harming a person like you<br>
is like embracing a blazing fire,<br>
It is as if I have seized a poisonous snake.<br>
So may you be well. Forgive me.'
<p>
And released from there, the nun<br>
went to the excellent Buddha's presence.<br>
When she saw the mark of his excellent merit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her eye became<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as it was before.
