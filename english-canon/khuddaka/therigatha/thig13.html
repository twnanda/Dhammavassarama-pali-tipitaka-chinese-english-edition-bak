<BLOCKQUOTE>
Black was my hair<br>
-- the color of bees -- <br>
&amp; curled at the tips;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with age, it looked like coarse hemp.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Fragrant, like a perfumed basket<br>
filled with flowers: my coiffure.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age it smelled musty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like animal fur.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Thick &amp; lush, like a well-tended grove,<br>
made splendid, the tips elaborate<br>
with comb &amp; pin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, it grew thin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; bare here &amp; there.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Adorned with gold &amp; delicate pins,<br>
it was splendid, ornamented with braids.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, with age,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that head has gone bald.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Curved, as if well-drawn by an artist,<br>
my brows were once splendid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, they droop down in folds.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Radiant, brilliant like jewels,<br>
my eyes: elongated, black -- deep black.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, they're no longer splendid.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Like a delicate peak, my nose<br>
was splendid in the prime of my youth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, it's like a long pepper.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Like bracelets -- well-fashioned, well-finished -- <br>
my ears were once splendid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, they droop down in folds.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Like plaintain buds in their color,<br>
my teeth were once splendid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, they're broken &amp; yellowed.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Like that of a cuckoo in the dense jungle,<br>
flitting through deep forest thickets:<br>
sweet was the tone of my voice.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, it cracks here &amp; there.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Smooth -- like a conch shell well-polished -- <br>
my neck was once splendid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, it's broken down, bent.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Like rounded door-bars -- both of them -- <br>
my arms were once splendid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, they're like dried up patali trees.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Adorned with gold &amp; delicate rings,<br>
my hands were once splendid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, they're like onions &amp; tubers.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Swelling, round, firm, &amp; high,<br>
both my breasts were once splendid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the drought of old age, they dangle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like empty old water bags.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Like a sheet of gold, well-burnished,<br>
my body was splendid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it's covered with very fine wrinkles.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Smooth in their lines, like an elephant's trunk,<br>
both my thighs were once splendid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, they're like knotted bamboo.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Adorned with gold &amp; delicate anklets,<br>
my calves were once splendid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, they're like sesame sticks.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
As if they were stuffed with soft cotton,<br>
both my feet were once splendid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, they're shriveled &amp; cracked.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.
<p>
Such was this physical heap,<br>
now: decrepit, the home of pains, many pains.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A house with its plaster all fallen off.<br>
The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.

You go to sleep saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Contemplatives."<br>
You wake up,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Contemplatives."<br>
You praise only<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contemplatives.<br>
No doubt you will be <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a contemplative.
<p>
Abundant food &amp; drink<br>
you give to contemplatives.<br>
Now, Rohini, I ask you:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you hold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contemplatives dear?
<p>
They don't like to work,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they're lazy,<br>
living off what's given by others,<br>
full of hankerings,<br>
wanting delicious things:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you hold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contemplatives dear?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<i>[Rohini:]</i>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For a long time, father,<br>
you've quizzed me <br>
about contemplatives.<br>
I'll praise to you<br>
their&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discernment,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; virtue,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; endeavor.
<p>
They do like to work,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they're not lazy.<br>
They do the best work:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They abandon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; passion &amp; anger.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why I hold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contemplatives dear.
<p>
They rid themselves<br>
of the three evil roots,[<a HREF="#n13.2.1" NAME="13.2.1">1</A>]<br>
doing pure actions.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All their evil's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abandoned.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why I hold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contemplatives dear.
<p>
Clean &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their bodily action,<br>
so is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their verbal action.<br>
Clean &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their mental action:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why I hold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contemplatives dear.
<p>
Spotless, like mother of pearl,<br>
pure within &amp; without,<br>
perfect in clear qualities:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why I hold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contemplatives dear.
<p>
Learned, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; maintaining the Dhamma,<br>
noble, living the Dhamma,<br>
they teach the goal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; the Dhamma:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why I hold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contemplatives dear.
<p>
Learned, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; maintaining the Dhamma,<br>
noble, living the Dhamma,<br>
with unified minds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; mindful:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why I hold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contemplatives dear.
<p>
Traveling far, mindful,<br>
giving counsel unruffled,<br>
they discern the end<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of suffering:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why I hold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contemplatives dear.
<p>
When they leave any village<br>
they don't turn to look back<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at anything.<br>
How free from concern<br>
they go!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why I hold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contemplatives dear.
<p>
They don't store in a granary,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pot, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or basket.<br>
They hunt [only]<br>
for what's already cooked:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why I hold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contemplatives dear.
<p>
They take neither silver,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor gold, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor money.<br>
They live off whatever is present:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why I hold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contemplatives dear.
<p>
Having gone forth <br>
from different families<br>
&amp; from different countries,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; still they hold <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one another dear:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why I hold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contemplatives dear.

Rohini, truly for our well-being<br>
were you born in our family.<br>
You have conviction <br>
in the Buddha &amp; Dhamma,<br>
and strong respect <br>
for the Sangha.
<p>
You truly discern<br>
this field of merit <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unexcelled.<br>
These contemplatives will receive<br>
<i>our</i> offering, too,<br>
for here we'll set up<br>
our abundant sacrifice.

If you're afraid of pain,<br>
if you dislike pain,<br>
go to the Buddha for refuge,<br>
go to the Dhamma &amp; Sangha.<br>
Take on the precepts:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That will lead <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to your well-being.
