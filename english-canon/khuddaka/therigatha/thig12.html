<h3><A NAME="1">XII</A> -- Punnika &amp; the Brahmin <A HREF="#top"><IMG SRC="../../../icon/scrollup.gif" alt="[go to top]"></A></h3>
<I>[Punnika:]</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I'm a water-carrier, cold,<br>
always going down to the water<br>
from fear of my mistresses' beatings,<br>
harrassed by their anger &amp; words.<br>
But you, Brahmin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what do you fear<br>
that you're always going down to the water<br>
with shivering limbs, feeling great cold?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>[The Brahmin:]</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Punnika, surely you know.<br>
You're asking one doing skillful kamma<br>
&amp; warding off evil.<br>
Whoever, young or old, does evil kamma<br>
is, through water ablution,<br>
from evil kamma set free.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>[Punnika:]</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Who taught you this<br>
-- the ignorant to the ignorant -- <br>
'One, through water ablution,<br>
is from evil kamma set free?'<br>
In that case, they'd all go to heaven:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all the frogs, turtles,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; serpents, crocodiles,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; anything else that lives in the water.<br>
Sheep-butchers, pork-butchers,<br>
fishermen, trappers,<br>
thieves, executioners,<br>
&amp; any other evil doers,<br>
would, through water ablution,<br>
be from evil kamma set free.
<p>
If these rivers could carry off<br>
the evil kamma you've done in the past,<br>
they'd carry off your merit as well,<br>
and then you'd be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; completely left out.<br>
Whatever it is that you fear,<br>
that you're always going down to the water,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; don't do it.<br>
Don't let the cold hurt your skin."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>[The Brahmin:]</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've been following the miserable path, good lady,<br>
and now you've brought me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; back to the noble.<br>
I give you this robe for water-ablution.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>[Punnika:]</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Let the robe be yours. I don't need it.<br>
If you're afraid of pain,<br>
if you dislike pain,<br>
then don't do any evil kamma,<br>
in open, in secret.<br>
But if you do or will do<br>
any evil kamma,<br>
you'll gain no freedom from pain,<br>
even if you fly up &amp; hurry away.<br>
If you're afraid of pain,<br>
if you dislike pain,<br>
go to the Awakened One for refuge,<br>
go to the Dhamma &amp; Sangha.<br>
Take on the precepts:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That will lead to your liberation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>[The Brahmin:]</I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I go to the Awakened One for refuge;<br>
I go to the Dhamma &amp; Sangha.<br>
I take on the precepts:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That will lead to my liberation.
<p>
Before, I was a kinsman to <A NAME="brahma">Brahma</A>;<br>
now, truly a brahmin.<br>
I'm a three-knowledge man.<br>
consummate in knowledge,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; safe &amp; washed clean.
