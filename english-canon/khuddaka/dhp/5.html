<BLOCKQUOTE>
Long for the wakeful is the night.<BR>
Long for the weary, a league.<BR>
For fools<BR>
unaware of True Dhamma,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; samsara<BR>
is long.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If, in your course, you don't meet<BR>
your equal, your better,<BR>
then continue your course,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; firmly,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alone.<BR>
There's no fellowship with fools.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'I have sons, I have wealth' -- <BR>
the fool torments himself.<BR>
When even he himself<BR>
doesn't belong to himself,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how then sons?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How wealth?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A fool with a sense of his foolishness<BR>
is -- at least to that extent -- wise.<BR>
But a fool who thinks himself wise<BR>
really deserves to be called<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a fool.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<br><p>
<a name="64"><b>64-65:</b></a>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Even if for a lifetime<BR>
the fool stays with the wise,<BR>
he knows nothing of the Dhamma -- <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as the ladle,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the taste of the soup.
<p>
<a name="65"></a>Even if for a moment,<BR>
the perceptive person stays with the wise,<BR>
he immediately knows the Dhamma -- <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as the tongue,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the taste of the soup.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Fools, their wisdom weak,<BR>
are their own enemies<BR>
as they go through life,<BR>
doing evil<BR>
that bears<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bitter fruit.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
<br><p>
<a name="67"><b>67-68:</b></a>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's not good,<BR>
the doing of the deed<BR>
that, once it's done,<BR>
you regret,<BR>
whose result you reap crying,<BR>
your face in tears.<BR>
<P>
<a name="68"></a>It's good,<BR>
the doing of the deed<BR>
that, once it's done,<BR>
you don't regret,<BR>
whose result you reap gratified,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; happy at heart.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>

<a name="69"><b>69:</b></a>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As long as evil has yet to ripen,<BR>
the fool mistakes it for honey.<BR>
But when that evil ripens,<BR>
the fool falls into<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pain.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Month after month<BR>
the fool might eat<BR>
only a tip-of-grass measure of food,<BR>
but he wouldn't be worth<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one sixteenth<BR>
of those who've fathomed<BR>
the Dhamma.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
An evil deed, when done,<BR>
doesn't -- like ready milk -- <BR>
come out right away.<BR>
It follows the fool,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; smoldering<BR>
like a fire<BR>
hidden in ashes.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<a name="72"><b>72-74:</b></a>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Only for his ruin<BR>
does renown come to the fool.<BR>
It ravages his bright fortune<BR>
&amp; rips his head &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; apart.
<p>
<a name="73"></a>He would want unwarranted status,<BR>
preeminence &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; among monks,<BR>
authority &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; among monasteries,<BR>
homage &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from lay families.
<p>
<a name="74"></a>'Let householders &amp; those gone forth<BR>
both think that this<BR>
was done by me alone.<BR>
May I alone determine<BR>
what's a duty, what's not':<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the resolve of a fool<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as they grow -- <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his desire &amp; pride.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The path to material gain<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; goes one way,<BR>
the way to Unbinding,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; another.<BR>
Realizing this, the monk,<BR>
a disciple to the Awakened One,<BR>
should not relish offerings,<BR>
should cultivate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seclusion<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; instead.
