<i>This was said by the Blessed One, said by the Arahant, so I have heard: </i>"There are these three roots of what is unskillful. Which three? Greed as a root of what is unskillful, aversion as a root of what is unskillful, delusion as a root of what is unskillful. These are the three roots of what is unskillful."

When a monk has seen a feeling of pleasure as stressful, a feeling of pain as an arrow, and a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain as inconstant, then he is called a monk who is noble, who has seen rightly, who has cut off craving, destroyed the fetters, and who -- from the right breaking-through of conceit -- has put an end to suffering &amp; stress."

Conquered by friendship with evil people -- his mind overwhelmed -- Devadatta is incurably doomed to deprivation, to hell, for the duration of an aeon.

O, that the end of this entire mass of suffering &amp; stress might be known!'

There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure &amp; pain, such the end of my life.
