"I ask the kinsman of the Sun, the great seer,<br>
about seclusion &amp; the state of peace.<br>
Seeing in what way is a monk unbound,<br>
clinging to nothing in the world?"
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"He should put an entire stop<br>
to the root of complication-classifications:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am the thinker.'[<a HREF="#n14-1" NAME="14-1">1</A>]<br>
He should train, always mindful,<br>
to subdue any craving inside him.<br>
Whatever truth he may know,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; within or without,<br>
he shouldn't get entrenched<br>
in connection with it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for that isn't called<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbinding by the good.<br>
He shouldn't, because of it, think himself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; better,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lower, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; equal.<br>
Touched by contact in various ways,<br>
he shouldn't keep conjuring self.<br>
Stilled right within,<br>
a monk shouldn't seek peace from another<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from anything else.<br>
For one stilled right within,<br>
there's nothing embraced,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so how rejected?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing that's self,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so from whence would there be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; against-self?[<a HREF="#n14-2" NAME="14-2">2</A>]
<p>
<A NAME="sea">As in</A> the middle of the sea<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is still,<br>
with no waves upwelling,<br>
so the monk -- unperturbed, still -- <br>
should not swell himself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anywhere."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
"He whose eyes are open has described<br>
the Dhamma he's witnessed,<br>
subduing danger.<br>
Now tell us, sir, the practice:<br>
the code of discipline &amp; concentration."
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"One shouldn't be careless with his eyes,<br>
should close his ears to village-talk,<br>
shouldn't hunger for flavors,<br>
or view anything in the world<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as <i>mine.</i><br>
When touched by contact<br>
he shouldn't lament,<br>
shouldn't covet anywhere any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; states of becoming,<br>
or tremble at terrors.<br>
When gaining food &amp; drink,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; staples &amp; cloth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he should not make a hoard.<br>
Nor should he be upset<br>
when receiving no gains.<br>
Absorbed, not &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foot-loose,<br>
he should refrain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from restlessness,<br>
shouldn't be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heedless,<br>
should live &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in a noise-less abode.<br>
Not making much of sleep,<br>
ardent, given to wakefulness,<br>
he should abandon sloth, deception,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; laughter, sports,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fornication, &amp; all that goes with it;<br>
should not practice charms,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interpret physical marks, dreams,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the stars, animal cries;<br>
should not be devoted to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; practicing medicine or inducing fertility.
<p>
A monk shouldn't tremble at blame<br>
or grow haughty with praise;<br>
should thrust aside selfishness, greed,<br>
divisive speech, anger;<br>
shouldn't buy or sell<br>
or revile anyone anywhere;<br>
shouldn't linger in villages,<br>
or flatter people in hopes of gains.
<p>
A monk shouldn't boast<br>
or speak with ulterior motive,<br>
shouldn't train in insolence<br>
or speak quarrelsome words;<br>
shouldn't engage in deception<br>
or knowingly cheat;<br>
shouldn't despise others for their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; life,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discernment,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; precepts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or practices.<br>
Provoked with many words<br>
from contemplatives<br>
or ordinary people,<br>
he shouldn't respond harshly,<br>
for those who retaliate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aren't calm.
<p>
Knowing this teaching,<br>
a monk inquiring<br>
should always<br>
train in it mindfully.<br>
Knowing Unbinding as peace,<br>
he shouldn't be heedless<br>
of Gotama's message -- <br>
for he, the Conqueror unconquered,<br>
witnessed the Dhamma,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not by hearsay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but directly, himself.<br>
So, heedful, you<br>
should always train<br>
in line with that Blessed One's message,"
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Blessed One said.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<b><A NAME="n14-1">1</A>.</b> On complication-classifications and their role in leading to conflict, see <A HREF="snp4-11.html">Sn IV.11</A> and the introduction to <A HREF="../../majjhima/mn18.html">MN 18</A>. The perception, "I am the thinker" lies at the root of these classifications in that it reads into the immediate present a set of distinctions -- I/not-I; being/not-being; thinker/thought; identity/non-identity -- that then can proliferate into mental and physical conflict. The conceit inherent in this perception thus forms a fetter on the mind. To become unbound, one must learn to examine these distinctions -- which we all take for granted -- to see that they are simply assumptions that are not inherent in experience, and that we would be better off to be able to drop them.
