He who can curb his wrath<br>
as soon as it arises,<br>
as a timely antidote will check<br>
snake's venom that so quickly spreads,<br>
-- such a monk gives up the here and the beyond,<br>
just as a serpent sheds its worn-out skin.
<p>
He who entirely cuts off his lust<br>
as entering a pond one uproots lotus plants,<br>
-- such a monk gives up the here and the beyond,<br>
just as a serpent sheds its worn-out skin.
<p>
He who entirely cuts off his craving<br>
by drying up its fierce and rapid flow,<br>
-- such a monk gives up the here and the beyond,<br>
just as a serpent sheds its worn-out skin.

as the wind demolishes a fragile bamboo bridge,<br>
-- such a monk gives up the here and the beyond,<br>
just as a serpent sheds its worn-out skin.
<p>
He who does not find core or substance<br>
in any of the realms of being,<br>
like flowers which are vainly sought<br>
in fig trees that bear none,<br>

just as a serpent sheds its worn-out skin.
<p>
He who bears no grudges in his heart,<br>
transcending all this "thus" and "otherwise,"<br>
-- such a monk gives up the here and the beyond,<br>
just as a serpent sheds its worn-out skin.
<p>
He who has burned out his evil thoughts,<br>
entirely cut them off within his heart,<br>
-- such a monk gives up the here and the beyond, just as the <br>
serpent sheds its worn-out skin.
<p>
He who neither goes too far nor lags behind,<br>
entirely transcending the diffuseness of the world,<br>
-- such a monk gives up the here and the beyond,<br>
just as a serpent sheds its worn-out skin.
<p>
He who neither goes too far nor lags behind<br>
and knows about the world: "This is all unreal,"<br>
-- such a monk gives up the here and the beyond,<br>
just as a serpent sheds its worn-out skin.
<p>
He who neither goes too far nor lags behind,<br>
greedless he knows: "This is all unreal,"<br>
-- such a monk gives up the here and the beyond,<br>
just as a serpent sheds its worn-out skin.
<p>
He who neither goes too far nor lags behind,<br>
lust-free he knows: "This is all unreal,"<br>
-- such a monk gives up the here and the beyond,<br>
just as a serpent sheds its worn-out skin.

He who neither goes too far nor lags behind,<br>
hate-free he knows: "This is all unreal,"<br>

He who neither goes too far nor lags behind,<br>
delusion-free he knows: "This is all unreal,"<br>

just as a serpent sheds its worn-out skin.
<p>
He who has no dormant tendencies whatever,<br>
whose unwholesome roots have been expunged,<br>
-- such a monk gives up the here and the beyond,<br>
just as a serpent sheds its worn-out skin.
<p>
States born of anxiety he harbours none<br>
which may condition his return to earth,<br>
-- such a monk gives up the here and the beyond,<br>
just as a serpent sheds its worn-out skin.
<p>
States born of attachment he harbours none<br>
which cause his bondage to existence,<br>
-- such a monk gives up the here and the beyond,<br>
just as a serpent sheds its worn-out skin.
<p>
He who has the five hindrances discarded,<br>
doubt-free and serene, and free of inner barbs,<br>
-- such a monk gives up the here and the beyond,<br>
just as a serpent sheds its worn-out skin.
