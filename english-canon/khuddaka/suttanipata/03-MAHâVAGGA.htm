<P align=center>1. Pabbajjàsutta.</P></B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>405. I describe the going forth, how the wise one went forth,</P>
<P>I'll tell how he reflected and announced the going forth </P>
<P>.</P>
<P>406. .'The household life is full of troubles, it's the sphere of 
defilements'.</P>
<P>`Going forth is like open space' seeing this I went forth.</P>
<P>407. Going forth in body, I refrained from doing demerit,</P>
<P>Giving up misconduct in words, led a pure life.</P>
<P>408. The enlightened one came to the mountains of Magadha in Ràjagaha</P>
<P>And went out to collect alms, complete with all noble marks</P>
<P>409. King Bimbisàra saw him, when standing on the top most storey of his 
palace.</P>
<P>Seeing his noble marks announced this:</P>
<P>410. ßGood sirs, listen. This one is handsome and pure, </P>
<P>Endowed with good conduct, does not look beyond a plough share.</P>
<P>411. Mindfully he turns his eyes down , is not of low caste,</P>
<P>Send royal messengers to watch where the bhikkhu is going."</P>
<P>412. The royal messengers followed close behind </P>
<P>To learn where he was going, and where he dwelt.</P>
<P>413. With protected sense doors he went for alms in due order</P>
<P>Quickly collected the alms food, aware and mindfulness established</P>
<P>414. Collecting the alms food the sage left the town</P>
<P>Turned towards the Pàndava hills, that was where he lived.</P>
<P>415. The messengers followed him, seeing him go to his dwelling.</P>
<P>One of them came back to inform the king.</P>
<P>416. ßO! Great King, this one sits in front of the Pàndian mountains,</P>
<P>Like a tiger, a bull, or even like a lion among the hills."</P>
<P>417. The warrior hearing the words of the messenger, </P>
<P>Got into a suitable carriage and left towards the Pàndava hills.</P>
<P>418. He went in the carriage as far as he could go, </P>
<P>And getting down from it went on foot and reached him.</P>
<P>419. The king sat on a side and exchanged friendly greetings with him <BR>And 
said this:</P>
<P>420. ßYou are young, in the first stage of youth</P>
<P>Looks quite handsome, and by birth seems to be a warrior.</P>
<P>421. You will look splendid on an elephant, with an army attending </P>
<P>Enjoy life I will give you wealth, tell us your birth too". </P>
<P>422. ßThe king of the state stretching from the side of the Himàlayas'</P>
<P>Is endowed with wealth and power, It is Kosala, my home..</P>
<P>423. From the lineage Sun and the Sàkya clan, I became a homeless </P>
<P>And have no sensual desires.</P>
<P>424. I saw the dangers in sensuality and appeasement in giving up</P>
<P>I go to strive, my mind is attached to it." </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>2. Padhànasutta- Striving.</P></B>
<P>425. For striving I came to the source of river Neranjarà</P>
<P>And concentrated unexhaustingly, to come to the end of the yoke</P>
<P>426 Namuci, came to me with compassionate words</P>
<P>ßYou are emaciated and discoloured, in the vicinity of death</P>
<P>427. You are more closer to death, than to life,</P>
<P>Good One live, life is great, living do merit.</P>
<P>428. Live the holy life, and do the fire sacrifice,</P>
<P>Accumulate much merit, what could be done by striving. </P>
<P>429. Striving is a difficult path, to attain something is difficult"</P>
<P>, Màra said these words and stood in the presence of the Enlightened One.</P>
<P>430. When this was said the Blessed One said thus to Màra: </P>
<P>ßEvil relation of negligence, why did you come here.</P>
<P>431. I do not see any good in doing merit, those who see good in doing 
merit,</P>
<P>Value the domain of Death.</P>
<P>432. I have faith effort and wisdom to strive like this,</P>
<P>Why should you ask me to live..</P>
<P>433. This air dries up even the water in the river,</P>
<P>And when I strive why shouldn't my blood dry up.</P>
<P>434. When the blood dries up, bile and phelgm dries up</P>
<P>When the flesh diminishes, the mind becomes pleasant</P>
<P>And a lot of mindfulness, wisdom and concentration takes hold of me.</P>
<P>435. To him abiding thus attained to the highest feeling, </P>
<P>When the mind does not desire sensuality, look at the purity of the 
person.</P>
<P>436. Sensuality is your first army, the second is aversion</P>
<P>Third is hunger and thirst, the fourth is craving.</P>
<P>437. The fifth is sloth and torpor the sixth is fear,</P>
<P>Seventh is doubts, besmearing and stubornness are the eighth </P>
<P>438. Gain, fame, honour obtained unrighteously</P>
<P>Praising oneself and disparaging others--</P>
<P>439. Namuci, these are your armies attacking on the dark side,</P>
<P>The not clever do not win them over, when these are won pleasàntness is 
gained.</P>
<P>440. We can partake of something to live, yet life is sham</P>
<P>To me death in a battle is superior than to live defeated.</P>
<P>441. I will not give up, like some recluses and brahmins</P>
<P>They do not know the path through which the trained go.</P>
<P>442. I see Màra and his armies marching forward for the fight,</P>
<P>I go forward to meet them, do not stop me from my decision.</P>
<P>443. If this army of heavenly and human quality is too much for 
me<SUP>1</SUP> </P>
<P>I turn away wisely like turning away from an unripe fruit.</P>
<P>444. Taking control of thoughts and mindfulness well established,</P>
<P>I will go from country to country training disciples at large.</P>
<P>445. Those doing the duties in my dispensation diligent to dispel,</P>
<P>Reach the non-sensual sphere and do not grieve..</P>
<P>446. ßFor seven years he followed the Blessed One step by step</P>
<P>Yet, did not get an opportunity from the enlightened mindful one. </P>
<P>.</P>
<P>447. Like a golden hued stone, like a floating huge bird</P>
<P>Is there a small weakness, for our satisfaction.</P>
<P>448. Not finding that satisfaction, the bird fled from there.</P>
<P>Like the crow not hurt by the stone let's leave alone Gotama."</P>
<P>449. That grief stricken one's violin fell off from his shoulder</P>
<P>And the displeased demon vanished from there itself.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>3. Subhàsitasutta Well spoken words.</P></B>
<P>I heard thus.</P>
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anàthapindika 
in Jeta's grove in Sàvatthi.</P>
<P>The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: ßO! Bhikkkus, words endowed with 
four factors become </P>
<P>faultless good words not censured by the wise. What are the four. Here the 
bhikkhu speaks only suitable words, not the unsuitable. Speaks righteous words 
and not the unrighteous. Speaks pleasant words and </P>
<P>not unpleasant words. Speaks the truth and not lies. Words endowed with these 
four factors become </P>
<P>faultless, good words not censured by the wise. The Blessed One further said 
thus:</P>
<P>450. ßThe appeased said that speaking suitable words is noble, speaking 
righteous words is the second</P>
<P>Speaking pleasant words is the third and speaking the truth is the 
fourth.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>òhen venerable Vangãsa got up from his seat, arranged the robe on one 
shoulder, clasping hands towards</P>
<P>the Blessed One said, ßIt occurs to me venerable sir." The Blessed One said 
ßIf so explain Vangãsa"</P>
<P>Then venerable Vangãsa explained it with meaningful verses in the presence of 
the Blessed One.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>451. ß Always speak words that do not hurt yourself,</P>
<P>So also do not hurt others, such are suitable words.</P>
<P>452. Speak pleasant words, over which you could rejoice,</P>
<P>Speak words pleasantly without evil following them.</P>
<P>453. Truth is the deathless word, that is the ancient law,</P>
<P>The appeased get established in the truth, essence and righteousness.</P>
<P>454. If the Enlightened One spoke words for appeasement and extinction</P>
<P>And for the ending of unpleasantness, those are the most noble words."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>4. Sundarãkabhàradvàjasutta- To the brahmin Sundarãkabhàradvàja</P></B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Thus I heard.</P>
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived on the bank of river Sundarãka. At that 
time the brahmin Sundarãka-bhàradvàja.was lighting the fire to do the fire 
sacrifice.He lighted the fire did the fire sacrifice and </P>
<P>getting up from it, looked in the four directions thinking to whom shall I 
offer the sacrificial cake. Then </P>
<P>he saw the Blessed One not far away, seated under a certain tree, well 
covered together with the head.</P>
<P>Taking the sacrificial cake in the left hand and the sacrificial water spout 
in the right hand he approached</P>
<P>the Blessed One. The Blessed One hearing the foot steps of the brahmin 
disclosed his head.</P>
<P>Then it occured to the brahmin `this good sir is a shavelling' and deterred 
from his decision. Then again</P>
<P>it occured to him;'there are shavellings who are brahmins, why shouldn't I 
approach and ask his birth'.</P>
<P>Then the brahmin approached the Blessed One and asked : ßGood sir, what is 
your clan" Then the Blessed </P>
<P>One addressed the brahmin Sundarãkabhàradvàja in verses.</P>
<P>455. ßI am not a brahmin, nor a warrior's son, I am not of household 
stock,</P>
<P>I learned the clans of ordinary ones thoroughly, and abide in the world 
thinking I am no-one.</P>
<P>456. Bearing the three robes, I go homeless, head shaved am cooled</P>
<P>Cannot be soiled by humans, it's not suitable that the brahmin should ask 
about my clan."</P>
<P>457. ßOne may ask, whether you are a brahmin or not,</P>
<P>You may say I am a brahmin and I may say I am not</P>
<P>Is it wrong to say these three words with twentyfour letters".</P>
<P>458. ßWhy do sages, humans warriors and brahmins make offerings variously to 
gods </P>
<P>I have learned the vedas thoroughly, and like to know the suitable time for 
the sacrifice for good </P>
<P>results"..</P>
<P>459. ßIndeed, brahmin, our sacrifice becomes fruitful, that we see you who 
know the vedas</P>
<P>Not seeing ones like you, we offer the sacrificial cake to others" </P>
<P>460. ßTherefore brahmin, you are the most suitable to approach and ask</P>
<P>You are appeased, passionless, not trembling, and desireless"</P>
<P>461. ßGood Gotama, am bent on doing the sacrifice</P>
<P>Advise me to do the sacrifice for good ressults".</P>
<P>ßBrahmin, listen, I will tell you ß. Said the Blessed One.</P>
<P>462. ßDo not ask about the birth, ask about the conduct, fire arises in 
firewood</P>
<P>In low clans too sages are born, thoroughbreds are born when restrained 
through shame.. </P>
<P>463. Tamed by the truth, with the taming self possessed perfected and the 
holy life lived to the end</P>
<P>At the correct moment make the offering to him,it will be fruitful to the 
brahmin desiring merit.</P>
<P>464. Those that give up sensuality and wander homeless, like the shuttle has 
one course of action </P>
<P>At the correct moment make the offering to them, it will be fruitful to the 
brahmin desiring merit.</P>
<P>465. Those free of greed owing to well restrained sense doors, like the moon 
freed from the seizure of </P>
<P>Ràhu</P>
<P>At the correct moment make the offering to them, it will be fruitful to the 
brahmin desiring merit.</P>
<P>466. The unsoiled wander in the world for ever mindful giving up selfish 
thoughts,</P>
<P>At the correct moment make the offering to them, it will be fruitful to the 
brahmin desiring merit. </P>
<P>467. Giving up sensuality, he wanders unsoiled, a knower of the end of birth 
and death,</P>
<P>Extinguished like a deep cool pond, the sacrificial cake is suitable for the 
Thus Gone One.</P>
<P>468. With equals equal, from unequals far removed, the Thus Gone One is of 
incomparable wisdom.</P>
<P>Unsoiled in this or the other world, the sacrificial cake is suitable for the 
Thus Gone One.</P>
<P>469. Not, crafty conceited or selfish and desireless owing to lack of greed, 
anger expelled is extinguished</P>
<P>The brahmin who dispelled the stain of grief, the sacrificial cake is 
suitable for the Thus Gone One.</P>
<P>470. Settlements abandomned, has no seizures anywhere, here or beyond, </P>
<P>The sacrificial cake is suitable for the Thus Gone One.</P>
<P>471. Concentrated crossed the floods, conscious of the highest view in the 
Teaching </P>
<P>With desires destroyed holds the last body, the sacrificial cake is suitable 
for the Thus Gone One.</P>
<P>472. The desires to be, together with rough speech, dispelled are not 
evident</P>
<P>The Perfected One is released in every way, the sacrifical cake is suitable 
for the Thus Gone One.</P>
<P>473. All bonds gone is not measuring among the measuring, knows

<P>Together with the field and sphere, the sacrificial cake is suitable for the 
Thus Gone One.</P>
<P>474. Not supported on desires, experiencing seclusion, heratics won over </P>
<P>Has no intentions what so ever, the sacrificial cake is suitable for the Thus

<P>475. Connections of the past and present completely destroyed there remains 
nothing.<SUP>1</SUP> </P>
<P>Appeased and released with the destruction of seizings, the sacrificial cake 
is suitable for the </P>
<P>Thus Gone One</P>
<P>476 Seeing bonds and the destruction of birth as one, he pulled out the 
sphere of greed remainderlessly. </P>
<P>Pure, undefiled, stainless and flawless, the sacrificial cake is suitable for

<P>477. The mind thoroughly concentrated in one point would not see any signs of

is suitable for the Thus </P>
<P>Gone One.</P>
<P>478. Seeing all things with clarity and bearing the last body does not have 
any delusion.</P>
<P>The Great Man has attained highest Enlightenment, the sacrificial cake is 
suitable for the Thus Gone </P>
<P>One."</P>
<P>479. ßMy sacrifice is indeed a true sacrifice that we have gained a perfect 
one like you to accept it.</P>
<P>Let Brahmà be eye-witness, may the Blessed One accept the sacrificial cake." 
</P>
<P>480. ßLook! Food gained by reciting verses is not suitable for the Perfect 
One</P>
<P>Enlightened Ones become mindful of the Teaching at the suitable moment</P>
<P>481. Offer those eatables and drinks to another perfected sage, </P>
<P>Who has destroyed desires and overcome doubts, it becomes a field of merit to 
one desiring merit. . </P>
<P>482. It's gain we came to know the Blessed One and to whom gifts should be 
offered.</P>
<P>We came in search of a suitable time for the sacrifice and came to great gain 
in your dispensation."</P>
<P>483. ßThe mind pure, all obduracy has disappeared</P>
<P>Well released from sensuality, has driven out sloth </P>
<P>484. Knows the limits to be tamed and is clever in birth and death.</P>
<P>The sage is well accomplished, it is to such a sacifice we came</P>
<P>485. We fall down with clasped hands and worship you</P>
<P>Offering eatables and drinks, thus our gifts become fruitful."</P>
<P>486. ßGood sir, you are enlightened, suitable to accept the sacrifical cake, 
an incomparable field of merit </P>
<P>A recipient for all the world, given to you is of much merit." </P>
<P>Then the brahmin Sundarãkabhàradvàja said thus to the Blessed One: ßGood 
Gotama, now I know. It</P>
<P>seems as though something over turned was re-installed. Something closed was 
made manifest. As though</P>
<P>the path was told to someone who had lost his way. It seems as though an oil 
lamp was lighted for those</P>
<P>who have eyes to see forms in the dark. In various ways good Gotama has 
explained the Teaching.</P>
<P>Now I take refuge in good Gotama, in the Teaching and the Community . May I 
gain the going forth and</P>
<P>the higher ordination in your dispensation. The brahmin Sundarãkabhàradvàja 
gained the going forth</P>
<P>and the higher ordination in the dispensation of the Blessed One. And soon 
after the higher ordination</P>
<P>venerable Sundarãkabhàradvàja secluded and withdrawn from the crowd abode 
diligent to dispel. Soon</P>
<P>after for whatever purpose sons of clansmen rightfully leave the household 
and go forth, that highest</P>
<P>end of the holy life, he here and now realized by himself and abode. Then he 
knew, birth is destroyed,</P>
<P>the holy life is lived to the end, what should be done is done, there is 
nothing more to wish for. Venerable </P>
<P>Sundarãkabhàradvàja became one other perfected. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>5. Màghasutta- The young man Màgha.</P></B>
<P>I heard thus.</P>
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the Gijjha mountain peaks in Rajagaha. 
Then Magha the young man</P>
<P>approached the Blessed One, exchanged friendly greetings sat on a side and 
said thus:"Good Gotama,</P>
<P>I am a benefactor, a liberal giver, one ready to do another's request. I earn 
by rightful means and with </P>
<P>that earned rightfully, I give one, or two, or three, or four, or five, or 
six, or seven, or eight, or nine, or ten.</P>
<P>Or I give twenty, or thirty, or forty, or fifty, or a hundred, or I give 
many. Good Gotama, when I give and</P>
<P>sacrifice thus do I accumulate much merit.</P>
<P>The Blessed One said,"Indeed young man you a benefactor, a liberal giver, one 
ready to do another's</P>
<P>request, one who earn by rightful means and out of what you earn rightfully 
give one, two, three, four, five,</P>
<P>six, seven, eight, nine, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred or you 
give many more by that you </P>
<P>accumulate much merit." Then the young man Màgha addressed the Blessed One in 
verse. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>487. The young man Màgha said:</P>
<P>ßI ask the liberal giver, the yellow robed homeless wanderer ,</P>
<P>I a householder, a benefactor, a liberal giver, ready to do another's 
request</P>
<P>Desire merit giving eatables and drinks to others </P>
<P>How should this sacrifice become pure."</P>
<P>488. The Blessed One said:</P>
<P>ßMàgha, you a liberal benefactor of a houssehold desiring merit </P>
<P>Give others eatables and drinks and please the recipient".</P>
<P>489. The young man Màgha said: </P>
<P>ßO! Blessed One, I a liberal benefactor of household stock desire merit,</P>
<P>And give eatables and drinks to recepients. May I know the recipients."</P>
<P>490. ßThey that wander in the world unsoiled, not possessing anything what so 
ever. </P>
<P>Should be offered the sacrifice at the right time by the brahmin desiring 
merit.</P>
<P>491. Breaking all bonds and endearments some are tamed, released, desireless 
and not hungry </P>
<P>They should be offered the sacrifice at the right time by the brahmin 
desiring merit.</P>
<P>492. Released from all bonds and endearments some are tamed, released, 
desireless and not hungry,</P>
<P>They should be offered the sacrifice at the right time by the brahmin 
desiring merit. </P>
<P>493. Dispelling greed, hate and delusion, and desires destroyed some have 
lived the holy life to the end </P>
<P>They should be offered the sacrifice, at the right time by the brahmin 
desiring merit.</P>
<P>494. The not crafty, not measuring, not greedy, not selfish and not 
hungry,</P>
<P>Should be offered the sacrifice, at the right time by the brahmin desiring 
merit. </P>
<P>495. Those not a prey to craving, cross the flood and wander selflessly.</P>
<P>They should be offered the sacrifice, at the right time, by the brahmin 
desiring merit.</P>
<P>496. They that do not think greedily to be and not to be in this or the other 
world,</P>
<P>Should be offered the sacrifice, at the right time, by the brahmin desiring 
merit.</P>
<P>497. They that give up sensuality, wander homeless and have one single course 
of action like a shuttle </P>
<P>Should be offered the sacrifice, at the right time, by the brahmin desiring 
merit</P>
<P>498. Those free of greed, owing to controlled mental faculties, like the moon 
released from the seizure of </P>
<P>Ràhu .</P>
<P>Should be offered the sacrifice, at the right time, by the brahmin desiring 
merit.</P>
<P>499. They by themselves quieted without greed and anger and would not return 
here</P>
<P>Should be offered the sacrifice, at the right time, by the brahmin desiring 
merit.</P>
<P>500. They that dispel birth and death remainderlessly, doubts and all duties 
too.</P>
<P>Should be offered the sacrifice, at the right time, by the brahmin desiring 
merit.</P>
<P>501. They that wander in the world being a light unto themselves, not having 
anything, released,</P>
<P>Should be offered the sacrifice, at the right time, by the brahmin desiring 
merit.</P>
<P>502. They that know, as it really is, `this is the last birth, there is no 
more birth,</P>
<P>Should be offered the sacrifice, at the right time, by the brahmin desiring 
merit. </P>
<P>503. Those perfected ones, mindfully attached to jhàna,attained enlightenment 
for the good of many,</P>
<P>Should be offered the sacrifice, at the right time, by the brahmin desiring 
demerit."</P>
<P>504. ßIndeed my question was useful, the Blessed One told me the 
recipients</P>
<P>You know the Teaching, and know recipients as they really are,"</P>
<P>505. The young man Màgha said:</P>
<P>ßI am a liberal benefactor from a household, making sacrifices desiring 
merit</P>
<P>Offering eatables and drinks to others, what should be the endowments of the 
giver."</P>
<P>506. The Blessed One said: </P>
<P>ßMàgha, you, giver, while giving, should pervade the mind with 
pleasantness</P>
<P>For the object, the recipient, and the offering, doing thus the fault is 
dispelled.</P>
<P>507. Free of greed, should check anger, the thought of loving kindness should 
be developed limitlessly,</P>
<P>Night and day for ever mindful, pervade all directions with loving 
kindness".</P>
<P>508. ßWho cleans, releases and obstructs, and with what self goes to the 
world of Brahmà </P>
<P>I do not know this, may it be told, the Blessed One is eye-witness, today I 
saw Brahmà."</P>
<P>You, in truth is like Brahmà, how is one born in the effulgent Brahmà 
world."</P>
<P>509. The Blessed One said</P>
<P>ß Making a sacrifice endowed with the three factors of a sacrifice and 
pleasing such recipients</P>
<P>I say one is born in the world of Brahmà."</P>
<P>When this was said the young man Màgha said thus to the Blessed One: ßNow I 
know good Gotama.</P>
<P>It seems as though something over turned is re-installed. As something 
covered is made manifest, As the </P>
<P>path was told to someone who had lost his way. It seems as though an oil lamp 
was lighted for those who</P>
<P>have eyes to see forms in the darköow I take refuge in good Gotama, in the 
Teaching and the Community.</P>
<P>May I be remembered as one who has taken refuge from today until life lasts. 
</P>
<P>. </P><B>
<P>6. Sabhiyasutta-To Sabhiya.</P></B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I heàrd thus.</P>
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the squirrels' sanctuary in the bamboo 
grove in Rajagaha. At that </P>
<P>time a certain deity, who was an earlier blood relation of Sabhiya the 
wandering ascetic, pointed out to him</P>
<P>a certain question and asked him to lead the holy life under him who could 
explain that question. The </P>
<P>wandering ascetic Sabhiya learning the question from the deity went to 
recluses and brahmins, to gatherings</P>
<P>small and large, to teachers of gatherings, to famous founders of sects, and 
to those who were accepted as </P>
<P>wise by many such as Puràna Kassapa, Makkhali Gosàla, Ajita Kesakambali, 
Pakudha Kaccàyana,</P>
<P>Sa¤jaya Belaññhiputta and Niganñha Nàtaputta.. The wandering ascetic would 
approach them and ask</P>
<P>the question, they not able to answer the question would express anger and 
displeasure. They would also</P>
<P>cross question Sabhiya. Then it occured to Sabhiya, these recluses and 
brahmins, small and large gatherings</P>
<P>teachers of gatherings, founders of sects such as Puràna Kassapa, Makkhali 
Gosàla, Ajita Kesakambala,</P>
<P>Pakudha Kaccàayana, Sa¤jaya Belaññhiputta and Niganñha Nàtaputta when 
questioned could not </P>
<P>reply and as a result expressed anger and displeasusre. They also in turn 
cross question me. What if I give up the holy life and partake of sensuality. 
Then it also occured to him the recluse Gotama too has </P>
<P>a large crowd, is a teacher of gatherings, is a famous ford maker, what if I 
approach the recluse Gotama </P>
<P>and ask this question. Then it occured to him again these good recluses and 
brahmins old and decayed </P>
<P>elders have led the holy life for a long time and yet when this question is 
asked being unable to reply</P>
<P>express anger and displeassure, and cross question me in turn, how could the 
recluse Gotama answer this</P>
<P>question. The recluse Gotama is young, and recently gone forth. Then it 
occured to him again, although</P>
<P>young , recluses should not be despised. There are young recluses powerful 
and wise, what if I approach</P>
<P>the recluse Gotama and ask this question. Then the wandering ascetic Sabhiya 
left on a tour to come to the</P>
<P>presence of the Blessed One in the squirrels' sanctuary in the bamboo grove 
in Rajagaha and gradually </P>
<P>approached the Blessed One, exchanaged friendly greetings sat on a side and 
said</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>510. ßI came with doubts and wavering, desiring to ask a question</P>
<P>May my doubts be dispelled. by answering them according the Teaching, step by 
step." </P>
<P>511. The Blessed One said:</P>
<P>ßSabhiya, you came from afar desiring to ask questions. I will put an end to 
your doubts.</P>
<P>By answering your questions according the Teaching step by step..</P>
<P>512. Sabhiya, ask your questions as you wish</P>
<P>I will put an end to your doubts step by step."</P>
<P>Then it occured to the wandering ascetic Sabhiya, it is wonderful, other 
recluses and brahmins did not give me even a chance to talk, the recluse Gotama 
gives me the concent to ask the questions, thoroughly </P>
<P>pleased he asked the Blessed One:</P>
<P>513. ßAcquiring what is a bhikkhu made, what is self restrain, what is the 
taming</P>
<P>How is enlightenment known, may these be explained."</P>
<P>514. The Blessed One said:</P>
<P>ßSabhiya, by himself the path paved for extinction, dispelling doubts</P>
<P>Giving up being and non being, and living the holy life until rebirth ends, 
he becomes a bhikkhu.</P>
<P>515. Mindful of equanimity for all the world, does not hurt anyone in the 
world,</P>
<P>The recluse crosses over undisturbed, and not haughty, this is self 
restrain.</P>
<P>516. When his mental faculties are developed internally and externally for 
all the world,</P>
<P>He piercingly sees this and the other world and abides in time,<SUP>1</SUP> 
he is the tamed. </P>
<P>517. Discriminating all suitabilities in existences together with their 
arising and passing away</P>
<P>Pure without defilements and blemish comes to the end of birth, that is 
enlightenment.</P>
<P>Then the wandering ascetic Sabhiya pleased hearing the words of the Blessed 
One asked a further </P>
<P>question.</P>
<P>518." Acquiring what is a brahmin made,who is a recluse, doing what is a 
bather</P>
<P>How is a Great Man known. May these be told."</P>
<P>519. Washed of all demerit, pure, well concentrated and established in 
truth,</P>
<P>Considers all existences thoroughly and is not soiled by them, that is a 
brahmin.</P>
<P>520. The calmed one gives up merit and demerit, undefiled knows this and the 
other world,</P>
<P>Overcoming birth and death becomes a recluse by that.</P>
<P>521. Cleaned of all demerit, internally, externally and in the world, </P>
<P>Does not find suitability for heavenly or human birth, he is a bather.</P>
<P>522. Does nothing wrong in the world, breaks up all bonds with which are 
bound,</P>
<P>Released is not soiled any where, by that he becomes a Great Man.</P>
<P>Then the wandering asccetic Sabhiya pleased hearing the words of the Blessed 
One asked a further question.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>523. ßHow is the field won, clever in which way, how is one wise and how is 
the sage known</P>
<P>May the Blessed One explain these to me"</P>
<P>524. The Blessed One said:</P>
<P>ßDiscriminating all fields heavenly, human and divine,</P>
<P>Released from the roots and bindings to all fields,</P>
<P>Such are the winners of the field as the meaning shows.</P>
<P>525. Discriminating all treasures, heavenly, human and divine,</P>
<P>Is released from the roots and bindings to all treasures</P>
<P>Such are the clever as the meaning shows.</P>
<P>526. Discriminating both purities internal, external and pure wisdom,</P>
<P>He overcomes the dark and white, such are wise as the meaning shows.</P>
<P>527. Knowing the genuine and the ingenuine Teaching</P>
<P>Internally, externally and in the whole world,</P>
<P>Becomes worthy of worship among gods and men,</P>
<P>That one who goes beyond the bonds and net is the sage."</P>
<P>The wandering ascetic Sabhiya pleased with the words of the Blessed One asked 
a further question.</P>
<P>528. ßAcquiring what is perfection, how is that experience,how does one 
become full of effort,</P>
<P>How does one become a thoroughbred, may this be told." </P>
<P>529. The Blessed One said:</P>
<P>ßSabhiya, Whatever feelings there be to recluses or brahmins</P>
<P>Dispel greed for all feelings, when he overcomes all feelings he's perfected. 
</P>
<P>530. Discriminating the diffused name and matter internally and externally as 
the cause of the illness,<SUP>1</SUP> </P>
<P>Released from all roots and bindings of the illness are those thorough in 
feelings as the meaning says. </P>
<P>531. Turning away from all demerit, with effort overcoming hellish 
unpleasantness,</P>
<P>Becomes full of effort and endeavour, such are the steady as the meaning 
shows..</P>
<P>532. Be there deep cuts and bonds internally and externally and the roots of 
bonds, </P>
<P>Released from all bonds, roots and bindings is the thoroughbred as the 
meaning says.</P>
<P>The wandering ascetic Sabhiya pleased with the words of the Blessed One asked 
a further question.</P>
<P>533. ßAcquiring what is health, what is nobility, what is good conduct, </P>
<P>How does one become an ascetic, may the Blessed One tell me".</P>
<P>534. The Blessed One said:</P>
<P>ßHearing and knowing all Teachings in the world faulty or faultless,</P>
<P>Overcoming all doubts, released, not confused in any way, one.is said to be 
healthy. </P>
<P>535. Cutting up desires for settling, with knowledge, does not come to a womb 
again.</P>
<P>Pullling out the threefold dirty perceptions,<SUP>2</SUP> does not form a 
suitability, such is a Noble One. </P>
<P>536. Established in good conduct, is always clever knowing the Teaching,</P>
<P>Released does not get soiled anywhere, has no aversion, that is good 
conduct.</P>
<P>537. What ever actions be, owing to the ripening of 
unpleasantness,<SUP>3</SUP> above, below,across or in the middle,</P>
<P>Thoroughly giving them up, so also craftiness, conceit, greed and anger,</P>
<P>Puts an end to name and matter, he is the ascetic with right conduct.</P>
<P>Then the wandering ascetic Sabhiya pleased and agreeing with the words of the 
Blessed One got up from </P>
<P>his seat, arranged the robe on one shoulder clasping hands towards the 
Blessed One eulogized him saying</P>
<P>these verses.</P>
<P>538. ßO! Wise one, we have crossed the floods overcoming about 
sixty-three</P>
<P>Doubts of recluses, perceptions of perceived settlements and 
distractions.<SUP>4</SUP> </P>
<P>539. You have gone to the end and gone beyond unpleasantness.</P>
<P>You are worthy, all knowing, and I think has destroyed desires.</P>
<P>You are resplendent, very wise and has ended my unpleasantness.</P>
<P>540. Whatever doubts I had , you dispelled them, </P>
<P>I worship you sage, abiding in the sphere of sages.</P>
<P>You are without unpleasàntness, a gentle relation of the sun. </P>
<P>541. Whatever doubts I had earlier, the wise one dispelled for me,</P>
<P>You are indeed an all knowing sage without hindrances.</P>
<P>542. All your troubles are turned out and made useless.</P>
<P>You are a result of the Truth, tamed, cooled and come to righteousness.</P>
<P>543. O! The best of men, great hero, all gods listen to your words</P>
<P>On the two sides of the Nàrada mountain.</P>
<P>544. I worship you thoroughbred, you greatest of men,</P>
<P>In the world of gods and men you have no comparison.</P>
<P>545. You are enlightened, you are Teacher, the sage who has overcome 
death..</P>
<P>You cut the latent tendencies and crossed, and cross the populace.</P>
<P>546. You have no more endearments, and your desires are destroyed.</P>
<P>You are a lion who does not seize and has ended fears small and large.</P>
<P>547. Like the lotus not soiled by mud and water, you are not soiled in merit 
or demerit</P>
<P>Hero, stretch your feet, Sabhiya worships the Teacher."</P>
<P>Then Sabhiya the wandering ascetic put his head down at the feet of the 
Blessed One and said: Now I </P>
<P>know venerable sir, It seems as though something over turned is re-installed, 
something covered is made</P>
<P>manifest. It seems as though the path is told to someone who has lost his 
way. Or it seems as though</P>
<P>an oil lamp is lighted for the darkness, for those who have eyes to see 
forms. In various ways the Blessed </P>
<P>One has explained the Teaching. Now I take refuge in the Blessed One, in the 
Teaching and the Community. May I gain the going forth and the higher 
ordination." </P>
<P>ßSabhiya, who ever of another faith earlier, would desire the going forth and 
the higher ordination</P>
<P>in this dispensation should be under probation for four months. At the end of 
the four months, if the bhikkhus are satisfied, they would give the going forth 
and higher ordination, this is only to test the </P>
<P>differences in the person.." ßO! Venerable sir, if one of another faith 
earlier desiring the going forth and the </P>
<P>higher ordination have to be under probation for four months, and at the end 
of the four months the satisfied</P>
<P>bhikkhus would give the going forth and the higher ordination . I will be 
under probation for four years.</P>
<P>At the end of four years let the bhikkhus be satisfied and give me the going 
forth and the higher ordination.."</P>
<P>The wandering ascetic Sabhiya obtained the going forth and the higher 
ordination in the dispensation of </P>
<P>the Blessed One. Soon after the higher ordination venerable Sabhiya secluded 
and withdrawn from the crowd abode diligent for dispelling . Soon afterwards for 
whatever purpose sons of clansmen rightfully</P>
<P>leave the household and go forth, that highest end of the holy life by 
himself realized abode. He knew </P>
<P>birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived to the end, what should be done is 
done, there is nothing to wish more. Venerable Ssabhiya became one other 
perfected . </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>7. Selasutta- To Sela the Brahmin.</P></B>
<P>I heard thus.</P>
<P>At one time the Blessed One was touring the country of Anguttaràpa with a 
large community of bhikkhus, about one thousand two hundred and fifty and 
entered a hamlet named Aapana. The matted </P>
<P>hair ascetic Keniya heard ßThe good recluse Gotama, son of the Sàkyas touring 
the country of </P>
<P>Anguttaràpa with a large community of bhikkhus, about one thousand two 
hundred and fifty bhikkhus</P>
<P>have come to the hamlet Aapana. Of him such fame has spread, he is blessed, 
all knowing, endowed </P>
<P>with knowledge and conduct, is well gone, knower of the worlds, an 
incomparable tamer of those to be </P>
<P>tamed, Teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed. He preaches to the 
world together with its gods </P>
<P>Màras, Brahmàs, the community of recluses and brahmins and gods and men, that 
Teaching by himself</P>
<P>known and realized. That Teaching is good at the beginning, in the middle and 
at the end, full of meaning </P>
<P>even in the letter and it explains the complete and pure holy life. It is 
good to see such worthy ones."</P>
<P>Then the matted hair ascetic Keniya approached the Blessed One, exchanged 
friendly greetings and sat on </P>
<P>a side. The Blessed One spoke to the matted hair ascetic according to the 
Teaching instructing, advising,</P>
<P>inciting and making his heart light. The matted hair ascetic Keniya, 
instructed, advised, incited and made</P>
<P>light hearted by the Blessed One said thus:"May the Blessed One accept 
tomorrow's meal from me together</P>
<P>with the community of bhikkhus". When this was said the Blessed One said: ßO! 
Keniya, the community</P>
<P>of bhikkhus is too large about one thousand two hundred and fifty, are the 
brahmins pleased about this </P>
<P>For the second time Keniya said: ßO! Gotama, how ever much the community of 
bhikkhus , even if one</P>
<P>thousand two hundred and fifty, the brahmins are pleased, may the Blessed One 
accept tomorrow's meal</P>
<P>from me together with the community of bhikkhus." For the second time the 
Blessed Ome said:"O! keniya,</P>
<P>the community of bhikkhus is too large about one thousand two hundred and 
fifty are the brahmins pleased</P>
<P>about this."For the third time Keniya said: ßO! Gotama, how ever much the 
community of bhikkhus, even if,</P>
<P>one thousand two hundred and fifty, the brahmins are pleased, may the Blessed 
One accept tomorrow's meal from me, together with the community of bhikkhus." 
The Blessed One accepted in silence.</P>
<P>Then Keniya the matted hair ascetic knew that the Blessed One had accepted, 
got up from his seat, went to his hermitage and addressed his friends and blood 
relations: ßGood sirs, listen, I have invited the</P>
<P>recluse Gotama for tomorrow's meal together with the community of bhikkhus, 
whatever work there is to</P>
<P>be done, do them for me." They sccepted Keniya the matted hair ascetic's 
request and some of them dug</P>
<P>furnaces, others axed fire-wood. Some washed vessels, placed water vessels 
and some arranged seats. </P>
<P>The matted hair ascetic Keniya himself arranged the circular hall</P>
<P>At that time the brahmin Sela lived in Aapana perfect in the three vedas, 
learned in the rules and rites as</P>
<P>officiating priest, learned in the phonology and etymology of words and the 
fivefold history in words and </P>
<P>grammar, and learned in tracing the marks of a Great Man. And he taught these 
to three hundred young men</P>
<P>orally.</P>
<P>At that time Keniya the matted hair ascetic was friendly with the brahmin 
Sela. And so the brahmin Sela</P>
<P>accompanied by the three hundred young men was walking and wandering for 
exercise bent towards </P>
<P>the hermitage of the matted hair ascetic. Then the brahmin Sela saw the 
matted hair ascetics at work in the </P>
<P>hermitage of Keniya, some digging furnaces, others axing fire-wood, washing 
vessels, placing water vessels</P>
<P>others arranging seats and Keniya the matted hair ascetic himself arranging 
the circular hall. And he said to</P>
<P>Keniya ßWhat, good Keniya, will there be a woman brought here, or one given 
away, or will there be a </P>
<P>great sacrifice, or is Seniya Bimbisàra the king of Magadha invited for 
tomorrow's meal together with his</P>
<P>army." ßSela, to me there would not be, a woman brought nor given away, 
Seniya Bimbisàra the king of Magadha is not invited for tomorrow's meal together 
with the army, yet there is a great sacrifice for me: </P>
<P>the recluse Gotama son of the Sàkyas, who has gone forth from the Sàkya clan 
, touring the country of</P>
<P>Anguttaràpa with a large community of bhikkhus has come to Aapana. Of him 
such fame has spread, he </P>
<P>is blessed, worthy, all knowing, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well 
gone, knower of the worlds,</P>
<P>the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, 
enlightened and blessed. I have invited him for tomorrow's meal together with 
the community of bhikkhus".</P>
<P>ßDoes good Keniya say enlightened ß ßGood Sela, I say enlightened". ßDoes, 
good Keniya say enlightened" ßGood Sela, I say enlightened." Then it occured to 
the brahmin Sela, ß even the sound `Enlightened' is rare in the world . The 
sacred sayings hand down thirty two marks of a Great Man, endowed with which 
there are only two courses of action for the Great Man and not another. If he 
leads a </P>
<P>household life he becomes a universal monarch, a righteous king who would 
rule the four quarters endowed </P>
<P>with the seven jewels. The jewel of the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the 
gem, the jewel of the woman,</P>
<P>the householder, and the advisor. He has more than a thousand sons all clever 
with heroic figures. Defeating </P>
<P>foriegn armies, he would rule the country surrounded by the ocean without 
weapons and punishments.</P>
<P>If he leaves the household and goes forth, becomes worthy, all knowing rolls 
the veil away from the world.</P>
<P>Good Keniya, where does the Enlightened One, worthy and all knowing live now" 
Then Keniya the matted</P>
<P>hair ascetic stretched out his right hand and said ßThere! In the green deep 
forest". </P>
<P>Then the brahmin Sela with the three hundred young men approached the Blessed 
One, while going he</P>
<P>addressed the young men ßgood sirs, come with little noise raising one foot 
after the other , Blessed Ones</P>
<P>are far from noise and live alone like lions. While I am talking with the 
recluse Gotama, do not arouse</P>
<P>conversations among yourselves and enter when our conversation ends."</P>
<P>Then the brahmin Sela approached the Blessed One, exchanged friendly 
greetings sat on a side, and examined the thirty two marks of a Great Man. He 
saw most of the marks of a Great Man, except two. He </P>
<P>had doubts as to whether the peudendum was encased and whether the tongue was 
large enough to cover</P>
<P>the face. Then it occured to the Blessed One, this brahmin Sela saw most of 
the marks of a Great Man except two, he has doubts, as to whether the pudendum 
is encased and the tongue is large enough to cover</P>
<P>the face. Then the Blessed One performed a psychic exercise so that the 
brahmin Sela could see the Blessed </P>
<P>One's pudendum encased and the large tongue. The Blessed One pulled out his 
tongue and with it touched</P>
<P>both ear lobes, nostrils and the whole forehead, and covered up the whole 
face with it.</P>
<P>Then it occured to the brahmin Ssla, indeed the recluse Gotama is endowed 
with all the thirty two marks</P>
<P>of a Great Man, yet we do not know whether he is enlightened. I have heard it 
said by learned aged </P>
<P>brahmins, that Great Men when praised disclose what they are, whether they 
are worthy and enlightened</P>
<P>What if I eulogize the recluse Gotama with meaningful verses and so he 
eulogized the Blessed One saying</P>
<P>these verses.</P>
<P>548. ßO! Blessed One, you are handsome, has pleasing looks is well born and 
is lovely to look at,</P>
<P>You have a golden hue, and strong white teeth..</P>
<P>549. To the well born, there are marks</P>
<P>All the marks of a Great Man are evident on your body.</P>
<P>550. You have pleasant eyes a beautiful mouth, a straight and majestic 
body</P>
<P>In the midst of the community you shine like the sun.</P>
<P>551. The bhikkhu with good looks is like a statue of gold</P>
<P>What is the use of your recluseship when so handsome.</P>
<P>552. You should be a universal monarch, the leading charioteer</P>
<P>Winning the four quarters, should be the monarch of Jambudvãpa.</P>
<P>553. Should have warrior subordinate kings attached to you,</P>
<P>O! Gotama, king of kings, win over the humans and rule".</P>
<P>554. The Blessed One said:</P>
<P>ßSela, I am the righteous king, incomparable,</P>
<P>Righteously I turn the wheel, not ever to be stopped." . . </P>
<P>555. The brahmin Sela said:</P>
<P>ß Acknowledges complete Knowledge, and is the righteous incomparable king</P>
<P>And Gotama says that he will turn the wheel righteously </P>
<P>556. Who are the good one's generals, the disciples who would follow the 
Teacher,</P>
<P>For the wheel of the Teaching to roll on, who would roll it afterwards."</P>
<P>557. The Blessed One said:</P>
<P>ßSela, this incomparable wheel of righteousness rolled on by me,</P>
<P>Sariputta, born sfter the Thus Gone One will roll it afterwards.</P>
<P>558. Brahmin, realzing, what should be realized, developing what should be 
developed.</P>
<P>I have dispelled what should be dispelled, therefore I'm enlightened."</P>
<P>559. The brahkmin Sela said:</P>
<P>ßO! Brahmin, dispel my doubts, and release me,</P>
<P>The presence of an enlightened one is always rare. </P>
<P>560. That which is rare in the world has appeared.</P>
<P>The all enlightened one, the incomparable surgeon.</P>
<P>561. Become Mahà Brahmà have destroyed the army of Death,</P>
<P>Winning over, all enemies, abide happily without fear."</P>
<P>562. ßGood sirs listen to what the wise one says,</P>
<P>The surgeon, the great hero, roars in the forest like a lion</P>
<P>563. Become Mahà Brahmà have destroyed the army of Death</P>
<P>Seeing him who would not be pleased except those with low birth</P>
<P>564. Those who wish, follow me, and the others could go</P>
<P>Now I go forth in the noble wise one's dispensation.."</P>
<P>565. ßIf you, sir, like the dispensation of the all enlightened one,</P>
<P>We too will go forth in the noble wise one's dispensation." .</P>
<P>566. ßO! Blessed One, these three hundred brahmins with clasped hands,</P>
<P>Beg for the going forth in your dispensation."</P>
<P>567. The Blessed One said:</P>
<P>ßSsela, the holy life is well proclaimed, is here and now and not a matter of 
time,</P>
<P>Here the not deluded go forth and train diligently"</P>
<P>The brahmin Sela together with his following obtained the going forth and the 
higher ordination in the </P>
<P>dispensation of the Blessed One.</P>
<P>Then Keniya, the matted hair ascetic at the end of that night prepared plenty 
of nourishing eatables and </P>
<P>drinks in his hermitage and informed the Blessed One: ßIt is time venerable 
sir, the food is ready."</P>
<P>The Blessed One putting on robes in the morning , taking bowl and robes 
approached the matted hair</P>
<P>ascetic's hermitage and sat on the prepared seats together with the community 
of bhikkhus. Then Keniya,</P>
<P>the matted hair ascetic with his own hands served and satisfied the community 
of bhikkhus headed by</P>
<P>the Enlightened One with the nourishing eatables and drinks. When the Blessed 
One had finished partaking</P>
<P>the meal, and had put the bowl away, Keniya took a low seat, sat on a side 
and the Blessed One addressed the thanks giving with these verses.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>568. ßOf sacrifices the fire sacrifice is the chief, the vedic hymn Sàvitti 
is the foremost of hymns,</P>
<P>The king is chief for humans, to rivers the ocean is important</P>
<P>569. To the constellation the moon is chief, to give warmth the Sun is 
chief,</P>
<P>To those desiring merit the Community of bhikkhus is the chief." </P>
<P>The Blessed One doing the thanks giving with these verses, got up from his 
seat and went away.</P>
<P>Then venerable Sela and his following, alone, withdrawn from the crowd and 
secluded abode diligently</P>
<P>for dispelling. Before long, for whatever purpose sons of clansmen rightly go 
forth from a household,</P>
<P>that highest end of the holy life, he here and now knew, realized and abode. 
He knew'birth is desstroyed,</P>
<P>the holy life is lived to the end, what should be done is done, there is 
nothing more to wish `, Venerable </P>
<P>Sela became an arahant and also his following became arahants. Then venerable 
Sela approached the</P>
<P>Blessed One together with his following. Arranging the robe on one shoulder, 
clasping hands towards the</P>
<P>Blessed One addressed the Blessed One in verses. </P>
<P>570. ßWise One, this is the eighth day, after we took your refuge.</P>
<P>In seven nights we are tamed in your dispensation.</P>
<P>571. You are enlightened, Teacher, the sage who has overcome Death, </P>
<P>You crossed, with destroyed dormant tendencies and crosses over this 
populace.</P>
<P>572. Endearments overcome have destroyed desires,</P>
<P>Is like a lion without seizures fears big and small overcome.</P>
<P>573. Here stand the three hundred bhikkhus with clasped hands </P>
<P>Hero, stretch out your feet, Great Men worship the Teacher. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>8. Sallasutta. -The Arrow.</P></B>
<P>574. The lives of mortals here is without an aim and without knowledge,</P>
<P>It is short, full of troubles accompanied with unpleasantness. </P>
<P>575. There is no remedy through which the born do not die,</P>
<P>Even when decayed this happens to mortals.</P>
<P>576. For ripe fruits, there is a fall, or the fear of a fall,</P>
<P>Likewise for the born mortal, there is constant fear of death.</P>
<P>577. All clay pots made by the potter get destroyed at the end</P>
<P>Likewise the life of mortals get destroyed in the end..</P>
<P>578. Children and the aged, fools and the wise,</P>
<P>All go under the sway of death, all are overcome by death.</P>
<P>579. To those going to the other world withdrawn by death</P>
<P>There is no protection from father to the son, nor from a relation to a 
relation.</P>
<P>580. Even when relations look on, crying at large, </P>
<P>One by one the mortals are lead away, as the butcher the cattle..</P>
<P>581. Thus the world is afflicted by death and decay,</P>
<P>The wise knowing this nature of the world, do not grieve.</P>
<P>582. Not knowing the path of arrival or depature,</P>
<P>Not seeing either end, crying is useless.</P>
<P>583. Whst is the use of wailing, pull it out,</P>
<P>It only destroys the self, reflect on this wisely</P>
<P>584. The mind is not appeased crying and weeping, </P>
<P>By doing it a lot of unpleasantness arises and destroys the body.</P>
<P>585. When one hurts oneself, he becomes thin and discoloured.</P>
<P>That wailing is useless, by it the dead are not protected.</P>
<P>586. Humans who do not dispel unpleasantaness, feel much of it,</P>
<P>They die bewailing, under the spell of grief.</P>
<P>587. Look at others too, on their death beds, how they go according to their 
actions.</P>
<P>In the face of death are like fish out of water.</P>
<P>588. What ever is thought, does not come true.</P>
<P>Such is change, that is the nature of the world. </P>
<P>589. Even if a human lives a hundred years or more,</P>
<P>His circle of friends change and he gives up his life here.</P>
<P>590. Therefore listen to the words of the noble ones and train to give up 
wailing,</P>
<P>Seeing the dead, think, `I will not see them again.'</P>
<P>591. Fire is put out with the help of water, likewise the clever wise 
human,</P>
<P>Pushes aside arisen grief, like air that carries away a tuft of cotton 
wool.</P>
<P>592. Wailings and distasteful thoughts are one's own, </P>
<P>Those desiring pleasantness should pull out one's own arrow.</P>
<P>593. The arrow withdrawn, unsoiled and appeased in mind,</P>
<P>Overcoming all grief, is extinguished. </P>

<P>8. Vàseññhasutta. -To the young man Vàsettha.</P></B>
<P>Thus I heard.</P>
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the forest of Icchànakala in the village 
Icchànakala. At that time</P>
<P>many well known brahmin householders lived in Icchànakala, such as the 
brahmins Chanki, Tàrukkha,</P>
<P>Pokkharasàti, Jànussoni, Todeyya and other well known brahmin householders. 
</P>
<P>To the two young brahmins Vàseññha and Bhàradvàja while walking and wandering 
for exeercise ñhis</P>
<P>dispute arose ß Friend, how does one become a brahmin". The young man 
bhàradvàja said : ßIf some one</P>
<P>is unsoiled and undisturbed by birth on both the mother's and father's side 
as far back as seven generations </P>
<P>he becomes a brahmin. Young Vàseññha said : ßIf some one becomes virtuous and 
endowed with </P>
<P>good conduct, he becomes a brahmin". Neither of them could convince the other 
on this dispute, and young Vàseññha addressed the young man Bhàradvàja ßFriend, 
Bhàradvàja, there is the recluse Gotama the son of the Sàkyas, gone forth from 
the Sàkya clan, his fame is spread in this manner. He is </P>
<P>worthy, all knowing, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, knower of 
the worlds, incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, Teacher of gods and men, 
enlightened and blessed, let us approach him and ask this question, and as he 
explains it, let us both accept it. Young Bhàradvàja agreed</P>
<P>to the young man Vàseññha's suggestion. Then the two young men approached the 
Blessed One, exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side and the young man 
Vàseññha addressed the Blessed One in verses.</P>
<P>594 The two of us accept and acknowledge that we are learned in the three 
Vedas,</P>
<P>I was taught by Pokkharasàti, and this young man by Tàrukkha</P>
<P>595. We both can recite the three Vedas completely, </P>
<P>In explaining the meanings of words and grammar, we are like our 
teachers.</P>
<P>596. O! Gotama, we have a dispute on birth,. Bhàradvàja says ßby birth is a 
brahmin"</P>
<P>And I say ßby action" This is our dispute wise one.</P>
<P>597. Each of us could not convince the other</P>
<P>We came to ask about it from the well known all enlightned one</P>
<P>598. When the moon has gone beyond waning, people encounter it with clasped 
hands,</P>
<P>Likewise Gotama is worshipful with clasped hands by the world.</P>
<P>599. The world is enlightened, we ask Gotama, does one become a brahmin by 
birth or else by actions</P>
<P>We do not know this, enlighten us so that we may know the brahmin."</P>
<P>600. The Blessed One said:</P>
<P>ßVaseññha I will tell you step by step how it happens,</P>
<P>The classification of living things in this and other births</P>
<P>601. Look at the grass and trees, although they are not aware,</P>
<P>This and the other has attributes peculiar to their births</P>
<P>. </P>
<P>602. So also insects, grass hoppers and ants</P>
<P>This and the other has attributes peculiar to their births..</P>
<P>603. Look at the animals small and large </P>
<P>This and the other has attributes peculiar to their births.</P>
<P>604. Look at the serpents with long backs going on their bellies,</P>
<P>This and the other has attributes peculiar to their births.</P>
<P>605. Look at the fish too, who find food in the water. </P>
<P>This and the other has attributes peculiar to their births.</P>
<P>606. Look at the birds flying through the air.</P>
<P>This and the other has attributes peculiar to their births.</P>
<P>607. Although at the birth of these, there are various attributes</P>
<P>In humans various attributes are not evident at birth.</P>
<P>608. They are not in the hair, head, ears or eyes</P>
<P>Not in the mouth, nose, lips or eye-lashes</P>
<P>609. Not in the neck, flanks stomach or back,</P>
<P>Not in the buttocks, chest, puedendum, and not in the sexual intercourse.</P>
<P>610. Not in the hands, feet, fingers or nails, nor in the knees and 
calves,</P>
<P>Not in the hue or voice are there attributes by which to know their birth. 
</P>
<P>611. In the individual bodies of humans, these are not evident,</P>
<P>They are designated by the activites of humans.</P>
<P>612. Among humans whoever makes a livelihood by looking after cattle,</P>
<P>Vàseññha, he is a farmer, not a brahmin.</P>

<P>618. Among humans whoever makes a livelihood by advising the king,</P>
<P>Vàseññha, he is the adviser, not a brahmin..</P>
<P>619. Among humans whoever makes a livelihood enjoying the wealth of the 
village and country,</P>
<P>Vssdeññhs, he is the king, not a brahmin.</P>
<P>620. One born of a brahmin woman's womb is not a brahmin, by address, he is 
sir, he has defilements,</P>
<P>When he has no defilements and no seizings, I call him a brahmin.</P>
<P>621. When all bonds are cut, if one is not worried,</P>
<P>Bonds cut and unyoked, I call him a brahmin.</P>
<P>622. Cutting the straps of interest and the present fetters,</P>
<P>When the obstacles removed, is enlightened, I call him a brahmin.. </P>

<P>Develops patience and a lot of it, I call him a brahmin.</P>
<P>624. Not angry, austere, virtuous not haughty</P>
<P>With taming he bears the last body, I call him a brahmin.</P>
<P>625. Like water that does not stay on the lotus leaf, the mustard seed that 
slips from the tip of the arrow,</P>
<P>When not soiled in sensuality, I call him a brahmin.</P>
<P>626. He understands unpleasantness, having diminished the self view here 
itself. . </P>
<P>. When the load abandoned is unyoked, I call him a brahmin.</P>
<P>627. With deep wisdom becomes clever in the path and non-path,</P>
<P>When attained to the highest truth, I call him a brahmin.</P>
<P>628. Not soiled by householders or by those gone forth,</P>
<P>When he becomes homeless with few desires, I call him a brahmin.</P>
<P>629. Giving up punishing living things infirm or firm,</P>
<P>When he does not kill or hurt anyone, I call him a brahmin. </P>
<P>630. Among enemies without enmity, among those hurting the self, 
extinguished,</P>
<P>When among the seizing without a seizing, I call him a brahmin.</P>
<P>631. Like mustard seeds on the tip of a sword, if his greed and hate,</P>
<P>Measuring and malice fall away, I call him a brahmin.</P>
<P>632. Instructs without harsh words, bringing out the truth</P>
<P>When he does not curse anybody, I call him a brahmin.</P>
<P>633. Long or short, small or large, agreeable or disagreeable,</P>

<P>635. When he has no roosting places, knowing what should and should not be 
done,</P>
<P>And has taken a dive in the deathless, I call him a brahmin..</P>
<P>636 Overcoming both bonds of merit and demerit</P>
<P>Pure, without grief, and unattached, I call him a brahmin. </P>
<P>.</P>
<P>637. Like the extremely pure moon undisturbed and without stains,</P>
<P>When the interest `to be' is destroyed, I call him a brahkmin. </P>
<P>638. Overcoming this difficult path of deluded existence, crossses over and 
concentrates,</P>
<P>Fearless, doubts overcome, is extinguished without seizings, I call him a 
brahmin.</P>
<P>639. Giving up sensuality, one goes forth as a homeless </P>
<P>When his sensuous thoughts are destroyed, I call him a brahmin. </P>
<P>640. Giving up craving, one goes forth as a homeless.</P>
<P>When his greedy thoughts are destroyed, I call him a brahmin.</P>
<P>641. Giving up the human yoke, overcomes the heavenly yoke,</P>
<P>When he is unyoked from all yokings, I call him a brahmin.</P>
<P>642. Giving up attachment and aversion is cooled and without seizings,</P>
<P>When the hero wins over the whole world, I call him a brahmin.</P>
<P>643. Seeing the fading of beings and also their arising </P>
<P>Is unsoiled, well gone and enlightened, I call him a brahmin.</P>

humans,</P>
<P>When desires destroyed, he becomes worthy, I call him a brahmin.</P>
<P>645. Has no defiling things in the past, afterwards or in the middle,</P>
<P>Undefiled, when not seizing , I call him a brahmin. </P>
<P>646. The noble bull, the heroic great sage, the fearless winner,</P>
<P>The bather, the enlightened one, I call him a brahmin.</P>
<P>647. Knowing earlier births, and seeing heavenly and hellish existences,</P>
<P>Comes to the destruction of birth, I call him a brahmin.</P>
<P>648. The usual way of the world is to be planned about name and clan</P>
<P>Accumulated and co-incidently meeting, it gets planned at the right time.</P>
<P>649. Ignorantly entangled in views for a long time, </P>
<P>The not knowing tell us, that by birth a brahmin is born.</P>
<P>650. By birth a brahmin is not born, by birth a non-brahmin is not born,</P>
<P>By actions a brahmin is born, by actions a non-brahmin is born..</P>
<P>651. By actions a farmer is born, by actions a craftsman is born,</P>
<P>By sctions a merchant is born, by actions a workman is born..</P>
<P>652. By actions a robber is born, by actions a soldier too, </P>
<P>By actions an adviser is born, by actions a king too. </P>
<P>653. Thus the wise see action as it really is,</P>
<P>Seeing it dependently arising become clever in the results of actions.</P>
<P>654. By actions the world rolls on, by actions the populace roll on,</P>
<P>Beings bound to actions, go on, like the linch pin of the wheel.</P>
<P>655. By austerites, leading the holy life, restraint and taming,</P>
<P>By these a brahmin is born, that is the most noble brahmin.</P>
<P>656. Endowed with the three knowledges, appeased and rebirth destroyed</P>
<P>Vàseññha know it as recognizing Brahmà and Sakha. </P>
<P>When this was said the two young men Vàseññha and Bhàradvàja said thus to the 
Blessed One: ßNow we know good Gotama. It seems as though something overturned 
is re-installed, something covered is made manifest, As though the path is told 
to someone who has lost his way. It seems as though an oil lamp was </P>
<P>lighted for the dark, for those who have eyes to see forms. In various ways 
good Gotama has explained the</P>
<P>Teaching. Now I take refuge in good Gotama, in the Teaching and the Community 
of bhikkhus.. Good </P>
<P>Gotama, remember us as disciples who have taken refuge from today until life 
lasts. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>10. Kokàliyasutta.-To the bhikkhu Kokàliya</P></B>
<P>I heard thus.</P>
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anàthapindika 
in Jeta's grove in Sàvatthi.</P>
<P>Then the bhikkhu Kokàliya approached the Blessed One worshipped, sat on a 
side and said thus to the </P>
<P>Blessed One:"Venerable sir, Sàriputta and Moggallàna are with evil desires, 
overcome by evil desires."</P>
<P>When this was said the Blessed One said:"Kokàliya, do not say that, have 
faith in Sàriputta and Moggallàna, they are well behaved. For the second time 
the bhikkhu Kokàliya said thus to the Blessed:One</P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, to the Blessed One they may be reliable and trustworthy, yet 
they are with evil desires, are</P>
<P>overcome by evil desires" For the second time the Blessed One said:"Kokàliya, 
do not say that, have faith</P>
<P>in Sàriputta and Moggallàna, they are well behaved." For the third time the 
bhikkhu Kokàliya said:</P>
<P>ßVenerable sir, to the Blessed One they may be reliable and trustworthy, yet 
they are with evil desires, are </P>
<P>overcome by evil desires." For the third time the Blessed One said: 
ßKokàliya, do not say that, have faith</P>
<P>in Sàriputta and Moggallàna, they are well behaved."</P>
<P>Then the bhikkkhu Kokàliya got up from his seat, worshipped the Blessed , 
circumbulated the Blessed </P>
<P>One and went away. Soon after that, all over bhikkhu Kokàliya's body there 
arose small blisters the size of </P>
<P>coming seeds. Next they became the size of green grams and next the size of 
chick peas. Then they became the size of jujubi fruits. And later the size of 
myrobolan fruits. From that they became the size of beluwa</P>
<P>fruits. Later they came to be like ripe beluwa fruits, burst and pus and 
blood oozed. The bhikkhu Kokàliya</P>
<P>became very ill on account of it and died and was born in the Paduma hell for 
bearing illwill in the mind for Sàriputta and Moggallàna.</P>
<P>Then Brahmà Sahampati when the night was waning illuminated the whole of 
Jeta's grove with a resplendent light approached the Blessed One, worshipped 
,stood on a side, and said: ßVenerable sir, bhikkhu Kokàliya died and is born in 
the Paduma hell for bearing illwill in the mind for Sàriputta and </P>
<P>Moggallàna, saying that Brahmà Sahampati worshipped, and circumbulated the 
Blessed One and vanished from there.</P>
<P>The Blessed One at the end of that night, addressed the bhikkhus, ßBhikkhus, 
last night Brahmà Sahampati when the night was waning illuminated the whole of 
Jeta's grove with a resplendent light</P>
<P>approached me worshipped and circumbulated me, then he stood on a side and 
said: ßVenerable sir, bhikkhu Kokàliya died and is born in the Paduma hell for 
bearing illwill in the mind for Sàriputta and </P>
<P>Moggallàna. Saying this he worshipped me, circumbulated me and vanished"</P>
<P>Then a certain bhikkhu asked the Blessed One:"Venerable sir, how long is the 
life span in the Paduma hell." The Blessed One said: ßBhikkhu, the life span in 
the Paduma hell is very long, it is not easy to say</P>
<P>it's so many years, or so many hundred years, or so many thousand years, or 
so many hundred thousand years." The bhikkhu said, ßVenerable sir, is it 
possisble to give a comparison." The Blessed One said </P>
<P>it's possible. A man has a load of sesame which is twenty measures by the 
Kosala measure. After every hundred years a man pulls out a sesame seed from the 
load and throws it. Doing this the load of sesame</P>
<P>finishes in no time but not the span of the Abbuda hell. Twenty such Abbuda 
hell spans make one Nirabbuda. hell span. Twenty such nirabbuda hell spans make 
one Ababa hell span. Twenty such Ababa</P>
<P>hell spans make one Ahaha hell span. Twenty Ahaha hell spans make one Añañà 
hell spanòwenty Añañà</P>
<P>hell spans make one Kumudu hell span. Twenty Kumudu hell spans make one 
Sogandhika hell span. Twenty Sogandhika hell spans make one Uppalaka hell span. 
Twenty Uppalaka hell spans make one</P>
<P>Pundarikà hell spans. And twenty Pundarikà hell spans make one Paduma hell 
span. It is in such a hell</P>
<P>that the bhikkhu Kokàliya is born for bearing illwill for Sàriputta and 
Moggallàna. Then the Blessed </P>
<P>One further said these verses:</P>
<P>657. ßTo one born a dagger is born in the mouth,</P>
<P>The fool cuts himself speaking foolishly.</P>
<P>658. Praising the blameworthy, and blaming the praiseworthy one accumulates 
demerit.</P>
<P>With that demerit he does not experience pleasantness. </P>
<P>659. Losing all wealth together with oneself by gsmbling is enough bad 
luck,</P>
<P>To bear illwill in the mind for those gone the righteous path is worse bad 
luck. </P>
<P>660. Blaming noble ones, bring birth in a hundred thousand Nirabbuda hells 
</P>
<P>And thirty six and five Abbuda hells, this for demeritorious intentions of 
word and mind. .</P>
<P>661. Telling lies and disowning one's words saying `I did not say' become the 
same afterwards</P>
<P>These are low actions of humans, done for the sake of others.</P>
<P>662. Offending the undefiled, pure and unblemished, the fool collects 
demerit,</P>
<P>Like throwing fine sand against the wind.</P>
<P>663. A greedy one belittling another is without faith, greedy, not 
grateful,</P>
<P>Selfishly engaged in slandering others.</P>
<P>664. Doing demerit with the mouth talk falsely about noble ones,</P>
<P>Saying destroyers of life, doers of difficult things</P>
<P>Of low humans they are the worst, not to talk much, they are here and now in 
hell. </P>
<P>665. For one's own detriment dust is thrown against the wind, the evil doer 
blaming the appeased,</P>
<P>And doing much more demerit, fall into hell for a long time.</P>
<P>666. By actions nobody is destroyed, that action comes gaining mastery,</P>
<P>That foolish evil doer encounters himself in unpleasantness in the next 
world.</P>
<P>667. Fallen to the hell of iron spikes encounters sharp edges and iron 
stakes</P>
<P>And there are iron balls completed, the `food suitable for the place'.</P>
<P>668. Those who speak do not speak pleasànt words, do not run fast to seek 
shelter,</P>
<P>They always stretch themselves on embers and enter a blaze like fire.</P>
<P>669. Taken away from the blaze are hammered down with iron hammers,</P>
<P>Like the blind going in the dark, it spreads like great earth.</P>
<P>670. Then they enter boiling molten cauldrons shining like fire.</P>
<P>There they are cooked long, as though living with fire.</P>
<P>671. Then how does it come to the evil doer with a mixture of pus and 
blood,</P>
<P>Whatever is wished for an enemy, with that trouble he is touched. </P>
<P>672. Like worms and maggots that live in the water, how is the evil doer 
cooked</P>
<P>Without a bank to swim to, are guarded on all sides.</P>
<P>673. They enter the forest of sharp swords with the body pierced,</P>
<P>Taken by the tongue with a hook are worried shaken about.</P>
<P>674. In the hell Vetarani, sharp and rough edges are encountered</P>
<P>The evil, doing demerit fall to it.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>675. When crying they are eaten by dogs and powerful birds of prey,</P>
<P>And chased to attack, by dogs, foxes, vultures and crows. </P>
<P>676. The mode of conduct here is low, it's like the conduct of the evil 
doers,</P>
<P>Therefore for the rest of their lives evil doers should not be negligent. 
</P>
<P>677. Calculations of the sesame load done by the wise about the span of life 
in the Paduma hell,</P>
<P>Will be five innumerable periods and the other twelve hundred innumerable 
periods. </P>
<P>678. The hellish unpleasantness explained here, has to be experienced for a 
long time</P>
<P>Therefore constantly protect the word and the mind behaving well, conducting 
well. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><B>
<P>11öàlakasutta- To Nalaka</P></B>
<P>679. Retinue of the thirty gods of Sakka and the retinue of gods of Inda, the 
happy ones, are rejoicing.</P>
<P>Waving clothes are very much over joyed, the sage Asita saw in his seclusion 
during the day.</P>
<P>680. Seeing the gods rejoicing much , he reflected it in his mind and 
said:</P>
<P>ßO! Gods, why are you pleased so much, for what reason do you wave 
clothes.</P>
<P>681. It's like when the gods won defeating the demi gods in the fight between 
the gods and demi gods,</P>
<P>Then, there was not such hair standing on end, seeing what wonderful thing 
are the gods rejoicing.</P>
<P>682. Whistling, singing, playing musical instruments, clamping symbols they 
dance,</P>
<P>I ask you, who live on the top of mount Meru , O! Sirs, dispel my doubts 
about this quickly"</P>
<P>683. ßThat incomparable noble gem aspiring enlightenment, is born for the 
good of humanity,</P>
<P>In the village of the Sakyas, in the state of Lumbini, we rejoice because of 
that.</P>
<P>684. The most noble of all beings, the chief man, the man bull, and noble one 
for the whole populace,</P>
<P>Wields the wheel in the forest of sages like the powerful lion that subdues 
the wild animals roaring."</P>
<P>685. Hearing that sound he quickly turned away, and entered the then palace 
of Suddhodana.</P>
<P>There he sat and said thus to the Sakyas:"Where is the prince, I too like to 
see him."</P>
<P>686. At that time the prince shining like gold, was like cleverly completed 
and brought out of the furnace.</P>
<P>Very much conceited about the beauty and incomparable hue, the Sakyas showed 
the son to Asita.</P>
<P>687. Seeing the prince shining like a pea-cock, like the pure moon shining in 
the sky,</P>
<P>Like the resplendent sun released from the clouds was very much pleased.</P>
<P>688. Gods held umbrellas in space, with various boughs and thousandfold 
rims</P>
<P>Golden sticks moved the whisks, yet those who held whisks and umbrellas were 
not seen.</P>
<P>689. The sage Kanhasiri saw his birth like gold that comes from the golden 
hued seat,</P>
<P>Holding the white parasol on the top, he accepted the prince with a pleasant 
mind.. . </P>
<P>690. Accepting the small one of the Sakyas became inquisitive about the marks 
of a Great Man.</P>
<P>And pleased he announced ßThe two footed one is noble, there is no 
compare."</P>
<P>691. Then thinking of his own course of action, displeased, tears rolled 
down</P>
<P>The Sakyas seeing the sage not speaking but crying asked: ßIs there danger to 
our prince."</P>
<P>692. Seeing the displeased Sakyas the sage said: ßI see no danger to the 
prince,</P>
<P>In the future too there will not be any danger, he will not live in the 
household, he has noble thoughts.</P>
<P>693. This prince will realize hightest enlightenment, with noble purity will 
see the wheel of the Teaching </P>
<P>Will roll it, out of compassion for the populace at large, under him the holy 
life will spread widely.</P>
<P>694. Very little of my life span is left now, and my death will be a danger 
to me,</P>
<P>I would not be able to hear the sweet Teaching, therefore was hurt, troubled 
and grief stricken.</P>
<P>695. Giving much happiness to the Sakyas, he went to the inner city and led 
the holy life.</P>
<P>With much compassion for his nephew instilled interest for the sweet 
Teaching. .</P>
<P>696. ßWhen the word `enlightened' is heard from an outsider, the enlightened 
one wanders according the </P>
<P>Teaching, </P>
<P>Go to him and question about his faith and lead the holy life under the 
Blessed One"</P>
<P>.</P>
<P>697 Advised by him out of compassion in a friendly mannerño realize highest 
enlightenment in the future</P>
<P>Nàlaka, the accumulation of merit lived a life of probation expecting the 
winner.</P>
<P>698. Hearing the sound that the winner is rolling the noble wheel of the 
Teaching, </P>
<P>Went and saw the pleasant sage.and gave him Asita's message.</P>
<P>End of the Story.</P>
<P>699. Knowing these words from Asita, as I heard them,</P>
<P>I ask them from Gotama, who has gone beyond all things. </P>
<P>700. Sage, by a homeless, wandering for alms,</P>

<P align=center>12. Dvayatànupassanà Sutta -Twofold Reflections</P></FONT><FONT

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I heard thus.</P>
<P>At one time the Blessed One was living in Sàvatti in the Pubba Monastery, the 
palace of Migàra's mother. That full moon night, the Blessed One was seated in 
the open attended by the Community of bhikkhus. The Blessed One observed the 
silent community of bhikkhus and addressed them.: "bhikkhus, if somebody were to 
ask you, 'O! bhikkhus, why should you listen to these noble teachings leading to 
enlightenment, you should reply thus: 'It is to know the twofold teaching as it 
really is' . How is it twofold: One reflection is, this is unpleasant and this 
its arising. The other reflection is, This is the cessation of unpleasantness 
and this the path leading to the cessation of unpleasantness. To a bhikkhu 
reflecting diligently to dispel, in this twofold manner two fruits could be 
expected; either knowledge here and now, or non-returning when substratum 
expires. and the Blessed One further said: </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>724. Those who do not know unpleasantness, its arising,</P>
<P>How all unpleasantness is destroyed and the path to end all 
unpleasantness...</P>
<P>725 Through release of mind or release through wisdom,</P>
<P>It is impossible they should come to the end, but to birth and decay..</P>
<P>726. They that know unpleasantness, its arising,</P>
<P>How unpleasantness is destroyed, and the path to end unpleasantness....</P>
<P>727. Endowed with release of mind or release through wisdom,</P>
<P>Do come to the end and not for birth and decay. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"If asked is there another method, to reflect rightfully in a twofold way, 
there is, would be the reply, and it would be asked how; "' Whatever 
unpleasantness experienced is on account of endearments (1). This is one 
reflection. With the remainderless cessation of all endearments, unpleasantness 
is not experienced. This is the second reflection To a bhikkhu reflecting in 
this ......re... .. the Blessed One further said thus.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>728. "In the diffused world unpleasantness arises on account of 
endearments,</P>
<P>The fool making endearments goes to unpleasantness again and again.</P>
<P>Knowing it as the birth and growth of unpleasantness, people should</P>
<P>not make endearments"</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"If asked is there another method, to reflect rightfully in a twofold way, 
there is, would be the reply, and it would be asked how, "Whatever 
unpleasantness experienced is on account of ignorance. This is one reflection. 
With the remainderless cessation of ignorance unpleasantness is not experienced. 
This is the second reflection. To a bhikkhu reflecting in this .......re...". 
the Blessed One further said thus: </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>729. "It is a characteristic of the ignorant to proceed from birth to death, 
Born here and there again and again.</P>
<P>730. Ignorance is the great delusion on account of which is a steady and long 
attachment, Those who know do not come for birth again and again.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"If asked is there .........re.......' would be asked how. '"Whatever 
unpleasantness experienced is on account of determinations (2). This is one one 
reflection . With the remainderless cessation of determinations, unpleasantness 
is not experienced. This is the second reflection. To a bhikkhu reflecting in 
this ....re..".. the Blessed One further said thus: </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>731 "Whatever unpleasantness experienced springs from determinations,</P>
<P>With the cessation of determinations, there is no arising of 
unpleasantness.</P>
<P>732. 'Unpleasantness springs from determinations', knowing this danger,</P>
<P>Destroy it with the perception of appeasing all determinations (3).</P>
<P>This is the destruction of unpleasantness, knowing it as it really is.</P>
<P>733. The wise attain right view and perfect knowledge</P>
<P>Going beyond the yoke of Death, do not come for rebirth."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"If asked is there .......re..'.... would be asked how. "'Whatever 
unpleasantness experienced is on account of consciousness. This is one 
reflection . With the remainderless cessation of consciousness, unpleasant- ness 
is not experienced. This is the second reflection. To the bhikkhu reflecting in 
this ....re..." ..... the Blessed One further said thus:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>734. "Whatever unpleasantness experienced springs from consciousness (4)</P>
<P>With the cessation of consciousness, there is no unpleasantness.</P>
<P>735. 'Unpleasantness springs from consciousness' knowing this danger</P>
<P>The bhikkhu appeases consciousness, and is for ever extinguished."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"If asked is there ......re...... ' would be asked how. "Whatever 
unpleasantness experienced is on account of contact. This is one re- flection. 
With the remainderless cessation of contact, unpleasantness is not experienced. 
This is the second reflection. To the bhikkhu reflecting in this .....re..." The 
Blessed One further said thus:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>736. "Those overcome by contact, wandering in the stream of being,</P>
<P>Fallen to the wrong path are far removed from the destruction of bonds.</P>
<P>737. Those who know contact thoroughly, and attached to appeasement,</P>
<P>They are the ones who thoroughly know contact, and are extinguished. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"'If asked is there ....re.....would be asked how. "Whatever unpleasantness 
experienced springs from feelings. (5) This is one reflection. With the 
remainderless cessation of feelings unpleasantness is not experienced. This is 
the second reflection. To the bhikkhu reflection in this ...re....." The Blessed 
One further said thus:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>738. "Whatever is felt, internally or externally,</P>
<P>As pleasant, unpleasant or even neither unpleasant nor pleasant,....</P>
<P>739. Knows all this as 'unpleasant' deceitful, decaying things,</P>
<P>While feeling sees them fade and there and there becomes dispassionate </P>
<P>The bhikkhu with destroyed feelings is for ever extinguished."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"'If asked is there ....re.... would be asked how. "Whatever unpleasantness 
experienced springs from craving. This is one reflection. With the remainderless 
cessation of craving unpleasantness is not experienced. This is the second 
reflection. To the bhikkhu reflecting in this ...re..... " The Blessed One 
further said thus: </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>740. "Craving is man's mate to tarry long in existences,</P>
<P>Born here and then there and never going beyond that.</P>
<P>741. Craving is the arouser of unpleasantness, knowing this danger,</P>
<P>The bhikkhu leads the holy life mindfully to give up craving and seizing.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"'If asked is there ....re.... would be asked how. "Whatever unpleasantness 
experienced springs from seizing. This is one reflection. With the remainderless 
cessation of seizings, unpleasantness is not experienced. This is the second 
reflection. To the bhikkhu reflecting in this .... re...." The Blessed One 
further said</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>742. "On account of seizing is being, become, goes to unpleasantness.:</P>
<P>To the born there is death, this is the arising of unpleasantness.</P>
<P>743. Therefore the wise rightly knowing the destruction of seizings,</P>
<P>Thoroughly know destruction of birth and do not come to be born again."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"'If asked is there ..... re.......would be asked how. "Whatever 
unpleasantness experienced springs from initiations. This is one reflection. 
With the remainderless cessation of initiations, unpleasantness is not 
experienced. This is the second reflection. To the bhikkhu reflecting in 
this...re..." The Blessed One further said:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>744. Whatever unpleasantness experienced springs from initiations,</P>
<P>With the cessation of initiations unpleasantness is not experienced</P>
<P>745. Unpleasantness comes after initiation, knowing this danger</P>
<P>Giving up all initiations are released there from.</P>
<P>746. The bhikkhu with appeased mind, the craving 'to be' uprooted ,</P>
<P>Birth and transmigration ended, has no rebirth".</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"If asked is there....re..... would be asked how. "Whatever unpleasantness 
experienced springs from supports. This is one reflection. With the 
remainderless cessation of supports, unpleasantness is not experienced. This is 
the second reflection. To the bhikkhu reflecting in this ....re..." The Blessed 
One further said:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>747 "Whatever unpleasantness experienced springs from supports, (4)</P>
<P>With the cessation of supports unpleasantness is not experienced. </P>
<P>748. Unpleasantness springs from supports, knowing this danger, </P>
<P>Learns all supports thoroughly and is not supported on them.</P>
<P>749. Thoroughly knowing the healthy state; the destruction of desires, </P>
<P>The Perfected One is not reckoned in the Teaching that stands 
discrimination."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"If asked is there ...re.... would be asked how. "Whatever unpleasantness 
experienced springs from wavering. This is one reflection. With the 
remainderless cessation of wavering, unpleasantness is not experienced. This is 
the second reflection. To the bhikkhu reflecting in this ...re...." The Blessed 
One further said:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>750. "Whatever unpleasantness experienced springs from wavering,</P>
<P>With the cessation of wavering, unpleasantness is not experienced.</P>
<P>751. Unpleasantness springs from wavering, knowing this danger,</P>
<P>Give up distractions and uproot determinations</P>
<P>Desireless and not seizing the bhikkhu leads the holy life mindfully.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"If asked is there ....re..... would be asked how. "To the supported comes a 
change, This is one reflection. To the not supported there is no change. This is 
the second reflection. To the bhikkhu reflecting in this ...re......" The 
Blessed One further said thus. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>752. The unsupported do not change, the supported are seized, </P>
<P>Born here and there they do not go beyond transmigrating.</P>
<P>753. There's fear in supports, knowing this danger,</P>
<P>Not supported and not seizing, the bhikkhu leads the holy life 
mindfully."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"If asked is there ...re..... would be asked how. "Out of material, 
immateriality is more peaceful. This is one reflection. Of immaterial cessation 
is more peaceful. This is the second reflection. To the bhikkhu reflecting in 
this ...re...." The Blessed One further said thus:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>754. "Beings with form, and formless beings,</P>
<P>Do not know cessation and come for re- birth.</P>
<P>755. Those that know matter thoroughly, get established in the immaterial 
</P>
<P>Those that find release in cessation, go beyond the domains of Death."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"If asked is there...re..... would be asked how. "O! bhikkhus, to gods and 
men, Màras, and the community of recluses and Brahmins 'this world is true ' is 
established. That, by the noble ones is verily seen with right wisdom as ïot 
true' . This is one reflection.. Whatever is established as false by gods and 
men, Màras and the community of recluses and Brahmins, is thoroughly seen as it 
really is with right wisdom as the truth by the Noble Ones. This is the second 
reflection. To the bhikkhu reflecting in this .....re...." The Blessed One 
further said:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>756. "Look at gods and men measuring the self without a self,</P>
<P>Taking name and matter for granted, think 'this is true' </P>
<P>757. In whatever is thought, there is a change,</P>
<P>That is the lie there, the deluded thing in brief.</P>
<P>758. The non-deluded thing is extinction, that the Noble Ones knew as true, 
</P>
<P>They have realized the truth and are extinguished for ever. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"If asked is there...re.... would be asked how.. "O! bhikkhus, to gods and 
men, Màras, and the community of recluses and Brahmins it is established that 
this world is pleasant, and that by the Noble Ones is verily seen with right 
wisdom as unpleasant. This is one reflection. Whatever established as un- 
pleasant by gods and men, Màras, and community of recluses and Brahmins, is 
thoroughly seen as it really is with right wisdom as pleasant by the Noble Ones. 
This is the second reflection. To a bhikkhu reflecting in this ...re....." The 
Blessed One further said:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>759. All forms sounds, tastes, smells, touches and ideas,</P>
<P>Are agreeable and pleasant as long as they are present.</P>
<P>760. To gods and men they are pleasant, while they are present,</P>
<P>When these cease it is unpleasant to them . </P>
<P>761. The breaking up of the self is seen as pleasant by the Noble Ones,</P>
<P>This is completely opposite to what is seen by the whole world.</P>
<P>762. What others said was pleasant, is unpleasant said the Noble Ones,</P>
<P>What others said was unpleasant, the Noble Ones knew as pleasant.</P>
<P>The Teaching is very difficult to understand, the fools are confused over 
it.</P>
<P>763. Those hemmed in darkness do not see,</P>
<P>To the mindful it is open as seeing a light,</P>
<P>Those not clever in the Teaching , do not see it right under the eye</P>
<P>764. Those going with the stream , overcome with the greed 'to be',</P>
<P>Within the reach of Death, find it difficult to realize this Teaching. </P>
<P>765. Other than the Noble Ones, who else would value enlightenment,</P>
<P>Which they knowing rightly extinguish without desires.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Blessed One said thus, and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the 
Blessed One. When the Blessed One gave this discourse about sixty bhikkhus 
released their minds from desires without holdings.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
