I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="savatthi">Savatthi</A> in the Eastern Monastery, the palace of <A NAME="migaramom">Migara's mother</A>. Now on that occasion -- the Uposatha day of the fifteenth, the full-moon night -- the Blessed One was sitting in the open air surrounded by the community of monks. Surveying the silent community of monks, he addressed them: "Monks, if there are any who ask, 'Your listening to teachings that are skillful, noble, leading onward, going to self-awakening is a prerequisite for what?' they should be told, 'For the sake of knowing qualities of dualities as they actually are.' 'What duality are you speaking about?' 'This is stress. This is the origination of stress': this is one contemplation. 'This is the cessation of stress. This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress': this is a second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way -- heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute -- one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here &amp; now, or -- if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance -- non-return."
<p>
That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-gone, the Teacher, said further:
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Those who don't discern stress,<br>
what brings stress into play,<br>
&amp; where it totally stops,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without trace;<br>
who don't know the path,<br>
the way to the stilling of stress:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lowly<br>
in their release of awareness<br>
&amp; release of discernment,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; incapable<br>
of making an end,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they're headed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to birth &amp; aging.

But those who discern stress,<br>
what brings stress into play,<br>
&amp; where it totally stops,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without trace;<br>
who discern the path,<br>
the way to the stilling of stress:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; consummate<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they aren't headed<br>

"Now, if there are any who ask, 'Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?' they should be told, 'There would.' 'How would that be?' 'Whatever stress comes into play is all from acquisition as a requisite condition': this is one contemplation. 'From the remainderless fading &amp; cessation of that very acquisition, there is no coming into play of stress': this is a second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way -- heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute -- one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here &amp; now, or -- if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance -- non-return."
<p>
That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-gone, the Teacher, said further:
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The manifold stresses<br>
that come into play in the world,<br>
come from acquisition as their cause.<br>
Anyone not knowing [this]<br>
creates acquisition.<br>
The fool, he comes to stress<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; again &amp; again.<br>
Therefore, discerning [this],<br>
you shouldn't create acquisition<br>
as you contemplate birth<br>
as what brings stress<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; into play.

<p>
"Now, if there are any who ask, 'Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?' they should be told, 'There would.' 'How would that be?' 'Whatever stress comes into play is all from ignorance as a requisite condition': this is one contemplation. 'From the remainderless fading &amp; cessation of that very ignorance, there is no coming into play of stress': this is a second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way -- heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute -- one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here &amp; now, or -- if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance -- non-return."
<p>
That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-gone, the Teacher, said further:
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Those who journey the wandering-on<br>
through birth &amp; death, again &amp; again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in this state here<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or anywhere else,<br>
that destination is simply through ignorance.<br>
This ignorance is a great delusion<br>
whereby they have wandered-on<br>
a long, long time.<br>
While beings immersed in clear knowing<br>
don't go to further becoming.

"Now, if there are any who ask, 'Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?' they should be told, 'There would.' 'How would that be?' 'Whatever stress comes into play is all from fabrication as a requisite condition': this is one contemplation. 'From the remainderless fading &amp; cessation of that very fabrication, there is no coming into play of stress': this is a second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way -- heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute -- one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here &amp; now, or -- if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance -- non-return."
<p>
That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-gone, the Teacher, said further:
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Any stress that comes into play<br>
is all from fabrication<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a requisite<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; condition.<br>
With the cessation of fabrication,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there is no stress<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coming into play.<br>
Knowing this drawback --<br>
that stress comes from fabrication<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a requisite<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; condition --<br>
with the tranquilizing of all fabrication,<br>
with the stopping of perception:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that's how there is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the ending of stress.<br>
Knowing this as it actually is,<br>
an attainer-of-wisdom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sees rightly.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing rightly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the wise --<br>

"Now, if there are any who ask, 'Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?' they should be told, 'There would.' 'How would that be?' 'Whatever stress comes into play is all from consciousness as a requisite condition': this is one contemplation. 'From the remainderless fading &amp; cessation of that very consciousness, there is no coming into play of stress': this is a second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way -- heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute -- one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here &amp; now, or -- if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance -- non-return."

Knowing this drawback --<br>
that stress comes from fabrication<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a requisite<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; condition --<br>
with the stilling of consciousness, the monk<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; free from hunger<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is totally unbound.

"Now, if there are any who ask, 'Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?' they should be told, 'There would.' 'How would that be?' 'Whatever stress comes into play is all from contact as a requisite condition': this is one contemplation. 'From the remainderless fading &amp; cessation of that very contact, there is no coming into play of stress': this is a second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way -- heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute -- one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here &amp; now, or -- if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance -- non-return."
<p>
That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-gone, the Teacher, said further:
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For those overcome by contact,<br>
flowing along in the stream of becoming,<br>
following a miserable path,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the ending of fetters<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is far away.<br>
While those who comprehend contact,<br>
delighting in stilling through discernment,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they, by breaking through contact,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; free from hunger,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are totally unbound.

<p>
"Now, if there are any who ask, 'Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?' they should be told, 'There would.' 'How would that be?' 'Whatever stress comes into play is all from feeling as a requisite condition': this is one contemplation. 'From the remainderless fading &amp; cessation of that very feeling, there is no coming into play of stress': this is a second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way -- heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute -- one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here &amp; now, or -- if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance -- non-return."
<p>
That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-gone, the Teacher, said further:
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Knowing that<br>
whatever is felt --<br>
pleasure, pain,<br>
neither pleasure nor pain,<br>
within or without --<br>
is stressful,<br>
deceptive,<br>

at each contact,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contact,<br>
he knows it right there:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with just the ending of feeling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there is no stress<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coming into play.<br>

<p>
"Now, if there are any who ask, 'Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?' they should be told, 'There would.' 'How would that be?' 'Whatever stress comes into play is all from craving as a requisite condition': this is one contemplation. 'From the remainderless fading &amp; cessation of that very craving, there is no coming into play of stress': this is a second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way -- heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute -- one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here &amp; now, or -- if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance -- non-return."
<p>
That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-gone, the Teacher, said further:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
With craving his companion, a man<br>
wanders on a long, long time.<br>
Neither in this state here<br>
nor anywhere else<br>
does he go beyond<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the wandering-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on.<br>
Knowing this drawback --<br>
that craving brings stress into play --<br>
free from craving,<br>
devoid of clinging,<br>
mindful, the monk<br>
lives the wandering life.

"Now, if there are any who ask, 'Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?' they should be told, 'There would.' 'How would that be?' 'Whatever stress comes into play is all from clinging as a requisite condition': this is one contemplation. 'From the remainderless fading &amp; cessation of that very clinging, there is no coming into play of stress': this is a second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way -- heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute -- one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here &amp; now, or -- if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance -- non-return."

That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-gone, the Teacher, said further:
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
From clinging as a requisite condition<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; comes becoming.<br>
One who has come into being<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; goes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to stress.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is death<br>
for one who is born.<br>
This is the coming into play<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of stress.<br>
Thus, with the ending of clinging, the wise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seeing rightly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; directly knowing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the ending of birth,<br>
go to no further becoming.

"Now, if there are any who ask, 'Would there be the right contemplation of dualities in yet another way?' they should be told, 'There would.' 'How would that be?' 'Whatever stress comes into play is all from disturbance as a requisite condition': this is one contemplation. 'From the remainderless fading &amp; cessation of that very disturbance, there is no coming into play of stress': this is a second contemplation. For a monk rightly contemplating this duality in this way -- heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute -- one of two fruits can be expected: either gnosis right here &amp; now, or -- if there be any remnant of clinging-sustenance -- non-return."

<BLOCKQUOTE>
All sights, sounds, smells, tastes,<br>
tactile sensations, &amp; ideas<br>
that are &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; welcome,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appealing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; agreeable --<br>
as long as they're said<br>

are supposed by the world<br>
together with its deities<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be bliss.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when they cease,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they're supposed by them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be stress.<br>
The stopping of self-identity<br>
is viewed by the noble ones<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as bliss.<br>
This is contrary<br>
to what's seen<br>
by the world as a whole.
<p>
What others say is blissful,<br>
the noble ones say is stress.<br>
What others say is stressful,<br>
the noble know as bliss.<br>
See the Dhamma, hard to understand!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here those who don't know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are confused.<br>
For those who are veiled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it's &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; darkness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blindness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for those who don't see.<br>
But for the good it is blatant,<br>
like light<br>
for those who see.<br>
Though in their very presence,<br>
they don't understand it --<br>
dumb animals, unadept in the Dhamma.<br>
It's not easy<br>
for those overcome<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by passion for becoming,<br>
flowing along<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the stream of becoming,<br>
falling under Mara's sway,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to wake up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to this Dhamma.
<p>
Who, apart from the noble,<br>
is worthy to wake up<br>
to this state? --<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the state that,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through rightly knowing it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they're free from fermentation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; totally<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unbound.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words. And while this explanation was being given, the minds of 60 monks, through lack of clinging, were fully released from fermentation.
