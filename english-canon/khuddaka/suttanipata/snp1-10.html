<b>Translator's note:</b> This discourse is the source of many proverbs frequently quoted in Theravadin countries. In 1982, when Thailand was celebrating the 200<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the founding of the current dynasty, His Majesty the King structured his chief address to the Thai people around the four qualities mentioned in the Buddha's last verse.
<hr>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at <A NAME="alavi">Alavi</A> in the haunt of the Alavaka yakkha. Then the Alavaka yakkha went to the Blessed One and on arrival said to him: "Get out, contemplative!"
<p>
[Saying,] "All right, my friend," the Blessed One went out.
<p>
"Come in, contemplative!"
<p>
[Saying,] "All right, my friend," the Blessed One went in.
<p>
A second time .... A third time, the Alavaka yakkha said to the Blessed One, "Get out, contemplative!"
<p>
[Saying,] "All right, my friend," the Blessed One went out.
<p>
"Come in, contemplative!"
<p>
[Saying,] "All right, my friend," the Blessed One went in.
<p>
Then a fourth time, the Alavaka yakkha said to the Blessed One, "Get out, contemplative!"
<p>
"I won't go out, my friend. Do what you have to do."
<p>
"<A NAME="ganges">I will ask you a question</A>, contemplative. If you can't answer me, I will possess your mind or rip open your heart or, grabbing you by the feet, hurl you across the Ganges."
<p>
"My friend, I see no one in the cosmos with its deities, Maras &amp; Brahmas, its contemplatives &amp; priests, its royalty &amp; commonfolk, who could possess my mind or rip open my heart or, grabbing me by the feet, hurl me across the Ganges. But nevertheless, ask me what you wish."

<i>[Alavaka:]</i>
<blockquote>
What&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a person's highest wealth?<br>
What, when well-practiced, brings bliss?<br>
What&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the highest of savors?<br>
Living in what way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is one's life called the best?
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>[The Buddha:]</i>
<blockquote>
Conviction &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a person's highest wealth.<br>
Dhamma, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when well-practiced, brings bliss.<br>
Truth is the highest of savors.[<a HREF="#n1" NAME="1">1</A>]<br>
Living with discernment,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one's life is called best.

<p>
<i>[Alavaka:]</i>
<blockquote>
How &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does one cross over the flood?<br>
How &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cross over the sea?<br>
How &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does one overcome suffering &amp; stress?<br>
How &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a person purified?
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>[The Buddha:]</i>
<blockquote>
Through conviction&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one crosses over the flood.<br>
Through heedfulness,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sea.<br>
Through persistence&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one overcomes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suffering &amp; stress.<br>
Through discernment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a person is purified.
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>[Alavaka:]</i>
<blockquote>
How &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does one gain discernment?<br>
How &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does one find wealth?<br>
How &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does one attain honor?<br>
How &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bind friends to oneself?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Passing from this world<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the next world,<br>
how&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does one not grieve?
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>[The Buddha:]</i>
<blockquote>
Convinced of the arahants' Dhamma<br>
for attaining Unbinding,<br>
-- heedful, observant --<br>
one listening well<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gains discernment.<br>
Doing what's fitting,<br>
enduring burdens,<br>
one with initiative<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; finds wealth.<br>
Through truth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one attains honor.<br>
Giving<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; binds friends to oneself.
<p>
Endowed with these four qualities,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- truth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self-control,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stamina,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relinquishment --<br>
a householder of conviction,<br>
on passing away, doesn't grieve.
<p>
Now, go ask others,<br>
common priests &amp; contemplatives,<br>
if anything better than<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; truth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self-control,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; endurance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; relinquishment<br>
here can be found.
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>[Alavaka:]</i>
<blockquote>
How could I go ask<br>
common priests &amp; contemplatives? --<br>
now that today I understand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what benefits<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the next life.
<p>
It was truly for my well-being<br>
that the Awakened One came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to stay in Alavi.<br>
Today I understand<br>
where what is given<br>
bears great fruit.
<p>
I will wander from village to village,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; town to town,<br>
paying homage&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the Self-awakened One<br>
&amp; the true rightness&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Dhamma. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
