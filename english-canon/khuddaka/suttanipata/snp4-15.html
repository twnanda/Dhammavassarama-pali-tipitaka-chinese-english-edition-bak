"When embraced,<br>
the rod of violence[<a HREF="#n15-1" NAME="15-1">1</A>]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; breeds danger &amp; fear:<br>
Look at people quarreling.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will tell of how<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I experienced<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dismay.<br>
<A NAME="fish">Seeing</A> people floundering<br>
like fish in small puddles,<br>
competing with one another -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as I saw this,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fear came into me.<br>
The world was entirely<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without substance.<br>
All the directions<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were knocked out of line.<br>
Wanting a haven for myself,<br>
I saw nothing that wasn't laid claim to.<br>
Seeing nothing in the end<br>
but competition,<br>
I felt discontent.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A NAME="arrow">And then I saw</A><br>
an arrow here,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so very hard to see,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; embedded in the heart.<br>
Overcome by this arrow<br>
you run in all directions.<br>
But simply on pulling it out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you don't run,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you don't sink.[<a HREF="#n15-2" NAME="15-2">2</A>]
<p>
[Here the trainings are recited.] [<a HREF="#n15-3" NAME="15-3">3</A>]
<p>
Whatever things are tied down in the world,<br>
you shouldn't be set on them.<br>
Having totally penetrated<br>
sensual pleasures,<br>
sensual passions,[<a HREF="#n15-4" NAME="15-4">4</A>]<br>
you should train for your own<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbinding.<br>
Be truthful, not insolent,<br>
not deceptive, rid<br>
of divisiveness.<br>
Without anger, the sage<br>
should cross over the evil<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of greed &amp; avarice.<br>
He should conquer laziness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weariness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sloth;<br>
shouldn't consort with heedlessness,<br>
shouldn't stand firm in his pride -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the man with his heart set<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on Unbinding.<br>
He shouldn't engage in lying,<br>
shouldn't create a sense of allure in form,<br>
should fully fathom conceit,<br>
and live refraining from impulsiveness;<br>
shouldn't &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delight in what's old,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prefer what's new,[<a HREF="#n15-5" NAME="15-5">5</A>]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grieve over decline,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get entangled in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what's dazzling &amp; bright.[<a HREF="#n15-6" NAME="15-6">6</A>]
<p>
I call greed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a 'great flood';<br>
hunger, a swift current.<br>
Preoccupations are ripples;<br>
sensuality, a bog<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hard to cross over.<br>
Not deviating from truth,<br>
a sage stands on high ground<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : a brahmin.
<p>
Having renounced All,[<a HREF="#n15-7" NAME="15-7">7</A>]<br>
he is said to be at peace;<br>
having clearly known, he<br>
is an attainer-of-wisdom;<br>
knowing the Dhamma, he's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; independent.<br>
Moving rightly through the world,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he doesn't envy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anyone here.
<p>
Whoever here has gone over &amp; beyond<br>
sensual passions -- <br>
an attachment hard<br>
to transcend in the world,<br>
doesn't sorrow,<br>
doesn't fret.<br>
He, his stream cut, is free<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from bonds.
<p>
Burn up what's <i>before,</i><br>
and have nothing for <i>after.</i><br>
If you don't grasp<br>
at what's <i>in between,[<a HREF="#n15-8" NAME="15-8">8</A>]</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you will go about, calm.
<p>
For whom, in name &amp; form,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in every way,<br>
there's no sense of <i>mine,</i><br>
and who doesn't grieve<br>
over what is not:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he, in the world,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; isn't defeated,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suffers no loss.[<a HREF="#n15-9" NAME="15-9">9</A>]
<p>
To whom there doesn't occur<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This is mine,'<br>
for whom nothing is others',<br>
feeling no sense of <i>mine-ness,</i><br>
doesn't grieve at the thought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have nothing.'
<p>
Not harsh,<br>
not greedy, not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perturbed,<br>everywhere<br>
in tune:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this is the reward<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- I say when asked -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for those who are free<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from pre-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conceptions.
<p>
For one unperturbed<br>
-- who knows -- <br>
there's no accumulating.<br>
Abstaining, unaroused,<br>
he everywhere sees<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; security.[<a HREF="#n15-10" NAME="15-10">10</A>]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sage<br>
doesn't speak of himself<br>
as among those who are higher,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; equal,<br>
or lower.<br>
At peace, free of selfishness,<br>
he doesn't embrace, doesn't<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reject,"
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Blessed One said.
