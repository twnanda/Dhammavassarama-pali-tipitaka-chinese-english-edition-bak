<blockquote>
Whatever spirits have gathered here,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- on the earth, in the sky -- <br>
may you all be happy<br>
&amp; listen intently to what I say.
<p>
Thus, spirits, you should all be attentive.<br>
Show kindness to the human race.<br>
Day &amp; night they give offerings,<br>
so, being heedful, protect them.
<p>
Whatever wealth -- here or beyond -- <br>
whatever exquisite treasure in the heavens,<br>
does not, for us, equal the Tathagata.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Buddha.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.
<p>
The exquisite Deathless -- ending, dispassion -- <br>
discovered by the Sakyan Sage in concentration:<br>
There is nothing to equal that Dhamma.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Dhamma.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.
<p>
What the excellent Awakened One extolled as pure<br>
and called the concentration<br>
of unmediated knowing:<br>
No equal to that concentration can be found.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Dhamma.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.
<p>
The <A NAME="8persons">eight persons</A> -- the four pairs -- <br>
praised by those at peace:<br>
They, disciples of the One Well-Gone, deserve offerings.<br>
What is given to them bears great fruit.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Sangha.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.
<p>
Those who, devoted, firm-minded,<br>
apply themselves to Gotama's message,<br>
on attaining their goal, plunge into the Deathless,<br>
freely enjoying the Liberation they've gained.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Sangha.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.
<p>
An Indra pillar,[<a href="#n1" name="1">1</A>] planted in the earth,<br>
that even the four winds cannot shake:<br>
that, I tell you, is like the person of integrity,<br>
who -- having comprehended<br>
the noble truths -- sees.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Sangha.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.
<p>
Those who have seen clearly the noble truths<br>
well-taught by the one of deep discernment -- <br>
regardless of what [later] might make them heedless -- <br>
will come to no eighth state of becoming.[<a href="#n2" name="2">2</A>]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Sangha.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.
<p>
At the moment of attaining sight,<br>
one abandons three things:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; identity-views, uncertainty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; any attachment to precepts &amp; practices.[<a href="#n3" name="3">3</A>]<br>
One is completely released<br>
from the four states of deprivation,[<a href="#n4" name="4">4</A>]<br>
and incapable of committing<br>
the six great wrongs.[<a href="#n5" name="5">5</A>]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Sangha.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.
<p>
Whatever bad deed one may do<br>
-- in body, speech, or in mind -- <br>
one cannot hide it:<br>
an incapability ascribed<br>
to one who has seen the Way.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Sangha.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.
<p>
<A NAME="forest">Like a</A> forest grove with flowering tops<br>
in the first month of the heat of the summer,<br>
so is the foremost Dhamma he taught,<br>
for the highest benefit, leading to Unbinding.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Buddha.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.
<p>
Foremost,<br>
foremost-knowing,<br>
foremost-giving,<br>
foremost-bringing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unexcelled, he taught the<br>
foremost Dhamma.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Buddha.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.
<p>
Ended the old, there is no new taking birth.<br>
dispassioned their minds toward further becoming,<br>
they, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with no seed, no desire for growth,<br>
the prudent, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go out like this flame.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Sangha.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.
<p>
Whatever spirits have gathered here,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- on the earth, in the sky -- <br>
let us pay homage to the Buddha,<br>
the Tathagata worshipped by beings<br>
human &amp; divine.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May there be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well-being.
<p>
Whatever spirits have gathered here,<br>

&amp; the Tathagata worshipped by beings<br>
human &amp; divine.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May there be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well-being.
