<B>Translator's note:</B> The Indian rhinoceros, unlike the African, has only one horn. Hence the recurrent image here. As noted under <A HREF="snp1-1.html">I.1</A>, there is evidence suggesting that the verses here were originally separate poems, composed on separate occasions, and that they have been gathered together because of their common refrain.]

goes for forage wherever it wants:<br>
the wise person, valuing freedom,<br>
wanders alone, a rhinoceros horn.
<p>
In the midst of companions<br>
-- when staying at home,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when going out wandering -- <br>
you are prey to requests.<br>
Valuing the freedom<br>
that no one else covets,<br>

<p>
There is sporting &amp; love<br>
in the midst of companions,<br>
&amp; abundant fondness for offspring.<br>

at the prospect of parting<br>
from those who'd be dear,<br>

Without irritation in all four directions,<br>
content with whatever you get,<br>
enduring troubles with no dismay,<br>

They are hard to please,<br>

If you gain a mature companion,<br>
a fellow traveler, right-living &amp; wise,<br>
overcoming all dangers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go with him, gratified,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mindful.
<p>

<A NAME="wildelephant">like the</A> elephant in the <A NAME="matanga">Matanga</A> wilds,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his herd.<br>
<p>
We praise companionship<br>

Those on a par, or better,<br>
should be chosen as friends.<br>
If they're not to be found,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; living faultlessly,<br>
wander alone, a rhinoceros horn.
<p>
Seeing radiant bracelets of gold,<br>
well-made by a smith,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clinking, clashing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two on an arm,<br>
wander alone, a rhinoceros horn,
<p>
[Thinking:]<br>
"In the same way,<br>
if I were to live with another,<br>
there would be careless talk or abusive."<br>
Seeing this future danger,<br>

with massive shoulders,<br>
renouncing his herd,<br>
lives in the wilds wherever he wants,<br>

I have knowledge arisen,"<br>

<p>
With no greed, no deceit,<br>
no thirst, no hypocrisy -- <br>

<A NAME="fire">like a fire</A> not coming back to what's burnt,<br>
wander alone, a rhinoceros horn.
<p>
Eyes downcast, not footloose,<br>
senses guarded, with protected mind,<br>
not oozing -- not burning -- with lust,<br>
wander alone, a rhinoceros horn.
<p>
Taking off the householder's marks,[<a href="#n2" NAME="2">2</A>]<br>

<p>
Turning your back on pleasure &amp; pain,<br>
as earlier with sorrow &amp; joy,<br>
attaining pure equanimity,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tranquillity,<br>
wander alone, a rhinoceros horn.
<p>
With persistence aroused<br>
for the highest goal's attainment,<br>
with mind unsmeared, not lazy in action,<br>
firm in effort, with steadfastness &amp; strength arisen,<br>
wander alone, a rhinoceros horn.
<p>
Not neglecting seclusion, absorption,<br>
constantly living the Dhamma<br>

comprehending the danger<br>
in states of becoming,<br>
wander alone, a rhinoceros horn.
<p>
Intent on the ending of craving &amp; heedful,<br>
learned, mindful, not muddled,<br>
certain -- having reckoned the Dhamma -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; striving,<br>
wander alone, a rhinoceros horn.
<p>
Unstartled, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A NAME="lion">like a</A> lion at sounds.<br>

Having let go of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; passion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aversion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delusion;<br>
having shattered the fetters;<br>
undisturbed at the ending of life,<br>

Friends without a motive these days<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are rare.<br>
They're shrewd for their own ends, &amp; impure.<br>
Wander alone, a rhinoceros horn.
