<P align=center>The Story.</P></FONT><FONT face=Times_CSX+>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>976. A brahmin of Kosala learned the vedas</P>
<P>Attained no-thingness and came south.</P>
<P>977, During the reign of Aalaka in the Assaka country</P>
<P>He lived on the bank of Godàvari eating leaves and fruits</P>
<P>978. There was a huge village to support him</P>
<P>And out of its income he peformed a sacrifice.</P>
<P>979. On his return after peforming the sacrifice,</P>
<P>Another brahmin entered his hut.</P>
<P>980. Tired, thirsty, with unbrushed teeth and dusty hair,</P>
<P>He approached and begged for five hundred coins.</P>
<P>981. Bàvari seeing him prepared a seat,</P>
<P>Inquired about his health and said:</P>
<P>982. 'Whatever I had to offer is spent,</P>
<P>This is the truth, I haven't five hundred coins'</P>
<P>983. "If this offering is not made, </P>
<P>May your top split in seven on the seventh day."</P>
<P>984. The crafty one cursed and frightened him </P>
<P>Bàvari hearing those words became unhappy</P>
<P>985. He emaciated without food, shot with the arrow of grief.</P>
<P>In that condition he could not concentrate.</P>
<P>986. A god saw him frightened and unhappy,</P>
<P>Desiring his good, approached and said thus:</P>
<P>987. "He does not know the top or its splitting, </P>
<P>Is crafty and only wants money" .</P>
<P>988. " O! good one, tell me,</P>
<P>The top and its splitting"</P>
<P>989. "I too do not know the the top and its splitting,</P>
<P>This knowledge, indeed belongs to the winners."</P>
<P>990. "Then, O! god, tell me, who knows,</P>
<P>About the top and its splitting."</P>
<P>991. "In the past, there was a world leader in Kapilavatthu,</P>
<P>A bright son of the Sàkyas, in the lineage of Okkàka.</P>
<P>992. Brahmin, he is enlightened, gone beyond all things,</P>
<P>Powerful with higher wisdom and wise about all things</P>
<P>And is realeased with the destruction of all endearments.</P>
<P>993. He is all enlightened, blessed, wise, and preaches the Teaching.</P>
<P>Approach him and ask, he will tell you."</P>
<P>994. Bàvari hearing the word 'all enlightened' became very happy,</P>
<P>His grief faded and joy arose to him.</P>
<P>995. Bàvari pleased and over joyed asked that god,</P>
<P>"In which state, village or hamlet, is this leader of the world.</P>
<P>We like to worship the noble, enlightened two footed one"</P>
<P>996. "The wise desireless son of the Sàkyas is in Sàvatthi, in Kosala.</P>
<P>He is wise and knows the splitting of the top"</P>
<P>997. Then he addressed his learned pupils all brahmins.</P>
<P>"Come young men, listen to my words, . </P>
<P>998. Now the all enlightened one is born in the world,</P>
<P>It is something rare, go to Sàvatthi and see the noble two footed one."</P>
<P>999. "O! brahmin, seeing him, how should we know, whether he is 
enlightened,</P>
<P>Tell us how we should know it"</P>
<P>1000."The marks of a Great Man are told in the Vedas,</P>
<P>There are thirty two of them told in order</P>
<P>1001. Whoever has these marks on his body,</P>
<P>Has two alternative behaviours</P>
<P>1002. If he leads a household life, would be a world leader</P>
<P>And would rule rightfully, without any weapons.</P>
<P>1003. If he leaves the household and becomes homeless</P>
<P>Would dispel darkness, become all enlightened and most noble.</P>
<P>1004. First mentally ask my birth, clan and marks of a Great Man,</P>
<P>Then ask about the top and its spllitting.</P>
<P>1005. Enlightened Ones can uncover the covered,</P>
<P>Mentally asked questions would be explained verbally."</P>
<P>1006. The sixteen pupil brahmins of Bàvari,</P>
<P>Ajita, Tissametteyya, punnaka, Mettagu,</P>
<P>1007. Dotaka, Upasiiva, Nanda, Hemaka,</P>
<P>Todeyya and Kappa and Jatukanni the wise one </P>
<P>1008. Badràudha, Udaya, Posala,</P>
<P>Wise Mogharàjà and the great sage Pingiya.</P>
<P>1009. Each with a following and all famous,</P>
<P>Wise concentraters who knew their past births.</P>
<P>1010. They all worshipped Bàvari, circumbulated him</P>
<P>And turned northwards with braided hair. in antelope hide skin dress.</P>
<P>1011. From Aàlaka first to Mahiisa, then Udena,</P>
<P>To Gonadda, Vediisa, Vanasavhya,</P>
<P>1012. To Kosambi, Sàketa, and the noble city Sàvatthi</P>
<P>Setavya, Kapilavatthu and Kusinàrà,</P>
<P>1013. To Pàvà, Boghanagà, Vesàli and Magadha,</P>
<P>And to the pleasant monument Pàsànaka.</P>
<P>1014. Like the thirsty in search of cool water,</P>
<P>Or like a merchant looking for great gain,</P>
<P>Like those overcome by the heat, looking for a shade,</P>
<P>They hurriedly ascended the rock. </P>
<P>1015. The Blessed One that moment was preaching, </P>
<P>Like a lion roaring in the forest. </P>
<P>1016. Ajita saw the shining all enlightened one,</P>
<P>Like the completed moon on the fifteenth day.</P>
<P>1017. Seeing all the marks on his body, </P>
<P>Pleased and standing on a side, asked the questions mentally.</P>
<P>1018. "Of our teacher, tell the age, clan and marks of a Great Man. </P>
<P>How learned is he in the Vedas, and how many brahmins does he teach".</P>
<P>1019."His age a hundred and twenty years and Bàvari by clan,</P>
<P>Has three marks on the body, and is perfect in the three vedas</P>
<P>1020. He instructs five hundred brahmins</P>
<P>In Grammar, History,and the roots and meanings of words". </P>
<P>1021. "Tell the marks on noble Bàvari's body,</P>
<P>And how is his greed, may we be not left in doubt </P>
<P>1022. "Can cover the face with the tongue, has hair between the brows,</P>
<P>The private parts of the body are enclosed in a bag, young men know 
these".</P>
<P>1023. Hearing these replies to unheard questions,</P>
<P>People with clasped hands consider with feelings.</P>
<P>1024. 'Which god, Brahmà, Inda or Sujampati</P>
<P>Asks these questions mentally, to whom are the replies'</P>
<P>1025. "Bàvari asks the top and its splitting,</P>
<P>May the Blessed One dispel the doubts of the sages".</P>
<P>1026. "Know ignorance as the top and science as splitting the top,</P>
<P>Endowd with faith, mindfulness, concentration, interest and effort" </P>
<P>1027 The young men thoroughly satisfied and full of feelings,</P>
<P>Arranged their robes on one shoulder, and put their heads at the feet of the 
Blessed One.</P>
<P>1028. "Good sir, the brahmin Bàvari and his pupils,</P>
<P>Worship the feet of the wise one with pleasure"</P>
<P>1029."May Bàvari and his pupils be with appeased minds,</P>
<P>May you all live long.</P>
<P>1030. If Bàvari or you have any questions to ask,</P>
<P>Now is the time to ask them"</P>
<P>1031. Permission granted by the all Enlightened One,they sat with clasped 
hands,</P>
<P>And Ajita asked the first queston.</P>

<P>"Venerable sir, how could a man, a sage, a warrioor or brahmin</P>

<P>The following of sixteen brahmins were given leave to pose their questions, 
all of which were explained. The explanation to a single question would be 
enough to know the meaning, the Teaching, and fall to the method to end birth 
and death and go beyond. Therefore 'Going Beyond' is a synonym for this 
discourse.</P>

<P>1131.Venerable Pingiya said</P>
<P>The pure wise one preached what he knew</P>
<P>The benefactor is free of sensuality and greed, why should he tell lies.</P>
<P>1132. Now I eulogize and praise him, </P>
<P>He has dispelled blemish, delusion, measuring and hypocrisy.</P>
<P>1133. The all seeing Enlightened One has dispelled darkness. </P>
<P>Has overcome all and gone to the end of the world.</P>
<P>Without desires has dispelled all unpleasantness.</P>
<P>Brahmà honour me, I tell the truth.</P>
<P>1134. Like the birds that leave the nest and go to the forest with much 
fruits</P>
<P>I give up my narrow view and widen like the swan reaching the ocean.</P>
<P>1135. Earlier I said, that the dispensation of Gotama was for the next 
birth</P>
<P>It's all hearsay and developed logical talk.</P>
<P>1136. By birth he is the sun who dispelled darkness seated alone,</P>
<P>Gotama's wisdom is wide like the earth.</P>
<P>1137. He preached for the destruction of craving here and now, and for mental 
well being,</P>
<P>For him, there is no compare.</P>
<P>1138. Pingiya, why do you live away from him even for a moment</P>
<P>He is wise like the earth.</P>
<P>1139. He taught the healthy state of destroyed craving here and now,</P>
<P>And has no compare.</P>
<P>1140. Not that I live away from him. </P>
<P>He is wise like the earth.</P>
<P>1141. He taught the healthy state of destroyed craving here and now</P>
<P>And has no compare.</P>
<P>1142. In my mind's eye, I see the diligent brahmin day and night,</P>
<P>Throughout the night I worship him, I think I'm near him in that manner.</P>
<P>1143. I do not see, faith,,joy, and mindfulness outside the dispensation of 
Gotama,</P>
<P>In whatever direction the wise one is, in that direction I'm bent.</P>
<P>1144. My decayed and disabled body does not turn in that direction.</P>
<P>. My mind and thoughts are constantly engaged there.</P>
<P>1145. Submerged in the mud crying I was landing and floating in turns,</P>
<P>Then I saw the Enlightened One who had crossed over.</P>
<P>1146. As Vakkali, Bhadràvudha and Alavi Gotama were released,</P>
<P>Pingiya, you too attain release through faith, and go beyond the domains of 
death.</P>
<P>1147. "I am very much pleased, hearing the words of the sage.</P>
<P>The Enlightened One has revealed, the arrow pulled out state.</P>
<P>1148. Knowing the highest gods, he taught for the here and hereafter,</P>
<P>The Teacher put an end to the doubts of the learned. </P>
<P>1149. I'm immovable and firm, I have no doubts.</P>
<P>Know me as one released in mind".</P>
