<P align=center>A FOREWORD FOR THE TRANSLATION</P>
<P align=center>OF THE ATTAKA VAGGA </P>
<P align=center>OF THE SUTTA NIPâTA</P></FONT><FONT face=Times_CSX+>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The attaka vagga consists of sixteen suttas which are specifically mentioned 
in various other suttas in the Udàna etcetra. This shows their importance as 
giving the complete Teaching of the Blessed One in a nut-shell. The Udàna speaks 
of bhikkhus who knew all these sixteen suttas by heart together with their 
meanings. The Blessed One applauds those bhikkhus as they would reap the highest 
results when they know those suttas. These suttas deal with difficult aspects of 
the Teaching, such as dependent arising and dependent cessation very clearly and 
precisely. They are the experiences of name and matter contact, being and 
non-being, and how fights and disputes arise and how they cease. These practical 
bits of advice are very important to any buddhist. 'The diffusedness of the 
world' as I translate it so often, is our involvement in the six spheres of 
mental contact, as permanent, agreeable and mine, and it is shown as the cause 
for fights and disputes. Further, arahanta, a buddhist's ideal and aim is 
clearly depicted. The training could start at any of these points, to become a 
worthy one; Arahant. . May this small treatise help many beings to end 
unpleasantness-dukkha </P>

<P align=center>1. Kàma Sutta - On sensuality.</P></FONT><FONT face=Times_CSX+>
<P>766. When sensual desires are satisfied,</P>
<P>The mortal is satisfied.</P>
<P>767. When sensuality degrades, he is oppressed,</P>
<P>As though shot with an arrow,</P>
<P>768. Whoever drives out sensuality, like throwing out a snake with the foot, 
</P>
<P>Overcomes the diffusedness of the world mindfully.</P>
<P>769. That man who has many desires, for fields, wealth, </P>
<P>Gold, cattle, slaves and relations with women.....</P>
<P>770. Is weakened and pressed down by them,</P>
<P>And comes to distress as shipwrecked.</P>
<P>771. Therefore humans, avoid sensuality mindfully,</P>
<P>Cross the floods and sink the boat..</P></FONT><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=5>
<P align=center>2. Guhatthaka Sutta- Concealed in a Cave.</P></FONT><FONT 
face=Times_CSX+>
<P>772. Man immersed in delusion stays protected in a cave;</P>
<P>He is far from seclusion. It is difficult to dispel sensuality.</P>
<P>773. Those 'agreeing to be' are not released, they do not know release, </P>
<P>They recollect the past and wish the future..</P>
<P>774. Humans, greedy and deluded by sensuality, heedlessly go wrong,</P>
<P>Fallen to unpleasantness wail, "Gone from here what will become to me".</P>
<P>775. Therefore train here itself, never do anything wrong knowing,</P>
<P>The wise said that life here is short.</P>
<P>776. I see the populace trembling, caught in the net of craving 'to be'</P>
<P>Not settled about craving to be and not to be, they cry when death comes.</P>
<P>777. Look at those appropriating, throbbing like fish in a dried up pond</P>
<P>Seeing this do not appropriate, be without clingings to be.</P>
<P>778. Check interests in the two extremities, thoroughly know contact free of 
greed</P>
<P>Never do anything, looked down by the wise and do not talk about the seen and 
heard,</P>
<P>779. Cross the flood knowing perception, when seized the sage is not 
soiled,</P>
<P>Be diligent to pull out the arrow, do not wish for this and the other world..

<P align=center>3. Dutthatthaka Sutta The harsh Eight.</P></FONT><FONT 
face=Times_CSX+>
<P>780. One speaks with an evil mind, another with a pure mind,</P>
<P>A sage is not born from a dispute, he has no disputes what so ever.</P>
<P>781. Someone will never overstep his own view, formed with interest and 
liking,</P>
<P>Whatever he knows, that he says.</P>
<P>782. Talking about one's virtues without being asked, is boasting,</P>
<P>It is non- noble and evil.</P>
<P>783. The appeased, extinguished bhikkhu does not say "these are my 
virtues"</P>
<P>He has nothing to boast, it is noble and pure.</P>
<P>784. Of a Teaching arranged, compounded and honoured</P>
<P>The appeasement remains to be tested. It is established through a personal 
experience.</P>
<P>785. Views are not easy to overcome, the Teaching taken as a whole should be 
investigated,</P>
<P>And humans take up and give up views in turns.</P>
<P>786. To the wise there are no arranged views of being and non-being</P>
<P>They give up hypocrisy and measuring, not seizing go beyond.</P>
<P>787. The clinging have a dispute in the Teaching, the not clinging have no 
disputes,</P>
<P>Without a self or even a negated self, are free of all views.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></FONT><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=5>
<P align=center>4. Suddhatthaka Sutta -The pure Eight.</P></FONT><FONT 
face=Times_CSX+>
<P>788. I know the highest healthy purity, which comes to humans as a view,</P>
<P>Knowledge arises seeing through that purity</P>
<P>789 Either the human purifies his view, or knowing dispels 
unpleasantness,</P>
<P>Knowing he purifies with substratum remaining, that view is the starting 
point.</P>
<P>790. No Brahmin declared purity through seeing, hearing, virtues, or an 
experience</P>
<P>Not soiled by merit and demerit, giving up the self view, and ceasing to act, 
he became pure.</P>
<P>791. One gives up and later seizes, with desires one does not cross the 
floods</P>
<P>This is seizing and letting go, like the monkey releasing a branch to hold 
another</P>
<P>792. Perceptive beings observe virtues and reach highs and lows</P>
<P>Knowing the Teaching that comes together in feelings do not reach</P>
<P>highs and lows.</P>
<P>793. Not angry with anybody or anything, open to the seen, heard and 
experienced,</P>
<P>The wise have nothing to think in the world.</P>
<P>794. Do not think this is proper to honour and say this is highest purity</P>
<P>Give up such clingings and thoughts altogether.</P>
<P>795. The Brahmin gone beyond sin, does not say, I know and I see,</P>
<P>He is neither passionate nor angry and takes nothing as highest 
purity.</P></FONT><FONT face=Times_CSX+ size=5>
<P align=center>5. Paramatthaka Sutta. -Upholding a View.</P></FONT><FONT 
face=Times_CSX+>
<P>796. People upholding views say all other's views are low</P>
<P>And they do not go beyond disputes.</P>
<P>797. Seeing some development in oneself, out of a seen, heard, virtues, or an 
experience,</P>
<P>People cling to views and see all other's views as low.</P>
<P>798. The wise said, that, that is the bond, for some reason to see others as 
low</P>
<P>Therefore the bhikkhu should not measure on account of a seen, heard, an 
experience</P>
<P>or virtues.</P>
<P>799. On account of knowledge or virtues do not hold a view as this is 
proper</P>
<P>Do not think, I'm equal, inferior or superior</P>
<P>800. Dispel the self view, do not think, 'I know'</P>
<P>The wise are without disputes and views.</P>
<P>801. Do not wish for the two extremities of being and non-being here, or 
hereafter,</P>
<P>Think discriminately about the Teaching and have no roosting places.</P>
<P>802. Do not have any thoughts or the smallest perception, about the seen, 
heard, and experienced</P>
<P>The Brahmin is without any views and has nothing to think in this world.</P>
<P>803. Do not get established even in the Teaching, and think it is proper to 
honour it,</P>
<P>A Brahmin is not led on by virtues, crossed over, he does not turn back.</P>

<P align=center>6. Jarà Sutta- On Decay.</P></FONT><FONT face=Times_CSX+>
<P>804. Life is very short, before completing a hundred years one dies,</P>
<P>If one out stays that period, he dies of decay.</P>
<P>805. People grieve exacting, yet there is no permanent hold,</P>
<P>There is separation no doubt, seeing this do not live in a household.</P>
<P>806. All man's possessions are abandoned at death,</P>
<P>The wise knowing this, do not possess with affection</P>
<P>807. That which encountered in a dream, is not seen when awake,</P>
<P>Likewise loved ones dead and gone are not seen.</P>
<P>808. What is seen and heard of the dead is called ïame' </P>
<P>To talk of those dead and gone, only name remains.</P>
<P>809. Those greedy to appropriate do not give up selfish grief and 
wailings</P>
<P>The sages give up seizing and abide developing calm.</P>
<P>810. The bhikkhu withdrawn from the crowd and mentally secluded</P>
<P>If he does not experience the self view, that is completion.</P>
<P>811. The sage not settled anywhere, does not make friends or enemies</P>
<P>And selfish grief and wailings do not soil him, like drops of water the lotus 
leaf.</P>
<P>812. The lotus and its leaves are not soiled by drops of water,</P>
<P>Likewise the sage is not soiled by the seen, heard and the experienced.</P>
<P>813. The wise one does not think of the seen, heard and experienced,</P>
<P>He does not desire purity by some other means, he is not attached and</P>
<P>does not lack interest.</P>

<P>814 Venerable Tissametteyya said:</P>
<P>"Venerable sir, you declare destruction to those engaged in sexual 
intercourse,</P>
<P>So, I desire a training in your dispensation"</P>
<P>815. The Blessed One said:</P>
<P>"Those engaged in sexual intercourse, become careless in the 
dispensation,</P>
<P>It is wrong conduct and not noble.</P>
<P>816. A certain one pursued sexual intercourse in the past, and had a 
downfall,</P>
<P>As though driving an uncontrolled vehicle</P>
<P>817. He decreased in fame and praise,</P>
<P>Hearing this train giving up sexual intercourse.</P>
<P>818. Pressed down with thoughts, he thinks like a beggar,</P>
<P>When blamed, has no words</P>
<P>819. When blamed, he also takes a weapon,</P>
<P>That is his greed caught in delusion.</P>
<P>820. Those engaged in sexual intercourse become dull and worried,</P>
<P>Therefore the wise should intend a single life.</P>
<P>821. The sage should know these earlier and later dangers,</P>
<P>And should intend a single life.</P>
<P>822. Train in seclusion, that is the Noble One's path,</P>
<P>By that do not think noble, that is imminence to extinction.</P>
<P>823. The emancipated sage free of sensual desires,</P>
<P>Is envied by the populace greedy for sensuality."</P></FONT><FONT

<P align=center>8. Pasura Sutta- A Debater.</P></FONT><FONT face=Times_CSX+>
<P>824. "'This only is pure, there is no purity in other Teachings'</P>
<P>On whatever it is established, it is an individual truth</P>
<P>825. Desiring a dispute one plunges into a crowd and calls each other a fool 
in turns,</P>
<P>He relies on others to dispute, the wise say they desire praise.</P>
<P>826. In an assembly they debate, desiring praise and fearing blame</P>
<P>When blamed becomes silent and angry and finds faults</P>
<P>827. When crossed questioned and shown short comings in the debate,</P>
<P>Grieve and wail and say 'I'm lost'</P>
<P>828. When debates arise, recluses reach highs and lows,</P>
<P>Seeing this give up debating, indeed, there is no good in praise</P>
<P>829. When praised for debating in a crowd, desires fulfilled,</P>
<P>He laughs reaching the heights</P>
<P>830. That haughtiness is his destruction, it is called conceit,</P>
<P>The wise say there is no purity in it, seeing this avoid disputes.</P>
<P>831. The hero partaking the best food, comes in search of an opponent,</P>
<P>If he is not there, he goes far in search of him.</P>
<P>832. Upholding a view he debates, saying, 'this only is the truth, what you 
say is not found'</P>
<P>A debate gives rise to enemies.</P>
<P>833. Views do not knock on views, they settle amicably,</P>
<P>Hero, what could you gain here, your opponent has no view to uphold.</P>
<P>834. You think and think entangled in a net of views,</P>
<P>The wise see the two ends meet, you cannot proceed.</P></FONT><FONT

<P>835. "Realizing craving, discontentment and greed, interest for sexual 
intercourse did not arise,</P>
<P>I see it as a ball of urine and excreta, and do not desire to touch it even 
with the foot"</P>
<P>836. "If you do not desire this jewel of a woman, aspired by many people and 
kings too,</P>
<P>Let us know your views, virtues, life and aspirations"</P>
<P>837. The Blessed One said:</P>
<P>"Màgandiya, taking the Teaching as a whole and discriminating</P>
<P>And not settled in views on account of a contact, I see internal appeasement 
grow,</P>
<P>And it does not occur to me I say this......"</P>
<P>838. The Brahmin Màgandiya said:</P>
<P>"From arrangements come decisions, the sage relies on decisions</P>
<P>Internal peace and its meaning, how is it explained by the wise."</P>
<P>839. The Blessed One said:</P>
<P>"Màgandiya, not through views, hearsay or knowledge and not by observing 
virtues</P>
<P>Neither is there purity without these</P>
<P>Not seizing these and not supported on appeasement, should not think 'to 
be'</P>
<P>840. The Brahmin Màgandiya said:</P>
<P>"If purity is not through a view, hearsay or knowledge and not by observing 
virtues </P>
<P>And if it is neither without them, I think this a dull Teaching,</P>
<P>For a certain one comes to purity through a view.</P>
<P>841. The Blessed One said:</P>
<P>"On account of views arise doubts, with seizings arise delusion,</P>
<P>Here is not seen the smallest perception, so your Teaching seems to be dull 
and stupid</P>
<P>842. To think I'm equal, superior, or inferior is a dispute,</P>
<P>If you do not think in these three ways, there is no equal or superior</P>
<P>843. To what does the Brahmin say is the 'truth'. or how does he dispute it's 
a 'lie' </P>
<P>When there is no equal or superior, on what is he going to dispute. .</P>
<P>844. The sage wandering homeless, does not make friends in the village</P>
<P>Sensuality given up, uncaring for honourings, disputes over, how could he 
have an arousing.</P>
<P>845. For living in seclusion one should not be honoured as a Great Man, </P>
<P>The thorny stem born in the mud and water is not soiled by them,</P>
<P>Likewise the sage not proud of his appeasement, is not soiled by sensuality 
and the world.</P>
<P>846. The perfected man does not measure and become haughty on account of his 
view or </P>
<P>understanding.</P>
<P>He is not led by actions or hearsay to make settlements.</P>
<P>847. The detached from perceptions have no bonds, the released through wisdom 
have no delusion.</P>
<P>They that value perceptions and views knock about in the world.</P>

<P>848. "I ask noble Gotama, with what views, and what virtues,</P>
<P>Is man said to be appeased."</P>
<P>849. The Blessed One said: </P>
<P>"Do not settle in the past, and do not prepare for the present moment</P>
<P>And do not have preferences.</P>
<P>850. Not angry, not trembling, not boasting, of scrupulously pure 
conduct,</P>
<P>Speak little without pride, that is the sage verbally restrained.</P>
<P>851. Do not grieve the past and entertain wishes for the future</P>
<P>Examine contacts discriminately, do not be led by views.</P>
<P>852. Withdraw without craftiness, malevolence and selfishness,</P>
<P>Do no daring things, do not be contemptible and do not slander</P>
<P>853. Do not run after much pleasures and be not conceited</P>
<P>Teach kindly without faith, yet not lacking interest.</P>
<P>854. Do not teach with intentions of gain, without the gains do not be 
angry,</P>
<P>Do not make enemies on account of greed and be not fond of tastes.</P>
<P>855. Always mindful of equanimity do not think,</P>
<P>I'm equal, superior, or inferior, have no specials.</P>
<P>856. Know the unsettling Teaching and make no settlements,</P>
<P>Do not crave for 'being' or ïon-being'.</P>
<P>857. He that does not desire sensuality is appeased,</P>
<P>Crossed the diffusedness of the world, has no bonds.</P>
<P>858. He has no sons, cattle, fields, or wealth,</P>
<P>And does not gain anything on account of an ownership or non-ownership.</P>
<P>859. Whatever he is called an ordinary one, a recluse, or Brahmin,</P>
<P>He is not estimated and does not dispute it.</P>
<P>860. Free of greed and selfishness, the sage is not proud</P>
<P>Among equals or unequals does not seek suitability.</P>

non-being'.</P>
<P>902. To the anxious are yearnings, to those who feel are plans,</P>
<P>If there is no passing away or arising, how is there a feeling, where is a 
plan.</P>
<P>903. "To what one said was the 'highest Teaching' , by another was said 
low,</P>
<P>Out of this dispute which is right, all these are clever words.</P>
<P>904. One's Teaching is complete, another's incomplete, it was said,</P>
<P>Thus arise a dispute, one's own opinion is true, it was said.</P>
<P>905. In the Teachings of those who revile others' Teachings, there is no 
special quality,</P>
<P>The belief of another in a personal matter, to hold it stubbornly is 
debasing.</P>
<P>906. Offerings done to the good Teaching and such things boost the self,</P>
<P>All disputes confirm 'being' , each one's purity is a personal matter.</P>
<P>907. Disputes should be overcome, by discriminating the Teaching taken as a 
whole,</P>
<P>A Brahmin has no outside leading, and he does not see another Teaching as 
superior.</P>
<P>908. 'I know, I see, it is that,' one comes to purity with this view,</P>
<P>He may have seen, what does it matter, he declares purity clinging 
greedily.</P>
<P>909. The description of a person who has seen ïame and matter',</P>
<P>Shows that there is a little or much sensuality in it, the wise see no purity 
in it.</P>
<P>910. To declare with certainty a pre thought view is not purity,</P>
<P>Settled on whatever some praise is done, there it self the flaw is shown.</P>
<P>911. A Brahmin, one with right view, or one released knowing is not born out 
of a definition,</P>
<P>They abide with equanimity learning the short comings of the ordinary. </P>
<P>912. The sage without bonds has no disputes among the disputing,</P>
<P>Appeased among the unappeased, abides, not seizing, but learning others</P>
<P>913. The wise one freed from the net of views has given up earlier desires 
and does not</P>
<P>make new ones,</P>
<P>Talking interestedly and assuredly, does not loathe the no-self view .</P>
<P>914. Free of thoughts that arise from the seen, heard and experienced,</P>
<P>The sage released from the load does not seek suitability or anything 
else"</P>

<P>915. "I ask the extinguished, secluded, Great Sage, the kinsman of the 
Sun</P>
<P>How does the bhikkhu extinguish not holding to anything in the world"</P>
<P>916. "The thought 'I be' causes the delay in the diffusedness of the world, 
uproot it.</P>
<P>And constantly train mindfully to dispel the craving for the self.</P>
<P>917. Internally or externally do not settle on anything knowing,</P>
<P>Great Beings ùay, that settlement is not extinction. </P>
<P>918. On account of it do not think superior, inferior or even equal,</P>
<P>Touched variously by matter, do not think selfishly.</P>
<P>919. Constantly appease the self, there is no other way to attain 
extinction,</P>
<P>To the internally appeased, there is neither a self view nor a negated self 
view .</P>
<P>920. In the middle of the ocean, there being no waves stillness pervades,</P>
<P>Likewise the bhikkhu standing still makes no characteristics.</P>
<P>921. The open mind is praiseworthy, the Teaching undoubtedly drives out 
trouble,</P>
<P>To tell the best method, either observe the higher code, or concentrate.</P>
<P>922. Cast no greedy glances, protect the ears from low talk,</P>
<P>Do not be greedy for tastes and do not appropriate anything in the world.</P>
<P>923. Touched by a contact the bhikkhu does not wail for any reason, </P>
<P>Do not muse 'to be' and do not be moved by great fear.</P>
<P>924. Gaining eatables, drinks, nourishments and clothes</P>
<P>Do not accumulating them, not gaining them do not grieve.</P>
<P>925. The meditator is not fond of travel and if necessary is not restless and 
negligent,</P>
<P>So on seat and bed abides silently.</P>
<P>926. Not fond of sleep be wakeful to dispel demerit,</P>
<P>Dispel laziness, craftiness, laughter, play, sexual desires, and self 
adornment. </P>
<P>927. Do no witch craft, reading dreams, signs and the constellation,</P>
<P>If you love yourself do not medicate to bring about an abortion.</P>
<P>928. Blamed the bhikkhu does not feel, praised is not elated</P>
<P>He dispels greed, selfishness, anger and slandering..</P>
<P>929 The bhikkhu does not tolerate buying and selling, does not blame anybody. 
for anything,</P>
<P>Does not make enemies in the village, and does not speak to people with 
intentions </P>
<P>of gain.</P>
<P>930. The bhikkhu has no discourses, does not talk useless words,</P>
<P>Does not train unruly ones and talking does not make enemies.</P>
<P>931. Does not tell lies, and knowing does no crafty things,</P>
<P>And on account of life, wisdom, virtues or knowledge does not degrade 
another.</P>
<P>932. Hearing a lot of angry words from recluses or many others,</P>
<P>Does not retort, the appeased do not make enemies.</P>
<P>933. Knowing this Teaching, the bhikkhu constantly trains mindfully with 
discrimination,</P>
<P>Knowing that 'appeasement' is extinction is diligent in the dispensation of 
Gotama.</P>
<P>934. The not attained, will be attained, the Teaching is the eye-witness, I 
see the healthy state,</P>
<P>Therefore train in the dispensation of the Blessed One diligently with 
reverence".</P>

<P>935. "Men with sticks in hand at the horse sacrifice arouse fear,</P>
<P>I appreciate the religious anxiety that overcame me, on account of that.</P>
<P>936. Seeing the frightened people, hostile to each other, like fish in little 
water,</P>
<P>I was overcome with fear.</P>
<P>937. The world is completely coreless, all directions are whirling,</P>
<P>It was impossible that the desires of the self could prevail.</P>
<P>938. As the hostility ended, I became dispassionate,</P>
<P>Then I saw the arrow difficult to be seen, struck in the heart.</P>
<P>939. Shot by that arrow, all directions move,</P>
<P>When the arrow is pulled out, the directions do not move, they settle.</P>
<P>940. Then follow songs for the training.:</P>
<P>Do not be attached to the bonds in the world, Give up all sensuality,</P>
<P>Train to extinguish the self.</P>
<P>941. Be truthful, not daring, not crafty and not slandering,</P>
<P>Overcome anger, evil greed and doubts.</P>
<P>942. Do not tolerate sleepiness, laziness, sloth and negligence,</P>
<P>The man with a mind to extinguish does not tolerate conceit. </P>
<P>943. Do not tell lies, do not worry about the body </P>
<P>Thoroughly know conceit, and earnestly abide dispassionate.</P>
<P>944 Do not delight the past, do not make new acquaintances</P>
<P>Left alone do not grieve, and make no settlements in space.</P>
<P>945. Greed I say is a "flood" and thoughts I say is "foam"</P>
<P>It is difficult to cross the mud of sensuality, when a settlement is 
made.</P>
<P>947. Knowing he is perfected, learning the Teaching which is not 
supported,</P>
<P>He deports himself rightfully in the world not desiring anything.</P>
<P>948. He that overcomes the bond sensuality, difficult to overcome,</P>
<P>Has cut the stream, loosened the bonds, is griefless and without anxiety.</P>
<P>949. Earlier defilements dried up, later there's none</P>
<P>Not seizing the middle, he abides appeased.</P>
<P>950 In all name and matter, if one has nothing to appropriate</P>
<P>And does not grieve on account of it, indeed, there is nothing to decay.</P>
<P>951. He has no possessions, and is not defiled on account of another's </P>
<P>Not feeling on account of a self, does not grieve 'I have nothing'.</P>
<P>952. Not cruel, not greedy, firm in all circumstances</P>
<P>I declare these good results to the steady one, when asked.</P>
<P>953. Those known as steady, have no accumulations what-so-ever,</P>
<P>Are dispassionate, with aroused effort, and appeased in all 
circumstances.</P>
<P>954. The sage does not talk words of equality, inferiority or superiority</P>
<P>Appeased and not selfish, does not give and does not throw away.</P>

<P>955. Venerable Sàriputta said:</P>
<P>"I have not seen or heard of anyone before this who speaks good words,</P>
<P>Come from the company of the happy ones.</P>
<P>956. The world together with the gods think that the wise one,</P>
<P>Dispelled darkness by himself, unattached.</P>
<P>957. O! unattached, truthful, Enlightened One come from that company,</P>
<P>We have a question to ask in which many are interested.</P>
<P>958. To a bhikkhu developing loathsomeness, on a lonely seat, at the root of 
a tree,</P>
<P>In a cemetery , in a mountain cave, or on high and low beds,.....</P>
<P>959. How many fears are there, which the bhikkhu would not experience,</P>
<P>On a bed without reproach</P>
<P>960. How many are the risks to the bhikkhu seeking the deathless,</P>
<P>Which the bhikkhu overcomes on a jungle seat or bed.</P>
<P>961. How many are the dangers, how many the pastures,</P>
<P>And what are the religious obligations to a resolute bhikkhu.</P>
<P>962. Training in which manner, would the bhikkhu be one pointed, clever and 
mindful,</P>
<P>To dispel his defilements, as the goldsmith the impurities"</P>
<P>963. The Blessed One said:</P>
<P>"Sàriputta, I will explain the method, to one desiring enlightenment,</P>
<P>On a pleasant lonely seat or bed, according the Teaching, I know.</P>
<P>964. The resolute mindful bhikkhu, does not fear these five,</P>
<P>Insect bites, creeping things, human contacts, and the four footed.</P>
<P>965. Adherents of other sects too would not be feared, seeing even their 
fearful ways,</P>
<P>Gradually overcoming these troubles, would be seeking the meritorious.</P>
<P>966. Endures illnesses, and pangs of hunger and extreme cold and heat, </P>
<P>Touched by them the homeless one makes much effort to overcome them.</P>
<P>967. Not stealing, not telling lies, touches the infirm and the firm with 
lovingkindness,</P>
<P>When he knows any agitation in the mind, dispels it as a factor of Death.</P>
<P>968. Not overcome by anger and conceit, digs them out even from the 
roots.</P>
<P>And considers that the dear and the not dear are fellow existants.</P>
<P>969. Honouring wisdom and the right pleasure, drives out these troubles,</P>
<P>The dissatisfied on jungle beds, have four kinds of laments.</P>
<P>970. "What shall I eat, where shall I eat, slept badly, where shall I sleep 
to-night."</P>
<P>These thoughts are wailings, the homeless trainer should dispel them.</P>
<P>971. Gaining food and clothes at the right time, know the amount to 
accept,</P>
<P>Protect the ears while walking in the village, aroused do not talk roughly 
</P>
<P>972. Eyes turned down, not fond of travel, concentrated and well awake,</P>
<P>Concentrated, with equanimity and aroused effort, dispel. doubts 
logically.</P>
<P>973. Verbally accused is mindful and pleasant, helps co-associates to enter 
the </P>
<P>stream of the Teaching.,</P>
<P>Does not talk good words too long, and does not care for gossip.</P>
<P>974.. Further, there are five attachments to the world, which should be 
dispelled by</P>
<P>mindful training.</P>
<P>They are the greed for forms, sounds, tastes, smells and touches.</P>
<P>975. Dispelling interests for these things, the bhikkhu is well released 
mindfully,</P>
<P>Taking time examines the good Teaching, and abiding alone he dispels 
darkness."</P>
<P>said the Blessed One. </P>
