<blockquote>
"I see the pure, the supreme,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; free from disease.<br>
It's in connection<br>
with what's seen<br>
that a person's purity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is."[<a HREF="#n4-1" NAME="4-1">1</A>]
<p>
Understanding thus,<br>
having known the "supreme,"<br>
&amp; remaining focused<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on purity,<br>
one falls back on that knowledge.<br>
If it's in connection<br>
with what is seen<br>
that a person's purity is,<br>
or if stress is abandoned<br>
in connection with knowledge,<br>
then a person with acquisitions<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is purified<br>
in connection with something else,[<a HREF="#n4-2" NAME="4-2">2</A>]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for his view reveals that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the way he asserts it.
<p>
No brahmin[<a HREF="#n4-3" NAME="4-3">3</A>]<br>
says purity<br>
comes in connection<br>
with anything else.<br>
Unsmeared with regard<br>
to what's &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seen, heard, sensed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; precepts or practices,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; merit or evil,<br>
not creating<br>
anything here,<br>
he's let go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of what he had embraced,<br>
he's let go of self.
<p>
Abandoning what's first,<br>
they depend on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what's next.[<a HREF="#n4-4" NAME="4-4">4</A>]<br>
Following distraction,<br>
they don't cross over attachment.<br>
<A NAME="monkey">They</A> embrace &amp; reject<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- like a monkey releasing a branch<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to seize at another[<a HREF="#n4-5" NAME="4-5">5</A>] -- <br>
a person undertaking practices on his own,<br>
goes high &amp; low,<br>
latched onto perception.<br>
But having clearly known<br>
through vedas,[<a HREF="#n4-6" NAME="4-6">6</A>] having encountered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Dhamma,<br>
one of profound discernment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; high &amp; low.
<p>
He's enemy-free[<a HREF="#n4-7" NAME="4-7">7</A>]<br>
with regard to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all things<br>
seen, heard, or sensed.<br>
By whom, with what,[<a HREF="#n4-8" NAME="4-8">8</A>]<br>
should he<br>
be pigeonholed<br>
here in the world?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- one who has seen in this way,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who goes around<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open.[<a HREF="#n4-9" NAME="4-9">9</A>]
<p>
They don't conjure, don't yearn,<br>
don't proclaim "utter purity."<br>
Untying the tied-up knot of grasping,<br>
they don't form a desire for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thing<br>
at all in the world.
<p>
The brahmin<br>
gone beyond territories,[<a HREF="#n4-10" NAME="4-10">10</A>]<br>
has nothing that<br>
-- on knowing or seeing -- <br>
he's grasped.<br>
Unimpassionate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for passion,<br>
not impassioned &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for dis-,[<a HREF="#n4-11" NAME="4-11">11</A>]<br>
he has nothing here<br>
that's he's grasped as supreme.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
<b><A NAME="n4-1">1</A>.</b> An ancient Indian belief, dating back to the Vedas, was that the sight of certain things or beings was believed to purify. Thus "in connection with what's seen" here means both that purity is brought about by means of seeing such a sight, and that one's purity is measured in terms of having such a sight. This belief survives today in the practice of <i>darshan.</i>

<p>
<b><A NAME="n4-2">2</A>.</b> In other words, if purity were simply a matter of seeing or knowing something, a person could be pure in this sense and yet still have acquisitions (= defilements), which would not be true purity.
<!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<A HREF="#4-2">Go back</A>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END -->
<p>
<b><A NAME="n4-3">3</A>.</b> "Brahmin" in the Buddhist sense, i.e., a person born in any caste who has become an arahant.
<!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<A HREF="#4-3">Go back</A>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END -->
<p>
<b><A NAME="n4-4">4</A>.</b> Nd.I: Leaving one teacher and going to another; leaving one teaching and going to another. This phrase may also refer to the mind's tendency to leave one craving to go to another.
<!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<A HREF="#4-4">Go back</A>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END -->
<p>
<b><A NAME="n4-5">5</A>.</b> "Like a monkey releasing a branch to seize at another" -- an interesting example of a whole phrase that functions as a "lamp," i.e., modifying both the phrase before it and the phrase after it.
<!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<A HREF="#4-5">Go back</A>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END -->
<p>
<b><A NAME="n4-6">6</A>.</b> Vedas -- Just as the word "brahmin" is used in a Buddhist sense above, here the word <i>veda</i> is given a Buddhist sense. According to the Commentary, in this context it means the knowledge accompanying four transcendent paths: the paths to stream-entry, once-returning, non-returning, and arahantship.

<p>
<b><A NAME="n4-7">7</A>.</b> Nd.I: The enemies here are the armies of Mara -- all unskillful mental qualities. For a detailed inventory of the armies of Mara, see <A HREF="snp3-2.html">Sn III.2</A>.

<b><A NAME="n4-8">8</A>.</b> By whom, with what -- two meanings of the one Pali word, <i>kena.</i>
<!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<A HREF="#4-8">Go back</A>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END -->
<p>
<b><A NAME="n4-9">9</A>.</b> Nd.I: "Open" means having a mind not covered or concealed by craving, defilement, or ignorance. This image is used in <A HREF="../udana/ud5-5.html">Ud V.5</A>. It is in contrast to the image discussed in <A HREF="snp4-2.html#n2-1">note 1 to Sn IV.2</A>. An alternative meaning here might be having one's eyes open.

<p>
<b><A NAME="n4-10">10</A>.</b> Nd.I: "Territories" = the ten fetters <i>(samyojana)</i> and seven latent tendencies <i>(anusaya).</i>
<!-- TXT_CUT_START -->[<A HREF="#4-10">Go back</A>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END -->
<p>
<b><A NAME="n4-11">11</A>.</b> Nd.I: "Passion" = sensuality; "dispassion" = the jhana states that bring about dispassion for sensuality.
