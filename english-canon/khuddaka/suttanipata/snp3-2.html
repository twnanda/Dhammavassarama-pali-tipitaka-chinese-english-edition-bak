<blockquote>
To me -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resolute in exertion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; near the river Nera&ntilde;jara,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; making a great effort,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doing jhana<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to attain rest from the yoke --
<p>
<A NAME="namuci">Namuci</A>[<a HREF="#n1" NAME="1">1</a>] came,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speaking words of compassion:<br>
"You are ashen, thin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Death is in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your presence.<br>
Death <br>
has 1,000 parts of you.<br>
Only one part <br>
is your life.<br>
Live, good sir! <br>
Life is better.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alive,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you can do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acts of merit.<br>
Your living the holy life,<br>
performing the fire sacrifice,<br>
will heap up much merit.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What use is exertion to you?<br>
Hard to follow<br>
-- the path of exertion -- <br>
hard to do, hard<br>
to sustain."
<p>
Saying these verses,<br>
Mara stood in the Awakened One's presence.<br>
And to that Mara, speaking thus,<br>
the Blessed One said this:
<p>
"Kinsman of the heedless,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evil One,<br>
come here for whatever purpose:<br>
I haven't, for merit,<br>
even the least bit of need.<br>
Those who have need of merit:<br>
those are the ones<br>
Mara's fit to address.
<p>
In me are &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conviction,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; austerity,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; persistence,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discernment.<br>
Why, when I'm so resolute <br>
do you petition me <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to live?<br>
This wind could burn up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even river currents.<br>
Why, when I'm resolute<br>
shouldn't my blood dry away?<br>
As my blood dries up<br>
gall &amp; phlegm dry up.<br>
As muscles waste away,<br>
the mind grows clearer;<br>
mindfulness, discernment,<br>
concentration stand <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more firm.<br>
Staying in this way,<br>
attaining the ultimate feeling,[<a HREF="#n2" NAME="2">2</a>]<br>
the mind has no interest <br>
in sensual passions.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a being's <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; purity!
<p>
Sensual passions are your first army.<br>
Your second &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is called Discontent.<br>
Your third &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is Hunger &amp; Thirst.<br>
Your fourth &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is called Craving.<br>
Fifth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is Sloth &amp; Torpor.<br>
Sixth &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is called Terror.<br>
Your seventh &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is Uncertainty.<br>
Hypocrisy &amp; Stubbornness, your eighth.<br>
Gains, Offerings, Fame, &amp; Status<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrongly gained,<br>
and whoever would praise self<br>
&amp; disparage others.
<p>
That, Namuci, is your army,<br>
the Dark One's commando force.<br>
A coward can't defeat it,<br>
but one having defeated it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gains bliss.<br>
<A NAME="munja">Do</A> <i>I</i> carry mu&ntilde;ja grass?[<a HREF="#n3" NAME="3">3</a>]<br>
I spit on my life.<br>
Death in battle woud be better for me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than that I, defeated,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; survive.
<p>
Sinking here, they don't appear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some priests &amp; contemplatives.<br>
They don't know the path<br>
by which those with good practices<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go.
<p>
Seeing the bannered force<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on all sides -- <br>
the troops, Mara <br>
along with his mount -- <br>
I go into battle.<br>
May they not budge me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my spot.<br>
That army of yours,<br>
that the world with its devas<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can't overcome,<br>
<A NAME="pot">I will smash</A> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with discernment -- <br>
as an unfired pot &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with a stone.
<p>
Making &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my resolve mastered,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mindfulness well-established,<br>
I will go about, from kingdom to kingdom,<br>
training many disciples.<br>
They -- heedful, resolute<br>
doing my bidding -- <br>
despite your wishes, will go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where, having gone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there's no grief."
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>Mara:</i>
<blockquote>
"For seven years, I've dogged<br>
the Blessed One's steps,<br>
but haven't gained an opening<br>
in the One Self-awakened<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; glorious.<br>
A crow circled a stone<br>
the color of fat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- 'Maybe I've found<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; something tender here.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe there's something delicious' -- <br>
but not getting anything delicious there,<br>
the crow went away.<br>
Like the crow attacking the rock,<br>
I weary myself with Gotama."
<p>
As he was overcome with sorrow,<br>
his lute fell from under his arm.<br>
Then he, the despondent spirit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disappeared.

<p>
<b><A NAME="n3">3</A>.</b> Mu&ntilde;ja grass was the ancient Indian equivalent of a white flag. A warrior expecting that he might have to surrender would take mu&ntilde;ja grass into battle with him. If he did surrender, he would lie down with the mu&ntilde;ja grass in his mouth. The Buddha, in asking this rhetorical question, is indicating that he is not the type of warrior who would carry mu&ntilde;ja grass. If defeated, he would rather die than surrender.
