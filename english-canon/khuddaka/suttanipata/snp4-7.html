"Tell the danger, dear sir,<br>
for one given over<br>
to sexual intercourse.<br>
Having heard your teaching,<br>
we'll train in seclusion."

<i>The Buddha:</i>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"In one given over<br>
to sexual intercourse,<br>
the teaching's confused<br>
and he practices wrongly:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this is ignoble<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in him.<br>
Whoever once went alone,<br>
but then resorts<br>
to sexual intercourse<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- like a carriage out of control -- <br>
is called vile in the world,<br>
a person run-of-the-mill.<br>
His earlier honor &amp; dignity:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lost.<br>
Seeing this,<br>
he should train himself<br>
to abandon sexual intercourse.
<p>
Overcome by resolves,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he broods<br>
like a miserable wretch.<br>
Hearing the scorn of others,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he's chagrined.<br>
He makes weapons,<br>
attacked by the words of others.<br>
This, for him, is a great entanglement.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sinks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; into lies.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They thought him wise<br>
when he committed himself<br>
to the life alone,<br>
but now that he's given<br>
to sexual intercourse<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they declare him a fool.
<p>
Seeing these drawbacks, the sage<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; here -- before &amp; after -- <br>
stays firm in the life alone;<br>
doesn't resort to sexual intercourse;<br>
would train himself<br>
in seclusion -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this, for the noble ones, is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; supreme.<br>
He wouldn't, because of that,<br>
think himself<br>
better than others:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>He's</i> on the verge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of Unbinding.
<p>
People enmeshed<br>
in sensual pleasures,<br>
envy him: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; free,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a sage<br>
leading his life<br>
unconcerned for sensual pleasures<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- one who's crossed over the flood."
