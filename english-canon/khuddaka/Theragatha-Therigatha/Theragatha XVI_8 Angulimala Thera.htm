<DIV class=verse><PRE>He who once lived in negligence
And then is negligent no more,
He's the one who brightens this world
 — Like the moon released from a cloud.

Who follows up with wholesome deeds
Unwholesome deeds he may have done,
He's the one who brightens this world
 — Like the moon released from a cloud.

Indeed that youthful bhikkhu who
Pours himself into the Buddha's teaching,
He's the one who brightens this world
 — Like the moon released from a cloud.

<DIV class=notes><B>Translator's note</B> 
<DIV class=note>
<P>Of all the monks and nuns who awakened under the guidance of the Buddha, none 
was more notorious than the author of these verses, the robber and murderer 
Angulimala. Originally named Ahimsaka (the harmless one), he was the son of the 
brahmin chaplain to the Kosala king and became a brilliant student in the 
medical school at Takkasila. On account of a number of intrigues perpetrated by 
his jealous classmates, he set upon a course of ambushing victims on the road 
and cutting off their thumbs in order to assemble a "garland of thumbs" which is 
the translation of his monastic name Angulimala.</P>
<P>The Buddha fearlessly confronted the robber and helped him to see the error 
of his ways. Then, in the face of tremendous opposition from the population, he 
allowed Angulimala to join the Sangha, and in due time he became an awakened 
Arahant. The karma of his previous deeds still followed him, however, and he was 
later stoned in the street by an angry mob. Coming into the teacher's presence 
"with blood running from his cut head, with his bowl broken, and with his outer 
robe torn," the Buddha simply said, "Bear it! brahmin, Bear it! You are 
experiencing here and now the result of [your] deeds..."</P>
<P>It is within this context that the above verses were composed. The author is 
clearly referring to his own emergence from negligence and unwholesome deeds 
into a wiser and more wholesome understanding. I cannot help but feel this story 
is timely, whether referring to individuals who have committed terrible deeds 
yet being capable of radical transformation, or to a nation looking more closely 
at its impact in the world. The goodness that fills our world may well be poised 
to emerge, like the bright moon, from behind the clouds which far too often 
obscure it.</P></DIV></DIV><!-- #bbinclude "c.footer.html" --><!-- =============================================================== --><!-- THE TEXT BELOW IS AUTOMAGICALLY GENERATED FROM AN INCLUDE FILE. --><!-- robots content="none" -->
