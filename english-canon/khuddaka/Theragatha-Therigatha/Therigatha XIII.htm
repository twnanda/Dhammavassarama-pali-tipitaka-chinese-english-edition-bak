<BLOCKQUOTE>Black was my hair<BR>-- the color of bees -- <BR>&amp; curled at 
  the tips;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with age, it looked like coarse hemp.<BR>The 
  truth of the Truth-speaker's words<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  doesn't change. 
  <P>Fragrant, like a perfumed basket<BR>filled with flowers: my 
  coiffure.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age it smelled 
  musty,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like animal fur.<BR>The truth of the 
  Truth-speaker's words<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change. 

  <P>Thick &amp; lush, like a well-tended grove,<BR>made splendid, the tips 
  elaborate<BR>with comb &amp; pin.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, it grew 
  thin<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; bare here &amp; there.<BR>The truth of the 
  Truth-speaker's words<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change. 

  <P>Adorned with gold &amp; delicate pins,<BR>it was splendid, ornamented with 
  braids.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, with age,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that head 
  has gone bald.<BR>The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change. 
  <P>Curved, as if well-drawn by an artist,<BR>my brows were once 
  splendid.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, they droop down in folds.<BR>The 
  truth of the Truth-speaker's words<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  doesn't change. 
  <P>Radiant, brilliant like jewels,<BR>my eyes: elongated, black -- deep 
  black.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, they're no longer splendid.<BR>The 
  truth of the Truth-speaker's words<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change. 
  <P>Like that of a cuckoo in the dense jungle,<BR>flitting through deep forest

  tubers.<BR>The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change. 
  <P>Swelling, round, firm, &amp; high,<BR>both my breasts were once 
  splendid.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the drought of old age, they 
  dangle<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like empty old water bags.<BR>The truth of the 
  Truth-speaker's words<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change. 

  <P>Like a sheet of gold, well-burnished,<BR>my body was 
  splendid.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it's covered with very fine 
  wrinkles.<BR>The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change. 
  <P>Smooth in their lines, like an elephant's trunk,<BR>both my thighs were

  bamboo.<BR>The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change. 
  <P>Adorned with gold &amp; delicate anklets,<BR>my calves were once 
  splendid.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, they're like sesame sticks.<BR>The

<BLOCKQUOTE>"I was a child, with clean clothes,<BR>when I first heard the 
  Dhamma.<BR>And within me, heedful,<BR>was a break-through to the 
  truth.<BR>Then I arrived <BR>at an enormous dissatisfaction<BR>with all 
  sensuality.<BR>Seeing the danger <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in self-identity,<BR>I 
  longed only <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for renunciation.<BR>Leaving my circle of 
  relatives,<BR>slaves, workers, <BR>prosperous villages &amp; 
  fields,<BR>delightful, enticing possessions,<BR>I went forth,<BR>abandoning 
  not-insignificant wealth. 
  <P>Having gone out through conviction<BR>in the well-taught true Dhamma,<BR>it 
  wouldn't be proper for me -- <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aspiring to nothingness -- 
  <BR>having cast off gold &amp; silver<BR>to take them back.<BR>Gold &amp; 
  silver <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; don't buy Awakening,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; don't 
  buy peace.<BR>This [gold] isn't proper for contemplatives.<BR>This isn't noble 
  wealth.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is<BR>greediness, intoxication, 
  <BR>delusion, bondage to dust, <BR>suspicion, many troubles.<BR>There's no 
  lasting stability here.<BR>It's to this extent that many, many 
  men<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- heedless, their hearts defiled -- <BR>opposing 
  one another, create <BR>conflicts, murder, bondage,<BR>calamity, loss, grief, 
  &amp; lamentation.<BR>Many misfortunes are seen<BR>for those head-over-heels 
  in sensuality.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, my relatives:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Why do you, like enemies, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; try to bind me to 
  sensuality?<BR>You know I've gone forth,<BR>seeing the danger in 
  sensuality.<BR>Gold coin &amp; bullion<BR>can't put an end to 
  fermentations.<BR>Sensuality is an enemy,<BR>a murderer,<BR>hostile, arrows 
  &amp; bonds.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, my relatives:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why 
  do you, like enemies, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; try to bind me to 
  sensuality?<BR>You know I've gone forth <BR>with shaven head, wrapped in a 
  patchwork cloak.<BR>Leftover alms-scraps, gleanings,<BR>a robe made from 
  cast-off cloth:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>That's</I> what's proper for me -- 
  <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the requisites of one with no home.<BR>The great seers 
  have rejected sensuality,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; both human &amp; 
  divine.<BR>Released are they, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the place of 
  security.<BR>Arrived are they, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in unshakeable ease. 
  <P>So may I not come into union <BR>with sensuality, in which no shelter is 
  found.<BR>It's an enemy, a murderer<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- sensuality -- 
  <BR>painful, like a mass of flame.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greed: <BR>an 
  obstacle, fearful, threatened,<BR>full of thorns,<BR>very out-of-tune,<BR>a 
  great cause of delusion.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sensuality:<BR>a frightening 
  attack,<BR>like a snake's head<BR>in which fools delight -- <BR>blinded, 
  run-of-the-mill. 
  <P>Because many people in the world<BR>are stuck in the mud of 
  sensuality,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unknowing,<BR>they don't realize the end of 
  birth &amp; death.<BR>Many people follow the path <BR>to bad 
  destinations<BR>because of sensuality,<BR>bringing disease on themselves. 
  <P>Thus sensuality creates enemies.<BR>It burns, is defiled.<BR>It's the bait 
  of the world,<BR>constraining, the bondage of death,<BR>maddening, deceptive, 
  agitating the mind.<BR>It's a net cast by <A name=mara5>Mara</A><BR>for the 
  defilement of living beings:<BR>with endless drawbacks, much 
  pain,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; great poison, <BR>giving little enjoyment, 
  creating conflict,<BR>drying up the good side [of the mind].<BR>I, having 
  caused much trouble like this<BR>because of sensuality,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  will not return to it,<BR>as I always delight in Unbinding.<BR>Doing battle 
  with sensuality<BR>in hopes of the cool state,<BR>I will stay heedful, finding 
  delight<BR>in the ending of fetters.<BR>I follow the path -- 
  <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eightfold, straight,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; griefless, 
  stainless, secure -- <BR>over which great seers<BR>have crossed." 
  <P>See this Subha, the goldsmith's daughter,<BR>standing firm in the 
  Dhamma,<BR>entering the imperturbable state,[<A
