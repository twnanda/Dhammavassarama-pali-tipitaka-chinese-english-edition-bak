Rouse yourselves.

Apply yourselves
to the Awakened One's bidding.
Scatter the army of Death

a shed made of reeds.

to the world of the hungry shades;

in the pain of the animal womb;
	enjoyed
the human state;
went to heaven

settled in the elements of form,
the elements of formlessness,
neither-perception, perception-less.
