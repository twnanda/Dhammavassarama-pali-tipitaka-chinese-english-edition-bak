<BLOCKQUOTE>In a lowly family I was born,<BR>poor, with next to no food.<BR>My 
  work was degrading:<BR>I gathered the spoiled,<BR>the withered flowers from 
  shrines<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and threw them away.<BR>People found me 
  disgusting,<BR>despised me, disparaged me.<BR>Lowering my heart,<BR>I showed 
  reverence to many. 
  <P>Then I saw the One Self-awakened,<BR>arrayed with a squadron of 
  monks,<BR>the Great Hero, entering the city,<BR>supreme, of the 
  Magadhans.<BR>Throwing down my carrying pole,<BR>I approached him to do 
  reverence.<BR>He ¡X the supreme man ¡X stood still<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out of 
  sympathy<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for me.<BR>After 
  paying homage<BR>to the feet of the teacher,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stood to 
  one side<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; requested the Going Forth from 
  him,<BR>supreme among all living beings.<BR>The compassionate 
  Teacher,<BR>sympathetic to all the world, said:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come, 
  monk."<BR>That was my formal Acceptance. 
  <P>Alone, I stayed in the wilds,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; untiring,<BR>I followed 
  the Teacher's words,<BR>just as he, the Conqueror, had taught me. 
  <P>In the first watch of the night,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recollected 
  previous lives;<BR>in the middle watch,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; purified the 
  divine eye;<BR>in the last,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; burst the mass of darkness. 
  <P>Then, as night was ending<BR>&amp; the sun returning,<BR><A 
  name=indra>Indra</A> &amp; <A name=brahma>Brahma</A> came to pay homage to 
  me,<BR>hands palm-to-palm at their hearts:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Homage to 
  you, O thoroughbred of men,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Homage to you, O man 
  supreme,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whose fermentations are 
  ended.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You, dear sir, are worthy of offerings." 
  <P><A name=smile>Seeing me,</A> arrayed with a squadron of devas,<BR>the 
  Teacher smiled &amp; said:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Through austerity, 
  celibacy,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; restraint, &amp; 
  self-control:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's how one is a 
  brahman.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is a brahman supreme." </P></BLOCKQUOTE><!-- #bbinclude "footer.html" --><!-- THE TEXT BELOW IS AUTOMAGICALLY GENERATED FROM AN INCLUDE FILE. --><!-- robots content="none" -->
