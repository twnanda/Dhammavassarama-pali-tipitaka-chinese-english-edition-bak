<BLOCKQUOTE>There are some who dispute<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; corrupted at 
  heart,<BR>and those who dispute<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their hearts set on 
  truth,<BR>but a sage doesn't enter<BR>a dispute that's arisen,<BR>which is why 
  he is<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nowhere constrained. 
  <P>Now, how would one<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; led on by 
  desire,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; entrenched in his likes,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  forming his own conclusions,<BR>overcome his own views?<BR>He'd dispute in 
  line<BR>with the way that he knows. 
  <P>Whoever boasts to others, unasked,<BR>of his practices, precepts,<BR>is, 
  say the skilled,<BR>ignoble by nature -- <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he who speaks 
  of himself<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of his own accord. 
  <P>But a monk at peace,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fully unbound in himself,<BR>who 
  doesn't boast of his precepts<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- "That's how I am" -- 
  <BR><I>he, </I>say the skilled,<BR>is noble by nature -- 
  <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he with no vanity<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with regard to 
  the world. 
  <P>One whose doctrines aren't clean -- <BR>fabricated, formed, given 
  preference<BR>when he sees it to his own advantage -- <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  relies on a peace<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dependent<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on 
  what can be shaken. 
  <P>Because entrenchments[<A 
  href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/suttanipata/snp4-03.html#n3-1" 
  name=3-1>1</A>] in views<BR>aren't easily overcome<BR>when considering what's 
  grasped<BR>among doctrines,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that's why<BR>a person 
  embraces or rejects a doctrine -- <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in light of these 
  very<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; entrenchments. 
  <P>Now, one who is cleansed[<A 
  href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/suttanipata/snp4-03.html#n3-2" 
  name=3-2>2</A>]<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has no preconceived view<BR>about states 
  of becoming<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or not-<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anywhere in the 
  world.<BR>Having abandoned conceit[<A 
  href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/suttanipata/snp4-03.html#n3-3" 
  name=3-3>3</A>] &amp; illusion,<BR>by what means would he go?[<A 
  href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/suttanipata/snp4-03.html#n3-4" 
  name=3-4>4</A>]<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He isn't involved. 
  <P>For one who's involved<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gets into 
  disputes<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over doctrines,<BR>but how -- in connection 
  with what[<A 
  href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/suttanipata/snp4-03.html#n3-5" 
  name=3-5>5</A>] -- <BR>would you argue<BR>with one 
  uninvolved?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has nothing<BR>embraced or 
  rejected,<BR>has sloughed off every view<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right here -- 
  every one. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>Notes</H3>
<P><B><A name=n3-1>1</A>.</B> Entrenchments: a rendering of the Pali term, 
<I>nivesana,</I> which can also be rendered as abode, situation, home, or 
establishment. [<A

<P><B><A name=n3-2>2</A>.</B> Nd.I: Cleansed through discernment. [<A

back</A>] 
<P><B><A name=n3-3>3</A>.</B> Nd.I explains a variety of ways of understanding 
the word "conceit," the most comprehensive being a list of nine kinds of 
conceit: viewing people better than oneself as worse than oneself, on a par with 
oneself, or better than oneself; viewing people on a par with oneself as worse 
than oneself, on a par with oneself, or better than oneself; viewing people 
worse than oneself as worse than oneself, on a par with oneself, or better than 
oneself. In other words, the truth of the view is not the issue here; the issue 
is the tendency to compare oneself with others. [<A

<P><B><A name=n3-4>4</A>.</B> Nd.I: "By what means would he go" to any 
destination in any state of becoming. [<A

<P><B><A name=n3-5>5</A>.</B> In connection with what: a rendering of the 
instrumental case that attempts to cover several of its meanings, in particular 
"by what means" and "in terms of what." For a discussion of the use of the 
instrumental case in the Atthaka Vagga, see <A
