<DIV class=tnote><B>Translator's note: </B>This poem, which is attributed to 
King Asoka's younger brother, falls into three parts: the first expresses his 
initial desire to leave the life of the palace and go into the forest; the 
second depicts his going forth; and the third announces his Awakening. Some 
scholars have suggested that many of the poems dealing with events in the lives 
of the early Buddhist monks and nuns may have originally been intended for 
dramatic performance, and this poem could easily have been written with that 
intent. The language of the original, with its heavy use of poetic terms, 
certainly indicates that the author had a literate background and was writing 
for a sophisticated audience. </DIV>

<DIV class=sutta>
<DIV class=verse><PRE>If, in front or behind,
there is no one else, 
it's extremely pleasant
for one staying alone
in the forest.

Come then! Alone
I will go to the wilderness
	praised	by the Awakened One
	pleasant	for a resolute monk
		dwelling alone.

Alone, 
astute in my goal,
I'll quickly enter the grove
	— refreshing,
	giving rapture
	to meditators — 
		the haunt 
	of elephants in rut.

When the Cool Forest's in full flower,
in a cool mountain gorge,
having bathed my limbs
I'll walk back &amp; forth.
	alone.

Ah, when will I dwell,
alone and free from companions,
in the refreshing great forest — 
	my task done,
	fermentation-free?

As I desire to do this, 
may my purpose succeed.
	I myself 
will bring it about.
	No one can do it
	for anyone else.



	I myself
bind on my armor.
I will enter the grove
and will not emerge
without having attained
fermentations' end.

While soft breezes blow — 
	cool,
	heavily, fragrantly scented — 
I'll make ignorance burst,
as I sit on a mountaintop.

In the forest covered with blossoms
or perhaps on a cool hillside,
blessed with the bliss of release,
on Giribbaja I'll delight. <SPAN class=note-tag><A href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/theragatha/thag10-02-tb0.html#n2-1" name=t2-1>1</A></SPAN>



	I am now he
whose resolves are fulfilled
like the moon on a full-moon night.
	With all fermentations
	totally ended,
	there is now no further becoming.
</PRE></DIV></DIV>
