<P><SMALL>From <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/asoka.html"><I>That 
the True Dhamma Might Last a Long Time: Readings Selected by King Asoka</I></A>, 
translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu.</SMALL> 
<HR>
Now at that time the wanderer <A name=sanjaya>Sa&ntilde;jaya</A> was residing in <A 
name=rajagaha>Rajagaha</A> with a large company of wanderers -- 250 in all. And 
at that time <A name=sariputta>Sariputta</A> and <A 
name=moggallana>Moggallana</A> were practicing the holy life under Sa&ntilde;jaya. They 
had made this agreement: Whoever attains the Deathless first will inform the 
other. 
<P>Then <A name=assaji>Ven. Assaji</A>, arising early in the morning, taking his 
robe and bowl, entered Rajagaha for alms: Gracious in the way he approached and 
departed, looked forward and behind, drew in and stretched out his arm; his eyes 
downcast, his every movement consummate. Sariputta the wanderer saw Ven. Assaji 
going for alms in Rajagaha: gracious... his eyes downcast, his every movement 
consummate. On seeing him, the thought occurred to him: "Surely, of those in 
this world who are arahants or have entered the path to arahantship, this is 
one. What if I were to approach him and question him: 'On whose account have you 
gone forth? Who is your teacher? In whose Dhamma do you delight?'" 
<P>But then the thought occurred to Sariputta the wanderer: "This is the wrong 
time to question him. He is going for alms in the town. What if I were to follow 
behind this monk who has found the path for those who seek it?" 
<P>Then Ven. Assaji, having gone for alms in Rajagaha, left, taking the alms he 
had received. Sariputta the wanderer approached him and, on arrival, having 
exchanged friendly greetings and engaged in polite conversation, stood to one 
side. As he stood there he said, "Your faculties are bright, my friend, your 
complexion pure and clear. On whose account have you gone forth? Who is your 
teacher? In whose Dhamma do you delight?" 
<P>"There is, my friend, the Great Contemplative, a son of the Sakyans, gone 
forth from a Sakyan family. I have gone forth on account of that Blessed One. 
That Blessed One is my teacher. It is in that Blessed One's Dhamma that I 
delight." 
<P>"But what is your teacher's teaching? What does he proclaim?'' 
<P>"I am new, my friend, not long gone forth, only recently come to this 
doctrine and discipline. I cannot explain the doctrine in detail, but I can give 
you the gist in brief." 
<P>Then Sariputta the wanderer spoke thus to the Ven. Assaji: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Speak a little or a lot,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but tell me just 
  the gist.<BR>The gist is what I want.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What use is a lot 
  of rhetoric? </BLOCKQUOTE>Then Ven. Assaji gave this Dhamma exposition to 
Sariputta the Wanderer: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whatever phenomena arise from cause:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their cause<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and 
  their cessation.<BR>Such is the teaching of the 
  Tathagata,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Great Contemplative. </BLOCKQUOTE><A 
name=saristream>Then</A> to Sariputta the Wanderer, as he heard this Dhamma 
exposition, there arose the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye: Whatever is subject 
to origination is all subject to cessation. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Even if just this is the Dhamma,<BR>you have 
  penetrated<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the Sorrowless (asoka) 
  State<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unseen, overlooked (by us)<BR>for many myriads of 
  aeons. </BLOCKQUOTE>Then Sariputta the wanderer went to where Moggallana the 
wanderer was staying. Moggallana the wanderer saw him coming from afar and, on 
seeing him, said, "Your faculties are bright, my friend; your complexion pure 
and clear. Could it be that you have attained the Deathless?" 
<P>"Yes, my friend, I have attained the Deathless. " 
<P>"But how, friend, did you attain the Deathless?" 
<P>"Just now, friend, I saw Ven. Assaji going for alms in Rajagaha: gracious in 
the way he approached and departed, looked forward and behind, drew in and 
stretched out his arm; his eyes downcast, his every movement consummate. On 
seeing him, the thought occurred to me: 'Surely, of those in this world who are 
arahants or have entered the path to arahantship, this is one. What if I were to 
approach him and question him: "On whose account have you gone forth? Who is

<P>"But then the thought occurred to me: 'This is the wrong time to question

who has found the path for those who seek it?' 
<P>"Then Ven. Assaji, having gone for alms in Rajagaha, left, taking the alms he

greetings and engaged in polite conversation, stood to one side. As I stood 
there I said, 'Your faculties are bright, my friend, your complexion pure and
