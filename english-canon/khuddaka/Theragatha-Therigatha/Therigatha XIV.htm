<P>As Subha the nun was going through <A name=jivaka>Jivaka's</A> delightful 
mango grove, a libertine (a goldsmith's son) blocked her path, so she said to 
him: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>'What wrong have I done you<BR>that you stand in my way?<BR>It's 
  not proper, my friend,<BR>that a man should touch<BR>a woman gone forth.<BR>I 
  respect the Master's message,<BR>the training pointed out by the one 
  well-gone.<BR>I am pure, without blemish:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you 
  stand in my way?<BR>You -- your mind agitated, impassioned;<BR>I -- 
  unagitated, unimpassioned,<BR>with a mind entirely 
  freed:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you stand in my way?' 
  <P>'You are young &amp; not bad-looking,<BR>what need do you have for going 
  forth?<BR>Throw off your ochre robe -- <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, let's 
  delight in the flowering grove.<BR>A sweetness they exude everywhere,<BR>the 
  towering trees with their pollen.<BR>The beginning of spring is a pleasant 
  season -- <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, let's delight in the flowering 
  grove.<BR>The trees with their blossoming tips<BR>moan, as it were, in the 
  breeze:<BR>What delight will you have<BR>if you plunge into the grove 
  alone?<BR>Frequented by herds of wild beasts,<BR>disturbed by elephants 
  rutting &amp; aroused:<BR>you want to go<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  unaccompanied<BR>into the great, lonely, frightening grove?<BR>Like a doll 
  made of gold, you will go about,<BR>like a goddess in the gardens of 
  heaven.<BR>With delicate, smooth <A name=kasi>Kasi</A> fabrics,<BR>you will 
  shine, O beauty without compare.<BR>I would gladly do your every bidding<BR>if 
  we were to dwell in the glade.<BR>For there is no creature dearer to 
  me<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than you, O nymph with the languid regard.<BR>If you 
  do as I ask, happy, come live in my house.<BR>Dwelling in the calm of a 
  palace,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have women wait on you,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  wear delicate Kasi fabrics,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adorn yourself with garlands 
  &amp; creams.<BR>I will make you many &amp; varied 
  ornaments<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of gold, jewels, &amp; pearls.<BR>Climb onto a 
  costly bed,<BR>scented with sandalwood carvings,<BR>with a well-washed 
  coverlet, beautiful,<BR>spread with a woolen quilt, brand new.<BR>Like a blue 
  lotus rising from the water<BR>where no human beings dwell,<BR>you will go to 
  old age with your limbs unseen,<BR>if you stay as you are in the holy life.' 
  <P>'What do you assume of any essence,<BR>here in this cemetery grower, filled 
  with corpses,<BR>this body destined to break up?<BR>What do you see when you 
  look at me,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you who are out of your mind?' 
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Your eyes<BR>are like those of a fawn,<BR>like those of 
  a sprite in the mountains.<BR>Seeing your eyes, my sensual 
  delight<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grows all the more.<BR>Like tips they are, of 
  blue lotuses,<BR>in your golden face<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- 
  spotless:<BR>Seeing your eyes, my sensual delight<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grows 
  all the more.<BR>Even if you should go far away,<BR>I will think only of your 
  pure,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long-lashed gaze,<BR>for there is nothing dearer 
  to me<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than your eyes, O nymph with the languid regard.' 
  <P>'You want to stray from the road,<BR>you want the moon as a 
  plaything,<BR>you want to jump over <A name=sineru>Mount Sineru</A>,<BR>you 
  who have designs on one born of the Buddha.<BR>For there is nothing anywhere 
  at all<BR>in the cosmos with its gods,<BR>that would be an object of passion 
  for me.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't even know what that passion would 
  be,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for it's been killed, root &amp; all, by the 
  path.<BR><A name=embers>Like embers</A> from a pit -- scattered,<BR><A 
  name=bowl>like a bowl of poison</A> -- evaporated,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
  don't even see what that passion would be,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for it's been 
  killed, root &amp; all, by the path.<BR>Try to seduce one who hasn't reflected 
  on this,<BR>or who has not followed the Master's teaching.<BR>But try it with 
  this one who knows<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and you suffer.<BR>For in the midst 
  of praise &amp; blame,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pleasure &amp; pain,<BR>my 
  mindfulness stands firm.<BR>Knowing the unattractiveness<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  of things compounded,<BR>my mind cleaves to nothing at all.<BR>I am a follower 
  of the one well-gone,<BR>riding the vehicle of the eightfold way:<BR>My arrow 
  removed, effluent-free,<BR>I delight, having gone to an empty dwelling.<BR>For 
  I have seen well-painted puppets,<BR>hitched up with sticks &amp; 
  strings,<BR>made to dance in various ways.<BR>When the sticks &amp; strings 
  are removed,<BR>thrown away, scattered, shredded,<BR>smashed into pieces, not 
  to be found,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in what will the mind there make its 
  home?<BR>This body of mine, which is just like that,<BR>when devoid of dhammas 
  doesn't function.<BR>When, devoid of dhammas, it doesn't 
  function,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in what will the mind there make its 
  home?<BR><A name=mural>Like a mural</A> you've seen, painted on a 
  wall,<BR>smeared with yellow orpiment,<BR>there your vision has been 
  distorted,<BR>meaningless your human perception.<BR><A name=mirage>Like an 
  evaporated</A> mirage,<BR><A name=gold>like a tree of gold</A> in a 
  dream,<BR><A name=magic>like a magic show</A> in the midst of a crowd -- 
  <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you run blind after what is unreal.<BR>Resembling a 
  ball of sealing wax,<BR>set in a hollow,<BR>with a bubble in the middle<BR>and 
  bathed with tears,<BR>eye secretions are born there too:<BR>The parts of the 
  eye<BR>are rolled all together<BR>in various ways.' 
  <P>Plucking out her lovely eye,<BR>with mind unattached<BR>she felt no regret. 

  <P>'Here, take this eye. It's yours.' 
  <P>Straightaway she gave it to him.<BR>Straightaway his passion faded right 
  there,<BR>and he begged her forgiveness. 
  <P>'Be well, follower of the holy life.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This sort of 
  thing<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; won't happen again.<BR>Harming a person like 
  you<BR>is like embracing a blazing fire,<BR>It is as if I have seized a 
  poisonous snake.<BR>So may you be well. Forgive me.' 
  <P>And released from there, the nun<BR>went to the excellent Buddha's 
  presence.<BR>When she saw the mark of his excellent 
  merit,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her eye became<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as it was 
  before. </P></BLOCKQUOTE><!-- #bbinclude "footer.html" --><!-- THE TEXT BELOW IS AUTOMAGICALLY GENERATED FROM AN INCLUDE FILE. --><!-- robots content="none" -->
