<H3><A name=intro>Translator's Introduction</A></H3>This, the first book in the 
<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/index.html">Khuddaka 
Nikaya</A> (Collection of Short Discourses), appears to have been designed as a 
primer for novice monks and nuns. In nine short passages it covers the basic 
topics that one would need to know in beginning Buddhist monastic life; many of 
the passages also serve as useful introductions to Buddhist practice in general. 
Passages <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/khp/khp.html#1">1</A> 
and <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/khp/khp.html#2">2</A> 
cover the ceremony for taking ordination as a novice. Passage <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/khp/khp.html#3">3</A> 
gives preliminary guidance in the contemplation of the body, a meditation 
exercise designed to overcome lust. Passage <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/khp/khp.html#4">4</A> 
introduces many of the basic categories of analysis through which discernment 
can be developed, beginning with the most basic formulation of the causal 
principle so central to the Buddha's teaching. Passage <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/khp/khp.html#5">5</A> 
gives an overview of the practice as a whole -- beginning with the need to 
associate with wise people, and ending with the attainment of Unbinding 
(nibbana/nirvana). This overview is presented in the context of the concept of 
protective rituals, and makes the point that -- given the nature of human action 
and its results -- the best protection comes not from rituals but from acting in 
a generous, moral, and wise manner. Passage <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/khp/khp.html#6">6</A> 
expands both on Passage <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/khp/khp.html#1">1</A> 
and Passage <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/khp/khp.html#5">5</A>, 
detailing some of the virtues of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha, while at the 
same time elaborating on the practice of meditation and the attainment of 
stream-entry -- the point at which the meditator has his/her first glimpse of 
Unbinding. Passage <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/khp/khp.html#7">7</A> 
elaborates on the theme of generosity, showing how gifts to the Sangha can be 
dedicated to the welfare of one's dead relatives. Passage <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/khp/khp.html#8">8</A> 
presents meritorious action in general as an investment more reliable and 
longer-lasting than material investments. Passage <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/khp/khp.html#9">9</A> 
returns to the subject of meditation, focusing on the development of good will 
and lovingkindness. 
<P>These nine passages, in different contexts, are frequently chanted in 
Theravada countries even today. Lay and ordained Buddhists chant Passage <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/khp/khp.html#1">1</A> 
daily, as an affirmation of their refuge in the Triple Gem. Monks will often 
chant Passages <A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/khp/khp.html#5">5</A>-<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/khp/khp.html#9">9</A> 
as blessings when lay people make merit, and frequently use verses from Passage 
<A 
href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/khp/khp.html#5">5</A> 
as sermon themes. 
<P>Thus the passages contained in this book serve as a useful introduction both 
to early Buddhist training and to modern Theravada practices.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Outside the walls they stand,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; at 
  crossroads.<BR>At door posts they stand,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; returning to 
  their old homes.<BR>But when a meal with plentiful food &amp; drink is 
  served,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no one remembers them:<BR>Such is the kamma of 
  living beings. 
  <P>Thus those who feel sympathy for their dead relatives<BR>give timely 
  donations of proper food &amp; drink<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- exquisite, clean 
  -- <BR>[thinking:] "May this be for our relatives.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May our relatives be happy!" 
  <P>And those who have gathered there,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the assembled 
  shades of the relatives,<BR>with appreciation give their blessing<BR>for the 
  plentiful food &amp; drink:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May our relatives live 
  long<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because of whom we have gained [this 
  gift].<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been honored,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and 
  the donors are not without reward!" 
  <P>For there [in their realm] there's<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no 
  farming,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no herding of cattle,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no 
  commerce,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no trading with money.<BR>They live on what is 
  given here,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hungry shades<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whose 
  time here is done. 
  <P>As water raining on a hill<BR>flows down to the 
  valley,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even so does what is given 
  here<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; benefit the dead.<BR>As rivers full of 
  water<BR>fill the ocean full,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even so does what is given 
  here<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; benefit the dead. 
  <P>"He gave to me, she acted on my behalf,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they were my 
  relatives, companions, friends":<BR>Offerings should be given for the 
  dead<BR>when one reflects thus<BR>on things done in the past.<BR>For no 
  weeping,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no sorrowing<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no other 
  lamentation<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; benefits the 
  dead<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whose relatives persist in that 
  way.<BR>But when this offering is given, well-placed in the Sangha,<BR>it 
  works for their long-term benefit<BR>and they profit immediately.<BR>
  <P>In this way &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the proper duty to relatives has been 
  shown,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; great honor has been done to 
  the dead,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and monks have been given 
  strength:

href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/digha/dn15.html">DN 15</A>] 
describes the eight emancipations as follows: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Possessed of form, one sees forms. This is the first 
  emancipation. 
  <P>"Not percipient of form internally, one sees forms externally. This is the 
  second emancipation. 
  <P>"One is intent only on the beautiful. This is the third emancipation. With 
  the complete transcending of perceptions of [physical] form, with the 
  disappearance of perceptions of resistance, and not heeding perceptions of 
  diversity, thinking, 'Infinite space,' one enters and remains in the dimension 
  of the infinitude of space. This is the fourth emancipation. With the complete 
  transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space, thinking, 'Infinite 
  consciousness,' one enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of 
  consciousness. This is the fifth emancipation. 
  <P>"With the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of 
  consciousness, thinking, 'There is nothing,' one enters and remains in the 
  dimension of nothingness. This is the sixth emancipation. 
  <P>"With the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness, one enters 
  and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. This is 
  the seventh emancipation. 
  <P>"With the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor 
  non-perception, one enters and remains in the cessation of perception and 
  feeling. This is the eighth emancipation. 
  <P>"Now, when a monk attains these eight emancipations in forward order, in 
  reverse order, in forward and reverse order, when he attains them and emerges 
  from them wherever he wants, however he wants, and for as long as he wants, 
  when through the ending of the mental fermentations he enters and remains in 
  the fermentation-free awareness-release and discernment-release, having 
  directly known it and realized it in the here and now, he is said to be a monk 
  released in both ways. And as for another release in both ways, higher or more 
  sublime than this, there is none." [<A
