<H3>Notes</H3>
<P><B><A name=n11.1>1</A>.</B> <I>Ujjuhaana.</I> The Commentary offers two 
interpretations for this word. The first is that it is a hill covered with 
jungle and many streams that tended to overflow in the rainy season. The other 
is that it is the name of a bird that could stay comfortable even when exposed 
to cold, wind, and rain. I've chosen the second alternative. K. R. Norman 
speculates that the term could be written ujjahaana, in which case it would be 
the present participle for a verb meaning abandoned or cast off. However, none 
of the manuscripts support his speculation. [<A

back</A>] 
<P><B><A name=n11.2>2</A>.</B> In other words, the sight of the crow taking up 
residence in skulls and other body parts provided a chastening perspective on 
how the mind takes up residence in the body. [<A
