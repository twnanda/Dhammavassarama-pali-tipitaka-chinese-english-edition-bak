<DIV class=verse><PRE>Crimson now, Sir, are the trees of the forest,
Having shed their foliage, they're eager to fruit,
(Their flowers are) blazing forth like brilliant flames,
— It is a luscious time of year, Great Hero.

The blossoming trees, so pleasing to the mind,
Spread their fragrance in every direction,
Surrendering their leaves and longing for fruit;
— The time has come to depart from here, Hero.

It is neither too cold, nor again too hot,
The season is pleasant, suited for travel.
My Lord, let the Sakyas and Koliyas see you
— Facing westward and crossing the Rohini.
</PRE></DIV></DIV>

<DIV class=notes><B>Translator's note</B> 
<DIV class=note>
<P>These verses are said to have been uttered by Udayin (nick-named Kala Udayin 
or "Dark Udayin"). He was the son of king Suddhodhana's chief minister, and is 
said to have been the childhood companion of prince Siddhartha. Soon after 
Gotama's awakening, the king sent several messengers to ask his son to return 
home. Each one, upon hearing the Buddha's teaching, apparently joined his 
movement and gave up the king's mission. Finally Suddhodhana sends Kaludayin, 
who agrees on condition that he can become a follower of the Buddha upon getting 
him to return home for a visit.</P>
<P>The Rohini river runs through the heart of the Buddha's homeland, marking the 
border between the lands of the Sakyas and the Koliyas (his father's and 
mother's families, respectively). Since the verses are uttered in Rajagaha, well 
to the southeast, a returning journey would face the traveller westward. One 
commentary says that Kaludayin went on for sixty stanzas of this beautiful 
nature poetry before asking the Buddha to return, but we only have the first few 
of these. The language is rich and evocative of spring sights and smells. It is 
composed in a meter of eleven syllables per line.</P>
<P>The Buddha does indeed go home soon after his awakening, where he picks up a 
number of family members to join his order. These include his half brother 
(Nanda), several cousins (Ananda, Anuruddha, and Devadatta), and his son 
(Rahula). Eventually his wife (Yosodhara), step-mother (Mahapajapati) and many 
other Sakyas will also become nuns and monks.</P></DIV></DIV><!-- #bbinclude "c.footer.html" --><!-- =============================================================== --><!-- THE TEXT BELOW IS AUTOMAGICALLY GENERATED FROM AN INCLUDE FILE. --><!-- robots content="none" -->
