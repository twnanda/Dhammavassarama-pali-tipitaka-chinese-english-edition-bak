<hr>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <a name="sav">Savatthi</a>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana">Anathapindika</A>'s monastery. Now at that time <A NAME="kondanna">Ven</A>. A&ntilde;&ntilde;a Konda&ntilde;&ntilde;a was sitting not far from the Blessed One, his legs crossed, his body held erect, reflecting on [his] release through the total ending of craving. The Blessed One saw Ven. A&ntilde;&ntilde;a Konda&ntilde;&ntilde;a sitting not far away, his legs crossed, his body held erect, reflecting on [his] release through the total ending of craving.
<P>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

For someone with no root, no soil,<br>
no leaves -- how creepers?<br>
Who's fit to blame him,<br>
the enlightened one freed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from bonds.<br> <!--{AG says no question mark here!}-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even devas praise him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even by <A NAME="brahma">Brahma</A> he's praised.
