I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="sav">Savatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana">Anathapindika's</A> monastery. Now at that time, most of the people in Savatthi were excessively attached to sensual pleasures. They lived delighting in, addicted to, infatuated with, fastened to, absorbed in sensual pleasures. Then in the early morning, a large number of monks, having put on their robes and carrying their bowls and outer robes, went into Savatthi for alms. Having gone for alms in Savatthi, after the meal, returning from their alms round, they went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they said to the Blessed One: "Most of the people in Savatthi are excessively attached to sensual pleasures. They live delighting in, addicted to, infatuated with, fastened to, absorbed in sensual pleasures."
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Clinging to sense pleasures, to sensual ties,<br>
seeing no blame in the fetter,<br>
never will those tied up in the fetter<br>
cross over the flood so great &amp; wide.
