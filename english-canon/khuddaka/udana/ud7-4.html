I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="sav">Savatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana">Anathapindika's</A> monastery. Now at that time, most of the people in Savatthi were excessively attached to sensual pleasures. They lived delighting in, addicted to, infatuated with, fastened to, absorbed in sensual pleasures. Then early in the morning the Blessed One, having put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. He saw that most of the people in Savatthi were excessively attached to sensual pleasures, that they live delighting in, addicted to, infatuated with, fastened to, absorbed in sensual pleasures.
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:

<A NAME="fish">Blinded</A> by sensuality<br>
covered by the net,<br>
veiled with the veil of craving,<br>
bound by the bond of heedlessness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like fish in the mouth of a trap,<br>
they go to aging &amp; death,<br>
like a suckling calf to its mother.
