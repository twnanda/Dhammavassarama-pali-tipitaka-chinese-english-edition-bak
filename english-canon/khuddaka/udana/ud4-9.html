I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in <A NAME="rajagaha">Rajagaha</A> at the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary. Now at that time, when <A NAME="upasena">Ven. Upasena Vangantaputta</A> was alone in seclusion, this line of thinking arose in his awareness: "What a gain, what a true gain it is for me that my teacher is the Blessed One, worthy and a fully self-awakened; that I have gone forth from home to the homeless life in a well-taught Dhamma and discipline; that my companions in the holy life are virtuous and endowed with admirable qualities; that I have achieved culmination in terms of the precepts; that my mind is unified and well-concentrated; that I am an arahant, with effluents ended; that I have great power and great might. Fortunate has been my life; fortunate will be my death."
<p>
Then the Blessed One, comprehending with his awareness the line of thinking that had arisen in Ven. Upasena Vangantaputta's awareness, on that occasion exclaimed:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
He feels no regret at what life has been,<br>
he feels no sorrow at death,<br>
if -- a wise one -- he has seen that state.<br>
He feels no sorrow<br>
in the midst of sorrow.
<p>
For one who has destroyed<br>
craving for becoming -- <br>
the monk of peaceful mind -- <br>
birth &amp; the wandering on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are totally ended.<br>
There is no further becoming.
