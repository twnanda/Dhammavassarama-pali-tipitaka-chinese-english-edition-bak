<hr>
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <A NAME="sav">Savatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="ana">Anathapindika</A>'s monastery. Now at that time Ven. Revata the Doubter was sitting not far from the Blessed One, his legs crossed, his body held erect, reflecting on [his] purification through the overcoming of doubt. The Blessed One saw Ven. Revata the Doubter sitting not far away, his legs crossed, his body held erect, reflecting on [his] purification through the overcoming of doubt.
<p>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any doubts,<br>
about here or the world beyond,<br>
about what is experienced<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by/because of others,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by/because of oneself,<br>
are abandoned -- all -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the person in jhana,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ardent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; living the holy life.
