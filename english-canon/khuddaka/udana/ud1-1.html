I have heard that on one occasion, when the Blessed One was newly Awakened -- staying at <A NAME="uruvela">Uruvela</A> by the banks of the <A NAME="neranjara">Nera&ntilde;jara River</A> in the shade of the Bodhi tree, the tree of Awakening -- he sat in the shade of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one session, sensitive to the bliss of release. At the end of seven days, after emerging from that concentration, in the first watch of the night, he gave close attention to dependent co-arising in forward order, thus:
<blockquote>
When this is, that is.<br>
From the arising of this comes the arising of that.
<p>
In other words:
<p>
From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications.<br>
From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness.<br>
From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-and-form.<br>
From name-and-form as a requisite condition come the six sense media.<br>
From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact.<br>
From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling.<br>
From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving.<br>
From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance.<br>
From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming.<br>
From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth.<br>
From birth as a requisite condition, then old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair come into play. Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress and suffering.
</blockquote>
Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:
<blockquote>
As phenomena grow clear<br>
to the brahmin -- ardent, absorbed -- <br>
his doubts all vanish<br>
when he discerns what has a cause.
</blockquote>
