<blockquote>
Whether walking, standing,<br>
sitting, or lying down,<br>
it flexes &amp; stretches:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this is the body's movement.<br>
Joined together with tendons &amp; bones,<br>
plastered over with muscle &amp; skin,<br>
hidden by complexion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the body isn't seen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for what it is:<br>
filled with intestines, filled with stomach,<br>
with the lump of the liver,<br>
bladder, lungs, heart,<br>
kidneys, spleen,<br>
mucus, sweat, saliva, fat,<br>
blood, synovial fluid, bile, &amp; oil.<br>
On top of that,<br>
in <A NAME="9streams">nine streams</A>,<br>
filth is always flowing from it:<br>
from the eyes : eye secretions,<br>
from the ears : ear secretions,<br>
from the nose : mucus,<br>
from the mouth : now vomit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now phlegm,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now bile.<br>
from the body : beads of sweat.<br>
And on top of that,<br>
its hollow head is filled with brains.
<p>
The fool, beset by ignorance,<br>
thinks it beautiful.<br>
But when it lies dead,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; swollen, livid,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cast away in a charnel ground,<br>
even relatives don't care for it.<br>
Dogs feed on it,<br>
jackals, wolves, &amp; worms.<br>
Crows &amp; vultures feed on it,<br>
along with any other animals there.
<p>
Having heard the Awakened One's words,<br>
the discerning monk<br>
comprehends, for he sees it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for what it is:<br>
"As this is, so is that.<br>
As that, so this."<br>
Within &amp; without,<br>
he should let desire for the body<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fade away.<br>
With desire &amp; passion faded away,<br>
the discerning monk arrives here:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the deathless,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the calm,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the undying state<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of Unbinding.
<p>
This two-footed, filthy, evil-smelling,<br>
filled-with-various-carcasses,<br>
oozing-out-here-&amp;-there body:<br>
Whoever would think,<br>
on the basis of a body like this,<br>
to exalt himself or disparage another:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if not blindness?
