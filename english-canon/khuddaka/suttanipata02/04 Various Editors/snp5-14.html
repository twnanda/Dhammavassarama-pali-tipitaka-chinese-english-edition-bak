<i>Posala:</i>
<blockquote>
To one who reveals the past<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- unperturbed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his doubts cut through -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who has gone to the beyond<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of all phenomena,<br>
I've come with a question.<br>
I ask the Sakyan about the knowledge [<A HREF="#n1" NAME="1">1</a>]<br>
of one devoid of perception of forms,<br>
who has abandoned all the body,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every body,<br>
who sees, within &amp; without,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'There is nothing':<br>
How is he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be led further on?
</blockquote>
<i>The Buddha:</i>
<blockquote>
The Tathagata, knowing directly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all stations of consciousness, [<A HREF="#n2" NAME="2">2</a>]<br>
knows for one stationed in them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; release<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; the steps leading there.
<p>
Knowing directly<br>
the origin of nothingness<br>
to be the fetter of delight,<br>
one then sees there clearly.<br>
That's his genuine knowledge -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the brahman who has lived<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to fulfillment.
</blockquote>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
<b><A NAME="n1">1</a>.</b> Posala's question concerning the knowledge of the person in the dimension of nothingness has a double meaning: He is asking about the Buddha's knowledge about that person, and also what a person in that dimension of attainment should do to develop his/her knowledge even further. The Buddha's answer deals with the question in both its senses.

<b><A NAME="n2">2</a>.</b> On the seven stations of consciousness, see <A HREF="../../digha/dn-15-tb0.html">DN 15</A>. The dimension of nothingness, discussed in this dialogue, is the seventh and most refined.
