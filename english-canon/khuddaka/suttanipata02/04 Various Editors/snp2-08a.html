<h3>Sutta Nipata II.8</h3>
<h1>Nava Sutta</h1>
<h1>A Boat</h1>
<small>Translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu.</small><br>

<small><b>Translator's Note:</b> Although it is often lost in translation, this poem in the Pali has a clearly articulated over-all structure. The first seven verses -- coming under the "because" <I>(yasma)</I> -- state reasons, while the last verse, under the "so" <I>(tasma),</I> draws the conclusion: find a good teacher and practice the Dhamma.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Because:</i>
<p>
when you honor<br>
 -- as the devas, Indra --<br>
one from whom<br>
you might learn the Dhamma,<br>
he, learned, honored,<br>
confident in you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shows you the Dhamma.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You, enlightened, heedful,<br>
befriending a teacher like that,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; practicing the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pondering,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; giving it priority,<br>
become<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; knowledgeable,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear-minded,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wise.
<p>
But if you consort with a piddling fool<br>
who's&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; envious,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hasn't come to the goal,<br>
you'll go to death<br>
without&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; having cleared up the Dhamma right here,<br>
with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your doubts unresolved.
<p>
Like a man gone down to a river --<br>
turbulent, flooding, swift-flowing --<br>
and swept away in the current:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how can he help others across?
<p>
Even so:<br>
he who hasn't<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cleared up the Dhamma,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attended to the meaning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of what the learned say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crossed over his doubts:<br>
how can he get others<br>
to comprehend?
<p>
But as one who's embarked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on a sturdy boat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with rudder &amp; oars,<br>
would -- mindful, skillful,<br>
knowing the needed techniques --<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carry many others across,
<p>
even so<br>
an attainer-of-knowledge, learned,<br>
self-developed, unwavering<br>
can get other people to comprehend --<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if they're willing to listen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ready to learn.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>So:</i><br>
you should befriend<br>
a person of integrity --<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; learned, intelligent.<br>
Practicing so<br>
as to know the goal,<br>
when you've experienced the Dhamma,
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you get bliss.
