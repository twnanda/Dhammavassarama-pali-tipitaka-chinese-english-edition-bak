&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without sign,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unknown<br>
-- the life here of mortals --<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; difficult,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; short,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tied up with pain.<br>
For there's no way<br>
by which those who are born<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will not die.<br>
Beings are subject<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to death<br>
even when they attain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; old age.
<p>
<A NAME="fruits">Like</A> ripe fruits<br>
whose downfall, whose danger<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is falling,<br>
so for mortals, once born,<br>
the constant danger<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is death.
<p>
<A NAME="potter">As</A> a potter's clay vessels<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; large &amp; small<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fired &amp; unfired<br>
all end up broken,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so too life<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heads to death.<br>
Young &amp; old<br>
wise &amp; foolish<br>
rich &amp; poor:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; come under the sway of death,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have death as their end.
<p>
For those overcome by death,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gone to the other world,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; father cannot shelter son,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor relatives a relative.<br>
<A NAME="cows">See:</A> even while relatives are looking on,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wailing heavily,<br>
mortals are<br>
one<br>
   by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one<br>
led away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like cows to the slaughter.
<p>
In this way is the world afflicted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with aging &amp; death,<br>
and so the enlightened don't grieve,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; knowing the way of the world.
<p>
"You don't know the path<br>
of his coming or going:<br>
seeing neither end,<br>
you lament in vain."
<p>
If, by lamenting,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- confused,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; harming yourself --<br>
any use could be gained<br>
the prudent would do it as well.<br>
But not by weeping &amp; grief<br>
do you gain peace of awareness.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pain<br>
arises all the more. Your body<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is harmed.<br>
You grow thin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pale,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; harming yourself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by yourself.<br>
Not in that way<br>
are the dead protected.<br>
Lamentation's in vain.
<p>
Not abandoning grief, a person<br>
suffers all the more pain.<br>
Bewailing one whose time is done,<br>
you fall under the sway of grief.
<p>
Look at others<br>
going along,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people arriving<br>
in line with their actions:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; falling under the sway of death,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beings simply<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shivering here.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For however they imagine it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it always turns out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; other than that.<br>
That's the type of (their) separation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See the way of the world.
<p>
Even if a person lives a century&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- or more --<br>
he's parted<br>
from his community of relatives,<br>
he abandons his life<br>
right here.
<p>
So, having heard the arahant,<br>
subduing lamentation,<br>
seeing the dead one whose time is done,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [think,] "I can't fetch him back." [<a HREF="#n1" NAME="1">1</A>]<br>
<A NAME="burningfluff">Just as</A> one would put out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a burning refuge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with water,<br>
so does the enlightened one --<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discerning,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; skillful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; wise --<br>
blow away any arisen grief,<br>
like the wind, a bit of cotton fluff.
<p>
<A NAME="arrow">Seeking</A> your own happiness,<br>
you should pull out your own arrow:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your own&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lamentation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; longing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; sorrow. [<a HREF="#n2" NAME="2">2</A>]<br>
With arrow pulled out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; independent,<br>
attaining peace of awareness,<br>
all grief transcended,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; griefless you are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unbound.
