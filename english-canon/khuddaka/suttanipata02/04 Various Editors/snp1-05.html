"I ask the sage of abundant discernment,<br>
awakened, lord of the Dhamma, free<br>
of craving, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; supreme <br>
among two-legged beings, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; best<br>
of charioteers:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How many contemplatives <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are there in the world?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please tell me."

"Four contemplatives, Cunda. There isn't a fifth.<br>
Being asked face-to-face, I'll explain:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Victor of the path,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the teacher of the path,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one who lives by the path,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; one who corrupts the path."

"Whom do the Awakened <br>
call the Victor of the path<br>

Tell me the one who lives by the path,<br>

He here knows the foremost as foremost,<br>

<b><a name="n1">1</a>.</b>
A corrupter of families is a monk who ingratiates himself into a family's affections by performing services for them that are inappropriate for a monk to do, thus diverting their faith away from those who live by the Dhamma and Vinaya. For more on this term, see <A HREF="../../../../lib/authors/thanissaro/bmc1/ch05.html#13"><i>The Buddhist Monastic Code,</i> Sanghadisesa 13</A>.
