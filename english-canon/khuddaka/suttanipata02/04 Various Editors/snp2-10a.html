<hr>
"Rouse yourself! Sit up! What good is there in sleeping? For those afflicted by disease (suffering), struck by <A NAME="arrow">the arrow</A> (craving), what sleep is there?
<p>
"Rouse yourself! Sit up! Resolutely train yourself to attain peace.[<A HREF="#n1" NAME="1">1</a>] Do not let the king of death,[<A HREF="#n2" NAME="2">2</a>] seeing you are careless, lead you astray and dominate you.
<p>
"Go beyond this clinging,[<A HREF="#n3" NAME="3">3</a>] to which devas and men are attached, and (the pleasures) they seek. Do not waste your opportunity. When the opportunity has passed they sorrow when consigned to <A NAME="niraya">Niraya</A>-hell.
<p>
"Negligence is a taint, and so is the (greater) negligence growing from it. By earnestness and understanding withdraw the arrow (of sensual passions)."
<blockquote>
-- vv. 331-334

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
<b><A NAME="n1">1</a>.</b> "Peace" is a synonym for Nibbana, the final goal.
[<A HREF="#1">Go back</A>]
<p>
<b><A NAME="n2">2</a>.</b> The king of death (maccuraja), or Mara (death), is the personification of everything that binds us to this world and prevents the gaining of deliverance.
[<A HREF="#2">Go back</A>]
<p>
<b><A NAME="n3">3</a>.</b> This clinging to pleasures of the senses.
[<A HREF="#3">Go back</A>]
