<hr>
Thus have I heard:
<p>
On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at Anathapindika's monastery. Now when the night was far advanced, a certain deity, whose surpassing radiance illuminated the whole of Jetavana, approached the Blessed One, respectfully saluted him, and stood beside him. Standing thus, he addressed the Blessed One in verse:
<p>
1. "Many deities and men longing for happiness have pondered on (the question of) blessings. Pray tell me what the highest blessings are.
<p>
2. "Not to associate with the foolish, but to associate with the wise, and to honor those worthy of honor -- this is the highest blessing.
<p>
3. "To reside in a suitable locality, to have performed meritorious actions in the past, and to set oneself in the right direction -- this is the highest blessing.
<p>
4. "Vast learning, skill in handicrafts, well grounded in discipline, and pleasant speech -- this is the highest blessing.
<p>
5. "To support one's father and mother; to cherish one's wife and children, and to be engaged in peaceful occupations -- this is the highest blessing.
<p>
6. "Liberality, righteous conduct, rendering assistance to relatives, and performance of blameless deeds -- this is the highest blessing.
<p>
7. "To cease and abstain from evil, to abstain from intoxicating drinks, and diligent in performing righteous acts -- this is the highest blessing.
<p>
8. "Reverence, humility, contentment, gratitude, and the timely hearing of the Dhamma, the teaching of the Buddha, -- this is the highest blessing.
<p>
9. "Patience, obedience, meeting the Samanas (holy men), and timely discussions on the Dhamma -- this is the highest blessing.
<p>
10. "Self-control, chastity, comprehension of the Noble Truths, and the realization of Nibbana -- this is the highest blessing.
<p>
11. "The mind that is not touched by the vicissitudes of life,[<a HREF="#n-s2-1" NAME="s2-1">1</A>] the mind that is free from sorrow, stainless, and secure -- this is the highest blessing.
<p>
12. "Those who have fulfilled the conditions (for such blessings) are victorious everywhere, and attain happiness everywhere -- To them these are the highest blessings."

<h3>Note</h3>
<p>
<b><A NAME="n-s2-1">1</A>.</b> The vicissitudes are eight in number: gain and loss, good-repute and ill-repute, praise and blame, joy and sorrow. This stanza is a reference to the state of mind of an arahant, the Consummate One. [<A HREF="#s2-1">Go back</A>]
