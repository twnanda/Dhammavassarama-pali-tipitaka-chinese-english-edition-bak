"Only here is there purity"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- that's what they say -- <br>
"No other doctrines are pure"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- so they say.<br>
Insisting that what they depend on is good,<br>
they are deeply entrenched in their personal truths.
<p>
Seeking controversy, they plunge into an assembly,<br>
regarding one another as fools.<br>
Relying on others' authority,<br>
they speak in debate.<br>
Desiring praise, they claim to be skilled.
<p>
Engaged in disputes in the midst of the assembly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- anxious, desiring praise -- <br>
the one defeated is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chagrined.<br>
Shaken with criticism, he seeks for an opening.
<p>
He whose doctrine is [judged as] demolished,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; defeated, by those judging the issue:<br>
He laments, he grieves -- the inferior exponent.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He beat me," he mourns.
<p>
These disputes have arisen among contemplatives.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In them are &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; elation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dejection.<br>
Seeing this, one should abstain from disputes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for they have no other goal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than the gaining of praise.
<p>
He who is praised there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for expounding his doctrine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the midst of the assembly,<br>
laughs on that account &amp; grows haughty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attaining his heart's desire.
<p>
That haughtiness will be his grounds for vexation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for he'll speak in pride &amp; conceit.<br>
Seeing this, one should abstain from debates.<br>
No purity is attained by them, say the skilled.
<p>
<A NAME="strong">Like a</A> strong man nourished on royal food,<br>
you go about, roaring, searching out an opponent.<br>
Wherever the battle is,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go there, strong man.<br>
As before, there's none here.
<p>
Those who dispute, taking hold of a view,<br>
saying, "This, and this only, is true,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those you can talk to.<br>
Here there is nothing -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no confrontation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the birth of disputes.
<p>
Among those who live above confrontation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not pitting view against view,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whom would you gain as opponent, Pasura,<br>
among those here<br>
who are grasping no more?
<p>
So here you come,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conjecturing,<br>
your mind conjuring<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; viewpoints.<br>
You're paired off with a pure one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and so cannot proceed.
