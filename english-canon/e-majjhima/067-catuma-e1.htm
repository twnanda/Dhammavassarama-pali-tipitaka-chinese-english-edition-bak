  <b>(67)The Discourse at Catuma.</b> </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus. </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One was living in the Aamalaki forest in Catuma. At that time
  about five hundred bhikkhus had come to Catuma headed by venerable Saariputta and
  venerable Moggallana to see the Blessed One.While exchanging friendly greetings, arranging
  beddings, putting away bowls and robes, they made much noise.The Blessed One addressed
  venerable Ananda: &#145;Ananda, who are those making such a noise, like fishermen hauling
  a catch of fish&#146; &#145;Venerable sir, about five hundred bhikkhus, headed by
  Sariputta and Moggallana have arrived in Catuma to see the Blessed One. They exchanging
  friendly greetings.with the resident bhikkhus, while arranging beddings, putting away
  bowls and robes are making much noise.Then Ananda, call those bhikkhus in my words&#146;..
  Venerable Ananda agreed, approached those bhikkhus and said. &#145;Venerable ones, the
  Teacher calls you.&#146;. Then those bhikkhus, agreeing approached the Blessed One,
  worshipped and sat on a side.The Blessed One addressed those bhikkhus. &#145;Bhikkhus, why
  do you make such a big noise? It&#146;s like fishermen hauling a catch of fish.&#146;
  &#145;Venerable sir, about five hundred bhikkhus, headed by Sariputta and Moggallana have
  arrived in Catuma to see the Blessed One.Exchanging friendly greetings, with the the
  resident bhikkhus, arranging beddings, putting away bowls and robes they are making much
  noise&#146;. &#145;Go! Bhikkhus, I turn you away, you should not stay close to me&#146;.
  Those bhikkhus, agreed, worshipped the Blessed One circumambulated the Blessed One and
  taking their bowls and robes left the presence of the Blessed One. </p>
  <p>At that time the Sakyas of Catuma had assembled in the assembly hall for some matter.
  The Sakyas of Catuma saw the bhikkhus going away in the distance, approaching them said
  thus:&#146;Venerable Ones, why do you go away?&#146; &#145;The Blessed One has turned out
  the Community of bhikkhus&#146;.&#146;Then venerable ones wait a moment, perhaps I would
  be able to win over the Blessed One&#146; Then those bhikkhus listened to the words of the
  Sakyas of Catuma and waited. The Sakyas of Catuma approached the Blessed One worshipped
  the Blessed One and sitting on a side said thus: &#145;Let, the Blessed One take pleasure
  in the Community of bhikkhus. May, the Blessed One welcome, the community of bhikkhus, As
  the Blessed One showed compassion to the community in the past, let compassion be shown
  now too. Venerable sir, here, there are new bhikkhus, those gone forth recently. If they
  do not get a chance to see the Blessed One, they would change their minds. Like small
  plants that die in want of water. Venerable sir, if these bhikkhus recently come to the
  dispensation do not get a chance to see the Blessed One they would change their minds.
  Like the calf that would be disturbed not seeing the mother. Venerable sir, in the same
  manner if these bhikkhus recently come to the dispensation do not get a chance to see the
  Blessed One they would change their minds. May the Blessed One take pleasure in the
  Community of bhikkhus. May the Blessed One welcome the community of bhikkhus, As the
  Blessed One showed compassion to the communityin the past, let there be compassion now
  too.&#146; </p>
  <p>Then Brahma Sahampati knowing the Blessed One&#146;s thoughts, as a strong man would
  stretch his bent arm, or bend his stretched arm in that manner disappearing from the world
  of Brahma appeared before the Blessed One. Brahma Sahamapathy arranging his shawl on one
  shoulder and clasping hands towards the Blessed One said &#145;Let the Blessed One take
  pleasure in the Community of bhikkhus. May the Blessed One welcome the community of
  bhikkhus, As the Blessed One showed compassion to the community in the past, let
  compassion be shown now too. Venerable sir, here, there are new bhikkhus, those gone forth
  recently. If they do not get a chance to see the Blessed One, they would change their
  minds, like small plants that die in want of water. Venerable sir, if these bhikkhus
  recently come to the dispensation do not get a chance to see the Blessed One they would
  change their minds. Like the calf that would be disturbed not seeing the mother. Venerable
  sir, in the same manner if these bhikkhus recently come to the dispensation do not get a
  chance to see the Blessed One they would change their minds. Let the Blessed One take
  pleasure in the Community of bhikkhus. May the Blessed One welcome the community of
  bhikkhus, As the Blessed One showed compassion to the community in the past, let
  compassion be shown now too.&#146; </p>
  <p>The Sakyas of Catuma and Brahma Sahampati could win over the Blessed One with the
  comparison of the plants and the calf. Then venerable Mahamoggallana addressed the
  bhikkhus: &#145;Friends, get up, take your bowls and robes, it was possible for the Sakyas
  of catuma and Brahma Sahampati to win over the Blessed One with the comparison of the
  plants and the calf&#146;. Those bhikkhus agreeing got up from their seats and taking
  bowls and robes, approached the Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side. Then the
  Blessed One spoke to venerable Sariputta. &#145;Sariputta, when I turned away the
  Community of bhikkhus, what occurred to you?&#146; &#145;Venerable sir, it occurred to me.
  The Blessed One will abide in pleasantness here and now, unconcerned, I too will abide in
  pleasantness here and now, unconcerned. Come! Sariputta, you should not arouse such a
  thought in the future&#146; Then the Blessed One addresssed venerable Mahamoggallana:
  &#145;Moggallana, when I turned away the Community of bhikkhus, what occurred to
  you?&#146;.&#146;Venerable sir, it occurrd to me thus: The Blessed One will abide in
  pleasantness here and now unconcerned, I and venerable Sariputta will lead the Community
  of bhikkhus.&#146; &#145;Good! Moggallana, either I or Sariputta and Moggallana should
  lead the Community of bhikkhus&#146;. </p>
  <p>Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: &#145;Bhikkhus, four fears should be
  expected by one descending to water: What four? Fear of, waves, crocodiles, whirl pools
  and alligators. Bhikkhus, these four fears should be expected by one entering<span
  style="mso-spacerun: yes">water. In the same manner four fears should be expected by a
  person leaving the household to become a homeless. What four?. The fear of waves, fear of
  crocodiles, fear of whirl<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">pools and fear of alligators. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, what is the fear of waves? Bhikkhus, a certain son of a clansman out of faith
  goes forth from a household. He becomes a homeless thinking am overcome by birth, decay,
  death, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress.There&#146;s only a few who
  could declare the complete ending of this unpleasantness.The co-associates in the holy
  life, advise him.You should go forward like this, turn and go like this, Look on, like
  thisand look this and other side like this. Thus you should bend your limbs and stretch
  you limbs.Thus you should bear the three robes and bowl. Then it occurs to him: When I was
  a householder, I advised others, here I have to abide by the advice of those who are like
  my sons and grand sons. Then he gives up robes and becomes a layman, out of fear for
  waves, it is said. Bhikkhus, fear of waves is a synonymn for anger and aversion. </p>

  and not drink thus. You should drink the suitable and avoid the unsuitable. Eat, partake
  and taste the suitable and avoid the unsuitable. You should eat and partake at the right
  time, avoid eating food at untimely hours. Then it occurs to him. When I was a
  householder, I ate what I liked, and not what I disliked, Partook what I liked and not
  what I disliked. Drank what I liked and not what I disliked. I ate, partook, tasted and
  drank the suitable and the unsuitable.</span> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">I partook,
  tasted and drank at timely hours and at untimely hours.Householders offer us nourishing

  round, in the village or hamlet controlled in body and speech, mindfulness not established
  and mental faculties not protected. In the village he sees a householder or the son of a
  householder partaking the five strands of sensual pleasures, possessed and provided with
  them. Then it occurs to him, when I was a householder, I too partook these five strands of
  sensual pleasures, possessed and provided. I have wealth in my clan, to enjoy these
  sensual pleasures. I could do merit, too. Then he gives up robes and becomes a layman. He
