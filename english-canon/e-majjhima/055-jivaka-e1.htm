  <b>(55)- A discourse to Jeevaka the foster son of the Prince.</b><o:p></o:p> </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived in Raajagaha, in the mango orchard of Jiivaka, the
  foster son of the prince. Jiivaka the foster son of the prince approached the Blessed One,
  worshipped, sat on a side and said: &#145;I have heard this, venerable sir, that living
  things are killed on account of the recluse Gotama, and he partakes that knowing, it was
  killed on account of him. Venerable sir, those who say, that living things are killed on
  account of the recluse Gotama, and he partakes that, knowing, it was killed on account of
  him, are they saying the rightful words of the Blessed One and not blaming the
  Teaching?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Jeevaka, those who say, that living things are killed on account of the recluse
  Gotama, and he partakes that knowing, because it was killed on account of him. They are
  not my words, and they blame me falsely. Jeevaka, I say that on three instances meat
  should not be partaken, when seen, heard or when there is a doubt. I say, that on these
  three instances meat should not be partaken.I say, that meat could be partaken on three
  instances, when not seen, not heard and when there is no doubt about it. </p>
  <p>Jeevaka, the bhikkhu supported by a village or hamlet sits pervading one direction with
  thoughts of loving kindness, and also the second, third, fourth, above, below and across,
  in all circumstances, for all purposes, towards all. With that thought developed
  limitlessly and grown great without anger. Then a certain householder or the son of a
  householder approaches and invites him for the next day&#146;s meal. If the bhikkhu
  desires he accepts and at the end of that night, putting on robes and taking bowl and
  robes, approaches the house of that householder or the son of the householder and sits on
  the prepared seat. That householder or his son serves him with the nourishing food with
  his own hands. It does not occur to him. This householder should offer me nourishing food
  in the future too. He partakes that morsel food, neither enslaved andswooned, nor guilty.
  Wisely reflecting the danger. Jeevaka, does this bhikkhu think to trouble himself, another
  or both at that moment?&#146;. &#145;No, venerable sir, he does not.&#146; &#145;Jeevaka,
  isn&#146;t this bhikkhu partaking this food without a blemish?&#146; &#145;He is,
  venerable sir I have heard, that Brahma abides, in loving kindness. I witness it in the
  Blessed One. The Blessed One abides in loving kindness.&#146; &#145;Jeevaka, the Thus Gone
  One has dispelled that greed, hate and delusion, pulled it out with the roots, made palm
  stumps and made them not to grow again. If you say it, on account of that, I allow
  it.&#146;&#145;Venerable sir, I say it, on account of that.&#146; &#145;Jeevaka, the
  bhikkhu abides supported on a certain village or hamlet. He abides pervading one direction
  with thoughts of compassion&#133;.With thoughts of intrinsic joy&#133;With equanimity and
  also the second, third, fourth, above, below and across, in all circumstances, for all
  purposes, towards all, equanimity grown great and developed limitlesslywithout anger. Then
  a certain householder or the son of a householder approaches him and invites him for the
  next day&#146;s meal. If the bhikkhu desires he accepts the invitation. At the end of that
  night, putting on robes and taking bowl and robes, he approaches the house of that
  householder or the son of the householder and sits on the prepared seat. That householder
  serves the bhikkhu with the nourishing food with his own hands. It doesn&#146;t occur to
  him, this householder should offer me nourishing food in the future too. He partakes that
  morsel food, not enslaved, not swooned, and without a guilt, wisely reflecting the danger.
  Jeevaka, does this bhikkhu think to trouble himself, another, or trouble both at that
  moment?&#146;. &#145;No, venerable sir, he does not.&#146; &#145;Jeevaka, doesn&#146;t
  this bhikkhu partake this food without a blemish?&#146; &#145;Venerable sir, he partakes
  food without a blemish. .I have heard, that Brahma abides in equanimity. I witness it, in
  the Blessed One. The Blessed One, abides in equanimity.&#146; &#145;Jeevaka, the Thus Gone
  One is not troubled, is detached, and not averse to greed, hate and delusion (* 1), pulled
  it out with the roots, made palm stumps and made not to grow again. If it is said on
  account of that, I allow it.&#146; &#145;Venerable sir, I say it, on account of
  that.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Jeevaka, who ever destroys living things on account of the Thus Gone One or the
  disciples of the Thus Gone One, accumulate much demerit on five instances: If he said, go
  bring that living thing of such name. In this first instance he accumulates much demerit.
  If that living thing is pulled along, tied, with pain at the throat, feeling displeased
  and unpleasant (* 2). In this second instance he accumulates much demerit. If it was said,
  go kill that animal. In this third instance he accumulates much demerit..When killing if
  that animal feels displeased and unpleasant (* 2), in this fourth instance he accumulates,
  much demerit. When the Thus Gone One or a disciple of the Thus Gone tastes that
  unsuitabale food (* 2). In this fifth instance he accumulates much demerit. Jeevaka, if
  anyone destroys the life of a living thing on account of the Thus Gone One or a disciple
  of the Thus Gone One, he accumulates much demerit on these five instances.&#146; When this
  was said Jeevaka the foster son of the prince said; &#145;Wonderful venerable sir, the
  bhikkhus partake suitable faultless food. Now I understand venerable sir. It is as though
  something overturned was reinstated. Something covered was made manifest. As though the
  path was told to someone who had lost his way. As though an oil lamp was lighted, for
  those who have sight to see forms. In various ways the Teaching is explained. Now I take
  refuge in the Blessed One, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. May I be
  remembered as one who has taken refuge from today until life lasts. </p>
  <p><b>Notes:</b> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. The Thus Gone One is not troubled, is detached, and not averse to greed hate and
    delusion.<em>&#146;yena kho Jeevaka raagena yena dosena yena mohena vihesavaa
    assa,arativaa assa pa.tighavaa assa so raago so doso so moho tathaagatassa pahino
    ucchinnamuulo taalavatthukato anabhaavakato aayati.m anuppaadadhammo&#145;</em> When
    equanimity is developed, that person&#146;s nature is such, that he is not troubled, is
    detached and not averse to greed, hate and delusion. </p>
    <p>2. The Blessed One shows five instances when it is demerit to offer meat to the
    bhikkhu. Those are when it is seen, heard, or known, that such and such an animal is
    killed. When it is ordered, kill this animal. When seen it, being pulled along to be
    killed. When seen it going along sad and unpleasant, and when the Thus Gone One or a
    disciple of the Thus Gone One tastes the unsuitable food. If we understand this correctly,
    it is feelings which matter.The Blessed One&#146;s Teaching is completely based on
    feelings. Unpleasantness-&#145;dukkha&#146; is a feeling, and it is for its cessation that
    the Teaching is proclaimed. </p>
