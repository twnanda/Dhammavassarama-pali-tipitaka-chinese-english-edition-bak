  (118) The Discourse on in and out breathing</strong></font></p>
  <p>I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the Pubba monastery in the palace of
  Migaara&#146;s mother, with the thoroughly learned elder disciples, such as venerables
  Saariputta, Mahaamoggallaana, Mahaakassapa, Mahaakaccaayana, Mahaako.t.thita,
  Mahaakappina, Mahaacunda, Anuruddha, Revata, Aananda and other learned elder disciples. At
  that time the elder bhikkhus were advising and instructing the novices. A certain elder
  bhikkhu advised ten novices, another twenty novices, another thirty and yet another forty
  novices. The novices too advised and instructed by the elder bhikkhus attained distinctive
  levels not attained before. On that full moon night the Blessed One was seated outside in
  the moonlight attended by the Community of bhikkhus&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The Blessed One observed the silent Community of bhikkhus and addessed them
  &#145;Bhikkhus, I&#146;m happy and convinced with this mode of progress. Therefore
  bhikkhus arouse much effort to attain the not attained, to realize the not realized, as I
  would be leaving Saavatthi on the full moon day of the fourth month of the rains.&#146;.
  The bhikkhus who had come from the states heard these words and they came to see the
  Blessed One. The elder bhikkhus hearing these words were very pleased and advised and
  instructed the novices. A certain elder bhikkhu advised ten novices, another twenty
  novices, another thirty and yet another forty novices. The novices too advised and
  instructed by the elder bhikkhus attained distinctive levels not attained before. On that
  full moon night of the fourth month of the rains the Blessed One was seated outside, in
  the moonlight attended by the Community of bhikkhus&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Then the Blessed One observed the silent Community of bhikkhus and addressed them.
  Bhikkhus, this gatherig is without idle talk, without empty talk, established in the pure
  essence. Such a gathering is worthy of honour, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings
  and reverential salutation, and it becomes an incomparable field of merit to the
  worldling. Giving a little to such a gathering brings much results, giving much brings
  much more. The sight of such a gathering is rare in the worldIt is suitable to go a long
  distance to see such a gathering with provisions for the journey. In this gathering there
  are worthy ones, desires destroyed, lived the holy life, done what should be done,
  dismissed the weight, come to the highest good, destroyed the bond &#145;to be&#146; and
  rightly knowing released. In this gathering there are bhikkhus who have destroyed the five
  lower bonds of the sensual world and are born spontaneously, not to proceed but to
  extinguish in that same birthIn this gathering there are bhikkhus, who have destroyed
  three bonds and dwindling greed, hate and delusion, would come to this world once more and
  make an end of unpleasantness. In this gathering there are bhikkhus, who have destroyed
  three bonds and have entered the stream of the Teaching, not falling from there, are sure
  of enlightenment. In this gathering there are bhikkhus, yoked to developping the four
  establishments of mindfulness. In this gathering there are bhikkhus, yoked to developping
  the four right endeavours. In this gathering there are bhikkhus, yoked to developping the
  four ways of making determinations.In this gathering there are bhikkhus, yoked to
  developping the five mental faculties. In this gathering there are bhikkhus, yoked to
  developping the five powers.In this gathering there are bhikkhus, yoked to developping the
  seven enlightenment factors. In this gathering there are bhikkhus, yoked to developping
  the Noble eightfold pathIn this gathering there are bhikkhus, yoked to developping Loving
  kindnessIn this gathering there are bhikkhus, yoked to developping Compassion. In this
  gathering there are bhikkhus, yoked to developping Intrinsic joy. In this gathering there
  are bhikkhus, yoked to developping Equanimity. In this gathering there are bhikkhus, yoked
  to developping Loathsomeness.In this gathering there are bhikkhus, yoked to developping
  the perception of impermanence. In this gathering there are bhikkhus, yoked to developping
  Mindfulness of in and out breathing. Bhikkhus, in and out breathing developped and made
  much brings much results and great results. When it is developped and made much, the four
  establishments of mindfulness get completed. When the the four establishments of
  mindfulness are developped and made much the seven enlightenment factors get completed
  When the seven enlightenment factors are developped and made much the knowledge of release
  gets completed. Bhikkhus, how is, in and out breathing developped and made much?&nbsp; </p>
  <p>How does it bring much results and great results? The bhikkhu, gone to the forest, or
  to the root of a tree, or to an empty house, sits legs crossed, the body straight, and
  mindfulness established in front. Mindfully he breathes in or breathes out. Breathing in
  long knows, I breathe in long. Breathing out long knows, I breathe out long.Breathing in
  short knows, I breathe in short. Breathing out short knows, I breathe out short. Trains,
  calming the bodily determination I breathe in. Trains,calming the bodily determination I
  breathe out. Trains, experiencing joy I breathe in. Trains, experiencing joy I breathe out
  Trains, experiencing pleasantness I breathe in. Trains, experiencing pleasantness I

  reflecting cessation. I breathe out. Trains,reflecting giving up.I breathe in. Trains,
  reflecting giving up, I breathe out. Developped.and made much in this manner, in and out
  breathing brings much fruit and great benfits. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, in and out breathing developped and made muchin which manner, do the four
  establishments of mindfulness get completed? Bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu breathing in long
  knows, I breathe in long. Breathing out long knows, I breathe out long.Breathing in short
  knows, I breathe in short. Breathing out short knows, I breathe out short. Trains, calming
  the bodily determination, I breathe in and out, at such times he reflects the body in the
  body. At such times he is zealous to be mindful and aware to dispel covetousness and
  displeasure for the world. Bhikkhus, I say in breaths and out breaths are a special
  feature in the body. Therefore bhikkhus, at such times, the bhikkhu abides reflecting the
  body in the body zealous to be mindful and aware to dispel covetousness and displeasure
  for the world. Bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu trains experiencing joy I breathe in and out
  Trains experiencing pleasantness I breathe in.and out.Trains experiencing the mental
  determination I breathe in and out. Trains calming the mental determination, I breathe in
  and out.at such times he reflects feelings in feelings. At such times he is zealous to be
  mindful and aware to dispel covetousness and displeasure for the world. Bhikkhus, I say in
  breaths and out breaths are a special feature of feelings, when they are carefully
  attended to. Therefore bhikkhus, at such times, the bhikkhu abides reflecting feelings in
  feelings zealous to be mindful and aware to dispel covetousness and displeasure for the
  world..Bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu trains experiencing the mental state, I breathe in and
  out. Trains with a rejoicing mind I breathe in and out. Trains with a concentrated mind
  Ibreathe in and out.Trains with a released mind. I breathe in and out, at such times he
  reflects the mental states in the mind. At such times he is zealous to be mindful and
  aware to dispel covetousness and displeasure for the world. Bhikkhus, I do not declare in
  and out breathing to the forgetful careless, one. Therefore bhikkhus, at such times, the
  bhikkhu abides reflecting the mental states in the mind zealous to be mindful and aware to
  dispel covetousness and displeasure for the world. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, when the bhikkhutrains, reflecting impermanence I breathe in and out. Trains,
  reflecting detachment. I breathe in.and out. Trains, reflecting cessation. I breathe
  in.and out. Trains, reflecting giving up.I breathe in.and out, at such times he reflects
  thoughts in the Teaching. At such times he is zealous to be mindful and aware to dispel
  covetousness and displeasure for the world. He wisely attends to the dispelling of
  whatever covetousness and displeasure in the world and masters it. Therefore bhikkhus, at
  such times, the bhikkhu abides reflecting thoughts in the Teaching, zealous to be mindful
  and aware to dispel covetousness and displeasure for the world. Bhikkhus, when developped
  and made much in this manner the four foundations of mindfulness get completed. </p>
  <p>The four establishments of mindfulness developped and made much in which manner, do the
  seven enlightenment factors get completed? Bhikkhus, at the time the bhikkhu abides
  reflecting the body in the body mindful and aware to dispel covetousness and displeasure
  for the world, his mindfulness is established without forgetfulness. At a time the
  bhikkhu&#146;s mindfulness is established, the enlightenment factor mindfulness is
  established to the bhikkhu, at that time the bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor
  mindfulness.and completes it.He abides with those thoughts mindfully examining them,
  wisely searchingfor the solution..Bhikkhus, at a time the bhikku abides thus,
  mindfullyexamining the Teaching wisely, to search for the solution, he develops the
  enlightenment factor the investigation of the Teaching, and completes it. When those
  thoughts are wisely examined for a direct solution with aroused effort the enlightenment
  factor effort, is establishedto the bhikkhu, at that time the bhikkhu develops the
  enlightenment factor effort and completes it.With the aroused effort arises immaterial
  joy. When immaterial joy arises the bhikkhu is established in the enlightenment factor joy
  and it gets completed. When the mind is joyful the body is appeased, so too the mind. When
  the mind and body are appeased, the enlightenment factor appeasement gets established in
  the bhikkhu, with development it gets completed. When the body is appeased the pleasant
  mind concentrates. At that time the bhikkhu is established in the enlightenment factor
  concentration, with development it gets completed. The bhikkhu thoroughly examines the
  concentrated mind. At that time the bhikkhu is established in the enlightenment factor
  equanimity, with development it gets completed. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, at the time the bhikkhu abides reflecting feelings in feelings, ...re... the
  mental states in the mind,.....re...... thoughts in the Teaching, mindful and aware to
  dispel covetousness and displeasure for the world, his mindfulness is established without
  forgetfulness. At a time the bhikkhu&#146;s mindfulness is established, the enlightenment
  factor mindfulness is established to the bhikkhu, at that time the bhikkhu develops the
  enlightenment factor mindfulness.and completes it.He abides with those thoughts mindfully
  examining them, wisely searchingfor the solution..Bhikkhus, at a time the bhikku abides
  thus, mindfullyexamining the Teaching wisely, to search for the solution, he develops the
  enlightenment factor the investigation of the Teaching, and completes it. When those
  thoughts are wisely examined for a direct solution with aroused effort the enlightenment
  factor effort, is establishedto the bhikkhu, at that time the bhikkhu develops the
  enlightenment factor effort and completes it.With the aroused effort arises immaterial
  joy. When immaterial joy arises the bhikkhu is established in the enlightenment factor joy
  and it gets completed. When the mind is joyful the body is appeased, so too the mind. When
  the mind and body are appeased, the enlightenment factor appeasement gets established in
  the bhikkhu, with development it gets completed. When the body is appeased the pleasant
  mind concentrates. At that time the bhikkhu is established in the enlightenment factor
  concentration, with development it gets completed. The bhikkhu thoroughly examines the
  concentrated mind. At that time the bhikkhu is established in the enlightenment factor
  equanimity, with development it gets completed. </p>
  <p>When the four establishments of mindfulness are thus developped and made muchthe seven
  enlightenment factors get completed. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, the seven enlightenment factors developped and made much in which manner does
  knowledge of the path get completed? The bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor
  mindfulness bent on seclusion, detachment, cessation, ending in relinquishing The bhikkhu
  develops the enlightenment factor investigation of the Teaching bent on seclusion,
  detachment, cessation, ending in relinquishing The bhikkhu develops the enlightenment
  factor effort bent on seclusion, detachment, cessation ending in relinquishing The bhikkhu
  develops the enlightenment factor joy bent on seclusion, detachment, cessation ending in
  relinquishing The bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor appeasement bent on seclusion,
  detachment, cessation ending in relinquishing The bhikkhu develops the enlightenment
  factor concentration bent on seclusion, detachment, cessation ending in relinquishing The
  bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor equanimity bent on seclusion, detachment,
  cessation ending in relinquishing. Bhikkhus, developped and made much in this manner
  knowledge of the path gets completed.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhu delighted in the words of the Blessed One. </p>
