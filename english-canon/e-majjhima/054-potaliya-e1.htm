  <b>(54) To The Householder Potaliya.</b><o:p></o:p> </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived in Anguttaraapa in a hamlet named Aapana in the
  bazaar. Then the Blessed One put on robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes entered
  Aapana for alms. After returning from the alms round and after the meal was over, the
  Blessed One entered a forest stretch and sat at the root of a tree to spend the day. The
  householder Potaliya too completely dressed and with a tent, walking and wandering for
  exercise, entered the forest stretch and approached the Blessed One, exchanged friendly
  greetings and stood on a side. Then the Blessed One addressed the
  householder.:&#146;Householder, there are seats, if you wish sit.&#146; When this was
  said, the householder Potaliya, thought the recluse Gotama, addresses me as a householder,
  was angry and averse and would not talk. For the second time the Blessed One said
  &#145;Householder, there are seats if you wish sit.&#146; When this was said, the
  householder Potaliya, thought the recluse Gotama, addresses me as a householder, was angry
  and averse and would not talk For the third time the Blessed One said. &#145;Householder,
  there are seats, if you wish sit.&#146; When this was said, the householder Potaliya,
  thought the recluse Gotama, addresses me as a householder, was angry and averse and said.
  &#145;It is not suitable that the recluse Gotama should address me as a householder.&#146;
  &#145;By your signs and attributes, you are a householder.&#146; &#145;Good Gotama, I have
  come to the end of all my actions and business. Whatever I had as wealth, grains, gold and
  silver is given to my sons and I do not advise or blame them. I care only for my food and
  clothing. Thus I have come to the end of all my actions and business.&#146;
  &#145;Householder, your ending of all actions and business is different from the ending of
  all actions and business in the noble ones Dispensation.&#146; &#145;Venerable sir, it is
  good if the Blessed One teaches me the ending of all actions and business in the noble
  ones Dispensation.&#146; &#145;Then householder, listen carefully, I will preach. </p>
  <p>Householder, there are eight ways to end all actions and business in the noble ones
  dispensation. What are the eight?. Householder, for the purpose of not destroying life,
  destruction done to life, should be given up. For the purpose of taking what is given,
  taking the not given should be given up. For the purpose of talking the truth, telling
  lies should be given up. For the purpose of not slandering, slandering should be given up.
  For the purpose of not coveting and non-greed, coveting and greed should be given up. For
  the purpose of maintaining blameless non-aversion, blameful aversion should be given up.
  For the purpose of maintaining non-anger and non-malice, anger and malice should be given
  up. For the sake of non-conceit, conceit should be given up. These stated in short conduce
  to the ending of all actions and business in the dispensation of the noble ones.&#146;
  &#145;Venerable sir, may the Blessed One explain, out of compassion, these eight things
  that conduce to the ending of actions and business in the noble one&#146;s
  Dispensation.&#146;&#145;Householder, listen and attend carefully, I will tell. </p>
  <p>It was said, for the purpose of not destroying living things, destroying life should be
  given up, why was it said? Householder, the noble disciple reflects, on account of
  whatever bonds I was a destroyer of living things, I have fallen to the method of
  destroying those bonds. If I destroy living things, myself will blame me, when the wise
  ones know about it, they will blame me. After death, a decrease should be expected. These
  are the bonds and obstructions, for the destruction of living things. Desires, trouble and
  displeasure may arise to those destroying living things, they are not, to those that
  abstain from destroying life. If it was said, for the purpose of not destroying living
  things, destroying life should be given up, it was said on account of this. </p>

  was it said so?. Householder, the noble disciple reflects on account of whatever bonds, I
  was telling lies, I have fallen to the method of destroying those bonds. If I tell lies
  myself will blame me. When the wise ones know about it, they will blame me. After death a
  decrease should be expected. These are the bonds and obstructions for telling lies.

  should be given up. Why was it said so? Householder, the noble disciple reflects, on

  <p>.Householder, these are the eight things stated in short and explained, for the ending
  of business and actions in the dispensation of the noble ones. Yet with this much only,
  actions and business will not come to the end in the noble ones&#146; Dispensation.&#146;
  &#145;Venerable sir, how does the complete ending of actions and business come about in
  the dispensation of the noble ones. Sir, it would be for my good, if the Blessed One
  explain the complete ending of actions and business in the noble one&#146;s
  Dispensation.&#146;&#145;Listen carefully, householder, I will tell. </p>
  <p>Householder, a clever butcher or his apprentice would throw a fleshless blood stained
  bone, devoid of any flesh, to a hungry dog, waiting near a slaughter- house Householder
  would that dog licking that blood stained fleshless bone get over his hunger? No,
  venerable sir, it wouldn&#146;t&#146; &#145;What, is the reason?&#146; &#145;That dog
  licking that blood stained fleshless bone, would gain fatigue and weariness only.&#146;
  &#145;In the same manner, the noble disciple reflects. The Blessed One has said that
  sensual desires are comparable to a bone, it brings much unpleasantness and much trouble,
  the danger here is much. This should be seen with equanimity and right wisdom, as it
  really is, and the various interests, should be turned out, A single interest and
  attachment should be developed with equanimity (*), in which all worldly material
  interests fade completely and equanimity should be developed further.. </p>
  <p>. Householder, a vulture, a crow, or a hawk would snatch a piece of flesh and would fly
  away with it, another crow, hawk or vulture seeing it would, pursue it, follow it and
  snatch the piece of flesh. Householder, if that vulture, crow or hawk does not give up
  that piece of flesh, wouldn&#146;t he come to death or deathly unpleasantness?&#146;
  &#145;He would, venerable sir&#146;. &#145;In the same manner, the noble disciple
  reflects. The Blessed One said that sensual desires are comparable to a piece of flesh

  <p>Householder, a man with a blazing grass torch would go against the wind Householder, if
  that man does not give up that blazing grass torch wouldn&#146;t he burn his hand, or arm
  or any other limb small or large? Wouldn&#146;t he come to death or deathly
  unpleasaantness?&#146; &#145;He would, venerable sir.&#146; &#145;In the same manner, the

  flames, a man who likes pleasantness, wants to live comes along and two strong men take
  him by his hands and feet and drag him along to the pit of charcoal.Householder,
  wouldn&#146;t his body writhe to get away from it? What is the reason?&#146;:
  &#145;Venerable sir, he knows, if I fall into this pit of charcoal, I will come to death
  or deathly unpleasantness.&#146; &#145;In the same manner, the noble disciple reflects.

  worldly material interests fade completely and equanimity should be develop further. </p>
  <p>. Householder, a man in his dreams would see delightful monuments, forests, flat lands
  and ponds, when he wakes he would not see any of them. In the same manner, the noble
  disciple reflects. The Blessed One has said that sensual desires are comparable to a
  dream, it brings much unpleasantness trouble and danger. This shouldbe seen with
  equanimity and right wisdom, as it really is, and the various interests, should be turned
  out, A single interest and attachment should be developed with equanimity (*), in which

  <p>Householder, a man who had borrowed some ear-rings, and fashionable ornaments would
  deck himself in them and would go to the bazaar. People, seeing him would say, looks like
  a rich man. When the owners see him, they would take their belongings. Householder,
  wouldn&#146;t that man be better in his own appearance?&#146;. &#145;He would be better,
  venerable sir.&#146; &#145;In the same manner, the noble disciple reflects. The Blessed
  One has said that sensual desires are comparable to borrowed things, that bring much
  unpleasantness trouble and danger This should be seen with equanimity and right wisdom, as

  attachment should be developed with equanimity (*) , in which all worldly material
  interests fade completely and equanimity should be developed further. </p>
  <p>Householder, close to a village or hamlet, there is a stretch of dense forest, and in
  it, there is a tree full of fruits. A man in search of fruits coming to this tree, and not
  seeing any fallen on the ground, would climb it and eat as much as he liked. He would fill
  his sling with some of the fruits. Another man with a sharp dagger going in search of
  fruits, would come to this same tree and not seeing any fruits fallen, and not able to
  climb the tree, would cut down the tree. Householder, if the man who had climbed the tree
  had not come down quickly, wouldn&#146;t he die, or come to deathly unpleasantness
  breaking one or the other of his limbs?&#146; &#145;Yes, venerable sir, he would.&#146;
  &#145;In the same manner, the noble disciple reflects. The Blessed One had said that
  sensual desires are comparable to a tree full of fruits. It brings much unpleasantness
  trouble and danger. This should be seen with equanimity and right wisdom, as it really is,

  be developed with equanimity (*) , in which all worldly material interests fade completely
  and equanimity should be developed further. </p>
  <p>Householder, the noble disciple come to this purity of mind through equanimity
  recollects the manifold previous births such as one birth, two births, ---with all modes
  and all details would recollect the various previous births. Householder, the noble
  disciple come to this purity of mind through equanimity with the heavenly eye purified
  above human, would see beings disappearing and appearing in un exalted and exalted states,
  beautiful and ugly in good and bad states---- would see beings according their actions.
  Householder, the noble disciple come to this purity through equanimity, has released his
  mind, is released through wisdom and would abide in that release here and now. </p>
  <p>Householder, this is the ending of all actions and business in the dispensation of the
  nobe ones. Householder, do you see this ending of all actions and business in the
  Dispensation of the noble ones, evident in you?&#146; &#145;What am I, venerable sir, I am
  far away from ending of all actions and business of the dispensation of the noble ones.
  Venerable sir, earlier, we thought, the ascetics of other sects were thoroughbreds and fed
  them thinking they were thoroughbreds, and placed faith in them. The bhikkhus, we thought
  were not thoroughbreds, fed them thinking they were not thoroughbreds and did not place
  faith in them, thinking they were not thoroughbreds. Now we know the ascetics of other
  sects are not the thoroughbreds, and feed them knowing they are not the thoroughbreds and
  do not place faith in them. Now we know that the bhikkhus are the thoroughbreds, feed them
  knowing that they are the thoroughbreds and place faith in them, knowing they are
  thoroughbreds. Venerable sir, you have produced in me love and reverence for the recluses.
  Now I understand venerable sir. It is as though something overturned is reinstalled.
  Something covered is made manifest. As though the path was shown to someone who had lost
  his way. It is like an oil lamp was lighted for the darkness, so that, those who have
  sight could see forms. In various ways the Blessed One has explained the Teaching. Now I
  take refuge in the Blessed One, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. May I be
  remembered as a lay disciple who has taken refuge from today till life lasts.&#146; </p>
