  <b>(20) The Discursively Thinking Mind.</b> </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus. </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapinddika in
  Jeta&#146;s grove in Saavatthi. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from
  there.&quot;Bhikkhus, by the bhikkhu developing the mind five things should be attended to
  from time to time. What five:The bhikkhu attending to a certain sign if evil demeritorious
  thoughts arise conductive to interest, anger and delusion, he should change that sign and
  attend to some other sign conductive to merit, then those signs conductive to interest,
  anger and delusion fade, and the mind settles and comes to a single point. Like a clever
  carpenter or his apprentice would get rid of a coarse peg with the help of a fine peg. In
  the same manner the bhikkhu attending to a certain sign, if evil demeritorious thoughts
  arise conductive to interest, anger and delusion, he should change that sign and attend to
  some other sign conductive to merit, then those signs conductive to interest, anger and
  delusion fade, the mind settles and comes to a single point.</p>
  <p>Even when the bhikkhu has changed the sign and attended some other sign, if evil
  demeritorious thoughts arise conductive to interest, anger and delusion, the bhikkhu
  should examine the dangers of those thoughts.These thoughts of mine are evil, faulty and
  bring unpleasant results. When the dangers of those thoughts are examined those evil
  demeritorious thoughts conductive to interest, anger and delusion fade. With their fading
  the mind settles and comes to a sigle point. Like a woman, a man, a child or youth fond of
  adornment would loathe and would be disgusted when the carcase of a snake, dog or a human
  corpse was wrapped round the neck. In the same manner when the bhikkhu has changed the
  sign and attended some other sign, if evil demeritorious thoughts arise conductive to
  interest, anger and delusion, the bhikkhu should examine the dangers of those thoughts.
  These thoughts of mine are evil, loathesome, faulty and bring unpleasant results. When the
  dangers of those thoughts are examined, those evil demeritorious thoughts conductive to
  interest, anger and delusion fade. With their fading the mind settles and comes to a
  single point. </p>
  <p>Even when the bhikkhu has examined the dangers of those evil demeritorious thoughts
  conductive to interest, anger and delusion, if those evil demeritorious thoughts conducive
  to interest, anger and delusion arise, he should not attend to them. When those evil
  demeritorious thoughts conductive to interest, anger and delusion are not attended, they
  fade. With their fading the mind settles and comes to a single point. Like a man who would
  not like to see forms, that come to the purview would either close his eyes or look away.
  In the same manner when the bhikkhu has examined the dangers of those evil demeritorious
  thoughts conductive to interest, anger and delusion, if evil demeritorious thoughts
  conductive to interest, anger and delusion arise, he should not attend to them. When those
  evil demeritorious thoughts conductive to interest, anger and delusion are not attended,
  they fade. With their fading the mind settles and comes to a single point. </p>
  <p>Even when the bhikkhu did not attend to those evil demeritorious thoughts conductive to
  interest, anger and delusion, if these evil demeritorious thoughts conductive to interest,
  anger and delusion arise, he should attend to appeasing the whole intentional thought
  process. When attending to appeassing the whole intentional thought process, those evil
  demeritorious thoughts conductive to interest, anger and delusion fade. With their fading
  the mind settles and comes to a single point. Like it would occur to a man walking fast:
  why should I walk fast, what if I stand. Then he would stand. Standing it would occur to
  him: Why should I stand, what if I sit. Then he would sit. Sitting it would occur to him:
  Why should I sit, what if I lie.Thus abandoning the more coarse posture, would maintain
  the finer posture. In the same manner when attending to appeasing the whole intentional
  thought process, those evil demeritorious thoughts conductive to interest, anger and
  delusion fade. With their fading the mind settles and comes to a single point. . </p>
  <p>Even when attending to appeasing the whole intentional thought process, those evil
  demeritorious thoughts conductive to interest, anger and delusion arise, the bhikkhu
  should press the upper jaw on the lower jaw and pushing the tongue on the palate should
  subdue and burn out those evil demeritorious thoughts conductive to interest, anger and
  delusion. Then those evil demeritorious thoughts conductive to interest, anger and
  delusion fade. With their fading the mind settles and comes to a single point. Like a
  strong man taking a weaker one by the head or body would press him and trouble him. In the
  same manner the bhikkhu should press the upper jaw on the lower jaw and pushing the tongue
  on the palate should subdue and burn out those evil demeritorious thoughts conductive to
  interest, anger and delusion. Then those evil demeritorious thoughts conductive to
  interest, anger and delusion fade. With their fading the mind settles and comes to one
  point. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu attending to a certain sign, if evil demeritorious thoughts
  conductive to interest, anger and delusion arise, he attends to another sign conductive to
  merit, those evil demeritorious thoughts conductive to interest, anger and delusion fade.
  With their fading the mind settles and comes to one point . </p>
  <p>When attending to the danger of those evil demeritorious thoughts conductive to
  interest, anger and delusion, those evil demeritorious thoughts conductive to interest,
  anger and delusion fade. With their fading the mind settles and comes to one point.:When
  not attending to those evil demeritorious thoughts conductive to interest, anger and
  delusion, those evil demeritorious thoughts conductive to interest, anger and delusion
  fade. With their fading the mind settles and comes to one point: When attending to
  appeasing the whole intentional thought process, these evil demeritorious thoughts
  conductive to interest, anger and delusion fade. With their fading the mind settles and
  comes to one point, The bhikkhu pressing the lower jaw with the upper jaw and pushing the
  tongue on the palate would subdue and burn out those evil demeritorious thoughts
  conductive to interest, anger and delusion. Then those evil demeritorious thoughts
  conductive to interest, anger and delusion fade. With their fading the mind settles and
  comes to one point. Bhikkhus, this is called the bhikkhu is master over thought
  processes..Whatever thought he wants to think, that he thinks, whatever thought he does
  not want to think, that he does not think He puts an end to craving , dispels the bonds
  and rightfully overcoming measuring makes an end of unpleasantness. . </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said thus, and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed
  One. </p>
