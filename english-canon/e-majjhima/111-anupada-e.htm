  (111) Uninterrupted Concentration.</strong></font></p>
  <p>I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika in
  Jeta&#146;s grove in Saavatthi. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from
  there.&#146;Bhikkus, Saariputta is wise, has wide wisdom, bright intelligence, spontaneous
  and sharp wisdom and penetrating wisdom. Saariputta concentrates a fortinight
  uninterrupted, secluded from sensual desires and thoughts of demerit, with thoughts and
  thought processes and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion abides in the first
  jhaana. These things of the first jhaana such as thoughts, thought processes, joy,
  pleasantness, one pointedness of mind, contact, feelings, perceptions, intentions,
  interest, resolution, effort, mindfulness, equanimity and attention, follow one after the
  other to him. They rise, persist and fade with his knowledge. He knows, these things come
  to be and cause feelings to rise. When these things follow one after the other, he abides
  with a mind that does not settle, is not bound, is released and unyokedand is
  unrestricted. knows there is an escape beyond this. With much practise they come to
  him.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, Saariputta, overcoming thoughts and thought processes, the mind
  internally appeased in one point, with joy and pleasaantness born of concentration abides
  in the second jhaanaThese things of the second jhaana such as internal appeasement, joy,
  pleasantness, one pointedness of mind, contact, feelings, perceptions, intentions,
  interest, resolution, effort, mindfulness, equanimity and attention, follow one after the
  other, to him. They rise, persist and fade with his knowledge. He knows, these things come
  to be and cause feelings to rise. When these things follow one after the other, he abides
  with a mind that does not settle, is not bound, is released and unyokedand is
  unrestricted. knows there is an escape beyond this. With much practise they come to him. </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, Saariputta, with equanimity to joy and detachment abides mindful and
  aware, and with the body experiences pleasantness too and abdes in the third jhaana. The
  noble ones say it&#146;s abiding in pleasantness mindfully.These things of the third
  jhaana such as equanimity, pleasantness, mindful awareness, one pointedness of mind,
  contact, feelings, perceptions, intentions, interest, resolution, effort, equanimity and
  attention, follow one after the other to him. They rise, persist and fade with his
  knowledge. He knows, these things come to be and cause feelings to rise. When these things
  follow one after the other, he abides with a mind that does not settle, is not bound, is
  released unyoked and unrestricted. knows there is an escape beyond this. With much
  practise they come to him.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, Saariputta, dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness, earlier having
  overcome pleasure and displeasure purifying mindfulness with equanimity abides in the
  fourth jhaana These things of the fourth jhaana such as equanimity, neither unpleasant nor
  pleasant feelings, observed feelings not enjoyed, purified mindfulness, one pointedness of
  mind, contact, feelings, perceptions, intentions, interest, resolution, effort, equanimity
  and attention, follow one after the other to him. They rise, persist and fade with his
  knowledge. He knows, these things come to be and cause feelings to rise. When these things
  follow one after the other, he abides with a mind that does not settle, is not bound, is
  released and unyokedand is unrestricted. knows there is an escape beyond this. With much
  practise they come to him.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, Saariputta, overcoming all perceptions, of matter and anger, not
  attending to various perceptions, with space is boundless attains to the sphere of space.
  Those things of the sphere of space such as the perception of space,one pointedness of
  mind, contact, feelings, perceptions, intentions, interest, resolution, effort, equanimity
  and attention, follow one after the other to him.They rise, persist and fade with his
  knowledge. He knows, these things come to be and cause feelings to rise. When these things
  follow one after the other, he abides with a mind that does not settle, is not bound, is
  released unyoked and unrestricted. knows there is an escape beyond this. With much
  practise they come to him.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, Saariputta, overcoming all perceptions of space with consciousness is
  boundless attains to the sphere of consciousness. Those things of the sphere of
  consciousness such as the perception of consciousness,one pointedness of mind, contact,
  feelings, perceptions, intentions, interest, resolution, effort, equanimity and attention,
  follow one after the other. They rise, persist and fade with his knowledge. He knows,
  these things come to be and cause feelings to rise. When these things follow one after the
  other, he abides with a mind that does not settle, is not bound, is released and
  unyokedand is unrestricted. knows there is an escape beyond this. With much practise they
  come to him. </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, Saariputta, overcoming all perceptions of consciousness with there is
  nothing attains to the sphere of nothingness. Those things of the sphere of nothingness
  such as the perception of nothingness,one pointedness of mind, contact, feelings,
  perceptions, intentions, interest, resolution, effort, equanimity and attention, follow
  one after the other to him. They rise, persist and fade with his knowledge. He knows,
  these things come to be and cause feelings to rise. When these things follow one after the
  other, he abides with a mind that does not settle, is not bound, is released, unyokedand
  unrestricted. knows there is an escape beyond this. With much practise they come to him. </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, Saariputta, overcoming all perceptions of nothingnessattains to the
  sphere of neither perception nor non perception. He mindfully rises from that attainment
  and reflects the things, that have passed away ceased and changed.He knows, these things
  come to be and cause feelings to rise. When these things follow one after the other, he
  abides with a mind that does not settle, is not bound, is released and unyokedand
  unrestricted. knows there is an escape beyond this. With much practise they come to him. </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, Saariputta, overcoming all the sphere of neither perception nor non
  perception attains the cessation of perceptions and feelings. Seeing it with wisdom his
  desires get destroyed. He mindfully rises from that attainment and reflects the things,
  that have passed away ceased and changed.He knows, these things come to be and cause
  feelings to rise. When these things follow one after the other, he abides with a mind that
  does not settle, is not bound, is released unyokedand unrestricted. knows there is nothing
  beyond this. With much practise nothing comes to him. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, saying it rightly, it is Saariputta that has mastered and completed the noble
  ones&#146; virtues, mastered and completed the noble ones&#146; concentration, mastered
  and completed the noble ones&#146; perception, mastered and completed the noble ones&#146;
  release. Sayng it rightly it is only Saariputta that has mastered and completed the noble
  ones&#146; virtues, concentration, wisdom and release. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, saying it rightly, he is the Blessed One&#146;s own son born of the mouth,
  born of the Teaching, the sign of the Teaching, the heritage of the Teaching and notone
  born from the heritage of material. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, Saariputta follows rolling the noble wheel of the Teaching, rightfully rolled
  by the Thus Gone One.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One.
