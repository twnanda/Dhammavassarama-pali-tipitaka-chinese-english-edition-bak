  <b>142. Classification of Offerings</b> </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived with the Sakyas in Nigrodha&#146;s monastery in
  Kapilavatthu. Then Mahapajaapati Gotamii taking a set of new clothes approached the
  Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said. &#145;Venerable sir to make this set of
  clothes for the Blessed One I spun and wove the cloth. May the Blessed One accept this set
  of clothes from me, out of compassion.&#146; The Blessed One said. &#146;Gotamii, offer it
  to the Community. When offered to the Community, it will be offered to me as well.&#146;
  For the second time Mahapajaapati Gotamii said &#145;Venerable sir to make this set of
  clothes for the Blessed One, I spun and wove the cloth. May the Blessed One accept this
  set of clothes from me, out of compassion.&#146; For the second time the Blessed One said.
  &#146;Gotamii, offer it to the Community. When offered to the Community, it will be
  offered to me as well.&#146; For the third time Mahapajaapati Gotamii said &#145;Venerable
  sir to make this set of clothes for the Blessed One I spun and wove the cloth. May the
  Blessed One accept this set of clothes from me, out of compassion.&#146; For the third
  time the Blessed One said. &#146;Gotamii, offer it to the Community. When offered to the
  Community, it will be offered to me as well.&#146; </p>
  <p>Hearing this venerable Aananda said to the Blessed One.&#146;Venerable sir, accept the
  set of new clothes from Mahapajaapatii Gotami. She was of much help to you, as stepmother,
  supporter, the one who fed milk, when the Blessed One&#146;s mother died. The Blessed One
  too was of great help to Mahapajaapati Gotamii Come to the Blessed One she took refuge in
  the Enlightenment, in the Teaching and the Community. Come to the Blessed One she
  abstained from, taking the life of living things, taking what is not given, misbehaving
  sexually, telling lies and taking intoxicating drinks. Come to the Blessed One
  Mahapajaapati Gotami got established in unwavering faith in Enlightenment, in the Teaching
  and the Community. Come to the Blessed One Mahajaapati Gotamii dispelled doubts about the
  truth of unpleasantness, its arising, its cessation and the path and method leading to its
  cessation. Thus the Blessed One was of great help to Mahapajaapati Gotami&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;That is so. Aananda, if a person come to another person, took refuge in the
  Enlightenment, the Teaching and the Community. I say the gratitude he has to return to
  that second person, is not repaid by joining hands in veneration, getting up and offering
  a seat on arrival, exchanging pleasant conversation and offering robes, morsel food,
  dwellings and requisites when ill. Aananda, if a person come to another person, abstained,
  from taking the life of living things, taking what is not given, misbehaving sexually,
  telling lies and taking intoxicating drinks. I say the gratitude he has to return to that
  second person, is not repaid by joining hands in veneration, getting up and offering a
  seat on arrival, exchanging pleasant conversation and offering robes, morsel food,
  dwellings and requisites when ill. Aananda, if a person come to another person, is
  established in unwavering faith in the Enlightenment, the Teaching and the Community. I
  say the gratitude he has to return to that second person, is not repaid by joining hands
  in veneration, getting up and offering a seat on arrival, exchanging pleasant conversation
  and offering robes, morsel food, dwellings and requisites when ill. Aananda, if a person
  meeting another person, became virtuous. I say the gratitude he has to return to that
  second person, is not repaid by joining hands in veneration, getting up and offering a
  seat on arrival, exchanging pleasant conversation and offering robes, morsel food,
  dwellings and requisites when ill. Aananda, if a person, met another person and dispelled
  his doubts about the Enlightenment, the Teaching and the Community. I say the gratitude he
  has to return to that second person, is not repaid by joining hands in veneration, getting
  up and offering a seat on arrival, exchanging pleasant conversation and offering robes,
  morsel food, dwellings and requisites when ill. </p>
  <p>Aananda, there are fourteen personal offerings that could be made. An offering made to
  the Thus Gone One, worthy and rightfully enlightened is the first personal offering. An
  offering made to the silent Enlightened One, is the second personal offering. An offering
  made to a worthy disciple, (*1) is the third personal offering. An offering made to a
  person fallen to the method of realizing worthiness, (*2) is the fourth personal offering.
  An offering made to a non-returner, (*3) is the fifth personal offering. An offering made
  to a person fallen to the method of realizing the state of non-returning is the sixth
  personal offering. An offering made to one, returning once, (*4) is the seventh personal
  offering. An offering made to a person fallen to the method of realizing the state of
  returning once is the eighth personal offering. An offering made to one who has entered
  the stream of the Teaching is the ninth personal offering. An offering made to a person
  fallen to the method of realizing the state of entry into the stream of the Teaching is
  the tenth personal offering. An offering made to one, not greedy and turned away from
  sensuality is the eleventh personal offering. An offering made to an ordinary virtuous
  person is the twelfth personal offering. An offering made to an ordinary not virtuous
  person is the thirteenth personal offering. An offering made to an animal is the
  fourteenth personal offering. . </p>
  <p>Aananda, of an offering made to an animal the results expected are by hundreds. Of an
  offering made to an ordinary not virtuous person the results expected are by thousands. Of
  an offering made to an ordinary virtuous person the results expected are by hundred
  -thousands Of an offering made to a not greedy one, turned away from sensuality the
  results expected are by hundred thousand millions. Of an offering made to a person fallen
  to the method of realizing the state of entry into the stream of the Teaching, the results
  expected are innumerable and unlimited. What would be the results for offering a gift to a
  stream entrant of the Teaching? Or one fallen to the method of realizing the state of not
  returning? Or one who would not return? Or one fallen to the method of realizing
  worthiness? Or a worthy disciple of the Thus Gone One? Or the silent enlightened One? Or
  the worthy, rightfully enlightened Thus Gone One? </p>
  <p>. Aananda, these seven are the offerings made to the Community. An offering to both
  bhikkhus and bhikkhunis headed by the Blessed One. This is the first offering made to the
  Community. After the demise of the Blessed One, an offering made to both bhikkhus and
  bhikkhunis. This is the second offering made to the Community. An offering made to the
  bhikkhus. This is the third offering to the Community. An offering made to the bhikkhunis.
  This is the fourth offering to the Community. An offering made indicating the number of
  bhikkhus and bhikkhunis. This is the fifth offering to the Community. An offering made
  indicating the number of bhikkhus. This is the sixth offering to the Community. An
  offering made indicating the number of bhikkhunis. This is the seventh offering to the
  Community. </p>
  <p>Aananda, in the future there will be the last bhikkhus in the lineage, not virtuous
  with evil things, wearing yellow strings round their necks. I say, even the results of an
  offering made to them on account of the Community is innumerable and limitless. I would
  not tell you, how an offering made to the Community is more fruitful than a personal
  offering. </p>
  <p>Aananda, there are four kinds of purity in an offering. An offering is pure, on the
  side of the donor, not the receiver. An offering is pure, on the side of the receiver, not
  the donor. An offering is neither pure on the side of the donor, nor the receiver. An
  offering is pure, on the side of the donor, as well as the receiver. </p>
  <p>Aananda, how is the offering pure, on the side of the donor and not the receiver? Here
  the donor is virtuous with good thoughts, the receiver is not virtuous with evil thoughts.
  Thus the offering is pure, on the side of the donor and not the receiver. </p>
  <p>Aananda, how is the offering pure, on the side of the receiver and not the donor? Here
  the receiver is virtuous with good thoughts, the donor is not virtuous with evil thoughts.
  Thus the offering is pure, on the side of the receiver and not the donor. </p>
  <p>Aananda, how is the offering neither pure on the side of the donor nor the receiver?
  Here the donor is not virtuous with evil thoughts and the receiver is not virtuous with
  evil thoughts. Thus the offering is neither pure, on the side of the donor nor the
  receiver </p>
  <p>Aananda, how is the offering pure on the side of the donor as well as the receiver?
  Here the donor is virtuous with good thoughts and the receiver is virtuous with good
  thoughts. Thus the offering is pure, on the side of the donor as well as the
  receiver.&#146; </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said. &#145;These are the four kinds of purity and further said: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A virtuous donor offers to one without virtues, things obtained righteously, with a
    pleasant mind, <br>
    Believing the results of actions. That offering is purified on the side of the donor. <br>
    A not virtuous donor offers to the virtuous, things not obtained righteously, with an
    unpleasant mind, <br>
    Disbelieving the results of actions. That offering is purified on the side of the receiver
    <br>
    A not virtuous donor offers to the not virtuous, things not obtained righteously, with an
    unpleasant mind, <br>
    Disbelieving the results of actions. That offering is not purified on either side. <br>
    A virtuous donor offers to the virtuous, things obtained righteously, with a pleasant
    mind, <br>
    Believing the results of actions. I say, that offering brings great results <br>
    One not greedy offers to those not greedy, things obtained righteously, with a pleasant
    mind, <br>
    Believing the results of actions. I say, that is the highest material offering &#145; </p>
