  (129)- To Recognize the fool and the wise one</strong></font></p>
  <p>I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika in
  Jeta&#146;s grove in Saavatthi. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from there. </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhus, these three are the marks, characteristics and attainments of the fool.
  What are the three? The fool has foolish thoughts, foolish words and foolish actions.If
  the fool was not with foolish thoughts, words and actions, how are the wise to know this
  good person is a fool, an unworthy one. Since the fool thinks, speaks and acts foolishly,
  the wise know he is a fool. The fool experiences unpleasantness and displeasure here and
  now in three ways. Bhikkhus, if the fool is with a crowd, in the street corner or a
  junction, and if the people there were talking some current topic, and if he destroyed
  living things, took the not given, misbehaved sexually, told lies and took intoxicating
  drinks, it occurs to him. These things the people are talking are evident in me too. This
  is the first instance that the fool experiences unpleasantness and displeasure. </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, the fool sees an offender taken hold by the king and given various
  kinds of torture caned and wipped, flogged with the jungle rope, flogged with the soiled
  stick, hands severed, legs severed, or both hands and legs severed, ears and nose severed,
  put in the boiling gruel pot, shell tonsured, put in Raahu&#146;s mouth, garlanded with
  the blazing garland, hands scorched, the bark dress given, put with snakes, putting hooks
  in theflesh, cutting pieces of flesh from the body, driving a spike from ear to ear,
  beating to make the body like straw, immersing in the boiling oil, giving to the dogs to
  be eaten, raising on a spike alive until death, and cutting the neck with the sword.
  Bhikkhus, then it occurs to the fool, for the reason of doing evil this robber, evil doer
  is punished. If the king gets hold of me, I too will be subjectedto these same
  punishments. This is the second instance that the fool experiences unpleasantness and
  displeasure. </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, when the fool is relaxed on a chair, on the bed or on a cover on the
  floor, he thinks of his misbehaviours by body, speech and mind. At such times they press
  on him heavily. Like the shadow of a huge mountain peak, would fall on the earth heavily
  in the evening..In the same mannerwhen the fool is relaxed on a chair, on the bed or on a
  cover on the floor, he thinks of his misbehaviours by body, speech and mind. At such times
  they press on him heavily. Bhikkhus, then it occurs to the fool. I did not do good and
  merit. Didn&#146;t dispel the fear of the frightened, did evil bloody faults and later I
  will reap their results. He grieves, laments, beats his breast and comes to bewilderment
  of mind. Bhikkhus, this is the third instance that the fool experiences unpleasantness and
  displeasure.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, the fool misbehaving by body, speech and mind, at the break up of the body
  after death, goes to decrease, is born in hell. Saying it rightly that hell is completely
  unwelcome and disagreeable. It is not easy to give a comparison for that unpleasantness. </p>
  <p>Then a certain bhikkhu said. &#146;Venerable sir, is it possible to give a
  comparison?&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said&#145;It is possible bhikkhu. An evil doer, a robber is taken hold
  and shown to the king and is told. Great king, this is a robber, an evil doer, mete the
  suitable punishment to him. Then the king would say.&#146;Good one, whip this person six
  thousand times in the morning.&#146; He is whipped six thousand times in the morning. In
  the mid day the king would ask &#145;Good one, how is that man?&#146; &#145;Great king he
  is alive as he was.&#146; Then the king would say.&#146;Good one, whip this person six
  thousand times in the mid day.&#146; He is whipped six thousand times in the mid day. In
  the evening the king would ask &#145;Good one, how is that man?&#146; &#145;Great king he
  is alive as he was.&#146; Then the king would say.&#146;Good one, whip this person six
  thousand times in the evening.&#146; He is whipped six thousand times in the evening.
  Bhikkhus. would that man whipped six thousand times three times a day feel unpleasant and
  displeased?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Even if given sixty whips, he would feel unpleasant and displeased, so what to
  speak of it when given six thousand whips three times a day&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Then the Blessed One took a small stone that fitted his fist and addressed the bhikkus.
  &#145;Bhikkhus, which is bigger in size, the stone in my fist or the Himalaya
  mountains?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, the stone in your fist cannot be reckoned as a comparison, not
  even as a quarter, nor even as a sign for the Great Himalayas&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;In the same manner bhikkhus, the unpleasantess and displeasure experienced on
  account of giving six thousand whips three times a day .cannot be reckoned as a
  comparison, not even as a quarter, nor even as a sign for the unpleasantness and
  displeasure experienced in hell. The warders of hell give him the fivefold binding. That
  is two hot iron spikes are sent through his two palms, and two other hot spikes are sent
  through his two feet and the fifth hot iron spike is sent through his chest. On account of
  this he experiences sharp piercing unpleasant feelings. Yet he does not die, until his
  demerit finishes. Next the warders of hell conduct him and hammer himOn account of this he
  experiences sharp piercing unpleasant feelings. Yet he does not die, until his demerit
  finishes. Next the warders of hell take him upside down and cut him with a knifeOn account
  of this too he experiences sharp piercing unpleasant feelings. Yet he does not die, until
  his demerit finishes. Next the warders of hell yoke him to a cart and make him go to and
  fro on a ground that is flaming and ablaze On account of this too he experiences sharp
  piercing unpleasant feelings. Yet he does not die, until his demerit finishes. Next the
  warders of hell make him ascend and descend a rock of burning ambers On account of this he
  experiences sharp piercing unpleasant feelings. Yet he does not die, until his demerit
  finishes. Next the warders of hell throw him upside down into a boiling, blazingpot of
  molten. Therehe is cooked in the molten scum, and he on his own accord dives in comes up
  and goes across in the molten pot.On account of this too he experiences sharp piercing
  unpleasant feelings. Yet he does not die, until his demerit finishes.Next the warders of
  hell throw him to the Great Hell. Bhikkhus, the Great Hell is square and has four gates.
  It&#146;s divided into two and is enclosed with an iron wall. The top is closed with an
  iron lid. The floor spreads upto seven hundred miles and it stands there everyday.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>I may explain the unpleasantness of the hell in various ways, yet it is not easy to
  explain that unpleasantness completely. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, there are beings that go on their fours and grinding grass dry or wet with
  their teeth, eat it. Who are such beings? They are horses, cattle, donkeys, goats,deer or
  any other animals that go on their fours and eat grass. The fool greedy for tastes do evil
  things and after death are born in the company of the four footed and eat grass. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, there are animals that eat excreta. They run sniffing the smell of excreta,
  thinking we will eat that and that, like the brahmin that runs for the smell of a
  sacrifice thinking we will eat here and here. In the same manner animals that eat excreta.
  run sniffing the smell of excreta, thinking we will eat that and that. Bhikkhus, what are
  the animals that eat excreta? They are cocks, pigs, dogs, foxes and any other animals that
  eat excreta. The fool greedy for tastes do evil things and after death are born in the
  company of the animals that eat excreta. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, there are crawling things that are born, live and die in the dark.. Bhikkhus,
  what are the crawling things that are born, live and die in the dark? Beetles, worm
  maggots, earth worms and similar crawling things are born, live and die in the dark. Fools
  greedy for tastes do evil things and after death are born in the company of those born in
  the dark </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, there are things that are born, live and die in the water..Bhikkhus, what are
  the things that are born, live and die in water? Fish, turtles, crocodiles and similar
  beings are born, live and die in water. Fools greedy for tastes do evil things and after
  death are born in the company of those born in water. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, there are things that are born, live and die in excreta..Bhikkhus, what are
  the things that are born, live and die in excreta? Things that are born live and die in
  rotten fish, in rotten flesh, in rotten bread, in a dirty village pool Fools greedy for
  tastes do evil things and after death are born in the company of those born, live and die
  in excreta. </p>
  <p>I may explain the unpleasantness of the animal world in various ways, yet it is not
  easy to explain that unpleasantness completely. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, a man would throw into the ocean a plough share with a single hole in it.
  Then with the eastern winds it would be carried west and with the western windscarried
  east. With the northern winds it would be carried south and with the southern winds
  carried north. Then there is a blind turtle in the depths of the ocean and it comes up to
  the surface after the lapse of a hundred years. Bhikkhus this turtle with one eye to see
  would he put his neck in the plough share and yoke it to the hole to see light?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, it would happen after the lapse of a very long time.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhus, it is more likely that the blind turtle would put his neck in the
  plough share and yoke the eye to the hole to see light rather than the fool once fallen to
  hell would gain humanity. What is the reason? Here, there is no righteous living, good
  conduct, merit or a pleasant mind. Here they eat each other, the weaker one is eaten up.
  Bhikkhus, even if the fool regains humanity after a very long time he is born in a low
  clan such as with the out castes, the hunters, with the bamboo weavers, chariot builders,
  rubbish collectors or in such other low family.Born into a poor family without eatables,
  drinks and clothing, gains them with difficulty. He too is not with pleasant appearance
  has a deformed body and is with many ailments, either blind, deformed, lame or paralysed,
  or does not gain eatables, drinks, clothes, conveyances, flowers, scents, ointments, beds,
  dwellings and illuminations. He misbehaves by body, speech and mind and after death goes
  to decrease and is born in hell </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, it is like the gambler, who at the first throw loses his sons, wife and all
  his wealth and is further pursued. That unlucky throw on account of which the gambler
  loses his sons, wife and all his wealth is much better than the fool misbehavingby body,
  speech and mindwould after death be born in hell.Bhikkhus, now the fools&#146; sphere is
  completely told&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhus, these three are the marks, characteristics and attainments of the wise
  one. What are the three? The wise one thinks for the well being, speaks good words and
  acts wisely..If the wise one was not with wise thoughts, words and actions, how are the
  wise to know this good person is a wise one, a worthy one. Since the wise onethinks,
  speaks and acts wisely, the wise recognize him as a wise one. The wise one experiences
  pleasantness and pleasure here and now in three ways. Bhikkhus, if the wise one is with a
  crowd, in the street corner or a junction, and if the people there were talking some
  current topic, and if he abstained from destroyingliving things, did not take the not
  given, did not misbehave sexually, did not tell lies and did not take intoxicating drinks,
  it occurs to him. These things the people are talking I too, know of these things. This is
  the first instance that the wise one experiences pleasantness and pleasure. </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, the wise one sees an offender taken hold by the king and given various
  kinds of torture caned and wipped, flogged with the jungle rope, flogged with the soiled
  stick, hands severed, legs severed, or both hands and legs severed, ears and nose severed,
  put in the boiling gruel pot, shell tonsured, put in Raahu&#146;s mouth, garlanded with
  the blazing garland, hands scorched, the bark dress given, put with snakes, putting hooks
  in theflesh, cutting pieces of flesh from the body, driving a spike from ear to ear,
  beating to make the body like straw, immersing in the boiling oil, giving to the dogs to
  be eaten, raising on a spike alive until death, and cutting the neck with the sword.
  Bhikkhus, then it occurs to the wise one for the reason of doing evil this robber, evil
  doer is punished. These things are not evident in me.I too see these as evil. This is the
  second instance that the wise one experiences pleasantness and pleasure. </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, when the wise one is relaxed on a chair, on the bed or on a cover on
  the floor, he thinks of his good conduct by body, speech and mind. At such times they
  press on him heavily. Like the shadow of a huge mountain peak, would fall on the earth
  heavily in the evening..In the same mannerwhen the wise one is relaxed on a chair, on the
  bed or on a cover on the floor, he thinks of his good conduct by body, speech and mind. At
  such times they press on him heavily. Bhikkhus, then it occurs to the wise one, I did not
  do demerit, dispelledthe fear of the frightened, did no evil bloody faults.did merit, and
  later I will reap their results. He does not grieve, lament, beat his breast and come to
  bewilderment of mind. Bhikkhus, this is the third instance that the wise one experiences
  pleasantness and pleasure.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, the wise one conducting well by body, speech and mind, at the break up of the
  body after death, goes to increase, is born in heaven. Saying it rightly that heaven is
  completely welcome and agreeable. It is not easy to give a comparison for that
  pleasantness. </p>
  <p>Then a certain bhikkhu said. &#146;Venerable sir, is it possible to give a
  comparison?&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said&#145;It is possible bhikkhu.It is like the pleasantnessand
  pleasure experienced by the Universal Monarch endowed with the seven treasures and the
  four powers. </p>
  <p>What are the seven treasures?&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, the consecrated warrior king on the full moon day washes his hair, bathes and
  observes the eight precepts, on the top most storey of his palace, then the heavenly wheel
  treasure appears to him, with the thousandfold spokes, axle and nob complete in every way.
  Seeing the wheel treasure it occurs to the consecrated warrior king. I have heard it said
  that when the consecrated warrior king on the full moon day washes his hair, bathes and
  observes the eight precepts, on the top most storey of his palace, the heavenly wheel
  treasure appears to him, with the thousandfold spokes, axle and nob, complete in every
  way. Have I become the Universal Monarch? Then the consecrated warrior king getting up
  from his seat, takes the golden water spout in his left hand and the wheel treasure in his
  right hand sprinkles water on the good wheel treasure. Bhikkhus, then the wheel treasure
  goes to the east even without a word, together with the king and the fourfold army. In
  whatever region the wheel treasure stops, there the king and the fourfold army dwells.The
  subordinate kings in the east approach the Universal Monarch and tell him. &#145;Welcome
  great king, you have come at the right time, advise us&#146; The Universal Monarch
  says.&#146;Life should not be destroyed, the not given should not be taken, sexual
  misconduct should not be, lies should not be told and intoxicating drinks should not be
  taken. Enjoy your kingships as you have done. Thus they become the subordinate kings of
  the Universal Monarch.The wheel treasure goes to the east as far as the eastern ocean.
  Then it turns and goes to the south...re.... as far as the southern ocean..Then it turns
  and goes to the west...re.... as far as the western ocean. Then it turns and goes to the
  north.even without a word, together with the king and the fourfold army. In whatever
  region the wheel treasure stops, there the king and the fourfold army dwells.The
  subordinate kings in the north approach the Universal Monarch and tell him. &#145;Welcome
  great king, you have come at the right time, advise us&#146; The Universal Monarch
  says.&#146;Life should not be destroyed, the not given should not be taken, sexual
  misconduct should not be, lies should not be told and intoxicating drinks should not be
  taken. Enjoy your kingships as you have done. Thus they become the subordinate kings of
  the Universal Monarch.The wheel treasure goes north as far as the northern ocean. Winning
  over all the lands surrounded by the ocean, returning to the Universal Monarch&#146;s
  kingdom, stands at the entrance to the inner chamber decorrating it, as though the axle
  was broken. Bhikkhus, the Universal Monarch&#146;s wheel treasure is such.. </p>
  <p>.Again, bhikkhus, to the Universal Monarch appears the elephant treasure, Uposatha by
  name, completely white, firm in a sevenfold manner, with supernormal powers could go
  through the air. Seeing it the pleased Universal Monarch would say, the elephant
  conveyance is fine, if it is well trained. Bhikkhus, that elephant treasure as it name
  implies, is of good birth and well trained. In the past a Universal Monarch wanting to
  examine the elephant treasure, ascended it in the morning traversing all the land
  surrounded by the ocean, returned to his kingdom for the mid day meal. Bhikkhus, the
  Universal Monarch&#146;s elephant treasure is such.. </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, to the Universal Monarch appears the horse treasure, Valaaha by name,
  completely white, except the black head and the dark mane. It has supernormal powers could
  go through the air. Seeing it the pleased Universal Monarch would say, the horse
  conveyance is fine, if it is well trained. Bhikkhus, that horse treasure as it name
  implies, is of good birth and well trained. In the past a Universal Monarch wanting to
  examine the horse treasure, ascended it in the morning traversing all the land surrounded
  by the ocean, returned to his kingdom for the mid day meal. Bhikkhus, the Universal
  Monarch&#146;s horsetreasure is such.. </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, to the Universal Monarch appears the gem treasure. A lepis gem of good
  birth, with eight facets and well completed. The effulgence of the gem treasure pervaded
  seven miles all round. In the past a Universal Monarch wanting to examine the gem treasure
  left his kingdom attended by the fourfold army in the darkness of the night with the gem
  treasure fixed on the top of the flag. The people in the villages around which they went
  started their usual work, thinking it was day light. Bhikkhus, the Universal
  Monarch&#146;s gem treasure is such. </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, to the Universal Monarch appears the woman treasure. Beautiful,
  pleasant to look at and endowed with the highest beauty. Not too tall nor too short, not
  too thin nor too fat, not too dark nor too fair, that beauty beyond human but not divine.
  Bhikkhus, that woman treasure had a bodily contact like that of cotton tuft or silk tuft.
  When cold she had a warm body and when warm had a cold body. From her body emanated the
  scent of sandlewood and from her mouth emanated the scent of white lotus&#146;. This woman
  treasure would get up and attend to the needs of the Universal Monarch with a pleasant
  mind, at his appearance. That woman treasure&#146;s mental needs would not exceed those of
  the Universal Monarch, her bodily needs would never. Bhikkhus, the Universal
  Monarch&#146;s woman treasure is such.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, to the Universal Monarch appears the householder treasure. </p>
  <p>To the householder treasure there appears the heavenly eye as a result of earler done
  actions. When he sees a treasure with or without ownership, he would inform the king.
  &#145;Great king, be unconcerned I will fill your treasury&#146; In the past a Universal
  Monarch wanting to examine the householder treasure embarked a ship and in the middle of
  the Ganges in the middle of the stream said &#145;Householder, I&#146;m in need of
  sovereigngold.&#146; &#145;Then Great king reach either of the two banks&#146;.
  &#145;Householder, I need the sovereign gold here itself.&#146; Then that householder
  treasure removed the water in the river with both his hands and raised a pot full of
  sovereign gold and told the Universal Monarch. &#145;Great king, is that enough, is the
  work done!&#146; &#145;Householder, that is enough, the work is done!&#146; Bhikkhus, the
  Universal Monarch&#146;s householder treasure is such.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, to the Universal Monarch appears the adviser treasure, circumspect,
  learned, wise and competent. He is competent and could attend to the needs ofthe Universal
  Monarch, dismiss whatever should be dismissed, and establish whatever should be
  established. Approaching the Universal Monarch he says &#145;Great king be unconcerned, I
  will advise. Bhikkhus, the Universal Monarch&#146;s adviser treasure is such.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, the Universal Monarch is endowed with these seven treasures. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, what are the four powers? </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, the Universal Monarch is handsome, pleasant to look at and endowed with the
  highest beauty much more handsome than any other human being.The Universal Monarch is
  endowed with this first power. </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, the Universal Monarch has long life, lives much longer than any other
  human being. The Universal Monarch is endowed with this second power. </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, the Universal Monarch has few ailments and few disorders. Is endowed
  with a good digestive system, not too cold, nor too hot unlike other humans.The Universal
  Monarch is endowed with this third power.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, the Universal Monarch is dear to the brahmin householders. Just as the
  father is dear to the sons so the Universal Monarch is dear to the brahmin householders.
  The brahmin householders are dear to the Universal Monarch. Just as the sons are dear to
  the father, so the brahmin householders are dear to the Universal Monarch. In the past the
  Universal Monarch went to the park with the fourfold army, then the brahmin householders
  approached the Universal Monarch and said. &#145;Great king, go slowly so that we could
  see you better.&#146; The Universal Monarch too addressed the charioteer and said.
  &#145;Charioteer go slowly so that I may see better these brahmin householders The
  Universal Monarch is endowed with this fourth power.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, the Universal Monarch is endowed with these four powers. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, would the Universal Monarch endowed with these seven treasures and these four
  powers experience much pleasantness and pleasure on account of it?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Endowed with even one of these treasures the Universal Monarch would experience
  much pleasantness and pleasure on account of it.There is nothing to speak when endowed
  with seven treasures and four powers.&#146; </p>
  <p>Then the Blessed One took a small stone that fitted his fist and addressed the bhikkus.
  &#145;Bhikkhus, which is bigger in size, the stone in my fist or the Himalaya
  mountains?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, the stone in your fist cannot be reckoned as a comparison, not
  even as a quarter, nor even as a sign for the Great Himalayas&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;In the same manner bhikkhus, the pleasantess and pleasure experienced by the
  Universal Monarch on account of the seven treasures and the four powers cannot be reckoned
  as a comparison, not even as a quarter, nor even as a sign for the pleasantness and
  pleasure experienced in heaven. Bhikkhus, if that wise one after a long lapse of time was
  to regain humanity he would be born in a rich, warrior clan, brahmin clan or householder
  clan, or such other high clan with much wealth, riches, sovereign gold and silver, with
  much grains. He would be handsome and pleasant to look at.a gainer of eatables, drinks,
  clothes, conveyances, flowers, scents, ointments, beds, dwellings and illuminations.
  Conducts well in body, words and mentally after death he would be born in heavenBhikkhus,
  it is like the gambler, who at the first throw wins a great mass of wealth.It would be a
  more lucky throw if the wise one conducting well by body, speech and mindwould after death
  be born in heaven Bhikkhus, now the wise one&#146;s sphere is completely told.&#146; </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One.
