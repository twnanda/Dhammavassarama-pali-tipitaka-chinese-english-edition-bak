  <b>(109) The longer discourse on the full moon night</b> </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the Pubba monastery, the palace of Migaara&#146;s
  mother, in Saavatthi. On that full moon night of the fifteenth day the Blessed One sat in
  the open, attended by the Community of bhikkhus. Then a certain bhikkhu got up from his
  seat, arranged his robe and clasping hands towards the Blessed One said. &#145;Venerable
  sir, I would ask a certain question if the Blessed one gives me leave and would explain
  it.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhu, sit on your seat and ask the question, you desire to ask.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Then that bhikkhu sat on his seat and asked the Blessed One.&#146;Venerable sir,
  are these the five holding masses? Such as the holding mass of matter, the holding mass of
  feelings, the holding mass of perceptions, the holding mass of determinations and the
  holding mass of consciousness?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhu these are the five holding masses. Such as the holding mass of matter,
  the holding mass of feelings, the holding mass of perceptions, the holding mass of
  determinations and the holding mass of consciousness&#146; </p>
  <p>That bhikkhu delighting and agreeing with the words of the Blessed One asked a further
  question. &#145;Venerable sir, on what are these five holding masses based?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhu, these five holding masses are based on interest.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, is the holding on these same five holding masses? Or is there a
  holding other than them?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhkkhu, the holding is on these same five holding masses, there is no holding
  other than them. Bhikkhu, the greed and interest for the five holding masses, is the
  holding there.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, is there a difference in the greed and interest for the five
  holding masses.&#146; </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said. &#145;Bhikkhu there is a difference. To someone it occurs, in the
  future may my matter be thus, my feelings be thus, my perceptions be thus, my
  determinations be thus and my consciousness be thus. That is the difference in the greed
  and interest for the five holding masses.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, what is an explanation for the masses?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhu, all matter, coarse or fine, internal or external, in the past, future
  and the present, inferior or superior, far or near, that is the mass of matter. All
  feelings, coarse or fine, internal or external, in the past, future and the present,
  inferior or superior, far or near, that is the mass of feelings. All perceptions, coarse
  or fine internal or external in the past, future and the present, inferior or superior,
  far or near, that is the mass of .perceptions. All determinations, coarse or fine,
  internal or external, in the past, future and the present, inferior or superior, far or
  near, that is the mass of determinations. All consciousness, coarse or fine internal or
  external, in the past, future and the present, inferior or superior, far or near, that is
  the mass of consciousess. Bhikkhu, this is the explanation for the masses.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, what is the cause for the mass of matter to become evident, the
  mass of feelings to become evident, the mass of perceptions to become evident, the mass of
  determinations to become evident and the mass of consciousness to become evident?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhu, because of the four primary elements the mass of matter becomes evident,
  because of contact, the mass of feelings becomes evident, because of contact the mass of
  perceptions becomes evident, because of contact, the mass of determinations becomes
  evident and because of name and matter the mass of consciousness becomes evident.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, how does the view of a self arise?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhu, the not learned ordinary man, who has not seen noble ones and Great Men
  not clever and not trained in their Teaching, sees matter in self, or sees a material form
  of the self, or in self sees matter, or in matter sees self. Sees feelings in self, or
  sees a feeling self, or in self sees feelings, or in feelings sees self. Sees perceptons
  in self, or sees a perceptual self, or in self sees perceptions, or in peceptions sees
  self. Sees determinations in self, or sees a determining self, or in self sees
  determinations, or in determinations sees self Sees consciousness in self, or sees a
  conscious self, or in self sees consciousness or in consciousess sees self. Bhikkhu, thus
  arises the self view.&#146; . </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, how does the view of a self not arise?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhu, the learned noble disciple who has seen noble ones and Great Men clever
  and trained in their Teaching, does not see matter in self, or a material form of the
  self, or in self matter, or in matter self. Does not see feelings in self, or a feeling
  self, or in self feelings, or in feelings self. Does not see perceptons in self, or a
  perceptual self, or in self perceptions, or in peceptions self. Does not see
  determinations in self, or a determining self, or in self determinations, or in
  determinations self Does not see consciousness in self, or a conscious self, or in self
  consciousness or in consciousess self. Bhikkhu, thus the self view does not arise.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, what is the satisfaction, the danger and escape from matter? . </p>
  <p>What is the satisfaction, the danger and escape from feelings? What is the
  satisfaction, the danger and escape from perceptions? What is the satisfaction, the danger
  and escape from determinations? What is the satisfaction, the danger and escape from
  consciusness?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhu, whatever pleasantness and pleasure that arises on account of matter, is
  the satisfaction in matter. That matter is impermanent, unpleasant a changeful thing, is
  the danger of matter. The disciplining and dispelling of interest and greed for matter is
  the escape from matter. Whatever pleasantness and pleasure that arises on account of
  feelings, is the satisfaction in feelings. That feelings are impermanent, unpleasant
  changeful things, is the danger of feelings. The disciplining and dispelling of interest
  and greed for feelings is the escape from feelings. Whatever pleasantness and pleasure
  that arises on account of perceptions, is the satisfaction in perceptions. That
  perceptions are impermanent, unpleasant and changeful things, is the danger of perceptions
  The disciplining and dispelling of interest and greed for perceptions is the escape from
  perceptions.Whatever pleasantness and pleasure that arises on account of determinations,
  is the satisfaction in determinations.That determinations are impermanent, unpleasant
  changeful things, is the danger of determinations. The disciplining and dispelling of
  interest and greed for determinations is the escape from determinations. Whatever
  pleasantness and pleasure that arises on account of consciousness, is the satisfaction in
  consciousness. That consciousness is impermanent, unpleasant a changeful thing, is the
  danger of consciousness. The disciplining and dispelling of interest and greed for
  consciousness is the escape from consciousness.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir knowing and seeing what does there not arise any latent tendencies
  of conceit and measuring in this sixfold conscious body, and all external signs?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhu, all matter, coarse or fine, internal or external, in the past, future
  and the present, inferior or superior, far or near, I&#146;m not all that matter, it is
  not my self. All feelings, coarse or fine, internal or external, in the past, future and
  the present, inferior or superior, far or near, I&#146;m not all those feelings, they are
  not my self. All perceptions, coarse or fine internal or external in the past, future and
  the present, inferior or superior, far or near, I&#146;m not all those perceptions, they
  are not my self. All determinations, coarse or fine, internal or external, in the past,
  future and the present, inferior or superior, far or near, I&#146;m not all those
  determinations, they are not my self. All consciousness, coarse or fine internal or
  external, in the past, future and the present, inferior or superior, far or near, I&#146;m
  not that consciousess, it is not my self. Bhikkhu knowing and seeing thus there does not
  arise any latent tendencies of conceit and measuring in this sixfold conscious body, and
  all external signs.&#146; </p>
  <p>Then this thought and thought process arose to a certain bhikkhu. &quot;Indeed, then
  matter is void of self, feelings are void of self, perceptions are void of self,
  determinations are void of self and consciousness is void of self. How could the self be
  touched, by actions, done void of a self?&quot; </p>
  <p>Then the Blessed One penetratingly seeing that thought and thought process in that
  bhikkhu&#146;s mind addressed the bhikkhus for his sake. &#145;Bhikkhus, there is a
  possibility that a certain foolish man overcome by ignorance and falling for craving,
  should think to creep through the Dispensation of the Teacher, thinking, &quot;Indeed,
  then matter is void of self, feelings are void of self, perceptions are void of self,
  determinations are void of self and consciousness is void of self. How could the self be
  touched, by actions, done void of a self?&quot; Bhikkhus, I train you for conditionality,
  according to the arisen situation, in this and other instance. Is matter permanent or
  impermanent?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, impermanent&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, unpleasant.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;That which is impermanent, unpleasant, a changing thing is it suitable to
  reflect, It is mine, I&#146;m that, it is my self?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;No venerable sir, it is not suitable.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Are feelings,....re..... perceptions, ...re.... determinations, ...re..... is
  consciousness permanent or impermanent?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, impermanent&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant?&#146; </p>
  <p>. &#145;Venerable sir, unpleasant.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;That which is impermanent, unpleasant, a changing thing is it suitable to
  reflect, It is mine, I&#146;m that, it is my self?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;No venerable sir, it is not suitable.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Therefore bhikkhus, all matter, coarse or fine, internal or external, in the
  past, future and the present, inferior or superior, far or near, I&#146;m not all that
  matter, it is not my self. All feelings, coarse or fine, internal or external, in the
  past, future and the present, inferior or superior, far or near, I&#146;m not all those
  feelings, they are not my self. All perceptions, coarse or fine internal or external in
  the past, future and the present, inferior or superior, far or near, I&#146;m not all
  those perceptions, they are not my self. All determinations, coarse or fine, internal or
  external, in the past, future and the present, inferior or superior, far or near, I&#146;m
  not all those determinations, they are not my self. All consciousness, coarse or fine
  internal or external, in the past, future and the present, inferior or superior, far or
  near, I&#146;m not that consciousess, it is not my self. This should be seen with right
  wisdom, as it really is. Bhikkhus, when the learned noble disciple sees this, he turns
  away from matter, turns away from feelings, turns away from perceptions, turns away from
  determinations and turns away from consciousness. Turning away is detached and released.
  When released, knowledge arises, I&#146;m released. Birth is destroyed, the holy life is
  lived, what should be done is done, there is nothing more to wish.&#146; </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said thus, and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed
  One. </p>
  <p>When this discourse was given about sixty bhikkhus were released from desires without
  holdings </p>
