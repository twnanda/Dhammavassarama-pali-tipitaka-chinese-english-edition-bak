  <p><br>
  I heard thus. </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the country of the Kurus in a hamlet named
  Kammassadhamma. The Blessed One, slept on a spread of dried grass in the fire hut of a
  brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan. In the morning, the Blessed One, putting on robes, taking
  bowl and robes went the alms round, in the hamlet Kammassadhamma. Returning from the alms
  round and after the meal was over the Blessed One entered a certain forest stretch, and
  sat at the root of a certain tree, to spend the day. </p>
  <p>The wandering ascetic Magandiya wandering and walking for exercise entered the fire hut
  of the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan. Seeing the spread of dried grass in the fire hut he
  said. &#145;Good Bharadvaja, for whom, is this spread of dried grass prepared, I think
  it&#146;s the bed of a recluse.&#146; &#145;Good Magandiya, it is the recluse
  Gotama&#146;s, the son of the Sakyas. He has gone forth from the clan of the Sakyas. His
  fame is such, the Blessed One is perfect, rightly enlightened, endowed with knowledge and
  conduct. Well gone, knows the worlds, is the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, is
  Teacher of gods and men, enlightened and Blessed&#146; &#145;Good Bharadvaja, we saw
  something we should not have seen, it&#146;s the bed of that good Gotama, the destroyer of
  humanity.&#146; &#145;Magandiya, be careful of what you say, good Gotama has many wise
  warriors, brahmins, householders and recluses, pleased and tamed in the noble Teaching and
  established in merit.&#146;&#146;Bharadvaja, I will meet that good Gotama, and tell these
  words myself, that the recluse Gotama is a destroyer of humanity. What is the reason? It
  is by examining his bed, that we do so.&#146; &#145;If it does not matter to good
  Magandiya, I will inform this to the recluse Gotama.&#146;&#146;Be unconcerned, good
  Bharadvaja, tell it if he asks.&#146; </p>
  <p>The Blessed One heard this conversation between the wandering ascetic Magandiya and the
  brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan, with his purified heavenly ear element above human. The
  Blessed One got up from his seclusion in the evening, and approached the fire hut of the
  brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan. Entering the fire hut, he sat on the prepared seat. Then
  the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan approached the Blessed One worshipped, exchanged
  friendly greetings and sat on a side. Then the Blessed One said, to the brahmin of the
  Bharadvaja clan.&#146;Was there any conversation between Bharadvaja and the wandering
  ascetic Magandiya concerning this spread of grass?&#146; When this was asked the brahmin
  of the Bharadvaja clan shivered and his hairs stood on end, and said.&#146;This we wanted
  to tell good Gotama, and even before that good Gotama tells it.&#146; Even when this
  conversation was taking place the wandering ascetic Magandiya wandering and walking for
  exercise entered the fire hut of the brahmin of the Bharadvaja clan, and approached the
  Blessed One.Exchanged friendly greetings with the Blessed One and sat on a side. </p>
  <p>Then the Blessed One addressed the wandering ascetic Magandiya. &#145;Magandiya, the
  eye is fond of forms, intent on forms and delight in forms, the eye of the Thus Gone One
  is tamed and protected. He teaches to protect and to restrain the eye.Is it on account of
  this, that Magandiya saidthe recluse Gotama is a destroyer of humanity?&#146; &#145;I said
  the recluse Gotama is a destroyer of humanity, by examining, his bed.&#146; .
  .&#146;Magandiya, the ear is fond of sounds, the nose is fond of smells, the tongue is
  fond of tastes, intent on tastes, and delight in tastes. The tongue of the Thus Gone One
  is tamed and protected. He teaches to protect and to restrain the tongue. Is it on account
  of this, that Magandiya said the recluse Gotama is a destroyer of humanity?&#146; &#145;I
  said the recluse Gotama, is a destroyer of humanity, examining his bedstead.&#146;
  &#145;Magandiya, the body, is fond of touches, &#133;re &#133;The mind is fond of ideas,
  intent on ideas and delight with ideas. The mind of the Thus Gone One is tamed and
  protected. He teaches to protect and to restrain the mind. Is it on account of this, that
  Magandiya said, the recluse Gotama is a destroyer of humanity?&#146;&#146;I said the
  recluse Gotama is a destroyer of humanity, examining his bedstead.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Magandiya, one is well provided with pleasing, agreeable, forms cognizable by eye
  consciousness, arousing fondness and sensual desires.In the mean time he knows the
  arising, fading, the satisfaction, the danger and the escape from forms, as it really is.
  He dispels and destroys the burning and thirst for forms and internally appeases the mind
  and abides. What has Magandiya to say to that?&#146; &#145;Good Gotama, I have nothing to
  say.&#146; Magandiya, one is well provided with pleasing, agreeable sounds cognizable by
  ear consciousness, re&#133;. smells, cognizable by nose consciousness,&#133;re&#133;
  tastes cognizable by tongue consciousness, touches,&#133;re&#133; cognizable by body
  consciousnessarousing fondness and sensual desires. In the mean time he knows the arising,
  fading, satisfaction, danger and the escape from touches, as it really is He dispels and
  destroys the burning and thirst for touches and internally appeases the mind and abides.
  What has Magandiya to say to that?&#146; &#145;Good Gotama, I have nothing to say.&#146; </p>
  <p>Magandiya, when I was a householder, I was well provided with the five strands of
  sensual pleasures. Such as pleasing agreeable forms cognizable by eye consciousness
  arousing fondness and sensual desires. Pleasing agreeable sounds, --pleasing agreeable
  smells, --pleasing agreeable tastes, and pleasing agreeable touches cognizable by body
  consciousness, arousing fondness and sensual desires. I was provided with three palaces,
  for the three seasons, one for the rainy season, one for the cold season and another for
  the hot season. Magandiya, I spent four months in the palace for the rainy season, without
  males and provided with music. Not coming down to the lower storey, for any reason. In the
  mean time I knew, the arising, fading, the satisfaction, the danger and the escape from
  sensual desires. I dispelled and destroyed the craving, burning and thirst, for sensual
  desires and internally appeased the mind and abode. I see other beings not satiated with
  sensuality, while partaknig it being eaten by it and burnt by it. I do not envy them, and
  do not take pleasure in it. Magandiya, I abide in that attachment away from sensuality,
  away from thoughts of demerit, and even beyond heavenly pleasantness and do not envy or
  delight in something lower than that. </p>
  <p>Magandiya, like a housholder, or a householder&#146;s son, quite wealthy and with many
  resources, well provided with the five strands of sensual pleasures. Such as pleasing
  agreeable forms cognizable by eye consciousness, arousing fondness and sensual desires.
  Pleasing agreeable sounds, --pleasing agreeable smells, --pleasing agreeable tastes, and
  pleasing agreeable touches cognizable by body consciousness, arousing fondness and sensual
  desires. He behaves himself correctly by body, speech and mind. After death, he goes to
  increase, is born with the retinue of the thirtythree gods and partakes of the five
  strands of heavenly sensual pleasures attended by nymphs in the Nandana forest. Then he
  sees a householder partake the five strands of sensual pleasures provided and well
  attended. Magandiya, do you think, this son of the gods, partaking the five strands of
  heavenly bliss, attended by those nymphs would envy that householder or the son of the
  householder and would come back for the five strands of sensual pleasures?&#146; &#145;No,
  good Gotama. Heavenly sensual pleasures are superior and more exalted than human sensual
  pleasures.&#146; &#145;In the same manner, Magandiya, when I was a householder I was well
  provided with the five strands of sensual pleasures. Such as pleasing agreeable forms
  cognizable by eye consciousness arousing fondness and sensual desires. Pleasing agreeable
  sounds, --pleasing agreeable smells, --pleasing agreeable tastes, and pleasing agreeable
  touches cognizable by body consciousness, arousing fondness and sensual desires. Then in
  the mean time I knew, the arising, fading, the satisfaction, the danger and the escape
  from sensuality as it really is. Then I dispelled and destroyed the craving, burning and
  thirst for senssuality and internally appeased the mind and abode. I see other beings not
  satiated with sensuality, while partaking it being eaten and burnt by it. I do not envy
  them, and do not take pleasure in it. Magandiya, I abide in that attachment away from
  sensuality, away from thoughts of demerit, and even beyond heavenly pleasantness and do
  not envy or delight in something lower than that. </p>
  <p>Magandiya, a lepor with a diseased, decayed skin, with worms attacking it, would
  scratch the skin with his nails and would have open bruises and wounds. Then he would burn
  those wounds in a pit of embers and his friends, co-associates and blood relations would
  call a doctor to attend on him. After that treatment he would get over his leprosy, and
  getting well would be able to go where he wished. Then he would see another lepor with a
  diseased, decayed skin, with worms eating the skin, and he scratching it for relief and
  burning the wounds and bruises in a pit of embers. Would he envy that lepor, or the pit of
  embers, or the treatment given?&#146; &#145;No, good Gotama, when he was diseased, the
  treatment was necessary. When he got over the illness, no more medicine is
  necessary.&#146; &#145;In the same manner, Magandiya, when I was a householder I was well
  provided with the five strands of sensual pleasures. Pleasing agreeable forms cognizable
  by eye consciousness arousing fondness and sensual desires. Pleasing agreeable sounds,
  --pleasing agreeable smells, --pleasing agreeable tastes, and pleasing agreeable touches
  cognizable by body consciousness, arousing fondness and sensual desires. In the mean time
  I knew the arising, fading, the satisfaction, the danger and the escape from sensuality as
  it really is I dispelled and destroyed the craving, burning and the thirst for sensuality,
  appeasing the mind internally abode. I see other beings partaking sensuality not satiated
  with it, being eaten by it and burnt by it. I do not envy them, and do not take pleasure
  in it. Magandiya, I abide in that attachment away from sensuality, away from thoughts of
  demerit, and even beyond heavenly pleasantness and do not envy or delight in something
  lower than that. </p>
  <p>Magandiya, a lepor with a diseased, decayed skin, worms attacking it, would scratch the
  skin with his nails and would have open bruises and wounds, would burn those wounds in a
  pit of embers. His friends, co-associates and blood relations would call a doctor to
  attend on him. Then treated by the doctor would get over his leprosy, and getting well
  would be able to go where he wished. Then two strong men would come along and pull this
  man along to the burning pit of embers. Magandiya, wouldn&#146;t his body writhe to get
  away from it?&#146; &#145;Yes, good Gotama, his body would writhe to get away from it.
  What is the reason? Good Gotama fire is unpleasant to contact, the great heat causes much
  burning.&#146; &#145;Magandiya, fire is unpleasant to contact, produces heat and causes
  burning to him, only now, or was it unpleasant to contact, produced heat and caused
  burning earlier too?&#146; &#146;Good Gotama, now and earlier too fire is unpleasant to
  contact, produced heat and caused burning. The lepor with a diseased, decayed skin, worms
  attacking it, scratched the skin with the nails and had open wounds. With a distorted
  mental faculty, he experienced pleasantness in fire. It is the result of a distorted
  perception.&#146; &#145;Magandiya, in the same manner, even in the past sensual contact
  was unpleasant, produced much heat and burning, in the future too sensual contact will be
  unpleasant, will produce much heat and burning, and sensual contact at present too is
  unpleasant, produces much heat and burning. Magandiya, these beings not free of greed for
  sensuality, destroyed by the greed for sensuality, worried by sensual worries, have
  distorted mental faculties and perceive the unpleasant contact of sensuality is pleasant
  feeling. </p>
  <p>Magandiya, however much the lepor would scratch the diseased, decayed skin, eaten by
  worms and make, open bruises and wounds and would burn the wounds in a pit of embers.Those
  wounds would not get better but worse and worse. The decay and the ill smell would get
  worse, and worse. Whatever satisfaction he gets, is through scratching the open wounds and
  scorching them.. In the same manner Magandiya, beings not free of greed for sensuality,
  destroyed with greed for sensuality, worried by sensual worries, partake of sensuality,
  and in this and other way they grow their sensual greed and grow their sensual worries.
  Whatever little satisfaction they gain is through the five strands of sense pleasures. </p>
  <p>Magandiya, have you seen or heard of a king or the chief minister of a king, provided
  and accomplished with the five strands of sensual pleasures. Have you seen such a one
  internally appeased, without giving up that sensual, greed, burning and thirst. Or do you
  see such a one, or will you see such a one in the future?&#146; &#145;No, good
  Gotama.&#146; &#146;Good! Magandiya, you have understood it. I too have not seen or heard
  of such a one. Nor will hear of such a one. Magandiya, who ever recluses or brahmins abode
  in the past or abide now or will abide in the future, gave up, give up and will give up
  the thirst and burning for sensuality and internally appease themselves. By knowing,
  sensuality, the arising of sensuality, fading of sensuality, the satisfaction of
  sensuality, its dangers, and the escape from it, as it really is.&#146; </p>
  <p>At that time the Blessed One utterred this solemn utterance. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&#145;Health is the highest gain, extinction is the highest bliss, <br>
    The eightfold path is the path to peace and deathlessness.&#146; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When this was said, the wandering ascetic Magandiya said to the Blessed One.
  &#145;These words of good Gotama are excellent, such as Health is the highest gain, and
  extinction, is the highest bliss.I too have heard these words said, by the teachers of
  teachers of wandering ascetics.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Health is the highest gain, extinction is the highest bliss. Magandiya, what is
  that health and what is that extinction?&#146; When this was asked, Magandiya stroked his
  own body and hands, saying, &#145;That health and extinction is here. Good Gotama,
  I&#146;m now healthy and without ailments.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Magandiya, like a man born blind, would not see impure and pure forms, would not
  see, blue, yellow, red or brown forms, would not see even and uneven forms, would not see
  the constellation, the moon and the sun. He would hear a man with sight say. Wonderful is
  a white garment, pure and stainless. Then he goes in search of white.A certain man cheats
  him, giving an oil sprayed coarse garment, saying: Good man this is a white pure stainless
  garment. He accepts it puts it on and pleased says delighted words- Wonderful is a white
  garment, pure and stainless.Magandiya, would that blind man, knowing, seeing, accept, wear
  and utter words of delight?&#146;&#145;Good Gotama that man, born blind would accept, wear
  and utter words of delight not knowing and not seeing that oil sprayed coarse garment. He
  would utter those words of delight, wonderful is a white garment, pure and stainless,
  placing faith in the man who has sight.&#146; &#145;Magandiya, in the same manner,
  wandering ascetics of other sects are blind, not knowing and not seeing health and
  extinction, would say this verse. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Health is the highest gain, extinction is the highest bliss. <br>
    Magandiya, this verse was said, by rightfully enlightened perfect ones.of the past. <br>
    Health is the highest gain, extinction is the highest bliss. (* 1) <br>
    The eightfold path is the peaceful path to deathlessness. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now this has become the ordinary one&#146;s verse. Magandiya, this body is the birth
  place of ill health, abscesses, troubles and ailments, and you say it is good health and
  extinction.You should have the noble one&#146;s eye to know the healthand see extinction.
  (* 1) </p>
  <p>I&#146;m pleased with good Gotama&#146;s Teaching: Could good Gotama teach me so that I
  may know that health and see that extinction. Magandiya, like a man born blind, would not
  see impure and pure forms. Would not see, blue, yellow, red or brown forms. Would not see
  even and uneven forms and would not see the constellation, the moon and the sun. His
  friends, co-associates and blood relations, would get a surgeon to attend to his eyes. He
  being treated and taking that medicine does not regain his sight. Magandiya, wouldn&#146;t
  that surgeon reap fatigue only?&#146; &#145;Yes, good Gotama.&#146;&#146;Magandiya, in the
  same manner I taught you showing the healthy state and showing extinction, yet you do not
  know it and see it, and it is only fatigue for me.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;I&#146;m pleased with good Gotama&#146;s Teaching: Could good Gotama teach me so
  that I may know that health and see that extinction.&#146; &#145;Magandiya, like a man
  born blind, would not see impure and pure forms. Would not see, blue, yellow, red or brown
  forms, nor even and uneven forms. Would not see the constellation, the moon and the sun.
  Would hear a man with sight saying, wonderful is a white garment, pure and stainless. He
  goes in search of white. Then a certain man cheats giving him an oil sprayed coarse
  garment Saying: good man this is a white pure stainless garment. He accepts it, puts it on
  and pleased says delighted words. Wonderful is a white garment, pure and stainless His
  friends, co-associates and blood relations, would get a surgeon to attend to his eyes.
  That surgeon attends to him, giving him purgatives for the head and stomach, and nasal
  treatment. Then he regains his sight. Soon after, he regains his sight, he dispels the
  interest and greed for the oil sprayed coarse garment, and considers the man who gave it
  as an enemy and even thinks to kill him: Indeed since long I have been cheated by this
  man, with this oil sprayed coarse garment. Saying good man this is a wonderful white
  garment pure and stainess. Magandiya, in the same manner manner I taught you showing the
  healthy state and showing extinction You know it and see it, and together with the arising
  of that sight,you dispel that interest and greed for the five holding masses. Indeed,
  since a long time I have been cheated by this mind. I have been upholding matter. I have
  been upholding feelings. I have been upholding perceptions. I have been upholding
  determinations and I have been upholding consciousness. On account of that holding there
  is being, on account of being, there is birth. On account of birth, decay, death, grief,
  wailing, unpleasantness, and distress-Thus is the arising of the whole mass of
  unpleasantness. </p>
  <p>I&#146;m pleased with good Gotama&#146;s Teaching, could I be taught so that I get up
  delighted from this seat Then Magandiya associate good friends, when you associate good
  friends, you hear the good Teaching. When you hear the good Teaching, you fall to the
  method of living according to the teaching. When you fall to the method of living
  according to the Teaching, you yourself realize the ill health, the absces, the arrow and
  the dart. It is here itself that the ill health, the abscess, the arrow and the dart
  should be completely removed. With the cessation of holding, there comes the cessation of
  being, with the cessation of being comes the cessation of birth. With the cessation of
  birth, cease decay, death, grief, wailing, unpleasantness and distress. Thus, ceases the
  complete mass of unpleasaantness.&#146; </p>
  <p>Then the wandering ascetic Magandiya, said to the Blessed One. &#145;Now I understand
  venerable sir, it is as though something over turned was reinstalled. As something
  covered, is made manifest. As though the path was told to one who had lost his way. As
  though an oil lamp was lighted for the dark for those with sight to see forms The Blessed
  One has explained the Teaching in various ways. Now I take refuge in the Blessed One in
  the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. May I gain the going forth and the higher
  ordination in the dispensation of the Blessed One.&#146; &#145;Magandiya, whoever is of
  another sect seeking the going forth and the higher ordination in this dispensation should
  be on probation for four months, after the four months, if the bhikkhus are satisfied,
  they would give the going forth and the higher ordination. It is to see the improvement in
  the person. Venerable sir if one of another sect, would have to be on probation for four
  months, I would be on probation for four years. May the bhikkhus, when satisfied give me
  the going forth and the higher ordination Magandiya gained the going forth and the higher
  ordination and soon after the higher ordination, venerable Magandiya abode withdrawn from
  the crowd diligent for dispelling. He here and now, realized and attained that highest end
  of the yoke, for which sons of clansmen rightfully leave the household and become
  homeless.He knew, birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived, what should be done is done,
  there is nothing more to wish. Venerable Magandiya became a perfect one. </p>
