  (93) To the young man Assalaayana.</strong></font></p>
  <p>I heard thus. </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One was abiding in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika
  inJeta&#146;s grove in Saavatthi. At that time about five hundred Brahmins of various
  states had come to Saavatthi for some business and were living in Saavatthi. It occurred
  to those Brahmins. This recluse Gotama declares the purity of the four castes. Who is able
  to dispute with the recluse Gotama on these words? At that time a young man named
  Assalaayana lived in Saavatthi. He was young, shaven headed, sixteen years of age, had
  learned the three Vedas, knew, the rites and rituals as officiating priest, the phonology
  and etymology of words and the marks of a Great Man. Then it occurred to those Brahmins.
  This young man Assalaayana lives in Saavatthi, is young, shaven headed, sixteen years of
  age, is learned in the three Vedas, knows the rites and rituals as officiating priest. He
  knows the phonology and etymology of words and the marks of a Great Man. It is possible
  for him to dispute with the recluse Gotama, on these words. Then those Brahmins approached
  the young man Assalaayana and said. &#145;Good Assalaayana, the recluse Gotama declares
  the purity of the four castes. Come, good Assalaayana, dispute with the recluse Gotama on
  these words. Then the young man Assalaayana said thus to those Brahmins. &#145;The recluse
  Gotama speaks the truth, it is difficult to dispute with those speaking the truth. It is
  not possible that I could dispute this with him.&#146; For the second time the Brahmins
  entreated the young man Assalaayana, saying he was a wandering ascetic. He refused. For
  the third time the Brahmins entreated and the young man Assalaayana, saying he should not
  accept uncontested defeat. </p>
  <p>When this was said, the young man Assalaayana said. &#146;Indeed I will not win, the
  good recluse Gotama, tells the truth, it is difficult to dispute with those speaking the
  truth. It is not possible that I could dispute this with him. Yet I will go to satisfy you
  good ones.&#146; </p>
  <p>Then the young man Assalaayana, together with a large gathering of Brahmins approached
  the Blessed One, exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side. He said to the Blessed
  One.&#146;Good Gotama, Brahmins say, Brahmins are from the highest caste, the others are
  low. Brahmins are pure, the others impure. Brahmins become pure, the others do not.
  Brahmins are the legitimate sons of Brahmaa, born of his mouth, born of him, with his sign
  and heritage. What has good Gotama to say about this?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Assalaayana, among Brahmins I see a woman menstruating, bearing a womb, giving
  birth and giving suck. Born from a womb, do they say, Brahmins are from the highest caste,
  the others are low. Brahmins are pure, the others impure. Brahmins become pure, the others
  do not. Brahmins are the legitimate sons of Brahmaa, born of his mouth, born of him, with
  his sign and heritage?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Whatever good Gotama says, the Brahmins think they are born, in the highest
  caste, the others are low. &#133;&#133;re&#133;with his sign and heritage.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Assalaayana, have you heard of Greece, Cambodiya, and certain other bordering
  states.They have only two castes, masters and slaves. One becomes a master and then a
  slave, and a slave becomes a master?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good one, Ihave heard of Greece, Cambodiya, and certain other bordering
  states.They have only two castes, masters and slaves. One becomes a master and then a
  slave, and a slave becomes a master.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Asslaayana, when this is so, with what powers and convictions do the Brahmins say
  that they are the highest caste, the others are low. &#133;&#133;re&#133;with his sign and
  heritage?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Whatever good Gotama says, the Brahmins think, they are born, in the highest
  caste, the others are low. &#133;&#133;re&#133;with his sign and heritage.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Assalaayana, is it a warrior, an ordinary man or a slave, who destroys life,
  takes what is not given, misbehaves in sexuality, lies, slanders, talks roughly, talks
  frivolously, covets, bears an angry mind and has wrong view, that after death would be
  born in decrease in hell and not a Brahmin?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;That&#146;s not so good Gotama. A warrior, a Brahmin, an ordinary man or a slave,
  who destroys life, takes what is not given, misbehaves in sexuality, lies, slanders, talks
  roughly, talks frivolously, covets, bears an angry mind and has wrong view, after death
  would be born in decrease in hell.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Asslaayana, when this is so, with what powers and convictions do the Brahmins say
  that they are the highest caste, the others are low. &#133;&#133;re&#133;with his sign and
  heritage?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Whatever good Gotama says, the Brahmins think they are born, in the highest
  caste, the others are low. &#133;&#133;re&#133;with his sign and heritage.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Assalaayana, is it only a Brahmin, who abstains from, destroying life, taking
  what is not given, does not misbehave in sexuality, does not, lie, slander, talk roughly,
  or talk frivolously, does not covet and bear an angry mind and has right view, that after
  death would be born in increase in heaven and not a warrior, an ordinary man or a
  slave?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;That&#146;s not so good Gotama. A warrior, a Brahmin, an ordinary man or a slave,
  who abstains from, destroying life, taking what is not given, does not misbehave in
  sexuality, does not, lie, slander, talk roughly, or talk frivolously, does not covet and
  bear an angry mind and has right view, after death would be born in increase in heaven.
  Good Gotama, from all four castes, those who abstain from, destroying life, taking what is
  not given, do not misbehave in sexuality, do not, lie, slander, talk roughly, or talk
  frivolously, do not covet and bear an angry mind and have right view, after death would be
  born in increase in heaven.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Asslaayana, when this is so, with what powers convictions do the Brahmins say
  that they are the highest caste, the others are low. &#133;&#133;re&#133;with his sign and
  heritage?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Whatever good Gotama says, the Brahmins say they are born in the highest caste,
  the others are low. &#133;&#133;re&#133;with his sign and heritage.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Assalaayana, are only the Brahmins in this region capable, to develop the thought
  of loving kindness without anger and ill will, not the warriors, the ordinary class or the
  slaves?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, that is not so, the warriors in this region are capable, to develop
  the thought of loving kindness without anger and ill will, also the brahmins, the ordinary
  class and the slaves. It is possible for all four castes in this region to develop the
  thought of loving kindness.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Asslaayana, when this is so, with what powers and convictions do the Brahmins say
  that they are the highest caste, the others are low. &#133;&#133;re&#133;with his sign and
  heritage?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Whatever good Gotama says, the Brahmins think, they are born, in the highest
  caste, the others are low. &#133;&#133;re&#133;with his sign and heritage.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Assalaayana, do you think that only the Brahmins are able to take the brush and
  soap and wash their dust and dirt in the river, not the warriors, the ordinary class and
  the slaves?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, that is not so, the warriors are able to take the brush and soap and
  wash their dust and dirt in the river, so also the brahmins, the ordinary class and the
  slaves. It is possible for all four castes to take the brush and soap and wash their dust
  and dirt in the river.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Asslaayana, when this is so, with what powers and convictions do the Brahmins say
  that, they are the highest caste, the others are low. &#133;&#133;re&#133;with his sign
  and heritage?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Whatever good Gotama says, the Brahmins think they are born in the highest caste,
  the others are low. &#133;&#133;re&#133;with his sign and heritage.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Asslaayana, a head anointed warrior king invites hundreds of people born in
  various clans, such as warrior, Brahmin, the ordinary class or slaves. Whether you are
  born in a hall, under a sweet scented tree, under a Chandana tree, or in a lotus, take an
  outer cover and make a fire. Come sirs, it does not matter, whether you are born with the
  out castes, low castes, bamboo weavers, or chariot makers, or the cleaners. Whether born
  in a trough of the, dogs, pigs, the washerman, or born in some brushwood. Take an outer
  cover and make a fire. If fire that has the flame, colour and lustre is made, could
  anything that is done with fire be done? Those born with the out castes, low castes,
  bamboo weavers, chariot makers or the cleaners, born in a trough of the dogs, pigs, the
  washerman, or born in a brush wood, would take an outer cover and make fire, would not
  that fire give the flame, colour and lustre and wouldn&#146;t whatever that should be done
  with the fire not be done?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, that is not so, whatever clan it may be, warrior, Brahmin, the
  ordinary class or slaves. Whether born in a hall, under a sweet scented tree, under a
  Chandana tree, or in a lotus. If he takes an outer cover and makes a fire, it would have
  the flame, colour and lustre and whatever that could be done with fire could be done with
  it. Even those born with the out castes, low castes, bamboo weavers, or chariot makers, or
  the cleaners, whether born in a trough of the, dogs, pigs, the washerman, or born in some
  brushwood, the fire they make has the flame, colour and lustre and anything that is done
  with fire could be done with it. Good Gotama, all fire has the flame, colour and lustre
  and it is possible to do, whatever work that has to be done with fire.&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Asslaayana, when this is so, with what powers and convictions do the Brahmins say
  that, they are the highest caste, the others are low. &#133;&#133;re&#133;with his sign
  and heritage?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Whatever good Gotama says, the Brahmins think they are born, in the highest
  caste, the others are low. &#133;&#133;re&#133;with his sign and heritage.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Assalaayana, a warrior prince lives with a Brahmin maiden, to them a son is born.
  Is that son born of the warrior prince and Brahmin maiden, according to the father, known
  a &#145;warrior&#146; or according to the mother known a &#145;brahmin?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, that son born of the warrior prince and the Brahmin maiden,
  according to the father should be known a &#145;warrior&#146; and according to the mother
  a &#145;brahmin.&#146;&#145;Assalaayana, a brahmin prince lives with a warrior maiden, to
  them a son is born. Is that son born of the brahmin prince and warrior maiden, according
  to the father known a &#145;brahmin&#146; or according to the mother known a
  &#145;warrior?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, that son born of the Brahmin prince and the warrior maiden,
  according to the father should be known a &#145;brahmin&#146; and according to the mother
  a &#145;warrior.&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Assalaayana, to a mare and donkey a mule is born, according to the mother should it be
  known a&#145;horse&#146; or according to the father should it be known a
  &#145;donkey&#146;?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, it&#146;s from a thoroughbred that a pony is born. Now I see the
  difference, in the earlier examples I did not see any difference.&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Assalaayana, there are two young men brothers, sons of the same mother, one is a
  brahmanic scholar, come of age, the other neither a scholar nor come of age. Of them which
  one do the Brahmins first attend with faith, with milk rice, with the sacrificial cake, or
  with hospitality?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, the Brahmins would first attend on the brahmanic scholar who has
  come of age, with faith, with milk rice, the sacrificial cake, with hospitality. Will
  there be much merit making offerings to the non-scholar not come of age?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Assalaayana, there are two young men brothers, sons of the same mother, one is a
  brahmanic scholar, come of age, unvirtuous and evil. The other neither a scholar nor come
  of age virtuous and with good conduct. Of them which one do the Brahmins first attend with
  faith, with milk rice, with the sacrificial cake, or with hospitality?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, the Brahmins would first attend on the non-scholar, who has not come
  of age, who is virtuous and with good conduct, with faith, with milk rice, with the
  sacrificial cake, with hospitality. How could there be much merit making offerings to the
  unvirtuous evil ones?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Assalaayana, first you came with the purity of the Brahmins, then came with the
  brahmanic scriptures. Now you have turned away from the purity of the four castes, as I
  have shown it to you.&#146; </p>
  <p>When this was said the young man Assalaayana, became silent, confused, the
  bodydrooping, and the face turned down. He sat down not knowing what to say.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Then the Blessed One knew that the young man Assalaayana had become silent with
  confusion, body drooping, and the face down, told him thus. &#146;Assalaayana, in the past
  seven Brahmin sages lived in the forest in huts made of leaves. When they were conversing
  this evil view arose to them. Brahmins are of high caste, all other castes are
  low..Brahmins are pure, the others impure. Brahmins become pure, the others do not.
  Brahmins are the legitimate sons of Brahmaa, born of his mouth, born of him, with his sign
  and heritage. Then the heavenly sage Asita, shaved his head and beard, robed himself in
  brown clothes, dressed in a hardy pair of sandles, taking a golden pole, appeared in front
  of the huts of leaves. There, walking up and down, said. &#145;Where have these Brahmin
  sages gone? Where have these Brahmin sages gone?&#146; Then it occurred to the Brahmin
  sages. &#145;Why is it said, where have these brahmin sages gone?&#146; when the seven
  Brahmin sages are walking mindfully like bulls tied to a threshing pole. They thought we
  will curse him and cursed &#145;Outcaste, go to ashes&#146; When the sages cursed him, the
  heavenly sage Asita became more and more attractive and pleasant to look at. Then it
  occurred to the seven Brahmin sages, our austerities are useless, our holy life is
  fruitless. Earlier when we cursed, &#145;Outcaste, go to ashes&#146; at once it became
  ashes, here he becomes more and more attractive and pleasant to look at. </p>
  <p>&#145;If the austerities of the good sirs is not delusion and if the holy life is not
  fruitless, sirs dispel the curse put on me. If there is a curse on you I will dispel
  that.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Who is this good One?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Have the good ones heard about the heavenly sage Asita?&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Yes, we have good one.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good sirs, I&#146;m that sage.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Then Assalaayana, the seven sages approached the heavenly sage Asita to worship
  him. </p>
  <p>&#145;The heavenly sage Asita, said thus to the seven sages. &#145;I heard, the seven
  Brahmin sages living in the forest in huts made of leaves. When you were conversing did
  this evil view arise to you? Brahmins think, Brahmins, are born, in the highest caste, all
  others are low. Brahmins are pure, the others impure. Brahmins become pure, the others do
  not. Brahmins are the legitimate sons of Brahmaa, born of his mouth, born of him, with his
  sign and heritage. Didn&#146;t it?&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Yes, it did good sir.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good sirs, do you know whether the mother that gave you birth is of Brahmin caste
  and not otherwise?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good sir, we do not know that.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Do you know, whether your mother&#146;s mother as far as the seventh generation,
  were from the Brahmin caste and not otherwise?&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good sir, we do not know that.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good sirs, do you know whether the father that gave you birth is of Brahmin caste
  and not otherwise?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good sir, we do not know that.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Do you know, whether your father&#146;s father as far as the seventh generation,
  were from the Brahmin caste and not otherwise?&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good sir, we do not know that.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Do you good sirs, know, how the descent is, to the womb?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good sir, we know, how the descent is to the womb. The mother and father come
  together, it becomes the season of the mother, the being, to be born attends. When these
  three coincide, there is a descent into the womb.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Do you know, whether, the being who attended is a warrior, a Brahmin, an ordinary
  person or a slave?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good one, we do not know, whether the being who attended was a warrior, a
  Brahmin, an ordinary person or a slave.&#146; <br>
  &#145;When that is so, do you know, what you have become?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;When that is so, we do not know, what we have become.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Assalaayana, the seven Brahmin sages, questioned, studied together, and asked for
  reasons on their view about the purity of birth, could not explain. Here you, questioned
  by me, we studying together and I asking for reasons about the purity of birth you could
  not explain. Didn&#146;t you gain even a spoonful from your teacher?&#146; </p>
  <p>When this was said the young man Assalaayana said. &#145;Now I understand good Gotama.
  I&#146;m a lay disciple who has taken refuge from good Gotama from today until life
  lasts.&#146; </p>
