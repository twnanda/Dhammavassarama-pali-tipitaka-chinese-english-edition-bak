  <b>(95) To the Brahmin Canki</b></font></p>
  <p>I heard thus. </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One touring Kosala, with a large community of bhikkhus, came to
  the Brahmin village Opasaada. The Blessed One abode in the sporting Saala forest to the
  north of Opasaada. At that time the Brahmin Cankii lived in Opasaada, endowed with seven
  marks of a Great Man. He was supplied grass, firewood, water and grains, by king Pasenadi
  of Kosala as royal gifts. The Brahmin householders of Opasaada heard. The good recluse
  Gotama, gone forth homeless, from the clan of the Sakyas is touring the Kosala country
  with a large community of bhikkhus, has arrived in Opasaada. This fame has spread of that
  good Gotama. He is blessed, perfect and rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and
  conduct, gone well, knows the worlds, is the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed,
  teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed. He teaches this world of gods and men,
  together with its Maaras Brahmaas, recluses and Brahmins, a Teaching, by himself known and
  realized. That Teaching is good at the beginning, in the middle and in the end, with
  meanings even in the letters. That Teaching proclaims the complete and pure holy life. It
  is good to see such perfect ones. </p>
  <p>The Brahmin householders, left Opasaada, and gathering and increasing in numbers went
  towards the sporting Saala forest to the north of Opasaada. At this time the Brahmin
  Cankii, was sleeping in the day, in his chamber, on the upper storey of his house. Then he
  saw the Brahmin householders of Opasaada going north towards the sporting Saala forest, in
  large numbers. He addressed his servant. &#145;Friend, why are the Brahmin householders of
  Opasaada going north towards the sporting Saala forest?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good sir Cankii, the recluse Gotama, gone forth homeless, from the clan of the
  Sakyas is touring the Kosala country with a large community of bhikkhus, has arrived in
  Opasaada. This fame has spread of that good Gotama. He is blessed, perfect and rightfully
  enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, gone well, knows the worlds, is the
  incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, is teacher of gods and men,enlightened and
  blessed. He teaches this world of gods and men, together with its Maaras Brahmaas,
  recluses and Brahmins, a Teaching, by himself known and realized. That Teaching is good at
  the beginning, in the middle and in the end, with meanings even in the letters. That
  Teaching proclaims the complete and pure holy life. It is good to see such perfect
  ones.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Then friend, approach those Brahmin householders of Opasaada and tell. The
  Brahmin Cankii says, good sirs go, the Brahmin Cankii too will approach to see the Blessed
  One&#146; </p>
  <p>The servant agreed, approached those Brahmin householders of Opasaada and
  said.&#146;The good Brahmin Cankii says, good sirs go. Brahmin Cankii too will approach to
  see the Blessed One.&#146; </p>
  <p>At that time about five hundred Brahmins from various states were residing in Opasaada
  come there for some purpose. They heard, that the Brahmin Cankii was going to see the
  recluse Gotama and approached the Brahmin Cankii. They asked. &#145;Is it true that good
  Canakii is going to see the recluse Gotama?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Yes, good ones, I too will approach to see the recluse Gotama.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;It is not suitable that good Canakii should approach to see the recluse Gotama,
  it is suitable that the recluse Gotama should approach to see good Cankii. Good Cankii is
  pure of birth on both the mother&#146;s and the father&#146;s side. The purity, is without
  blame about birth, as far back as the seventh fore father. Therefore it is not suitable
  that good Cankii should approach the recluse Gotama, but the recluse Gotama should
  approach good Cankii. Good Cankii has great wealth, is learned in the three Vedas, and the
  rites and rituals as officiating priest. Knows the phonology and etymology of words. Is
  learned in the marks of a Great Man. Good Cankii is pleasant to look at, has a beautiful
  skin complexion, talks politely, has nothing inferior in his appearance. Good Cankii is
  virtuous and well developed in them. Speaks politely, distinctly, words full of meaning.
  Good Cankii is a teacher of many, teaches three hundred young men orally. King Pasenadi of
  Kosala reveres good Cankii. The Brahmin Pokkarasaati reveres good Cankii. The Brahmin
  Cankii lives in Opasaada, endowed with seven marks of a Great Man. He is supplied grass,
  firewood, water and grains, by king Pasenadi of Kosala as royal gifts. Therefore it is not
  suitable that good Canakii should approach to see the Blessed One, it is suitable that the
  recluse Gotama should approach to see good Cankii. </p>
  <p>&#145;Then good sirs, listen to what I have to say about good Gotama, why I should
  approach the recluse Gotama and not that the recluse Gotama should approach me. The good
  recluse Gotama, is pure of birth on both the mother&#146;s and the father&#146;s side. The
  purity, is without blame about birth, as far back as the seventh fore father. Therefore it
  is not suitable that the good recluse Gotama should approach me, but I should approach the
  good recluse Gotama. The recluse Gotama gave up much sterling gold, treasures hidden and
  open and went forth homeless. When young, even in the prime of youth, with dark black
  hair, when his mother and father were crying with tearing eyes, he shaved head and beard
  and went forth. The recluse Gotama is pleasant to look at, has a beautiful skin
  complexion, talks politely, there is nothing inferior in his appearance. The good recluse
  Gotama, is endowed with the noble one&#146;s virtues, speaks politely, distinctly wise
  words full of meaning. The recluse Gotama is the teacher of, the teachers of many. He has
  destroyed greed for sensuality and is firm in his decision. The recluse Gotama tells of
  the results of actions, and is honoured, for not doing evil by the wise. The good recluse
  Gotama went forth from an honoured, wealthy clan with many resources. Many come from
  external countries and states to get questions answered by the good recluse Gotama.
  Thousands of deities have taken refuge in good Gotama until the end of their lives. This
  fame has spread about good Gotama. That Blessed One is perfect, rightfully enlightened,
  endowed with knowledge and conduct, gone well, the incomparable tamer of those to be
  tamed, is teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed. The recluse Gotama is complete
  with the two and thirty marks of a Great Man. The king of MagadhaSeniya Bimbisaratogether
  with his wife and children has taken refuge in the good recluse Gotama until life lasts.
  King Pasenadi of Kosala together with his wife and children has taken refuge in the good
  recluse Gotama. The Brahmin Pokkarasaati together with his wife and children has taken
  refuge in the good recluse Gotama. The recluse Gotama has arrived in Opasaada and abides
  in the sporting Saala forest in the north of Opasaada. Whoever comes to our villages and
  fields are our guests. We should look after our guestsrevere and honour them. On account
  of these things it is not suitable that the recluse Gotama should approach to see me and
  it is suitable I should approach the recluse Gotama. These are not all the good qualities
  of good Gotama, there is much more untold. Taking into account even one of these, it is
  not proper that the recluse Gotama should approach me, but I should approach the recluse
  Gotama. Therefore let us all approach the recluse Gotama. </p>
  <p>The Brahmin Cankii, with a large gathering of Brahmins approached the Blessed One,
  exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side. At that time some elderly Brahmins were
  exchanging friendly greetings with the Blessed One. A young man named Kaapa.thika, about
  sixteen years of age, with shaven head, learned in the three Vedas was seated in that
  gathering. He had learned the phonology and etymology of words, was learned in the marks
  of a Great Man. He interrupted the Blessed One when exchanging friendly greetings with the
  elderly Brahmins. The Blessed One said. &#146;Venerable Bhaaravdaaja do not interrupt when
  we are talking with the elderly Brahmins. When this conversation comes to an end. You
  should talk,&#146; The Brahmin Cankii said. &#145;Good Gotama do not blame the young man
  Kaapa.thika. He speaks well, is wise and young and he could dispute with good Gotama on
  these words.&#146; Then it occurred to the Blessed One. Indeed, there will be a discussion
  with the young man Kaapa.thika on the three Vedas, that he is honoured so much by the
  Brahmins.&#146; It occurred to the young man Kaapa.thika, when the recluse Gotama&#146;s
  eyes meet with mine, I will, ask my question. The Blessed One knowing the thought and
  thought processes of the young man directed his eyes to Kaapa.thika. It occurred to young
  Kaapa.thika, my eyes have met with those of the recluse Gotama, what if I ask the
  question. He said. &#145;Good Gotama, the Brahmins believe the ancient sayings handed down
  through hearsay and by authority is the truth, all else is not the truth. What has good
  Gotama to say about it?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bharadvaaja, is there a single Brahmin, who says, I know this. I see this. This
  only is the truth, all else is false?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;No, good Gotama, there isn&#146;t&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bharadvaaja, is there a single teacher, or a teacher&#146;s teacher up to the
  seventh generation, who says. I know this. I see this. This only is the truth, all else is
  false.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;No, good Gotama, there isn&#146;t.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bharadvaaja, did a single sage of the Brahmins, in the past like Atthaka Vaamaka,
  Vaamadeva, Vessamitta, Yamataggi, Angiirasa, Bharadvaaja, Vaasettha, Kassapa and Bhagu who
  made and protected the ancient sayings like the Brahmins who protect reciting the verses,
  over and over again now, say I know this. I see this. This only is the truth, all else is
  false.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;No, good Gotama, they didn&#146;t.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bharadvaaja, a single Brahmin, among the Brahmins did not say. I know this. I see
  this. This, is the truth, all else is false. A single teacher, or a teacher&#146;s teacher
  up to the seventh generation did not say. I know this. I see this. This, only is the
  truth, all else is false. A single sage of the Brahmins, in the past like Atthaka Vaamaka,
  Vaamadeva, Vessamitta, Yamataggi, Angiirasa, Bharadvaaja, Vaasettha, Kassapa and Bhagu who
  made and protected the ancient sayings like the Brahmins who protect reciting the verses,
  over and over again now, did not say I know this. I see this. This, only is the truth, all
  else is false. Bharadvaaja, it is like a line of blind men holding hands. The first does
  not see, the middle one does not see and the last one does not see. When this is so, the
  words of the Brahmins are similar to the words of a line of blind men. Bharadvaaja,
  isn&#146;t this faith not well established? </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, the Brahmins associate it, on not only faith but, also
  hearsay.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bharadvaaja, earlier your dispute was on faith, now it is on hearsay. These five
  things have twofold results here and now. What are the five? They are faith, liking,
  hearsay, careful thinking and forbearance with view. These five things are with twofold
  results here and now. Bharadvaaja, there is good faith, it becomes useless, not true,
  changes. Again there is much liking, it becomes useless, not true, changes. There is
  hearsay, which becomes useless, not true, changes. There is very careful thinking too,
  which becomes useless, not true, changes. Also there is forbearance with view, which
  becomes useless, not true, changes. It is not suitable for a wise man who protects the
  truth to take a one sided view and say, this only is the truth, all else is not the
  truth.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, how is the truth protected? I ask good Gotama, how is the truth
  protected?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bharadvaaja, to a man there comes faith, this is my faith, he protects those
  words truthfully.On account of that he does not take a superficial view and say, this only
  is the truth, all else is not true. This is only protecting the truth and not realising
  the truth. Bharadvaaja, to a man there comes a liking, this is my liking, he protects
  those words truthfully.On account of that he does not take a superficial view and say,
  this only is the truth, all else is not true. This is only protecting the truth and not
  realising the truth.. Bharadvaaja, to a man there is hearsay, this is my hearsay, he
  protects those words truthfully.On account of that he does not take a superficial view and
  say, this only is the truth, all else is not true. This is only protecting the truth and
  not realising the truth.. Bharadvaaja, to a man there comes careful thinking, this is my
  careful thinking, he protects those words truthfully.On account of that he does not take a
  superficial view and say, this only is the truth, all else is not true.This is only
  protecting the truth and not realising the truth. Bharadvaaja, to a man there comes
  forbearance with views, this is my view, he protects those words truthfully.On account of
  that he does not take a superficial view and say, this only is the truth, all else is not
  true. This is only protecting the truth and not realising the truth.&#146;.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, the truth is protected with this much. Now we see the protection of
  the truth. How is the truth realised? I ask the realization of the truth from good
  Gotama.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bharadvaaja, a bhikkhu lives supported on a certain village or hamlet. A
  householder or the son of a householder approaches this venerable one to examine him to
  see whether he has greedy, angry or deluded thoughts. He examines, is this venerable one
  with such greedy thoughts, overcome by them, not knowing would say I know, not seeing
  would say I saw, or would teach others, in such a way for their ill doing for a long time.
  Then he knows, this venerable one does not have such greedy thoughts, overcome by them,
  not knowing would say I know, not seeing would say I saw, or would teach others, in such a
  way for their ill doing for a long time. This venerable one&#146;s bodily and verbal
  behaviour are those of a not greedy one. If this venerable one teaches something, it is
  deep, difficult to understand, exalted, beyond logic, clever, should be experienced by the
  wise, this cannot be done by a greedy one. When examining he sees the venerable one is
  pure, has no greedy thoughts and examines him further. </p>
  <p>Is this venerable one with such angry thoughts, overcome by them, not knowing would say
  I know, not seeing would say I saw, or would teach others, in such a way for their ill
  doing for a long time. Then he knows, this venerable one does not have such angry
  thoughts, overcome by them, not knowing would say I know, not seeing would say I saw, or
  would teach others, in such a way for their ill doing for a long time. This venerable
  one&#146;s bodily and verbal behaviour are those of one not angry. If this venerable one
  teaches something, it is deep, difficult to understand, exalted, beyond logic, clever,
  should be experienced by the wise, this cannot be done by one who is angry. When examining
  he sees the venerable one is pure, has no angry thoughts and examines him further.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Is this venerable one with such deluded thoughts, overcome by them, not knowing would
  say I know, not seeing would say I saw, or would teach others, in such a way for their ill
  doing for a long time. Then he knows, this venerable one does not have such deluded
  thoughts, overcome by them, not knowing would say I know, not seeing would say I saw, or
  would teach others, in such a way for their ill doing for a long time. This venerable
  one&#146;s bodily and verbal behaviour are those of one not deluded. If this venerable one
  teaches something, it is deep, difficult to understand, exalted, beyond logic, clever,
  should be experienced by the wise, this cannot be done by one who is deluded. When
  examining he sees the venerable one is pure, not deluded. Thus faith gets established in
  him, with faith he approaches to associate. When associating he lends ear to listen to the
  Teaching and to bear it in his mind. When the Teaching is borne in the mind it is
  examined. When examining the meanings, he speculates patiently and an interest is born.
  With bon interest he struggles to weigh facts. Weighing makes the fourfold endeavour to
  realise the highest truth. Then realises the highest truth even with the body, also sees
  it with penetrating wisdom. Bharadvaaja, with this much the truth is realised. I declare
  this as the realising of the truth.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, now, I know the realising of the truth. How is this attained? Good
  Gotama, teach me that attainment and realization.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bharadvaaja, practising, developing and making much of those same things lead to
  the realization of the truth. I declare that the realization of the truth is this
  much.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, now I know the realising of the truth. What things are of much help
  for realising the truth?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bharadvaaja, the fourfold endeavour is of much help for the realisation of the
  truth. If not for the fourfold endeavour, the realisation of the truth is not. Therefore
  the fourfold endeavour is of much help for the realisation of the truth.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, for the fourfold endeavour, what thing is of much help?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bharadvaaja, weighing (* 1) is of much help for the fourfold endeavour. Without
  the weighing there is no fourfold effort, therefore weighing is of much help for the
  fourfold endeavour.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, for weighing, what thing is of much help? </p>
  <p style="margin-top:12.0pt">Bharadvaaja, struggling (* 2) is of much help for weighing.
  Without that struggle there is no weighing, therefore that struggle is of much help for
  weighing&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, for struggling, what thing is of much help? </p>
  <p>&#145;Bharadvaaja, interest, is of much help for struggling. Without that interest,
  there is no struggle, therefore that interest is of much help for struggling.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, for interest, what thing is of much help? </p>
  <p>&#145;Bharadvaaja, rightful speculation (* 3), is of much help for interest.. Without
  the rightful speculating mind, there is no interest, therefore the rightful speculative
  mind is of much help for interest.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, for a rightful speculative mind, what thing is of much help? </p>
  <p>&#145;Bharadvaaja, examining the meanings in the Teaching, is of much help for a
  rightful speculative mind. Without that examining of meanings in the Teaching, there is
  norightful speculation, therefore examining meanings in the Teaching is of much help for a
  speculative mind.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, for examining meanings in the Teaching, what thing is of much help? </p>
  <p>&#145;Bharadvaaja, bearing the Teaching in the mind, is of much help for examining
  meanings in the Teaching. Without bearing the Teaching in mind, there is no examination of
  meanings, therefore bearing the Teaching in mind is of much help for examining meanings in
  the Teaching.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, for bearing the Teaching in the mind, what thing is of much help? </p>
  <p>&#145;Bharadvaaja, listening to the Teaching, is of much help for bearing the Teaching
  in the mind. Without listening to the Teaching, there is no bearing of the Teaching,
  therefore listening to the Teaching, is of much help for bearing the Teaching in the
  mind.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, for listening to the Teaching, what thing is of much help?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bharadvaaja, lending ear, is of much help for listening to the Teaching. Without
  lending ear there is no listening to the Teaching, therefore, lending ear, is of much help
  for listening to the Teaching.&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, for lending ear, what thing is of much help?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bharadvaaja, associating, is of much help for lending ear. Without association
  there is no lending ears, therefore associating is of much help for lending ear.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, for associating, what thing is of much help?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bharadvaaja, approaching, is of much help for associating Without an approach
  there is no association, therefore approaching is of much help for associating..&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, for approaching, what thing is of much help?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bharadvaaja, faith, is of much help for approaching Without faith there is no
  approaching, therefore faith is of much help for approaching..&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;I asked good Gotama, how the truth is protected. Good Gotama explained it to me,
  I like that explanation, I&#146;m pleased with it. I asked good Gotama, how the truth is
  realised.Good Gotama explained it to me, I like that explanation, I&#146;m pleased with
  it. I asked good Gotama, how the realisation of the truth is attained. Good Gotama
  explained it to me, I like that explanation, I&#146;m pleased with it I asked good Gotama,
  what things are of much help for realisation of the truth. Good Gotama explained them to
  me, I like that explanation, I&#146;m pleased with it. Whatever questions I asked, were
  explained to me. I likethat explanation. I&#146;m pleased with it. Good Gotama, earlier I
  thought, who are these shaveling menial recluses, the offerings of the feet of our
  kinsman. Do they know the Teaching? Good Gotama has aroused in me, love for the recluses,
  now I appreciate them and honour them. Good Gotama now I understand. &#150; May I be
  remembered as a lay disciple who has taken refuge in good Gotama from today until life
  lasts.&#146;. </p>
  <p><b>Notes:</b> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Weighing is of much help for the fourfold endeavour. &#146;padhaanassa kho
    bharadvaaja tulanaa bahukaaraa&#146; The fourfold endeavours are pushing the mind forward
    earnestly, to dispel arisen demerit to promote non arising of not arisen demerit To
    promote the arising of not arisen merit and to see the development and completion of
    arisen merit. For this kind of mental work to happen, we should mentally weigh our
    activities by body speech and mind. We should be aware of the activities at the six doors
    of mental contact.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>2. Struggling is of much help for weighing. &#145;Tulanaaya kho bharadvaaja ussaaho
    bahukaaro hoti&#146; This is a mental struggle. It consists of thinking and pondering to
    sort out the correct and comes to be right thinking.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText2">3. Right speculation is of much help for interest.&#146;Chandassa
