  <p>I heard thus: </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika in
  Jeta&#146;s grove in Saavatthi. </p>
  <p>From there the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, &quot;Bhikkhus, I will teach the
  method of the foreat, listen, and attend carefully, I will teach. </p>
  <p>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu abides in a certain forest stretch . When abiding there,
  unestablished mindfulness does not get established, unconcentrated mind does not
  concentrate, not destroyed desires do not get destroyed and the not attained noble end of
  the yoke is not attained, as for the four requisites of life for the gone forth, robes,
  morsel food, dwellings and requities when ill are collected with difficulty. That bhikkhu
  should reflect, I abide in this forest stretch, to me abiding in this forest,
  unestablished mindfulness does not get established, unconcentrated mind does not get
  concentrated, not destroyed desires do not get destroyed and the not attained noble end of
  the yoke is not attained , as for the four requisites of life for the gone forth, robes,
  morsel food dwellings and requisites when ill are collected with difficulty Bhikkhus, he
  should not abide in that stretch of forest, he should leave it by night or by day. </p>

  the yoke is not attained, as for the four requisites of life for the gone forth, robes,
  morsel food, dwellings and requisites when ill are collected without difficulty. That
  bhikkhu should reflect, I abide in this stretch of forest, to me abiding in this forest

  concentrate, the not destroyed desires do not get destroyed, the not attained noble end of
  the yoke is not attained, as for the four requisites of life for the gone forth, robes,
  morsel food, dwellings and requisites when ill are collected without difficulty. I did not
  go forth as a homeless for the sake of robes, morsel food, dwellings and requisites when
  ill, yet to me living in this stretch of forest not established mindfulness does not get
  established, not concentrated mind does not concentrate, the not destroyed desires do not
  get destroyed and the not attained noble end of the yoke is not attained. Bhikkhus, that
  bhikkhu considering should leave that stretch of forest, should not abide there.</p>
