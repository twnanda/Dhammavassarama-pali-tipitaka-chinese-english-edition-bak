  <p>I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika in
  Jeta&#146;s grove in Saavatthi.Then to the bhkikkhus assembled in the attendance hall
  after the mid-day meal, this talk arose..&#146;Friends, it is wonderful, the Blessed One
  who knows and sees, is perfect and rightfully enlightened has said that mindfulness
  established in the body, developped and made much, brings much results and great
  results.&#146; When this conversation was going on, the Blessed One got up from his
  seclusion, in the evening, approched the attendance hall, sat on the prepared seat and
  addressed the bhikkhus. &#145;Bhikkhus, with what talk were you seated here and what was
  the other conversation?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, we were assembled in the attendance hall after the mid-day meal,
  then this talk arose..among us. Friends, it is wonderful, the Blessed One who knows and
  sees, is perfect and rightfully enlightened has said that mindfulness ofthe body in the
  body, developped and made much, brings much results and great results.When this
  conversation was going on, the Blessed One arrived.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhus, mindfulness of the body in the body developped and made much in which
  manner brings much results and great results? The bhikkhu, gone to the forest, or to the
  root of a tree, or to an empty house, sits legs crossed, the body straight, and
  mindfulness established in front. Mindfully he breathes in or breathes out. Breathing in
  long knows, I breathe in long. Breathing out long knows, I breathe out long.Breathing in
  short knows, I breathe in short. Breathing out short knows, I breathe out short. Trains,
  calming the bodily determination I breathe in. Trains,calming the bodily determination I
  breathe out. When he abides diligent to dispel, worldly thoughts and recollections fade
  and his mind gets established in a single point concentrated. Bhikkhus, in this manner too
  mindfulness of the body in the body is developped. </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu going knows, I go. Or standing knows, I stand. Or sitting
  knows, I sit. Or lying knows, I lie. In whatever manner his body is placed, that and that
  he knows When he abides diligent to dispel, worldly thoughts and recollections fade and
  his mind gets established in a single point concentrated. Bhikkhus, in this manner too
  mindfulness of the body in the body is developped. </p>
  <p>Again the bhikkhu becomes aware, going forward or turning back, looking on, or looking
  about, bending or stretching, Becomes aware bearing the three robes and bowl, Becomes
  aware enjoying, drinking, eating or tasting. Becomes aware going, standing, sitting,
  lying, speaking, or keeping silence.When he abides diligent to dispel, worldly thoughts
  and recollections fade and his mind gets established in a single point concentrated.
  Bhikkhus, in this manner too mindfulness of the body in the body is developped. </p>
  <p>Again, the bhikkhu abides reflecting this body up from the sole, down from the hair on
  the top and surrounded by the skin as full of various impurities. There are in this body,
  hair of the head and body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, veins, bones, bone marrow, kidneys,
  heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, lower intestines, bowels, stomach, excreta, bile,
  phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, eye secretions, saliva, snot, oil of joints,
  urine,Just like a bag of provisions open on both sides, is filled up with various grains
  such as rice, paddy, green grams, beans, sesame, fine rice. A man who could see would pull
  it out and reflect, this is rice, this paddy, this green grams, this beans, this sesame,
  and this is fine rice. In the same manner the bhikkhu abides reflecting this body, up from
  the sole, down from the hair on the top and surrounded by the skin as full of various
  impurities. There are in this body, hair of the head and body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh,
  veins, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, lower intestines,
  bowels, stomach, excreta, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, eye secretions,
  saliva, snot, oil of joints and urine.When he abides diligent to dispel, worldly thoughts
  and recollections fade and his mind gets established in a single point concentrated.
  Bhikkhus, in this manner too mindfulness of the body in the body is developped </p>
  <p>Again the bhikkhu abides reflecting this body as elements in whatever posture it is.
  There are in this body, the elements, earth, water, fire and air.Just as a clever butcher
  or his apprenticewould be seated in a hut at the four cross roads with a killed cow
  dissecting it into small bits. In the same manner, in this body, there are the elements
  earth, water, fire and air.When he abides diligent to dispel, worldly thoughts and
  recollections fade and his mind gets established in a single point concentrated. Bhikkhus,
  in this manner too mindfulness of the body in the body is developped </p>
  <p>Again, the bhikkhu reflects this body as a dead body thrown in the charnel ground,
  either after one day, two days or three days, bloated, turned blue and festering. This
  body too is subject to that same,has not gone beyond it. When he abides diligent to
  dispel, worldly thoughts and recollections fade and his mind gets established in a single
  point concentrated. Bhikkhus, in this manner too mindfulness of the body in the body is
  developped . </p>
  <p>Again, the bhikkhu abides reflectingthis body as a dead body thrown in the charnel
  ground eaten by hawks, vultures, dogs, foxes, or by various other living things. This body
  too is subject to that same, has not gone beyond it.Again, the bhikkhu abides
  reflectingthis body as a dead body thrown in the charnel ground eaten by hawks, vultures,
  dogs, foxes, or by various other living things. This body too is subject to that same, has
  not gone beyond it.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu reflects this body as thrown in the charnel ground, as a
  skeleton with flesh and blood bound with nerves, as a skeleton without flesh, smeared with
  blood and bound with nerves, as a skeleton without flesh and blood, bound with nerves, as
  a skeleton not bound together, thrown here and there, the bones of the hands here and the
  bones of the legs there, the knee bone, the thigh bones, the hip bone, the back bone, and
  the skull thrown here and there. Then he considers, to this body too this same would
  happen, it has not gone beyond that. </p>
  <p>When he abides diligent to dispel, worldly thoughts and recollections fade and his mind
  gets established in a single point concentrated. Bhikkhus, in this manner too mindfulness
  of the body in the body is developped. </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu reflects this body as thrown in the charnel ground, as
  bones turned white the colour of shells, as rotted bones, as bones three years old,
  decayed and turned to dust Then he considers, to this body too this same would happen, it
  has not gone beyond that.When he abides diligent to dispel, worldly thoughts and
  recollections fade and his mind gets established in a single point concentrated. Bhikkhus,
  in this manner too mindfulness of the body in the body is developped. </p>
  <p>Again the bhikkhu secluding the mind from sensual thoughts and defiling thoughts. With
  thoughts and thought processes, and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion, abides in
  the first jhaana. He pervades this body, perfects it and fills it up with joy and
  pleasantness born of seclusion.Does not leave a single spot untouched with that joy and
  pleasantness born of seclusion. Bhikkhus, like a bather or his apprentice, would place
  some bathing powder in a bronze vessel, would mix it sprinkling water and turning itinto a
  ball of lather.He would mix it well, until the lather becomes a ball and nothing would
  trickle down from it. In the same manner he would pervade this body, perfect itand fill it
  up with the joy and pleasantness born of seclusion, not leaving a single spot untouched
  with that joy and pleasantness.When he abides diligent to dispel, worldly thoughts and
  recollections fade and his mind gets established in a single point concentrated. Bhikkhus,
  in this manner too mindfulness of the body in the body is developped. </p>
  <p>Again, the bhikkhu overcoming,thoughtsand thought processes, would bring the mind to a
  single point appeasing it internally. And without thoughts and thought processes and with
  joy and pleasantness born of concentration would abide in the second jhaana. Then he would
  pervade this body, perfect it and fill it up with joy and pleasantness born of
  concentration. He would not leave a single spot untouched with that joy and pleasantness
  born of concentration. Like a deep pond without inlets from the east, west, north or
  south, is filled up with cool water springing from the bottom. Rain water too would not
  enter it.The cool water coming up, would fill it flowing all round and completing it, not
  leaving a single spot untouched by that cold water. In the same manner he pervades this
  body, perfects it and fills it up with joy and pleasantness born of concentration.Would
  not leave a single spot untouched with the joy and pleasantness born of concentration.
  When he abides diligent to dispel, worldly thoughts and recollections fade and his mind
  gets established in a single point concentrated. Bhikkhus, in this manner too mindfulness
  of the body in the body is developped...&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Again, the bhikkhu, with equanimity to joy and detachment, would abide mindful and
  aware, experiencing pleasantness too with the body and abide in the third jhaana.To this
  the noble ones say abiding in pleasantness with equanimity.Then he pervades this body,
  perfects it, fills it up with pleasantness devoid of joy. Wouldnot leave a single spot
  untouched with that pleasantness devoid of joy. Like, ofblue,red and white lotuses that
  grow in a pond, some areborn,grow,develop, nourish and bloomin the water. Their tops and
  roots are pervaded with the cold water and they do not have a place not touched with the
  cold water. In the same manner he pervades this body, perfects it, and fills it up with
  pleasantness devoid of joy, touchingeverything with that pleasantness. When he abides
  diligent to dispel, worldly thoughts and recollections fade and his mind gets established
  in a single point concentrated. Bhikkhus, in this manner too mindfulness of the body in
  the body is developped.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Again the bhikkhu, dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness, and earlier over
  coming,pleasure and displeasure, with mindfulness purified with equanimity abides in the
  fourth jhaana. Then.he sits pervading the whole body with that pure and clean mind, not
  leaving out any spot. Like a man who has covered himself with a white cloth together with
  the head, without leaving out anything. In the same manner he sits pervading the whole
  body with that pure clean mind, not leaving out any spot untouched with the pure clean
  mind. When he abides diligent to dispel, worldly thoughts and recollections fade and his
  mind gets established in a single point concentrated. Bhikkhus, in this manner too
  mindfulness of the body in the body is developped. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, to whomever bhikkhu mindfulness of the body in the body are developped and
  made much his thoughts of merit are intense with knowledge. Bhikkhus, just as whoseever
  mind is intensely spread to the great ocean, to him all rivulets are bent to the great
  ocean. In the same manner to whomever bhikkhu mindfulness of the body in the body is
  developped and made much his thoughts of merit are intense with knowledge. Bhikkhus, to
  whomever bhikkhu mindfulness of the body in the body is not developped and not made much,
  Death finds access to him. Death finds a sign in him. (*1) Like a man putting a huge stone
  in a lump of wet mud. Bhikkhus, would the huge stone find access into the lump of wet mud?
  </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, it would.find access.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;In the same manner, bhikkhus, a man come to a dry sapless log with an overcover,
  saying, I will light a fire, and make fire. Bhikkhus, that man, come to the dry sapless
  log of wood with the overcover rubbing it with the overcover would he light a fire and
  make fire?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, he would light a fire.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhus, in the same manner, to whomever bhikkhu mindfulness of the body in the
  body is not developped and not made much, Death finds access to him. Death finds a sign in
  him. (*1) Like when there is an empty water vessel standing upright a man comes with a
  load of water. Bhikkhus, would it be possible for that man to fill the water vessel?&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>&#145;Yes, venerable sir, it would be possible.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhuz, in the same manner to whomever bhikkhu mindfulness of the body in the
  body is not developped and not made much, Death finds access to him. Death finds a sign in
  him.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhus, in the same manner, to whomever bhikkhu mindfulness of the body in the
  body is developped and made much, Death will not find access to him. Death will not find a
  sign in him. Like a man who would put a small ball of thread on a well formed cross bar.
  Bhikkhus, do you think it would find access in the well formed cross bar?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, it would not.&#146; . </p>
  <p>&#145;In the same manner bhikkhus, to whomever bhikkhu mindfulness of the body in the
  body is developped and made much, Death will not find access to him. Death will not find a
  sign in him. Like a man come to a wet sappy log with an overcover, saying, I will light a
  fire, and make fire. Bhikkhus, that man, come to the wet sappy log of wood with the
  overcover rubbing it with the overcover would he light a fire and make fire?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, he would not light a fire.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhus, in the same manner, to whomever bhikkhu mindfulness of the body in the
  body is developped and made much, Death will not find access to him. Death will not find a
  sign in him. Like when there is a water vessel standing upright full to the brim, a man
  comes with a load of water. Bhikkhus, would it be possible for that man to fill the water
  vessel?&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;No, venerable sir, it would not be possible.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;In the same manner bhikkhus, to whomever bhikkhu mindfulness of the body in the
  body is developped and made much, Death will not find access to him. Death will not find a
  sign in him. </p>
  <p>Mindfulness of the body in the body developped and made much, directed for the
  realization of whatever higher knowledge, becomes the eye witness in that and that sphere.
  As there is a vessel with water filled to the brim, then a strong man comes, in whatever
  manner he considers, about it, it&#146;s water. </p>
  <p>Mindfulness of the body in the body developped and made much, when directed for the
  realization of whatever higher knowledge, it becomes the eye witness in that and that
  sphere. (*2) As on level ground, there is a square pond with embankments, filled to the
  brim, a strong man comes and opens the enbankments in some manner, isn&#146;t it water
  that comes out?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, it is water?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhus, in the same manner mindfulness of the body in the body developped and
  made much, when directed for the realization of </p>
  <p>whatever higher knowledge, it becomes the eye witness in that and that sphere. As on
  level ground, on the four cross roads, stands a carriage yoked to thoroughbreds, ready
  with whip and reins. A trainer of horses comes, ascends the carriage and taking the reins
  in the left hand and the whip in the right,goes where he likes and recalls. In the same
  manner mindfulness of the body in the body developped and made much, directed for the
  realization of </p>
  <p>whatever higher knowledge, becomes the eye witness in that and that sphere.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, mindfulness of the body in the body, practised, developped, made much, made
  the vehicle, made the foundation, indulged in the practise with aroused effort, I declare
  ten benefits. What are the ten? </p>
  <p>Overcoming whatever dislikes lives with like and dislike Overcoming whatever fears
  lives without fears. Endures cold and heat, hunger and thirst, the sting of gad flies and
  yellow flies, the heat of the air, the sting of serpents and creepings, badly enunciated
  words with hurtful contacts. Endures bodily unpleasant feelings that are sharp piercing
  and unwelcome Becomes a quick and easy gainer of the four jhaanas, the high and pleasant
  abidings of the mind, here and now. Partakes of various supernormal powers, such as one
  becomes many and many becomes one. Goes unobstructed across walls, embankments, rocks,
  like going in space. Dives in and out of earth as though in water. Goes unbroken on water
  as though on earth. Abides in space like birds large and small. Touches and rubs off with
  the hand, even the moon and sun, so powerful as they are. Thus wields power with the body
  as far as the world of Brahmaa. With the heavenly ear purified beyond human hears both
  sounds, heavenly and human, far and near. Penetrates and sees the minds of other beings.
  Sees the greedy mind, the not greedy mind, the angry mind, the not angry mind, the deluded
  mind and the not deluded mind. Knows the contracted mind, the distracted mind, the
  developped mind, the undevelopped mind, the noble mindand the mind without compare. Knows
  the concentrated mind, the unconcentrated mind, the released mind and the unreleased mind.
  Recollects the manifold previous births. Such as one birth, two births ...re.....with all
  modes and details the various previous births. With the purified heavenly eye beyond human
  sees beings disappearing and appearing in unexalted and exalted states, beautiful and
  ugly, in good and bad states. </p>
  <p>Sees beings according to their actions. Destroying desires, the mind released from
  desires and released through wisdom, here and now by oneself realizing abides. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, mindfulness of the body in the body, practised, developped, made much, made
  the vehicle, made the foundation, indulged in the practise with aroused effort, I declare
  these ten benefits. </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One </p>
  <p><b>Notes.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. To whomever bhikkhu mindfulness of the body in the body is not developped and made
    much, Death finds access to him. <em>&#145;Yassa kassaci bhikkhave, bhikkhuno kaayagataa
    sati abhaavitaa abahuliitakaa labhati tassa Maaro otara.m. labhati tassa Maaro
    aarammana.m.&#146; &#145;Maara&#146;</em> though alluded to a supernormal being, here it
    means the defilements in the thoughts.of the bhikkhu. </p>
    <p>2. Mindfulness of the body in the body developped and made much, when directed to the
    realization of whatever higher knowledge, it becomes the eye witness in that and that
    sphere.&#146;<em>Yassa kassaci bhikkhave kaayagataa sati bhaavitaa bahuliikataa, so yassa
    yassa abhi~n~naa sacchikaraniiyassa dhammassa citta.m abhininnaameti
    abhi~n~naasacchikiriyaaya tatra tatr&#146;eva sakkhibhavyata.m paapunaati sati sati
    aayatane</em>. The thorough development of mindfulness of the body in the body, leads the
    bhikku for the realization of the higher knowledges. It is said that, that developped
    mindfulness, is the eye witness of those higher knowledges. There is no other evidence of
    these attainments. </p>
