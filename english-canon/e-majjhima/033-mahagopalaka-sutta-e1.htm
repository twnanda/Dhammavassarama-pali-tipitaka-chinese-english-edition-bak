  <b>(33) The Major Discourse on the Cowherd</b>. </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus. </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika in
  Jeta&#146;s grove in Saavatthi. From there the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, it is not possible for the cowherd to increase his fold endowed with eleven
  characteristics. What eleven: The cowherd does not know matter, is not clever in marks, is
  not a dispeller of nits, does not dress wounds, does not make smoke, does not know the
  ford, does not experience joy, does not know the path, is not clever in finding pastures,
  does the mistake of not leaving a remainder, does not pay special attention to the
  forefathers of the herd. Endowed with these eleven factors, it is not possible that the
  cowherd could care for his herd or increase his herd, --In the same manner, the bhikkhu
  endowed with these eleven characteristics would not come to growth and increase in this
  dispensation, What eleven?. The bhikkhu does not know matter, is not clever in marks, does
  not dispel nits, does not dress wounds, does not make smoke, does not know the ford, does
  not experience joy, does not know the path, is not clever in finding pastures, does the
  mistake of not leaving a remainder, does not pay special attention to the forefathers of
  the Community.Endowed with these eleven factors, it is not possible that the bhikkhu could
  come to growth and increase in this dispensation. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu not know matter. The bhikkhu does not know as it really
  is, that all matter is matter of the four great elements and the matter held as mine from
  the four great elements. Thus, the bhikkhu does not know matter. How is the bhikkhu not
  clever in marks. The bhikkhu does not know as it really is, the fool by his actions, and
  the wise one by his actions, thus the bhikkhu is not clever in marks. How does the bhikkhu
  not dispel nits. Here the bhikkhu endures sensual thoughts does not chase them out and
  make them not rise again,. Endures angry thoughts, does not chase them out, and make them
  not rise again. Endures hurting thoughts, does not chase them out, and make them not rise
  again. Endures arisen demerit does not chase it out, and make it not rise again. Thus the
  bhikkhu does not dispel nits. How does the bhikkhu not dress the wounds.The bhikkhu seeing
  a form with the eye takes the sign and the details. To one abiding uncontrolled in the
  faculty of the eye, evil demerit of covetousness and displeasure may trickle down, to its
  control he does not fall, does not protect the faculty of the eye. Hearing a sound with
  the ear&#151;Cognizing a smell with the nose&#151;Coignizing a taste with the tongue,
  --Cognizing a touch with the body, Cognizing an idea with the mind does not take the sign
  or the details. To one abiding uncontrolled in the faculty of the mind, evil demerit, of
  covetousness .and displeasure may trickle down. To its control he does not fall, does not
  protect the faculty of the mind. Thus the bhikkhu does not dress the wounds. Bhikkhus, how
  does the bhikkhu not make smoke Here the bhikkhu, does not explain the Teaching to others
  as he has learnt and experienced, Thus the bhikkhu does not make smoke. Bhikkhus, how does
  the bhikkhu not know the ford: The bhikkhu does not approach the learned bearers of the
  Teaching and Discipline, those who know the headings, from time to time, to question and
  cross question, to know the meanings. So that those venerable ones would explain the
  hidden meanings and would dispel doubts. Thus the bhikkhu does not know the ford.
  Bhikkhus, how does the bhikkhu not experience joy? In the Teaching and Discipline declared
  by the Thus Gone One, the bhikkhu does not experience the meanings in the Teaching and the
  joy on account of it.* Thus the bhikkhu does not experience joy. How does the bhikkhu not
  know the paths?. Here the bhikkhu does not know the noble eightfold path as it really is.
  Thus the bhikkhu does not know the path. How is the bhikkhu not clever in finding
  pastures? Here the bhikkhu does not know as it really the four establishments of
  mindfulness. Thus the bhikkhu is not clever in finding pastures. How does the bhikkhu make
  the mistake of not leaving a remainder. Here the bhikkhu accepts robes, morsel food,
  dwellings and requisites when ill, offered by householders out of faith, not knowing the
  amount to accept. Thus the bhikkhu makes the mistake of not leaving a remainder. How does
  the bhikkhu not pay attention to the forefathers of the Community. Here the bhikkhu does
  not attend with bodily actions of loving kindness, verbal actions of loving kindness, and
  mental actions of loving kindness, towards the leaders of the Community. Those with a long
  standing and need special attention. Thus the bhikkhu does not attend to the forefathers
  of the Community. It is not possible that the bhikkhu endowed with these eleven
  characteristics should come to growth and development in this Teaching and Discipline. . </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, it is possible that the cowherd could increase his fold endowed with eleven
  characteristics. What eleven: The cowherd knows matter. Is clever in knowing marks.
  Dispels nits, dresses wounds, makes smoke, knows the ford, experiences joy, and knows the
  path. Is clever in finding pastures, does no mistake of not leaving a remainder. Pays
  special attention to the forefathers of the herd. Endowed with these eleven factors, it is
  possible that the cowherd could care his herd and increase his herd. In the same way, the
  bhikkhu endowed with these eleven characteristics would come to growth and increase in
  this dispensation. What eleven? The bhikkhu knows matter. Is clever in marks, dispels
  nits, dresses wounds, makes smoke, knows the ford, experiences the joy, knows the path and
  is clever in finding pastures. He does no mistake of not leaving a remainder. Pays special
  attention to the forefathers of the Community.. Endowed with these eleven factors, it is
  possible that the bhikkhu could come to growth and increase in this Teaching and
  Dispensation </p>

  displeasure may trickle down, to its control he falls, protects the faculty of the eye.

  <p><strong>Notes. </strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. In the Teaching and Discipline declared by the Thus Gone One, the bhikkhu
    experiences meanings in the Teaching and the joy on account of it.&#146;<i>Idha bhikkhave
    bhikkhu Tathaagatappavedite dhammavinaye desiyamaane labhati dhammaveda.m labhati
    dhammuupasa.mhita.m paamujja.m</i>&#146;- The bhikkhu that experiences meanings in the
    Teaching comes to right understanding (<i>sammaadi.t.thi</i>) this is equivalent to
    entering the stream of the Teaching <i>(sotaapanna</i>) which comes about by studying and
    understanding the Teaching declared by the Blessed One. The joy experienced is on account
    of dispelling a large portion of the unpleasantness inherent to any born ordinary person <i>(puthujjana</i>)
