  <b>(108) To the brahmin Gopakamoggallaana.</b> </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At a time, soon after the demise of the Blessed One, venerable Aananda lived in the
  squirrels&#146; sanctury in the bamboo grove in Raajagaha. At that time king Ajaatasattu
  of Magadha the son of the Vedehas was fortifying Raajagaha, fearing an assault from king
  Pajjota. Venerable Aananda wearig robes in the morning, taking bowl and robes entered
  Raajagaha for alms. Then it occurred to venerable Aananda, it is too early to go for alms
  in Raajagaha, what if I approached the work place of the brahmin Gopakamoggallaana. Then
  he approached the work place of the brahmin Gopakamoggallaana and approached him. Seeing
  venerable Aananda approaching in the distance he said to venerable Aananda. &#145;Come!
  good Aananda, it is after a long time we saw good Aananda. Here the seat is ready, may
  good Aananda, take a seat.&#146; Venerable Aananda, sat on the prepared seat, and the
  brahmin too sat on a side, taking a low seat and said. &#145;Good Aananda, is there a
  single bhikkhu, who endowed with all those things is exactly like good Gotama perfect and
  rightfully enlightened?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Brahmin, there is not a single bhikkhu endowed with all those things is exactly
  like the Blessed One perfect and rightfully enlightened. The Blessed One is the founder
  the knower, the declarer of the path, not found, not known and not declared before. He is
  clever and knows the path, his disciples today follow that path and are later endowed with
  those attributes . </p>
  <p>When this conversation was taking place between venerable Aananda and the brahmin
  Gopakamoggallaana, the chief minister of Magadha, the brahmin Vassakaara approached the
  work site and approached the brahmin Gopakamoggallaana to examine the work done in
  Raajagaha. Seeing venerable Aananda, exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side and
  asked. &#145;With what conversation were you here venerable sir?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Brahmin, this brahmin Gopakamoggallaana asked me is there a single bhikkhu who
  endowed with all those things is exactly like good Gotama perfect and rightfully
  enlightened, and I said. Brahmin, there is not a single bhikkhu endowed with all those
  things, is exactly like the Blessed One perfect and rightfully enlightened. The Blessed
  One is the founder the knower, the declarer of the path, not found, not known and not
  declared before. He is clever and knows the path, his disciples today follow that path and
  are later endowed with those attributes. Brahmin, when this conversaton was taking place,
  you arrived.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Aananda, is there a bhikkhu appointed by good Gotama, saying after my demise
  your refuge will be this one, whom you follow now?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Brahmin, there is not a single bhikkhu appointed by good Gotama, saying, after my
  demise your refuge will be this one, whom we follow now.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Aananda, is there a single bhikkhu appointed by a majority of elders in the
  Community of bhikkhus, saying this one will be our refuge after the demise of the Blessed
  One?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Brahmin, there is not a single bhikkhu appointed by a majority of elders in the
  Community of bhikkhus, saying this one will be our refuge after the demise of the Blessed
  One.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Aananda, even without a refuge, what is the reason for this unity?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Brahmin, we are not without a refuge, there is to us the refuge of the
  Teaching.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Aananda, when asked, is there a bhikkhu appointed by good Gotama, saying
  after my demise your refuge will be this one, you should follow him. It was said, </p>
  <p>Brahmin, there is not a single bhikkhu appointed by good Gotama, saying after my demise
  your refuge will be this one, you should follow him. When asked </p>
  <p>is there a single bhikkhu appointed by a majority of elders in the Community of
  bhikkhus, saying this one will be our refuge after the demise of the Blessed One, </p>
  <p>it was said, there is not a single bhikkhu appointed by a majority of elders in the
  Community of bhikkhus, saying this one will be our refuge after the demise of the Blessed
  One. When asked even without a refuge, what is the reason for this unity, it was said we
  are not without a refuge, there is to us the refuge of the Teaching. How could these words
  of venerable Aananda be explained?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Brahmin, the Blessed One who knows and sees, is perfect and rightfully </p>
  <p>enlightened has declared ten things which arouse confidence in us. Seeing these in the
  Teaching we abide revering and honouring the Teaching. What are the ten? </p>
  <p>Brahmin, the bhikkhu becomes virtuous abiding restrained in the higher code of rules,
  practises the right conduct seeing fear in the slightest fault. Becomes learned in the
  Teaching, good at the beginning, in the middle and the end, bearing it in the mind
  treasures it.Sees it full of meanings even in the words, explaining the complete and pure
  holy life. Of such a Teaching he becomes learned in words and meanings and penetratingly
  sees it himself. Becomes contented in whatever gains of robes, morsels, dwellings and
  requisites for the ill. Becomes a quick and easy gainer of the four jhaanas, the pure
  states of the mind, enjoyed gratis here and now. Enjoys the various super normal powers
  such as,.one becomes many and many becomes one. Appears and disappears unhindered across
  walls, embankments and rocks, as though going in space. Dives and comes up from earth as
  in water. Walks unbroken on water as though on earth. Sits cross legged in space as birds
  small and large do. Touches and rubs off with the hand even moon and sun, so powerful as
  they are. Thus wields power with the body as far as the world of Brahmaa. With the
  purified heavenly ear beyond human, hears sounds both divine and human, far and near. </p>
  <p>Penetratingly sees the minds of others. Knows the mind with greed and without greed,
  the angry mind and the not angry mind, the deluded mind and the not deluded mind. Knows
  the scattered mind and the not scattered mind, the lofty mind and the not lofty mind, the
  mind with a compare and the mind without a compare. Knows the concentrated mind and the
  not concentrated, the released mind and the not released mind. Recollects, the manifold
  previous births, such as one birth, two births, ....re ......thus recollects the manifold
  previous births. With the divine eye purified beyond human sees beings appearing and
  disappearing, in inferior and superior states, beautiful and ugly, in hell and heaven,
  knows beings born according to their actions. Destroying desires, the mind released and
  released through wisdom, here and now realizes and abides.Brahmin, the Blessed One who
  knows and sees, is perfect and rightfully enlightened has declared these ten things which
  arouse confidence in us. Seeing these in the Teaching we abide revering and honouring the
  Teaching.. </p>
  <p>Then the chief minister of Magadha, the brahmin Vassakaara addressed the general
  Upananda.&#146;Look general, these good sirs honour and venerate, what should be honoured
  and venerated, why shouldn&#146;t we honour and venerate the good sirs and live dependent
  on them.&#146; </p>
  <p>Then the chief minister of Magadha said, &#145;Where does venerable Aananda abide at
  present?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Brahmin, at present I live in the bamboo grove.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Aananda, in the bamboo grove, is there a pleasant abiding, is it noiseless,
  away from human habitation and suitable for seclusion?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Indeed brahmin, in the bamboo grove there is a pleasant abiding, it is noiseless,
  away from human habitation and suitable for seclusion as long as those like you protect
  it.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Indeed good Aananda, in the bamboo grove there is a pleasant abiding, it is
  noiseless, away from human habitation and suitable for seclusion, because good sirs like
  you concentrate there. At one time good Gotama was living in the peaked hall in the Great
  forest, in Vesaali and I approached him. At that time good Gotama was explaining
  concentration in various ways. Good Gotama too was concentrating at that time. Does good
  Gotama praise all concentrations?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Brahmin, the Blessed One does not praise all concentrations, nor does he blame
  all concentrations. What kind of concentration does he not praise? Brahmin, a certain one
  abides overcome with sensual greed, not knowing the escape from arisen sensual greed, he
  concentrates with it, and wastes, decays and muses on account of it.Abides overcome with
  anger, not knowing the escape from arisen anger, he concentrates with it, and wastes,
  decays and muses on account of it.Abides overcome with sloth and torpor, not knowing the
  escape from arisen sloth and torpor, he concentrates with it, and wastes, decays and muses
  on account of it.Abides overcome with restlessness and worry, not knowing the escape from
  arisen restlessness and worry, he concentrates with it, and wastes, decays and muses on
  account of it.Abides overcome with doubts, not knowing the escape from arisen doubts, he
  concentrates with it, and wastes, decays and muses on account of it. The Blessed One did
  not praise such concentration. Brahmin, what kind of concentration did the Blessed One
  praise? Brahmin, the bhikkhu secluded from sensual desires and thoughts of demerit, with
  thoughts and thought processes, and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion abides in
  the first jhaana. Overcoming thougts and thought processes and the mind internally
  appeased and settled in one point, and with joy and pleasantness born of concentration
  abides in the second jhaana...re..... in the third jhaana,...re.... abides in the fourth
  jhaana. Brahmin, the Blessed One praises such concentration.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Aananda, good Gotama blames the blameable concentration and praises the
  praiseworthy concentration. Now we will go, there is much work to be done.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Brahmin, do so, if you think it is the time to go.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;The chief minister of Magadha, the brahmin Vassakaara delighted and agreeing with
  the words of venerable Aananda got up from his seat and went away. Soon after he had gone
  away, the brahmin Gopakamoggallaana said. &#145;Good Aananda, did not reply our
  question.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Yet brahmin, I told you. There is not a single bhikkhu endowed with all those
  things is exactly like the Blessed One perfect and rightfully enlightened. The Blessed One
  is the founder the knower, the declarer of the path, not found, not known and not declared
  before. He is clever and knows the path, his disciples today follow that path and are
  later endowed with those attributes.&#146; </p>
