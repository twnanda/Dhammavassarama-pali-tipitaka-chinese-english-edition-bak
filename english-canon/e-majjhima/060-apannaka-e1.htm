  heard thus. </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One was touring the kingdom of Kosala with a large community of
  bhikkhus and entered the brahmin village of Saala. The householders of Saala heard that
  the good recluse Gotama the son of the Sakyas, who had gone forth homeless was touring the
  kingdom of Kosala, with a large community of bhikkhus. That he had entered the brahmin
  village of Saala. Of that good Gotama fame had spread: That blessed one is perfect,
  rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, knower of worlds,
  the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, Teacher of gods and men, enlightened and
  blessed. In this world of gods and men, together with its Maras, Brahmas, the community of
  recluses and brahmins, gods and men, he declares a teaching by himself known and realized.
  Which is good at the beginning, in the middle and at the end, full of meaning even in the
  letters and proclaiming the pure and complete holy life. It is good to see such noble
  ones. Then the brahmin householders of Saala approached the Blessed One, some worshipped
  the Blessed One, some exchanged friendly greetings, some clasped hands towards the Blessed
  One, some announced their clan and name, and some were silent. They all sat on a side.
  Then Blessed One asked them, &#145;Householders, have you a favourite teacher, in whom you
  could gain some faith, gradually?&#146;. &#145;Venerable sir, we have no favourite teacher
  in whom we could gain faith gradually&#146;. &#145;Householders, you who have no teacher
  would you like to observe this inquiring teaching? (* 1). Householders, if you observe
  this inquiring teaching it will be for your good for a long time. What is the inquiring
  teaching?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Householders, there are certain recluses and brahmins who have this view and
  declare it. There are no results for gifts, offerings, or sacrifices. There are no results
  for good and bad actions. There is no this world, no other world, no mother, no father.
  There are no spontaneously arisen beings and there are no recluses and brahmins in this
  world, who come to the right path, have realized this world and the other world and
  declare it. Householders, there are some other recluses and brahmins who have opposite
  views and declare. There are results for gifts, offerings, and sacrifices. There are
  results for good and bad actions. There is this and other world. There is mother, father.
  There are spontaneously arisen beings and recluses and brahmins in this world, come to the
  right path, have realized this world and the other world and declare it. Householders, do
  these two groups of recluses and brahmins bear completely opposite views and declare
  them?&#146;&#145;They do venerable sir&#146;. </p>
  <p>&#145;Householders, those recluses and brahmins who have this view and declare there
  are no results for gifts, offerings, or sacrifices. There are no results for good and bad
  actions, there is no this world, no other world, no mother, no father. There are no
  spontaneously arisen beings recluses and brahmins in this world, who come to the right
  path, have realized this world and the other world and declare it (* 2). We could expect
  this, they would abstain from these three things of merit such as good conduct by body,
  speech and mind, would observe these three things of demerit such as misconduct by body,
  speech and mind. What is the reason? These good recluses and brahmins do not see the
  dangers of demerit, the vile nature of defilements, the purity and the results of merit in
  giving up. There&#146;s another world (* 3). So their view there is no other world,
  becomes wrong view. Words that say, there is no other world, becomes wrong speech. The
  view, there is no other world, is completely opposite to what the noble ones say. The
  noble ones talk of another world. Their instructions, there is no other world, becomes
  wrong instructions, and the wrong teaching. Giving the wrong instructions, they praise
  themselves and disparage others. .By that they decrease in their virtues andaccumulate
  various things of demerit, on account of wrong view. Such as wrong thoughts, wrong speech,
  giving instructions in the wrong teaching quite opposite to the noble one&#146;s teaching,
  and praising themselves and disparaging others. </p>
  <p>A wise man reflects, if there is no other world, these good persons will be well and
  good after death. If there is another world, after death they would go to decrease, to
  hell. Let us say there is no, other world, and the words of these good recluses and
  brahmins are true. Yet they are blamed by the wise, here and now, as un -virtuous ones
  bearing wrong view, and negative ideas. If there is the other world, these good persons
  will have unlucky throws on both sides. The wise will blame them here and now, they will
  decrease in virtues and birth in hell after death. Thus if this pervading teaching is
  observed, it pervades both sides and neglects the side of demerit. </p>
  <p>Householders, there are recluses and brahmins who have this view and declare, there are
  results for gifts, offerings, and sacrifices, there are results for good and bad actions,
  there is this and other world, there is mother and father. There are spontaneously arisen
  beings, recluses and brahmins in this world, who come to the right path, have realized
  this world and the other world and declare it We could expect this Giving up these
  demerits such as misconduct by body, speech and mind, theywould be of right conduct by
  body, speech and mind. Why is that? These good recluses and brahmins see the danger of
  demerit, the impurity of defiling things, the results and the purity of giving up. If
  there is another world, their view there is another world, becomes right view. The thought
  &#145;there is another world,&#146; becomes their right thoughts. The words &#145;there is
  another world,&#146; are right words for them. They that say, &#145;there is another
  world,&#146; come to the same view as the noble ones. They give the right instructions in
  the right Teaching. Thus they do not praise themselves or disparage others. Even from the
  beginning their evil virtues are dispelled Thus they develop much merit on account of
  right view, such as right speech, giving instructions in the teaching which is the same
  that the noble ones say and by that not praising themselves and not disparaging others.. </p>
  <p>Here, householders a wise man reflects thus: If there was another world, these good
  persons after death will go to increase will be born in heaven. Perhaps there was no other
  world and the words of these good recluses and brahmins would not be true. Yet they are
  here and now praised by the wise: These are virtuous persons, with the right view, they
  think there are results for actions. If there was another world, these persons are lucky
  both ways. Here and now they are praised by the wise, and after death, will increase will
  be born in heaven. Thus those who abide by this pervading teaching, pervades both sides
  and keeps away from demerit. </p>
  <p>Householders, there are recluses and brahmins who have this view and declare it. The
  doer and the subject, the destroyer and the destroyed, the tormentor and one tormented,
  the griever and the one that causes it, the one frightened and the monster, the killer,
  the taker of the not given, the one who cuts limbs, the plunderer, the prison keeper, the
  one waiting in ambush, the one going to others&#146; wives, the one telling lies, does no
  demerit. If one was to roll a wheel with blades fixed to the rim, up to the southern bank
  of the Ganges, killing all beings and making it, a mass of flesh, the destroyer does not
  accumulate demerit, on account of it. If one goes up to the northern bank of the Ganges
  giving gifts and making others to give gifts, making sacrifices and making others to
  sacrifice, there is no merit accumulated on account of it. </p>
  <p>Then householders, there are recluses and brahmins who hold a completely opposite view
  to this and declare it The doer and the subject, the destroyer and the destroyed, the
  tormentor and his subject, the griever and the one causing it, the frightened and the
  monster, the killer, the taker of the not given, the one who cuts limbs, the plunderer,
  the prison keeper, the one waiting in ambush, the one going to others&#146; wives, the
  deceiver, doesdemerit. If one was to roll a wheel with blades fixed to the rim, up to the
  southern bank of the Ganges, killing all beings and making it, a mass of flesh, the
  destroyer accumulates demerit, on account of it. If one goes up to the northern bank of
  the Ganges giving gifts and making others to give gifts, making sacrifices and making
  others to sacrifice, there&#146;s merit accumulated on account of it. Householders, do
  these two groups of recluses have completely opposite views?&#146; &#145;Yes, venerable
  sir, they have.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Householders, there are recluses and brahmins who have this view and declare it.
  The doer and the subject neither do demerit. The destroyer and the destroyed, the
  tormentor and his subject, the griever and the giver of grief, the frightened and the
  monster, neither of them do demerit.The killer, the taker of the not given, the one who
  cuts limbs, the plunderer, the prison keeper, the one waiting in ambush, the one going to
  others&#146; wives, the deceiver, they do no demerit. If one was to roll a wheel with
  blades fixed to the rim, up to the southern bank of the Ganges, killing all beings and
  making it, a mass of flesh, the destroyer does not accumulate demerit, on account of it.
  If one goes up to the northern bank of the Ganges giving gifts and making others to give
  gifts, making sacrifices and making others to sacrifice, there is no merit accumulated on
  account of it. We could expect this, from them. They would refrain from the three merits,
  of good conduct by body, speech and mind. Would. Observe the three demerits of misconduct
  by body, speech and mind.. What is the reason? These good recluses and brahmins do not see
  the dangers of demerit, the vile nature of defilements, the purity and the results of
  merit in giving up. There are results for actions, their view, &#145;there are no results
  for actions&#146;, becomes to them wrong view. Words that say &#145;there are no results
  for actions,&#146; becomes to them wrong speech. This view is completely opposite to what
  the noble ones say, the noble ones talk of the results of actions. The instructions,
  &#145;there are no results for actions,&#146; that comes to be giving instructions in the
  wrong Teaching. The giver of wrong instructions praises his, self and disparages others.
  Thus he loses whatever virtues he was endowed with and he accumulates various things of
  demerit on account of wrong view, such as wrong thoughts, wrong speech, giving
  instructions in the wrong Teaching quite opposite to the noble one&#146;s teaching, and
  praising himself and disparaging others. Thus he accumulates much demerit on account of
  wrong view. </p>
  <p>Then a wise man reflects thus. If there are no results for actions, these good persons
  will be well and good after death. If there be results for actions, after death they would
  go to decrease, to hell. Let us say there are no results for actions and the words of
  these good recluses and brahmins become true. Yet they are blamed by the wise, here and
  now, as un virtuous ones bearing the wrong view, there are no results for actions. If
  there are results for actions, these good persons will have unlucky throws on both ways.
  They will be blamed by the wise here and now, and will have a decrease and birth in hell
  after death. Thus if this pervading teaching is observed, it pervades both sides and
  neglects the side of demerit. </p>
  <p>Householders, there are recluses and brahmins who hold this view and declare it.The
  doer and the subject, the destroyer and the destroyed, the tormentor and the subject, the
  griever and the one that causes it, the frightened and the monster, do demerit. The
  killer, the taker of the not given, the one who cuts limbs, the plunderer, the prison
  keeper, the one waiting in ambush, the one going to others&#146; wives, and the deceiver,
  does demerit. If one was to roll a wheel with blades fixed to the rim, up to the southern
  bank of the Ganges, killing all beings and making it, a mass of flesh, the destroyer
  accumulates demerit, on account of it. If one goes up to the northern bank of the Ganges
  giving gifts and making others to give gifts, making sacrifices and making others to
  sacrifice, there is merit accumulated on account of it. We could expect this from them.
  They would give up these demerits such as misconduct by body, speech and mind, would abide
  in the three merits of right conduct by body, speech and mind. Why is that? These good
  recluses and brahmins see the danger of demerit, the impurity of defiling things, the
  results and the purity of giving up. If there are results for actions, their view
  &#145;there are results for actions&#146; becomes right view, for them. . When they think,
  &#145;there are results for actions, that becomes right thoughts for them. When they talk
  that &#145;there are results for actions&#146;, that becomes right words for them. The
  view, there are results for actions, is the same as the view of the noble ones, and the
  instructions they give is the right Teaching. On account of that they do not praise
  themselves or disparage others. Thus from the beginning their evil virtues were dispelled,
  and they accumulate much merit on account of right view, such as right speech, giving
  instructions in the teaching which is the same that the noble ones say and by that not
  praising themselves nor disparaging others.. </p>
  <p>Then a wise man reflects. If there are results for actions, these good persons will go
  to increase will be born in heaven, after death..Let us say there are no results for
  actions, and the words of these good recluses and brahmins are not true. Yet they are
  praised by the wise, here and now, as virtuous, as ones with the right view of actions.If
  there are results for actions, these good persons will have lucky throws on both ways. The
  wise will praise them here and now, they will come to increase and birth in heaven after
  death. Thus if this pervading teaching is observed, it pervades both sides and neglects
  the side of demerit. </p>
  <p>Householders, there are recluses and brahmins of this view and declaring it. Beings are
  impure for no cause or reason, for the purity of beings there is no cause or reason.
  Beings are purified for no reason. There is no strength, no effort, no manly power, no
  manly courage, all beings, all living things, all born are led to maturity and are born in
  the higher six and experience pleasantness and unpleasantness (* 4) without any reason.
  Then householders, there are recluses and brahmins with the view completely opposite to
  this and declaring it. Beings are impure with a cause and reason, for the purity of beings
  there is a cause and reason. beings are purified for some reason. There&#146;s strength,
  effort, manly power, manly courage, all beings, all living things, all born are not led to
  maturity and are born in the higher six and experience pleasantness and unpleasantness.
  &#145;Householders, do these two groups of recluses and brahmins hold views, completely
  opposite to each other?&#146; &#145;They do venerable sir&#146;. </p>
  <p>Then householders, there are recluses and brahmins of this view and declaring it. For
  the impurity of beings there is no cause or reason, for the purity of beings there is no
  cause or reason. There is no strength, no effort, no manly power, no manly courage. All
  beings, living things, all born are led to maturity, and are born in the higher sixand
  experience pleasantness and unpleasantness (* .We should expect this from them. They would
  not observe these three things of merit such as good conduct by body, speech and mind.
  Would observe these three things of demerit such as misconduct by body, speech and mind.
  What is the reason? These good recluses and brahmins do not see the danger of demerit, the
  vile nature of defilements, the purity and the results of merit in giving up. When there
  is a cause they have the view there is no cause. That becomes wrong view, words that say
  there is no cause or reason, becomes wrong speech. When there is a cause they said, there
  is no cause. This view is completely opposite to what the noble ones say, the noble ones
  talk of a cause. When there is a cause, they instructed there is no cause. That becomes
  giving instructions in the wrong Teaching. Giving wrong instructions he praises his self
  and disparages others. Thus he loses whatever virtues he was endowed with. He accumulates
  various things of demerit on account of wrong view, such as wrong thoughts, wrong speech,
  giving instructions in the wrong Teaching quite opposite to the noble one&#146;s teaching,
  and praising themselves and disparaging others. Thus he accumulates much demerit on
  account of wrong view. </p>
  <p>A wise man reflects thus. If there is no cause, these good persons will be well and
  good after death. If there be a cause, after death they would go to decrease, to hell. Let
  us say, there is no cause, then the words of these good recluses and brahmins become true.
  Yet they are blamed by the wise, here and now, as un virtuous ones with the wrong view,
  there is no cause. If there is a cause, these good persons will have unlucky throws on
  both ways. The wise will blame them here and now, after death, a decrease and birth in
  hell. Thus if this pervading teaching is observed, it pervades both sides and neglects the
  side of demerit. </p>
  <p>Householders, there are recluses and brahmins with the view, for the impurity of beings
  there is a cause and reason, for the purity of beings there is a cause and reason. There
  is strength, effort, manly power and courage. All beings, all living things, all born are
  not led to maturity by accident and are born in the higher six and experience pleasantness
  and unpleasantness, on account of a reason. We could expect this, from them. They would
  give up these demerits such as misconduct by body, speech and mind and would abide in the
  three merits of right conduct by body, speech and mind. Why is that? These good recluses
  and brahmins see the danger of demerit, the impurity of defiling things, the results and
  the purity of giving up. If there is a cause The view, there is a cause, becomes right
  view. The thoughts there is a cause, become right thoughts. Their words about a cause,
  become right words. The view there is a cause, is the view of the noble ones, and the
  given instructions become instructions in the right Teaching. On account of that they do
  not praise themselves or disparage others. Thus even earlier their evil virtues were given
  up and they develop much merit on account of right view, such as right speech, giving
  instructions in the teaching which is the same that the noble ones say and by it not
  praising themselves and not disparaging others.. </p>
  <p>Then a wise man reflects. If there is a cause, these good persons will go to increase
  will be born in heaven after death. Let us say there is no cause, and the words of these
  good recluses and brahmins are not true. They are praised by the wise, here and now, as
  virtuous ones, with right view, as ones with the right view of cause and effect.If there
  is a cause these good persons will have lucky throws on both ways. Praise from the wise
  here and now, an increase and birth in heaven after death. Thus if this pervading teaching
  is observed, it pervades both sides and neglects the side of demerit. </p>
  <p>Householders, there are recluses and brahmins who have this view and declare it. There
  aren&#146;t completely immaterial states. There are other recluses and brahmins who are
  completely opposite to this view and declare. There are completely immaterial states.
  Householders, do they have completely opposite views?&#146; &#145;Yes venerable sir, they
  have.&#146; &#146;Then a wise man reflects. Those recluses and brahmins who hold the view
  and declare, there aren&#146;t completely immaterial states would say. I have not seen
  this. Those recluses and brahmins who say there are completely immaterial states would
  say. I know this. I who do not see or do not know, should not take a superficial view of
  it. Saying, this only is the truth, all else is not the truth. To think in this manner is
  not suitable for one like me. If the words of those recluses and brahmins who said there
  are no completely immaterial states are true. My birth among material gods of mental
  nature could not be shown. (* 5) If the words of those recluses and brahmins who said
  there are completely immaterial states was true, my birth among immaterial perceptive gods
  could not be shown (* 6) For material reasons, there&#146;s taking sticks, weapons,
  disputes, fights, taking sides and slandering, going on. These are not evident in
  completely immaterial states. So wisely reflecting we could detach from matter, and fall
  to the path of cessation. </p>
  <p>Householders, there are recluses and brahmins who have this view and declare There
  isn&#146;t the complete cessation of being. There are other recluses and brahmins who are
  completely opposite to this view and declare. There is complete cessation of being.
  Householders, do they have completely opposite views? Venerable sir, they have. A wise man
  reflects. There are recluses and brahmins who hold the view and declare, there isn&#146;t
  complete cessation of being. They would say. I have not experienced that. Those recluses
  and brahmins who say there is complete cessation of being, would say. I have experienced
  it. I do not see or know this, so I should not look at it from a superficial angle.
  Saying, this only is the truth, all else is not the truth. To think in this manner is not
  suitable for one like me. If the words of those recluses and brahmins who said there is no
  complete cessation of being is true. My birth among immaterial gods of perceptive nature
  could not be shown. If the words of those recluses and brahmins who said there is complete
  cessation of being is true, there is a possibility that I should cease &#145;to be&#146;
  here and now. (* 7)The view of those recluses and brahmins who say there is no complete
  cessation of being is close upon greed, is fixed to the yoke, is with interest, is close
  upon appropriation, is close to holding. The view of those recluses and brahmins who say
  there is a complete cessation of being is close upon non-greed, unfixed from the yoke,
  without interest, far from appropriation and far from holding. He has fallen to the method
  of ceasing from being, detaching from being, giving up being, by reflecting. </p>
  <p>Householders, there are four persons evident in the world. What four: There is a person
  who torments his self yoked to tormenting. There is a person who torments others yoked to
  tormenting. There is a person who torments his self and others yoked to tormenting. There
  is a person who neither torments his self or others, is unyoked. He is here and now
  appeased, cooled and abides in pleasantness like Brahma. Householders, who torments his
  self yoked to tormenting? A certain person goes without clothes, licks the hands without
  manners as in the Karandakasuttam. --- Thus he abides yoked to giving various kinds of
  torture to the body, tormenting his self yoked to tormenting. Householders, which one
  tortures others yoked to it? A certain person kills pigs and sheep and is yoked to giving
  various kinds of torture to living things. This person torments others yoked to
  tormenting. Householders, which one torments his self and others yoked to tormenting?
  Householders, a certain person is a king or a head anointed warrior&#151;frightening
  others makes them work with tears in their eyes. This one, torments his self and others
  yoked to it. Householders, which one does not torment his self or others and is unyoked?
  Is here and now appeased, cooled and abides in pleasantness like Brahma?. Householders,
  the Thus Gone One is born in the world, perfect and rightfully enlightened,---- dispelling
  the five hindrances and making the minor defilements weak, he secludes the mind from
  sensual desires and thoughts of demerith. With thoughts and thought processes, and with
  joy and pleasantness born of seclusion abides in the first jhaana&#151;the second
  jhaana&#151;third jhaana,---fourth jhaana,-- When the mind is concentrated, pure without
  blemish free of minor defilements workable and malleable and is steady, he directs the
  mind to know previous births. Reflects innumerable previous births. &#150;When the mind is
  concentrated, pure without blemish free from minor defilements, workable malleable and
  steady, he directs the mind to know the disappearing and appearing of beings. With the
  heavenly eye purified beyond human he sees beings disappear and appearnot exalted and
  exalted, beautiful and ugly, good and bad. Knows beings according their actions. When the
  mind is concentrated, pure, without blemish free from minor defilements, workable
  malleable and steady directs the mind for the destruction of desires. He knows as it
  really is, this is unpleasant---- knows the path to the cessation of desires as it really
  is. When he knows and sees thus, his mind is released from sensual desires released from
  the desires &#145;to be&#146; and released from the ignorant desires. When released knows
  I&#146;m released..I have destroyed birth. The holy life is lived, what should be done is
  done, there is nothing more to wish. Householders, this one does not torment himself or
  others, is unyoked. Is here and now appeased, cooled and abides in pleasantness like
  Brahma.&#146; </p>
  <p>When this was said the brahmin householders of Sala said thus to the Blessed One.
  .&#145;Good Gotama, now we understand. It is like something over turned is reinstalled.
  Like something covered is made manifest. As though the path is told to someone who had
  lost his way. It is as though an oil lamp is lighted for the darkness for those who have
  sight to see forms. In various ways good Gotama has explained the Teaching. Now we take
  refuge in Good Gotama, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. May we be remembered
  as lay disciples who have taken refuge from today until life lasts.&#146;. </p>
