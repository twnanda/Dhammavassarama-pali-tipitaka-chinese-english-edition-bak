  <b>(140) Classification of Elements.</b> </strong></font></p>
  <p>I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One while touring the Magadha country entered the potter
  Baggava&#146;s workshop in Rajagaha and told him, &#145;If it is not inconvenient to you,
  I will spend one night in your workshop.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, there is a homeless one already arrived at the workshop, if he
  does not mind, abide as you like.&#146; </p>
  <p>At that time a certain clansman named Pukkusaati who had become homeless out of faith
  in the Blessed One had already arrived at the workshop. The Blessed One approached
  venerable Pukkusaati and said &#146;If it is not inconvenient to the bhikkhu, I will spend
  one night at the workshop.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable one, abide as you wish, in the potter&#146;s workshop, there are no
  problems.&#146; </p>
  <p>Then the Blessed One entered the potter&#146;s workshop, made a spread of dried grass
  in a suitable place, and sat legs crossed, mindfulness established in front of him. The
  Blessed One sat far into the night in the seated posture. Venerable Pukkusaati too spent
  most of the night in the seated posture. Then it occurred to the Blessed One, this
  clansman&#146;s posture is pleasing, I will question him. The Blessed One asked venerable
  Pukkusaati. &#145;Bhikkhu, in whose faith have you become homeless? Or who is your
  Teacher? Or whose Teaching pleases you?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable one, there is the recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyas, become
  homeless. Of that blessed Gotama, such fame has spread: That Blessed One is worthy,
  rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, knows the worlds,
  (*1) is the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, the teacher of gods and men,
  enlightened and blessed. I became homeless with faith in him. That Blessed One is my
  teacher. I&#146;m pleased with that Blessed One&#146;s teaching. &#145; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhu, where does that rightfully enlightened, Blessed One live now? </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable one, in the northern states there is a township named Saavatthi, that
  rightfully enlightened Blessed One, lives there now.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhu, have seen that Blessed One, and seeing, could you recognize him?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable one, I haven&#146;t seen the Blessed One, and seeing him would not
  recognize him.&#146; </p>
  <p>Then it occurred to the Blessed One: This clansman has become homeless on account of
  faith in me and the Blessed One addressed venerable Pukkusaati. &#145;Bhikkhu, I will give
  you the Teaching, listen carefully and attentively.&#146; </p>
  <p>Venerable Pukkusaati replied. &#145;Yes, venerable one.&#146; </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said. &#146;Bhikkhu, man consists of six elements, six spheres of
  contact, eighteen mental ramblings and four resolutions. (Settled in them, should not
  imagine. When not imagining, it is said, the sage is appeased.) Be wise and diligent to
  protect the truth, to develop benevolence and train for appeasement. This is the short
  exposition of the classification of the six elements. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhu, it was said man consists of six elements. Why was it said? The elements are
  earth, water, fire, air, space and consciousness. If it was said, man consists of six
  elements, it was said on account of this. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhu, it was said man consists of six spheres of contact. Why was it said? The
  spheres of contact are eye contact, ear contact, nose contact, tongue contact, body
  contact and mind contact. If it was said, man consists of six spheres of contact, it was
  said on account of this. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhu, it was said man consists of eighteen mental ramblings. Why was it said? Seeing
  a form, the mind thinks discursively, settled in pleasure, settled in displeasure and
  settled in equanimity. Hearing a sound&#133;.re&#133;&#133; Cognizing a
  scent&#133;re&#133;.. Enjoying a taste&#133;..re&#133;. Experiencing a touch on the
  body&#133;re&#133;Cognizing an idea in the mind thinks discursively, settled in pleasure,
  settled in displeasure and settled in equanimity. Thus there are six ramblings of the mind
  in pleasure, six ramblings of the mind in displeasure and six ramblings of the mind in
  equanimity. If it was said, man consists of eighteen mental ramblings, it was said on
  account of this. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhu, it was said man is of four resolutions. Why was it said? They are the
  resolutions of wisdom, of truth, of giving up and appeasement. If it was said, man is of
  four resolutions, it was said on account of this. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhu, it was said be wise and diligent to protect the truth, to develop benevolence
  and train for appeasement. Why was it said? How is the bhikkhu wise and diligent? These
  six are the elements. That is earth, water, fire, air, space and consciousness. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhu, what is earth element? There is internal and external earth element. What is
  internal earth element? It is the hard internal, personal earth such as hair, on the head,
  on the body, nails, teeth, outer skin, flesh, veins, bones, bone marrow, kidney, heart,
  liver, lungs, spleen, intestines, larger intestines, belly, excreta and any other thing
  that is hard, internal, personal, and fixed as one&#146;s own. This internal and external
  earth is the earth element. These are not me. I&#146;m not in them. They are not self.
  This should be seen with right wisdom, as it really is and the mind should be nipped and
  detached from the earth element. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhu, what is the water element? There is internal and external water element. What
  is internal water element? That which is internal, personal, watery and fixed as
  one&#146;s own, such as bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, oil of the body, tears, oil of
  the eyes, spit, snot, oil of the joints, urine and any other thing that is internal,
  personal, watery and fixed as one&#146;s own. Bhikkhu, this is internal water element.
  This internal water element and the external water element, go as water element. These are
  not me. I&#146;m not in them. They are not self. This should be seen with right wisdom, as
  it really is and the mind should be nipped and detached from the water element </p>
  <p>Bhikkhu, what is the fire element? There is internal and external fire element. What is
  internal fire element? That which is internal, personal, fiery and fixed as one&#146;s
  own. By which there is heat and burning, and anything enjoyed, drunk, eaten and tasted is
  digested, and any other thing that is internal, personal, fiery and fixed as one&#146;s
  own. Bhikkhu, this is internal fire element. This internal fire element and external fire
  element, is fire element. These are not me. I&#146;m not in them. They are not self. This
  should be seen with right wisdom, as it really is and the mind should be nipped and
  detached from the fire element. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhu, what is air element? There is internal and external air element. What is
  internal air element? The internal air that goes up and down the body, air in the belly,
  in the lower portion of the abdomen, air going up and down the limbs, in breaths and out
  breaths or any other internal, personal, airy thing is internal air element. Bhikkhu, this
  internal and external air element, is the air element. It is not me. I&#146;m not in it.
  It is not self. This should be seen with right wisdom, as it really is and the mind should
  be nipped and detached from the air element. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhu, what is the element of space? There is internal and external space element.
  What is internal space element? The internal spaces in the form of space in the ear lobes,
  nostrils, open space from the mouth, where anything enjoyed, drunk, eaten and tasted is
  stored, and the space through which it is turned out or any other internal, space that is
  one&#146;s own. Bhikkhu, this is internal space element. The internal and external space,
  is the space element. This is not me. I&#146;m not in it. It&#146;s not self. This should
  be seen with right wisdom, as it really is and the mind should be nipped and detached from
  the space element. </p>
  <p>Then there remains consciousness purified and clean, by which something is known, as
  pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant. Bhikkhu, on account of a pleasant
  contact, arises pleasant feeling and he knows, I feel pleasant. With the cessation of that
  pleasant contact, the respective pleasant feeling too ceases and he knows that it has
  appeased. Bhikkhu, on account of an unpleasant contact, arises unpleasant feeling and he
  knows, I feel unpleasant. With the cessation of that unpleasant contact, the respective
  unpleasant feeling too ceases and he knows that it has appeased. Bhikkhu, on account of a
  neither unpleasant nor pleasant contact, arises neither unpleasant nor.pleasant feeling,
  and he knows, I feel neither unpleasant nor pleasant. With the cessation of that neither
  unpleasant nor pleasant contact, the respective neither unpleasant nor pleasant feeling
  too ceases and he knows that it has appeased </p>
  <p>Bhikkhu, with the contact of two logs of wood there arise heat and fire and when they
  are put apart, the respective heat and the fire ceases and appeases. In the same manner on
  account of a pleasant contact, arises pleasant feeling and he knows, I feel pleasant. With
  the cessation of that pleasant contact, the respective pleasant feeling too ceases and he
  knows that it has appeased. On account of an unpleasant contact, arises unpleasant feeling
  and he knows, I feel unpleasant. With the cessation of that unpleasant contact, the
  respective unpleasant feeling too ceases and he knows that it has appeased. On account of
  a neither unpleasant nor pleasant contact, arises a neither unpleasant nor pleasant
  feeling, and he knows, I feel neither unpleasant nor pleasant. With the cessation of that
  neither unpleasant nor pleasant contact, the respective neither unpleasant nor pleasant
  feeling too ceases and he knows that it has appeased </p>
  <p>Then purified equanimity only remains, tender, workable and bright. A clever goldsmith
  or his apprentice building a furnace would light it. Taking the pair of spincers, would
  place the gold in the lighted furnace and from time to time he would heat it, sprinkle
  water on it and look at it. Then that gold becomes purified, with the impurities turned
  out. Then the gold becomes tender, workable and bright, and suitable to make any ornament
  such as anklets, earrings or a gold chain. In the same manner only purified equanimity
  remains tender, workable and bright. Then he knows, this equanimity that is purified and
  bright I will direct to the sphere of space. He develops the mind and the suitable
  thoughts, and knows my equanimity will be settled in it for a long time. This equanimity
  that is purified and bright I will direct to the sphere of consciousness. He develops the
  mind and the suitable thoughts and knows, my equanimity will be settled in it for a long.
  time. This equanimity that is purified and bright I will direct to the sphere of
  nothingness. He develops the mind and the suitable ideas, and knows my equanimity will be
  settled in it for a long time. This equanimity that is purified and bright I will direct
  to the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception. He develops the mind and the
  suitable thoughts and knows, my equanimity will be settled in it for a long time. Then he
  knows this equanimity that is purified and bright I directed to the sphere of space
  developing the mind and the suitable thoughts is compounded. This equanimity that is
  purified and bright I directed to the sphere of consciousness, developing the mind and the
  suitable thoughts is compounded. This equanimity that is purified and bright I directed to
  the sphere of nothingness developing the mind and the suitable thoughts is compounded.
  This equanimity that is purified and bright I directed to the sphere of neither perception
  nor non-perception developing the mind and the suitable thoughts, is compounded So he does
  not intend or think &#145;to be&#146; or &#145;not to be&#146; and does not seize anything
  and does not worry about it and is extinguished. He knows, birth is destroyed, the holy
  life is lived, what should be done is done, there is nothing more to wish. Feeling
  pleasant feelings knows, it is impermanent, is not bent to it and knows that he does not
  delight in it. Feeling unpleasant feelings knows, it is impermanent, is not bent to it and
  knows that he does not delight in it. Feeling neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings
  knows, it is impermanent, is not bent to it and knows that he does not delight in it.
  Feeling pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings feels them
  unyoked. Experiencing feelings that end the body he knows, I experience feelings that end
  the body. Experiencing feelings that end life he knows, I experience feelings that end
  life. He knows, at the break up of the body, before the end of life that all feelings and
  enjoyments will be cooled. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhu, on account of oil and a shred, the oily flame burns, when the oil and shred
  ends and no more fuel is fed, it extinguishes. In the same manner experiencing feelings
  that end the body he knows, I experience feelings that end the body. Experiencing feelings
  that end life he knows, I experience feelings that end life. He knows, at the break up of
  the body, before the end of life that all feelings and enjoyments will be cooled. The
  bhikkhu endowed thus has made the highest wise resolution. This is the highest noble
  wisdom, that is knowledge for the destruction of all unpleasantness. The release,
  established in truth is immovable. Bhikkhu, thoughts that deviate from the truth are not
  the truth. (*2) Thoughts that do not deviate from the truth, are the truth, it&#146;s
  extinction. (*3) Therefore the bhikkhu endowed thus, has made the highest resolution in
  truth. This is the highest noble truth. They are thoughts on the truth, extinction. Owing
  to ignorance, earlier he may have made resolutions. Now they are dispelled, uprooted, made
  palm stumps not to arise again. </p>
  <p>Therefore the bhikkhu endowed thus has made the highest resolution in giving up. This
  is the highest noble giving up. That is giving up all earlier resolutions. Owing to
  ignorance, earlier he may have had covetousness and greedy interest. Now they are
  dispelled, uprooted, made palm stumps not to arise again. Owing to ignorance, earlier he
  may have had the evil aversion and anger. Now they are dispelled, uprooted, made palm
  stumps not to arise again. Owing to ignorance, earlier he may have had the evil ignorance
  and delusion. Now they are dispelled, uprooted, made palm stumps not to arise again.
  Therefore the bhikkhu endowed thus has made the highest resolution in appeasement. The
  highest and most noble appeasement is the appeasement of greed, hate and delusion. </p>
  <p>If it was said, do not be negligent to be wise, protect the truth and develop giving up
  and train for appeasement, it was said on account of this. </p>
  <p>Established anywhere should not imagine, when not imagining it is said the sage is
  appeased. Why was it said? Bhikkhu, &#145;I be&#146; is imagining, here I am, is
  imagining, I will be, is imagining, I will not be, is imagining, I will be material, is
  imagining, I will be immaterial, is imagining, I will be perceptive or non-perceptive, are
  imaginings. I will be neither perceptive nor non-perceptive, is imagining. Bhikkhu,
  imagining is an ailment, a blister, an arrow. When all imaginings end, it is said the sage
  is appeased. Bhikkhu, the appeased sage is not born, does not decay, does not change, does
  not desire. Bhikkhu, one who has nothing to be born has nothing to decay. When there is no
  decay there&#146;s no death. When there is no death, there is no change. When there is no
  change there are no desires. If it was said, established anywhere should not imagine, when
  not imagining it is said the sage is appeased, it was said on account of this. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhu, remember this as my short classification of the six elements. </p>
  <p>Then venerable Pukkusaati knowing I have met the Teacher, the well gone one, the
  rightfully enlightened one, got up from his seat, arranging the robe on one shoulder, put
  his head at the feet of the Blessed and said thus. &#146;Venerable sir pardon me owing to
  foolishness, delusion and demerit I have addressed the Blessed One as friend, pardon me,
  it will be for future restraint.&#146; </p>
  <p>Bhikkhu, owing to foolishness, delusion and demerit, you have transgressed, addressing
  me as friend, I would not reckon it. As you ask for pardon seeing your mistake, I pardon
  you, it is increase in the Teaching to see one&#146;s mistake and ask for pardon, for
  future restraint.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, may I gain the higher ordination in your presence.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhu, are your bowl and robes complete?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir my bowl and robes are incomplete.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhu, the Thus Gone One does not confer the higher ordination, when bowl and
  robes are incomplete.&#146; </p>
  <p>Then venerable Pukkusaati delighted in the words of the Blessed One got up from his
  seat, worshipped the Blessed One and turning his right side towards him, went round the
  Blessed One and went away in search of bowl and robes. When he was going in search of bowl
  and robes, a rough cow killed him. </p>
  <p>Then many bhikkhus approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said.
  &#145;Venerable sir, the clansman Pukkusaati who was advised in short by the Blessed One
  has died. Where is he born after death?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhus, the clansman Pukkusaati is wise, he realized the Teaching, I did not
  explain much. The clansman Pukkusaati destroyed the five lower bonds binding to the
  sensual world and is born spontaneously, not to proceed from that world. </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One.
  </p>
  <p><b>Notes.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Knows the worlds.<i>&#146;lokaviduu.</i>&#146; The world to anyone is the data that
    come through the six doors of mental contact. The Blessed One knows this and knows that
    each ones data is different from another&#146;s and so he is known as one who knows the
    worlds. </p>
    <p>2. Thoughts that deviate from the truth are not the truth. <i>&#145;ta.m hi, bhikkhu,
    musaa ya.m mosadhamma.m&#146;</i> The truth is unpleasantness. That is all data from the
    six doors of mental contact such as sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches and ideas are
    impermanent, therefore unpleasant and so without an abiding self. If someone thinks that
    this data is permanent, pleasant and mine, he is deviating from the truth. The highest
    resolution in truth is not to deviate from this truth. </p>
    <p>3. Thoughts that do not deviate from the truth are the truth. It is extinction. <i>&#145;ta.m
    sacca.m ya.m amosadhamma.m nibbaana.m</i>&#146;This is to come to the view that all data
    from the six doors of mental contact in the form of sights, sounds, smells, tastes,
    touches and ideas are impermanent, therefore they are unpleasant and so there is no
    abiding self. This is the truth and it is extinction. <br>
