  <p>I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the squirrels&#146; sanctuary in the bamboo grove
  in Raajagaha. Venerable Bhuumija put on robes in the morning, taking bowl and robes
  approached the home of prince Jayasena and sat on the prepared seat. Then prince Jayasena
  approached venerable Bhuunija, exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side and said.
  &#145;Good Bhuumija, there are recluses and brahmins who hold this view and declare it.
  Leading the holy life with attachment, it is not possible to attain some distinction
  Leading the holy life without attachment, it is not possible to attain some distinction
  Leading the holy life with attachment and without attachment, it is not possible to attain
  some distinction Leading the holy life neither with nor without attachment it is not
  possible to attain some distinction. What is good Bhuumija&#146;s teacher&#146;s view
  about this?&#146; </p>
  <p>Prince, not that I have heard it from the Blessed One or this was acknowledged by him.
  Yet there is a posssibility that the Blessed One would say itWithout right and true
  insight, leading the holy life with attachment, it is not possible to attain some
  distinction (*1) Without right and true insight leading the holy life without attachment,
  it is not possible to attain some distinction Without right and true insight leading the
  holy life with attachment and without attachment, it is not possible to attain some
  distinctionWithout right and true insight, leading the holy life neither with nor without
  attachment it is not possible to attain some distinction.With right and true insight,
  leading the holy life with attachment, it is possible to attain some distinctionWith right
  and true insight leading the holy life without attachment, it is possible to attain some
  distinction With right and true insight leading the holy life with attachment and without
  attachment, it is possible to attain some distinctionWith right and true insight, leading
  the holy life neither with nor without attachment it is possible to attain some
  distinction. </p>
  <p>&#145;If good Bhuumija&#146;s teacher holds this view and professes it, indeed his
  teacher presses on the tops of all recluses and brahmins, I think. Then prince Jayasena
  served venerable Bhuumija with his own share of milk rice. </p>
  <p>After the alms round and when the meal was over, venerable Bhuumija approached the
  Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said thus. &#145;Venerable sir, I put on robes
  in the morning, taking bowl and robes approached the home of prince Jayasena and sat on
  the prepared seat. Then prince Jayasena approached me exchanged friendly greetings, sat on
  a side and said. &#145;Good Bhuumija, there are recluses and brahmins who hold this view

  prince Jayasena said, if good Bhuumija&#146;s teacher holds this view and professes it,
  indeed his teacher presses on the tops of all recluses and brahmins, I think &#145;.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>&#145;Venerable sir, when asked thus and when this reply was given, how far was I
  saying the words of the Blessed One, was I talking according to the Teaching and not
  blaming the Blessed One?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;There, Bhuumija, when asked thus and when this reply was given, you said the
  words of the Blessed One, talking according to the Teaching and not blaming the Blessed
  One in any way.&#146; </p>

  <p><b>Notes.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1.Without right and true insight, leading the holy life with attachment, it is not
    possible to attain some distinction. <em>&#145;Aasa~n ce pi karitvaa ayoniso
    brahmacariya.m carati, abhabbo phalassa adhigamaaya.&#146;</em> The complete sutta tells
    us that leading the holy life should be with right and true insight. ie The one leading
    the holy life should know for what purpose he is doing so. He should correctly understand
    the acutely unsatisfactory nature of life, and so make an effort to achieve a distincton
    above human. So then he should arouse effort to attain that distinction not yet attained. </p>
