  <b>(25) .The Simile of the Deer Feeder</b> </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus: </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika in
  Jeta&#146;s grove in Saavatthi. From there the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus:
  &quot;Bhikkhus, the deer feeder does not feed the wild animals thinking may the wild
  animals eat this food, be beautiful, live long and may they feed on this food for a long
  time.Yet the deer feeder feeds the wild animals thinking may the wild animals encroaching
  for food be intoxicated, eat this food be swooned and be negligent and be subjected to the
  wicked actions in this encroachment. </p>
  <p>The first set of wild animals, encroached the deer feeder&#146;s encroachment, ate the
  fodder swooned, became intoxicated and negligent, and became subjects to the wishes of the
  deer feeder, in that same encroachment. Thus the first set of wild animals were not
  released from the power of the deer feeder. </p>
  <p>The second set of wild animals together thought thus; The first set of wild animals,
  encroached the deer feeder&#146;s encroachment, ate the fodder swooned, became intoxicated
  and negligent, and became subjects to the wishes of the deer feeder, in that same
  encroachment. Thus the first set of wild animals were not released from the powers of the
  deer feeder .What if we abstained from all fearful fodder, entered a forest dwelling. So
  they abstained from all fearful fodder, entered a forest dwelling and abode. In the last
  month of the Summer when grass and water decreased, their bodies emaciated much, power and
  effort decreased , Then they went back to the deer feeder ate the fodder swooned, became
  intoxicated and negligent and became subjects to the wishes of the deer feeder, in that
  same encroachment. Thus the second set of wild animals were not released from the power of
  the deer feeder. </p>
  <p>The third set of wild animals together thought thus: The first set of wild animals,
  encroached the deer feeder&#146;s encroachment, ate the fodder swooned, became intoxicated
  and negligent, and became subjects to the wishes of the deer feeder, in that same
  encroachment. Thus the first set of wild animals were not released from the power of the
  deer feeder. </p>
  <p>The second set of wild animals together thought thus; The first set of wild animals,
  encroached the deer feeder&#146;s encroachment, ate the fodder swooned, became intoxicated
  and negligent, and became subjects to the wishes of the deer feeder, in that same
  encroachment. Thus the first set of wild animals were not released from the powers of the
  deer feeder. What if we abstained from all fearful fodder, entered a forest dwelling. So
  they abstained from all fearful fodder, entered a forest dwelling and abode. In the last
  month of the Summer when grass and water decreased, their bodies emaciated much, power and
  effort decreased , Then they went back to the deer feeder, ate the fodder swooned, became
  intoxicated and negligent and became subjects to the wishes of the deer feeder, in that
  same encroachment. Thus the second set of wild animals too were not released from the
  power of the deer feeder. </p>
  <p>Why shouldn&#146;t we make a settlement in the encroachment of the deer feeder and eat
  the fodder not swooned, not intoxicated, not negligent and not become subjects to the
  wishes of the deer feeder, in that same encroachment. So they made a setlement in the
  encroachment of the deer feeder and ate the fodder not swooned, not intoxicated and not
  negligent and did not become subjects to the wishes of the deer feeder in that same
  encroachment. </p>
  <p>Then it occured to the deer feeder and his followers: This third set of wild animals
  are crafty, trained deceivers are proficient devils, we do not know their comings and
  goings. What if we surround the enclosure on all sides with sticks. Indeed we will see the
  settlement of the third set of wild animals and get at them. Then they surrounded the
  enclosure on all sides with sticks and the deer feeder and his followers saw the
  settlement of the wild animals and got at them. Thus the third set of wild animals too
  were not released from the power of the deer feeder. </p>
  <p>The fourth set of wild animals together thought thus:<b> </b>The first set of wild
  animals, encroached the deer feeder&#146;s encroachment, ate the fodder swooned, became
  intoxicated and negligent, and became subjects to the wishes of the deer feeder, in that
  same encroachment. Thus the first set of wild animals were not released from the power of
  the deer feeder. The second set of wild animals together thought thus; The first set of
  wild animals, encroached the deer feeder&#146;s encroachment, ate the fodder swooned,
  became intoxicated and negligent, and became subjects to the wishes of the deer feeder, in
  that same encroachment. Thus the first set of wild animals were not released from the
  power of the deer feeder .What if we abstained from all fearful fodder, entered a forest
  dwelling. So they abstained from all fearful fodder, entered a forest dwelling and abode.
  In the last month of the Summer when grass and water decreased, their bodies emaciated
  much, power and effort decreased , Then they went back to the deer feeder, ate the fodder
  swooned, became intoxicated and negligent and became subjects to the wishes of the deer
  feeder, in that same encroachment. Thus the second set of wild animals too were not
  released from the power of the deer feeder .The third set of wild animals thought Why
  shouldn&#146;t we make a settlement in the encroachment of the deer feeder and eat the
  fodder not swooned, not intoxicated, not negligent and not become subjects to the wishes
  of the deer feeder, in that same encroachment. So they made a setlement in the
  encroachment of the deer feeder and ate the fodder not swooned, not intoxicated and not
  negligent and did not become subjects to the wishes of the deer feeder in that same
  encroachment. Then it occurred to the deer feeder and his followers: This third set of
  wild animals are crafty, trained deceivers are proficient devils, we do not know their
  comings and goings. What if we surround the enclosure on all sides with sticks. Indeed we
  will see the settlement of the third set of wild animals and get at them. Then they
  surrounded the enclosure on all sides with sticks and the deer feeder and his followers
  saw the settlement of the wild animals and got at them. Thus the third set of wild animals
  too were not released from the power of the deer feeder. </p>
  <p>Then it occurred to the fourth set of wild animals, what if we make our settlement in
  the encroachment so that the deer feeder and his followers do not know our comings and
  goings * and eat the fodder not swooned, not intoxicated, not negligent and not become
  subjects to the wishes of the deer feeder in that same encroachment. So they made their
  settlement in the encroachment, so that the deer feeder and his followers do not know
  their comings and goings and eating the fodder not swooned, not intoxicated and not
  negligent and not becoming subjects to the wishes of the deer feeder in the encroachment. </p>
  <p>Then it occurred to the deer feeder and his followers, this fourth set of wild animals
  are crafty and trained deceivers are proficient devils, we do not know their comings and
  goings. What if we surround the enclosure on all sides with sticks. Indeed we will see the
  settlement of the fourth set of wild animals and get at them. Then they surrounded the
  enclosure on all sides with sticks and the deer feeder and followers did not see the
  settlement of the wild animals and did not get at them. Then it occurred to the deer
  feeder and his followers: If we hurt the fourth set of wild animals, others will be hurt,
  and that will hurt others. What if we take care of the fourth set of wild animals. So the
  deer feeder and his followers took care of the fourth set of wild animals. Thus the fourth
  set of wild animals were released from the power of the deer feeder.. </p>
  <p>This is a comparison to explain the meaning, this is its meaning. Fodder is a synonym
  for the five strands of sensual pleasures. The deer feeder is a synonym for Maara the evil
  one. The Followers of the deer feeder is a synonym for Maara&#146;s following. Wild
  animals is a synonym for recluses and brahmins. </p>
  <p>The first set of recluses and brahmins encroaching partook of the worldly matter of
  Maara, swooned and became intoxicated and negligent came under the power of Maara and
  worldly matter. like the first set of wild animals, I say this first set of recluses and
  brahmins are comparable to them. </p>
  <p>The second set of recluses and brahmins together thought thus: The first set of
  recluses and brahmins encroaching partook of the worldly matter of Maara, swooned and
  became intoxicated and negligent came under the power of Maara and worldly matter, this
  first set of recluses and brahmins were not released from the power of Maara. What if we
  abstained from all fearful worldly matter and abode in a forest dwelling. They abstained
  from all fearful worldly matter and abode in a forest dwelling. There they ate vegetables,
  millets, raw rice, Dadulla rice, water plants, husked rice powder, rice foam, sesame
  flour, grass, cowdung, roots and fruits and picked fruits. In the last month of Summer
  when grass and water dried, their bodies emaciated and power and effort decreasing they
  returned to partake of the worldly matter of Maara. They partaking food swooned became
  intoxicated and negligent and came under the power of Maara and worldly matter.. Thus the
  second set of recluses and brahmins were not released from the power of Maara like the
  second set of wild animals, I say, this second set of recluses and brahmins. are
  comparable to them. </p>
  <p>The third set of recluses of brahmins together thought thus: The first set of recluses
  and brahmins encroaching partook of the worldly matter of Maara, swooned and became
  intoxicated and negligent were under the power of Maara and worldly matter, this first set
  of recluses and brahmins were not released from the power of Maara. What if we abstained
  from all fearful worldly matter and abode in a forest dwelling. They abstained from all
  fearful worldly matter and abode in a forest dwelling. There they ate vegetables, millets,
  raw rice, Dadulla rice, water plants, husked rice powder, rice foam, sesame flour, grass,
  cowdung, roots and fruits and picked fruits. In the last month of Summer when grass and
  water dried, their bodies emaciated and power and effort decreasing returned to partake of
  the worldly matter of Maara. They partaking food swooned became intoxicated and negligent
  and came under the power of Maara and worldly matter.. Thus the second set of recluses and
  brahmins were not released from the power of Maara </p>
  <p>Then it occured to them what if we make our settlement in Maara&#146;s worldly matter,
  and partake of that worldly matter not swooned, and not intoxicated and not negligent and
  be not subjects of Maara and his worldly matter. They made their settlement in
  Maara&#146;s worldly matter, partook of the worldly matter not swooned and not intoxicated
  and not becoming negligent did not become the subjects of Maara and worldly matter. Yet
  they had such views such as: Is the world eternal or not eternal. Is it limited or not
  limited. Is the soul the body, or is the soul one and the body something different. Is the
  Thus Gone One after death, or isn&#146;t the Thus Gone One after death. Is it the Thus
  Gone One is and is not after death. Is it the Thus Gone One, neither is nor is not after
  death. Thus bhikkhus, this third set of bhikkhus were not released from the power of
  Maara. like the third set of wild animals I say, this third set of recluses and brahmins,
  are comparable to them. </p>
  <p>The fourth set of recluses of brahmins together thought thus: The first set of recluses
  and brahmins encroaching partook of the worldly matter of Maara, swooned and became
  intoxicated and negligent came under the power of Maara and worldly matter, this first set
  of recluses and brahmins were not released from the power of Maara. What if we abstained
  from all fearful worldly matter and abode in a forest dwelling. They abstained from all
  fearful worldly matter and abode in a forest dwelling. There they ate vegetables, millets,
  raw rice, Dadulla rice, water plants, husked rice powder, rice foam, sesame flour, grass,
  cowdung, roots and fruits and picked fruits. In the last month of Summer when grass and
  water dried, their bodies emaciated and power and effort decreasing returned to partake of
  the worldly matter of Maara. There they partaking food swooned became intoxicated and
  negligent and came under the power of Maara and worldly matter.. Thus the second set of
  recluses and brahmins were not released from the power of Maara </p>
  <p>Then it occured to them what if we make our settlement in Maara&#146;s worldly matter,
  and partake of that worldly matter not swooned, and not intoxicated and not negligent and
  be not subjects of Maara and his worldly matter. They made their settlement in the
  encroachment of Maara&#146;s worldly matter, partook of the worldly matter not swooned and
  not intoxicated and not becoming negligent did not become the subjects of Maara and
  worldly matter. Yet they had such views such as: Is the world eternal or not eternal. Is
  it limited or not limited. Is the soul, the body, or is the soul one and the body
  something different. Is the Thus Gone One after death, or isn&#146;t the Thus Gone One
  after death. Is it the Thus Gone One is and is not after death. Is it the Thus Gone One
  neither is, nor is not after death. Thus bhikkhus, this third set of bhikkhus were not
  released from the power of Maara. What if we make our settlement not accessible to death
  and his followers, in this same encroachment of death and this worldly matter, and partake
  this worldly matter not swooned, not intoxicated and not becoming negligent, we would not
  become the subjects of Maara in this same encroachment. They made their settlement not
  accessible to death and his followers, and settling in that same encroachment of death and
  this worldly matter partook of this worldly matter not swooned, not intoxicated and not
  becoming negligent, did not become the subjects of Maara in this same encroachment.
  Bhikkhus, in this manner the fourth set of recluses and brahmins were released from the
  power of Maara, like. the fourth set of wild animals, I say, this fourth set of recluses
  and brahmins are comparable to them.. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, what is inaccessible to Maara and the followings of Maara. Here, bhikkhus,
  the bhikkhu secluded from sensual thoughts and demeritorious thoughts with thoughts and
  thought processes and with joy and pleasaantness born of seclusion, attained to abides in
  the first jhaana. To this is said, that death is blindfolded, having destroyed the
  feetless one has gone beyond the sight of death, the evil one. Again, the bhikkhu
  overcoming thoughts and thought processes, the mind internally appeased and brought to one
  point, without thoughts and discursive thoughts, with joy and pleasantness born of
  concentration attained to abides in the second jhaana. To this is said, that death is
  blindfolded, having destroyed the feetless one has gone beyond the sight of death the evil
  one. Again, the bhikkhu with joy and with equanimity to detachment abides mindful and
  aware, experiences pleasantness too with the body, to this the noble ones say: mindfully
  abiding in pleasantness with equanimity. To this is said, that death is blindfolded,
  having destroyed the feetless one, has gone beyond the sight of death, the evil one.
  Again, the bhikkhu, giving up pleasantness, and unpleasantness, and earlier overcoming
  pleasure and displeasure, without unpleasantness and pleasantness and mindfulness purified
  with equanimity attained to abides in the fourth jhaana. To this is said, that death is
  blindfolded, having destroyed the feetless one has gone beyond the sight of death the evil
  one. Again the bhikkhu overcoming all perceptions of matter and overcoming perceptions of
  anger, not attending to various perceptions, with space is boundless attains to abides in
  the sphere of space. To this is said, that death is blindfolded, having destroyed the
  feetless one, has gone beyond the sight of death, the evil one. Again, the bhikkhu
  overcoming all perceptions of space with consciousness is boundless attains to abides in
  the sphere of consciousness. To this is said, that death is blindfolded, having destroyed
  the feetless one, has gone beyond the sight of death, the evil one. Again, the bhikkhu
  overcoming all the sphere of consciousness, with there is nothing attains to abides in the
  sphere of no-thingness. To this is said, that death is blindfolded, having destroyed the
  feetless one, has gone beyond the sight of death, the evil one. Again, the bhikkhu,
  overcoming all the sphere of no-thingness, attains to abides in the sphere of
  neither-perception-nor-non-perception. To this is said, that death is blindfolded, having
  destroyed the feetless one, has gone beyond the sight of death, the evil one. Again, the
  bhikkhu overcoming all the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, attains to the
  cessation of perceptions and feelings and abides. Seeing it with wisdom too, desires get
  destroyed. To this is said, that death is blindfolded, having destroyed the feetless one,
  has gone beyond the sight of death, the evil one. </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said thus, and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed
  One. </p>
