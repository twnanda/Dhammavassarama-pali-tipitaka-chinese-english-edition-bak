  (138)- Point by point Classification.</strong></font></p>
  <p>I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by Anaathapindika in
  Jeta&#146;s grove in Saavatthi. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from there.
  &#145;Bhikkhus I will give the point by point classification, listen attentively.&#146;
  Those bhikkhus agreed and the Blessed One said thus. &#145;Bhikkhus, in whatever manner
  the bhikkhu examines, he finds his external consciousness is not scattered, internally is
  not settled and without a holding is not worried. Bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu&#146;s
  external consciousness is not scattered, internally is not settled and without a holding
  is not worried, there would not be to him future arisings of birth, decay, death and
  unpleasantness.&#146; The Blessed One said thus, got up from his seat and went to his
  dwelling.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Soon after the Blessed One had left, it occurred to those bhikkhus. The Blessed One has
  given this short exposition and without giving the detailed explanation has got up from
  his seat and gone to his dwelling &#145;Bhikkhus, in whatever manner the bhikkhu examines,
  he finds his external consciousness is not scattered, internally is not settled and
  without a holding is not worried. Bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu&#146;s external consciousness
  is not scattered, internally is not settled and without a holding is not worried, there
  would not be to him future arisings of birth, decay, death and unpleasantness.&#146; Who
  could give us the detailed explanation to this short exposition given by the Blessed One? </p>
  <p>It occurred to those bhikkhus, venerable Mahaakaccaana is praised by the Teacher as
  well as by the wise co-associates in the holy life. It is possible for venerable
  Mahaakaccaana to give the detailed exposition for this short exposition given by the
  Blessed One. What if we approached venerable Mahaakaccaana and asked this. Then those
  bhikkhus approached venerable Mahaakaccaana, exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side
  and said. &#145;Friend, Kaccaana, the Blessed One gave this short exposition and without
  giving the detailed exposition got up from the seat and went to his
  dwelling.-&#146;Bhikkhus, in whatever manner the bhikkhu examines, he finds his external
  consciousness is not scattered, internally is not settled and without a holding is not
  worried. Bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu&#146;s external consciousness is not scattered,
  internally is not settled and without a holding is not worried, there would not be to him
  future arisings of birth, decay, death and unpleasantness.&#146; Now who could give us the
  detailed exposition of this short exposition?&#146; </p>
  <p>It occurred to us venerable Mahaakaccaana is praised by the Teacher as well as the wise
  co-associates of the holy life. It is possible for venerable Mahaakaccaana to give the
  detailed exposition for this short exposition given by the Blessed One. What if we
  approached venerable Mahaakaccaana and asked this. So those bhikkhus approached venerable
  Mahaakaccaana and said &#145;Friend Kaccaana, explain this to us.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Friends, it is like a man in need of heartwood, going in search of it, come to a
  standing huge tree full of heartwood, ignoring the heartwood, roots and trunk was to think
  that the branches and leaves was the heartwood. In the same manner, the venerable ones
  come face to face with the Teacher have ignored him and should ask it from me. That
  Blessed One knows, sees, has become wise, has become the Teaching and has become Brahmaa.
  He preaches and practises, is the bringer of meanings, the giver of deathlessness, the
  lord of the Teachingand thus gone. Now is the right time to ask this from him and as he
  explains it, we will bear it in our minds&#146;. </p>
  <p>&#145;Friend Kaccaana, indeed,that Blessed One knows, sees, has become wise, has become
  the Teaching and has become Brahmaa. He preaches and practises it, is the bringer of
  meanings, the giver of deathlessness, the lord of the Teachingand thus gone. Now is the
  right time to ask this from him and as he explains it, we will bear it in our minds Yet,
  venerable Mahaakaccaana is praised by the Teacher as well as the wise co-associates of the
  holy life. It is possible for venerable Mahaakaccaana to give the detailed exposition for
  this short exposition given by the Blessed One. Friend Kaccaana, explain this to us, if it
  is not troublesome to you&#146;. </p>
  <p>&#145;Then friends, listen and attend carefully.&#146; Those bhkkhus agreed and
  venerable Mahaakaccaana said thus &#145;The Blessed One has given this short exposition
  and without giving the detailed explanation has got up from his seat and gone to his
  dwelling &#145;Bhikkhus, in whatever manner the bhikkhu examines, he finds his external
  consciousness is not scattered, internally is not settled and without a holding he is not
  worried. Bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu&#146;s external consciousness is not scattered,
  internally is not settled and without a holding is not worried, there would not be to him
  future arisings of birth, decay, death and unpleasantness&#146; Of this short exposition,
  I understand the detailed explanation thus.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Friends, how is external consciousness scattered and spread out? Friends, the bhikkhu
  seeing a form has eye consciousness which follows that form enslaved, boundfettered and in
  search of pleasure. To this is called external consciousness is scattered and spread out.
  Hearing a sound,...re.... Smelling a scent,...re....Tasting ...re.... Experiencing a
  touch,...re..... Cognizing an idea has mind consciousness which follows that idea
  enslaved, bound and fettered in search of pleasure. To this is called external
  consciousness is scattered and spread out.. :. </p>
  <p>Friends, how is external consciousness not scattered and not spread out? Friends, the
  bhikkhu seeing a form has eye consciousness which does not follow that form enslaved,
  bound and fettered in search of pleasure. To this is called external consciousness is not
  scattered and not spread out. Hearing a sound,...re.... Smelling a scent,...re....Tasting
  ...re.... Experiencing a touch,...re..... Cognizing an idea has mind consciousness which
  does not follow that idea enslaved, bound and fettered in search of pleasure. To this is
  called external consciousness is not scattered and not spread out.. :. </p>
  <p>Friends, how is the mind internally settled? Friends, the bhikkhu secluded from sensual
  desires and demerit, with thoughts and thought processes and with joy and pleasantness
  born of seclusion attains to the first jhaana. To him there is consciousness which is
  enslaved, bound, fettered and in search of pleasure following after joy and pleasantness
  born of seclusion. To this is called the mind is internally settled. Again the bhikkhu
  overcoming thoughts and thought processes, internally the mind settled and in one point,
  with joy and pleasantness born of concentration attains to the second jhaana. To him there
  is consciousness which is enslaved, bound, fettered and in search of pleasure following
  after joy and pleasantness born of concentration.To this is called the mind is internally
  settled. Again the bhikkhu with equanimity to joy and detachment abides mindful and aware
  and with the body experiencing pleasantness too, attains to the third jhaana. To this the
  noble ones say abiding in pleasantness with equanimity. To him there is consciousness
  which is enslaved, bound, fettered and in search of pleasure following after equanimity.
  To this is called the mind is internally settled. Again, friends the bhikkhu dispelling
  pleasantness and unpleasaantness and earlier having overcome pleasure and displeasure,
  with equanimty mindfulness purified attains to the fourth jhaana.To him there is
  consciousness which is enslaved, bound, fettered and in search of pleasure following after
  neither unpleasantness nor pleasantness. To this is called the mind is internally settled.

  <p>Friends, how is there worry for non holding? Friends, the not learned ordinary man who
  has not seen noble ones or Great Beings, not clever in their Teachings and not trained in
  their Teachings sees matter in self, or a material self, or in self matter, or in matter
  selfThat matter changes, takes some other form. Consciousness arises to him about the
  changed nature of matter and he worries about the changed nature of matter. The worry
  takes hold of the mind in which the Teaching had arisen, terrifying and annoying it and he
  worries without a hold. Sees feelings in self, or a feeling self, or in self feelings, or
  in feelings self,....re..... Sees perceptions in self, or a perceiving self, or in self
  perceptions, or in perceptions self,....re... Sees determinations in self, or a
  determining self, or in self determinations, or in determinations selfSees consciousness
  in self, or a conscious self, or in self consciousness, or in consciousess self . This
  consciousness changes, take some other form. Consciousness arises to him about the changed
  nature of consciousess and he worries about the changed nature of consciousness. The worry
  takes hold of the mind in which the Teaching had arisen, terrifying and annoying it and he
  worries without a hold. Friends, this is worrying for non holding..&nbsp; </p>

  <p>Friends, of this short exposition gven by the Blessed One thus:. </p>
  <p>&#145;Bhikkhus, in whatever manner the bhikkhu examines....re..... there would not be
  to him future arisings of birth, decay, death and unpleasantness&#146; </p>
  <p>I know the detailed explanation thus. If you wish approach the Blessed One and ask him
  about it. As he explains it, we will bear it in our minds.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Those bhikkhus delighted with the words of venerable Mahaakaccaana and appreciating
  them got up from their seats, approached the Blessed One worshipped, sat on a side and
  said. &#145;Venerable sir, that exposition, which the Blessed One stated in short and
  without giving the detailed explanaton got up from the seat and went to the dwelling, such
  as &#145;Bhikkhus, in whatever manner the bhikkhu examines....re..... there would not be

  venerable Mahaakaccaana and asked him to explain this to us. He explained it in this
  manner with these words and phrases </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, Mahaakaccaana is wise, if you had asked it from me, I would have explained it
  in this same manner. This is its meaning, bear it as that. </p>
