  <b>(48) The Discourse at Kosambi</b> </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus. </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One was living in Ghosita&#146;s monastery in Kosambi. At that
  time the bhikkhus of Kosambi had aroused a dispute and were quarrelling with each other,
  throwing sharp words at each other They would not discuss the matter among themselves and
  come to an understanding. A certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on
  a side and said, Venerable sir, the bhikkhus of Kosambi have aroused a dispute and are
  quarrelling with each other, throwing sharp words at each other. They would not discuss
  the matter among themselves and come to an understanding. Then the Blessed One addressed a
  certain bhikkhu: Come bhikkhu in my words address those bhikkhus, and tell, the Teacher
  wants you. That bhikkhu agreed, approached those bhikkhus, and said Bhikkhus, the Teacher
  wants you: Those bhikkhus agreed, approached the Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a
  side. Then the Blessed One said to those bhikkhus; Bhikkhus, is it true that you have
  aroused a dispute among yourselves are quarrelling with each other throwing sharp words at
  each other.You wouldn&#146;t discuss the matter among yourselves and come to an
  understanding? Yes, venerable sir.Bhikkhus, at a time when you have aroused a dispute
  among yourselves are quarrelling with each other throwing sharp words at each other, are
  you established in bodily actions of loving kindness, towards co-associates in the holy
  life openly and secretly? Established in verbal actions of loving kindness, towards
  co-associates in the holy life openly and secretly? Establishd in mental actions of loving
  kindness, towards co-associates in the holy life openly and secretly? No, venerable
  sir.Bhikkhus, you have aroused a dispute among yourselves quarrelling with each other,
  throwing sharp words at each other.Now you are not established in bodily actions of loving
  kindness, towards co-associates in the holy life openly or secretly. You are not
  established in verbal actions of loving kindness, towards co-associates in the holy life
  openly or secretly. You are not established in mental actions of loving kindness, towards
  co-associates in the holy life openly or secretly. Foolish men, seeing what good have you
  aroused this dispute? You do not discuss this matter among yourselves and come to an
  understanding. Foolish men, this will be for your undoing for a long time </p>
  <p>Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: Bhikkhus, there are six things which
  conduces to reverence, unity, friendliness and love for each other. What six: Here,
  bhikkhus, the bhikkhu should be establishd in bodily actions of loving kindness towards
  co-associates in the holy life openly and secretly. This is a thing which conduces to
  reverence, unity, friendliness and love for each other. Again, the bhikkhu should be
  established in verbal actions of loving kindness towards co-associates in the holy life
  openly and secretly. This too is a thing which conduces to reverence, unity, friendliness
  and love for each other. Again the bhikkhu should be established in mental actions of
  loving kindness towards co-associates in the holy life openly and secretly. This too is a
  thing that conduces to reverence, unity, friendliness and love for each other. Again
  bhikkhus, gains rightfully obtained, as far as what is put into the bowl, the bhikkhu
  would not partake without sharing equally with the co-associates in the holy life. This
  too is a thing that conduces to reverence, unity, friendliness and love for each other.
  Again the bhikkhu becomes equal in virtues with the co-associates in the holy life openly
  and secretly. The virtues that are not broken, fissured or spotted, are consistent and
  praised by the wise as unaffected and conductive to concentration. This too is a thing
  that conduces to reverence, unity, friendliness and love for each other . Again the
  bhikkhu becomes equal with the co-associates in the holy life in the noble view that leads
  to the beyond.Which rightfully shows the destruction of unpleasantness to one who thinks
  logically. This too is a thing that conduces to reverence, unity, friendliness and love
  for each other. Bhikkhus, these are the six things that conduces to reverence, unity,
  frendliness and love for each other. Bhikkhus, of these six the noble view that leads to
  the beyond and rightfully shows the destruction of unpleasantness to one who thinks
  logically is the foremost and the chief. It binds all others at the top most beam of the
  gabled house. .. </p>
  <p>Bhikkhus, what is that noble view that leads to the beyond and rightfully shows the
  destruction of unpleasantness to one who thinks logically. Here. Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu
  gone to a forest or to the root of a tree, or to an empty house reflects. Are there
  undispelled hindrances in me? Do they obstruct my mind, from knowing and seeing as it
  really is? Am I overcome by sensual lust, or is my mind hindered by them? Am I overcome by
  anger, or is my mind hindered by it? Am I overcome by sloth and torpor, or is my mind
  hindered by sloth and torpor? Am I overcome by restlessness and worry, or is my mind
  hindered by restlessness and worry? Is my mind overcome with doubts, about this world and
  the other world? Or am I with a dispute quarrelling, throwing rough words at others, is my
  mind hindered in this manner? </p>
  <p>The bhikkhu knows, I haven&#146;t undispelled hindrances on account of which my mind
  would not see it, as it really is.These things are thoroughly dispelled from my mind and
  it is ready for realising the truth. This is the first noble knowledge attained, not of
  the world and not shared by the ordinary (*1). </p>
  <p>Again, the noble disciple reflects When I practise and develop this view much, I
  experience internal appeasement, and internal extinction (*2). This is the second noble
  knowledge attained, not of the world and not shared by the ordinary. </p>
  <p>Again the noble disciple reflects. This view I have gained is it also the view of the
  recluses and brahmins of other sects. Then he knows, this view with which I am endowed, is
  not shared by recluses and brahmins of other sects. This is the third noble knowledge
  attained, not of the world and not shared by the ordinary. </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflects. I share this view with those come to
  righteousness of view. I&#146;m also endowed with that unique characteristic. Bhikkhus,
  what is that unique characteristic of one come to righteousness or view? When he does any
  wrong, it becomes manifest to him, and he instantly goes to the Teacher or a wise
  co-associate in the holy life and declares and makes it manifest and makes amends for
  future restrain, like a toddler who is slow to stand and lie would tred on a burning piece
  of charcoal and would instantly pull away from it. In the same manner when he does any
  wrong, it becomes manifest to him, and he instantly goes to the Teacher or a wise
  co-associate in the holy life and declares and makes amends for future restrain. This is a
  unique character of one come to righteousness of view. This is the fourth noble knowledge
  attained, not of the world and not shared by the ordinary. </p>
  <p>Again, bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflects. I share this view, with those come to
  righteousness of view. I&#146;m also endowed with that unique characteristic. Bhikkhus,
  what is that unique characteristic of one come to righteousness of view? It is the unique
  characteristic of one come to righteousness view, to be greatly intent in completing any
  work high or low that has to be done for the co-associates in the holy life. Mindful of
  the high virtues, training, and high wisdom. Like the cow which would even pull out the
  post to which it is tied in an effort to save her calf. In the same manner would be
  greatly intent in completing any work high or low that has to be done for the
  co-associates in the holy life. Mindful of the high virtues, much training and high
  wisdom. Then he knows, I share this view, with those come to righteousness of view.
  I&#146;m endowed with that unigue characteristic. This is the fifth noble knowledge
  attained, not of the world and not shared by the ordinary. </p>
  <p>Again, the noble disciple reflects I share this power, with those come to righteousness
  of view. I&#146;m endowed with that power.What is that power with which the one come to
  righteousness of view is endowed?.One come to righteousness of view listens to the
  Teaching attending carefully to take the essential with the mind well concentrated. Then
  he knows, I&#146;m endowed with the power of one come to righteousness of view. This is
  the sixth noble knowledge attained, not of the world and not shared by the ordinary. </p>
  <p>Again, the noble disciple reflects.I share this power, with those come to righteousness
  of view. I&#146;m endowed, with that power What is that power with which the one come to
  righteousness of view is endowed?. It is the power of one come to righteousness of view to
  listen to the Teaching taught by the Blessed One and gain the meanings, experience the
  Teaching and experience the joy. Then he knows, with whatever power the one, come to
  righteousness of view is endowed, I too share that power. . This is the seventh noble
  knowledge attained, not of the world and not shared by the ordinary. </p>
  <p>When the noble disciple is endowed with these seven characteristics, he is ready to
  realise the fruits of the entry into the stream of the Teaching. </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said thus and those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One.

  <p><strong>Notes </strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. This is the first knowledge attained not of the world and not shared with the
    ordinary&#146;i<i>damassa pa;.thama.m ~naana.m adhigata.m honti ariya.m lokuttara.m
    asaadhaarana.m puthujjanehi</i>&#146;. This knowledge does not belong to the world, as the
    data does not enter through any of the doors of mental contact. So it is not shared by the
    ordinary worldliing.It is some knowledge realised by the noble disciple. </p>
    <p>2. When I practise and develop this view much, I experience internal appeasement and
    internal extinction.<i>&#146;ima.m nukho aha.m di.t.thi aasevanto baavento bahulii karonto
    labhaami paccatta.m samatha.m labhaami paccatta.m nibbuuta.mti</i>&#146; The view of the
