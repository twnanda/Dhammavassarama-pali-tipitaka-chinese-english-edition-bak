  <b>(76) Advice to the Wandering Ascetic Sandaka.</b> </font></p>
  <p>I heard thus. </p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One lived in Gosita&#146;s monastery in Kosambi. At that time
  the wandering ascetic Sandaka lived in a grove of fig trees with a large community of
  wandering ascetics about five hundred of them. Then venerable Ananda, getting up from his
  seclusion in the evening addressed the bhikkhus: &#145;Friends, let us go to the Devakata
  pool to see the caves.&#146; Those bhikkhus agreed and venerable Ananda approached the
  Devakata pool with those bhikkhus. At that time, the wandering ascetic Sandaka was seated
  with a large gathering of wandering ascetics making much noise engaged in various kinds of
  childish talk. Such as talk about kings, robbers, chief ministers, the army, about fears,
  fights, eatables and drinks, dress, beds, flowers and scents, relations,
  conveyances,villages, hamlets, towns and states, women and heros, and gossip at the corner
  of the street and at the well,about those dead and gone, various other talk about the
  origin of the world and the oceanandof things thathappenedand did not happen. The
  wandering ascetic Sandaka saw venerable Ananda coming in the distance and silenced the
  gathering: &#145;Good sirs, make less noise, do not make such a noise. The recluse Ananda,
  a disciple of the recluse Gotama is coming. Of the disciples of recluse Gotama, residing
  in Kosambi this is one. These venerable ones make little noise, are trained to make little
  noise and they train others to make little noise. Thinking this gathering makes little
  noise may have thought to approach.&#146; Then those wandering ascetics became silent
  Venerable Ananda approached the wandering ascetic, Sandaka. The wandering ascetic Sandaka
  said to venerable Ananda: &#145;Good Ananda, come! It is after a long time that good
  Ananda thought of coming. Sit good Ananda, the seat is ready.&#146; Venerable Ananda sat
  on the prepared seat, and the wandering ascetic too sat on a side taking a low seat.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p>Then venerable Ananda, addressed the wandering ascetic Sandaka who was seated on a
  side; &#145;Sandaka, with what talk were you seated at this time, and what was your topic
  of conversation.&#146; &#145;Let that talk be, good Ananda, with what we were sitting now.
  A talk, from good Ananda, we hear rarely. We would like to hear something concerning the
  Teaching of your Teacher.&#146; &#145;If so Sandaka be attentive and listen
  carefully&#146;. The wandering ascetic Sandaka agreed and venerable Ananda
  said.&#145;Sandaka, the Blessed One who knows and sees, is perfect and rightfully
  enlightened has declared four holy lives that should not be lived and four other
  unsatisfactory holy lives that should not be lived. Which the wise man if possible does
  not live, and even if he lives is not convinced that it is merit.&#146; &#145;Good Ananda,
  what are the four holy lives declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees, is perfect
  and rightfully enlightened that should not be lived, which the wise man if possible does
  not live and even if he lives is not convinced that it is merit?&#146;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Sandaka, a certain Teacher upholds this view and declares it: There are no
  results for gifts, sacrifices and offerings. There are no results for good and bad
  actions, there is no this world, no other world, no mother, no father. There are no
  spontaneously arisen beings and no recluses and brahmins, who by themselves realising this
  world and the other world declare it. The man is made of the four primary elements and
  when he dies, earth, goes back to earth, water, to water, fire, to the fire, and air, to
  air. The mental faculties ascend the sky. Five people, carry the corpse in a decked chair,
  as far as the cemetery, the remains are grey bones. The burnt ashes become a gift. Whoever
  says, there is something, talk useless words. The foolish and the wise after death get
  anihilated and destroyed, and there is nothing after death. </p>
  <p>Sandaka a wise man reflects, this good teacher upholds this view and declares. There
  are no results for gifts-re--and there is nothing after death. If the words of these
  teachers are true, I should not do anything. I should not live the holy life. After death
  my teacher and I become equal in our recluseship. I who do not even believe it. We both
  get anihilated and destroyed after death. Unnecessarily these good teachers went naked and
  wore a knot on the head, did austerities yoked to standing and pulling out hairs of the
  head and beard. As for me, I lived surrounded by wife and children, enjoyed wearing
  Kashmire clothes, bearing flowers and scents, and earning gold and silver. I become equal
  with these good teachers after death. Knowing what and seeing what should I lead the holy
  life under these teachers. He knowing this is not a holy life turns away from it. Sandaka,
  this is the first holy life the Blessed One who knows and sees, is perfect and rightfully
  enlightened has declared should not be lived, which the wise man if possible does not
  live, and even if he lives is not convinced that it is merit.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Again, Sandaka a certain teacher upholds this view and declares The doer, and the
  subjected, the destroyer and destroyed, the tormentor and tormented, the griever and giver
  of grief, the frightened and the monster do no demerit. The killer, the taker of the not
  given, the one who cuts limbs, the plunderer, the prison keeper, the one waiting in
  ambush, the one going to others&#146; wives, and the deceiver, do no demerit. If one was
  to roll a wheel with blades fixed to the rim, up to the southern bank of the Ganges,
  killing all beings and making it, a mass of flesh, the destroyer does not accumulate
  demerit, on account of it. If one goes up to the northern bank of the Ganges giving gifts
  and making others to give gifts, making sacrifices and making others to sacrifice, there
  is no merit accumulated on account of it. </p>
  <p>Sandaka a wise man reflects. This good teacher upholds this view and declares. The doer
  and the subjected--- there is no.merit accumulated on account of it. If the words of this
  teacher are true, I should not do, anything. I should not live the holy life. My teacher
  and I become equal in our recluseship. I do not even believe it. We both do not accumulate
  demerit. Unnecessarily these good teachers led a holy life.. As for me, I lived surrounded
  by wife and children, enjoyed wearing Kashmire clothes, bearing flowers and scents, and
  earning gold and silver. After death, I become equal with these good teachers. Knowing
  what and seeing what should I lead the holy life under these teachers. He knowing this is
  not a holy life turns away from it. : Sandaka, this is the second holy life the Blessed
  One who knows and sees, is perfect and rightfully enlightened has declared should not be
  lived, which the wise man if possible does not live, and even if he lives is not convinced
  that it is merit.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Again, Sandaka, a certain teacher upholds this view and declares it. Beings are made
  impure for no cause or reason, and purified for no cause or reason. There is no strength,
  no effort, no manly power, no manly courage, all beings, all living things, all born, are
  led to maturity and are born in the higher six and experience pleasantness and
  unpleasantness </p>
  <p>Here, Sandaka a wise man reflects, this good teacher upholds this view and declares
  that beings are defiled--- experience pleasantness and unpleasantness. If the words of
  these teachers are true, here I should not do, anything. I should not live the holy life.
  My teacher and I we both become equal in our recluseship, I who do not believe it. We both
  will be purified without a reason Unnecessarily these good teachers led a holy life.. As
  for me, I lived surrounded by wife and children, enjoyed wearing Kashmire clothes, bearing
  flowers and scents, and earning gold and silver. After death, I become equal with these
  good teachers. Knowing what and seeing what should I lead the holy life under these
  teachers. He knowing this is not a holy life turns away from it. Sandaka, this is the
  third holy life the Blessed One who knows and sees, is perfect and rightfully enlightened
  has declared should not be lived, which the wise man if possible does not live, and even
  if he lives is not convinced that it is merit.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Again, Sandaka a certain teacher upholds this view and declares it. These seven bodies
  are not made nor created, are barren, immovable and stand like strong pillars. They
  don&#146;t move or change, or harm each other. One is not interested in the others
  pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings. What are the seven? They
  are earth, water, fire, air, pleasantness, unpleasantness, and the soul.Therefore there is
  no harming, or killing, hearing or making to hear, cognizing or making to cognize. If the
  head is cut with a sharp weapon, no life is destroyed. Only the seven bodies are
  dismantled. There are, fourteen hundred thousand important births, sixty thousand six
  hundred and five actions. Five hundred of four actions, three of four actions, one action,
  half an action and sixteen methods. Sixteen internal world cycles. Six high births, eight
  births of a prophet, four thousand nine hundred ascetic births, four thousand nine hundred
  wandering ascetic births, and four thousand nine hundred elephant births. Twenty hundred
  controlling powers, thirty hundred hells, six and thirty royal elements, seven perceptual
  births, seven non-perceptual births, seven niganta births, seven heavenly and seven human
  births, seven ghostly births and seven recollections. Seven higher recollections, seven
  hundred and seven falls, seven hundred and seven dreams. Faring on as fools or as wise,
  for eighty hundred thousand major and minor world cycles should end unpleasantness. It is
  not that by these virtues, observances, austerities, I will mature my imature actions, or
  while feeling I put an end to feelings. There are no measurements for pleasant or
  unpleasant feelings and not seeing an end to existences. There are no highs and lows. It
  is like being thrown into a disordered ball of thread and one has to find one&#146;s way
  to come out of it. Faring on as fools or as wise, for eighty hundred thousand major and
  minor, world cycles one should end unpleasantness. . </p>
  <p>Sandaka a wise man reflects. This good teacher upholds this view and declares it. These
  seven bodies&#151;should end unpleasantness. If the words, of these teachers are true, I
  should not do anything. I should not live the holy life. My teacher and I are equal in our
  recluseship, I who do not even believe it. We both will make an end of unpleasantness
  faring on in existences. Unnecessarily these good teachers led a holy life, going naked,
  wearing a knot on the head. Yoked to standing and pulling out hairs of head and beard.. As
  for me, I lived surrounded by wife and children, enjoyed wearing Kashmire clothes, bearing
  flowers and scents, and earning gold and silver. After death I become equal with these
  good teachers. Knowing what and seeing what should I lead the holy life under these
  teachers. He knowing this is not a holy life turns away from it. : Sandaka, this is the
  fourth holy life the Blessed One who knows and sees, is perfect and rightfully enlightened
  has declared should not be lived, which the wise man if possible does not live, and even
  if he lives is not convinced that it is merit&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Sandaka, these are the four holy lives, the Blessed One who knows and sees, is perfect
  and rightfully enlightened has declared should not be lived, which the wise man if
  possible does not live and even if he lives is not convinced that it is merit.
  &#150;Surprising and wonderful good Ananda, these four holy lives that the Blessed One who
  knows and sees, is perfect and rightfully enlightend has declared as should not be lived,
  which the wise man if possible does not live and even if he lives is not convinced that it
  is merit. Good Ananda what are the four holy lives, the Blessed One who knows and sees, is
  perfect and rightfully enlightened has declared as unsatisfactory and should not be lived,
  which the wise man if possible does not live and even if he lives is not convinced, that
  it is merit.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>&#145;Sandaka, a certain teacher acknowledges all pervading knowledge and vision
  constantly and continually, while, walking, standing, lying or awake. He enters an empty
  house and does not gain morsels.A dog bites him. He encounters an elephant in rut, a rough
  horse or a rough bull. Asks for the name and clan of a man or woman, or the name of a
  village or hamlet and how one should go there. When asked what it is. He would say, I
  entered an empty house, did not gain morsels and a dog bit me. I met, an elephant in rut,
  a rough horse, a rough bull. I had to ask the name and clan of a man, a woman, a village,
  a hamlet and how I should get there. Sandaka, a wise man should reflect. This good teacher
  acknowledges all pervading knowledge and vision, and ---he asks the name and clan of a
  man, a woman. I should know and turn away from that holy life as unsatisfactory. Sandaka,
  this is the first holy life, the Blessed One who knows and sees, is perfect and rightfully
  enlightened has declared as unsatisfactory and should not be lived, which the wise man if
  possible does not live and even if he lives is not convinced, that it is merit.. </p>
  <p>Again, Sandaka, a certain teacher goes by hearsay and takes it as the truth. To a
  teacher who goes by hearsay, the tradition becomes the truth. He may have heard it
  correctly or may not have heard it correctly. It becomes the truth to him, the truth may
  be something else. Sandaka, a wise man should reflect. This teacher goes by hearsay. He
  preaches what has reached him by tradition and hearsay. What he has heard may be the truth
  or not. I, should know and turn away from that holy life as unsatisfactory. Sandaka, this
  is the second holy life, the Blessed One who knows, sees, is perfect and rightfully
  enlightened has declared as unsatisfactory and should not be lived. The wise man if
  possible does not live and even if he lives is not convinced, that it is merit.. </p>
  <p>Again, Sandaka, a certain teacher goes by logic, arguing logically brings out a
  teaching by himself beaten out. In the teaching of a logical teacher, some arguments may
  be true and others may not be true. Sandaka, a wise man should reflect. This teacher goes
  by logic. He preaches what he has beaten out by logical conclusion. His arguments may be
  authentic or not, I should know and turn away from that holy life as unsatisfactory.
  Sandaka, this is the third holy life, the Blessed One who knows and sees, is perfect and
  rightfully enlightened has declared as unsatisfactory and should not be lived. The wise
  man if possible does not live and even if he lives is not convinced, that it is merit.. </p>
  <p>Again Sandaka, a certain teacher is dull and bewildered, when a question is asked, he
  wriggles and sits on the fence. It does not occur to me thus, it does not occur to me
  otherwise, there is no other solution either and none of these are the solutions. Sandaka,
  a wise man should reflect. This teacher is dull and bewildered, when a question is asked
  he wriggles and sits on the fence. I should know and turn away from that holy life as
  unsatisfactory. Sandaka, this is the fourth holy life, the Blessed One who knows and sees,
  is perfect and rightfully enlightened has declared as unsatisfactory and should not be
  lived, which the wise man if possible does not live and even if he lives is not convinced,
  that it is merit. </p>
  <p>.Sandaka, these are the four holy lives the Blessed One who knows and sees, is perfect
  and rightfully enlightened has declared as unsatisfactory and should not be lived.&#146;
  &#145;Surprising and wonderful good Ananda, these four holy lives that the Blessed One who
  knows and sees, is perfect and rightfully enlightend has declared as unsatisfactory, which
  the wise man if possible does not live and even if he lives is not convinced that it is
  merit. Good Ananda what is the holy life, declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees,
  is perfect and rightfully enlightened as satisfactory and convincing in the noble
  Teaching, and is merit?&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Sandaka, the Thus Gone One is born in the world, perfect, rightfully
  enlightened,endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, knower of the worlds, the
  incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed.
  He proclaims to this world of gods and men, together with its Maras, Brahmas, the
  community of recluses, brahmins, gods and men, that Teaching good at the beginning, in the
  middle and in the end, full of meaning even in the letters declaring the complete and pure
  holy life. A householder, or the son of a householder or one born in some clan hears the
  Teaching and gains faith in the Thus Gone One.With that gain of faith reflects, the
  household life is full of difficulties, it is the path for defiling. Going forth is like
  open space. Living in a household it is not easy to lead a holy life complete and pure
  without being defiled. What if I shave, head and beard, put on yellow clothes and go forth
  homeless. At some suitable time he gives up a little wealth or a large mass of wealth,
  either leaving behind a small circle of friends, or a large circle of friends shaving head
  and beard and donning yellow clothes goes forth as a homeless. </p>
  <p>Gone forth he becomes a trainer in the life of a bhikkhu, gives up hurting living
  things, throwing away stick and weapon, ashamed and compassion aroused, abides with
  compassion for all beings. Abstaining from taking what is not given, desires the given,
  the self made pure without thieving he abides. Abstaining from low sexual intercourse he
  leads the holy life. Abstaining from telling lies becomes reliable and trustworthy and
  abides without a dispute with the world. Giving up slander, hearing here does not say it
  elsewhere, to split these. Hearing elsewhere does not say it here to split those. Unites
  the split, promotes unity, fond of unity talks words to unite. Giving up rough words says
  pleasant words pleasing to the ears, and going straight to the heart of the populace at
  large. Abstains from frivolous talk. Says appropriate, truthful, meaningful words in
  accordance with the Teaching and Discipline, those words that could be treasured. </p>
  <p>Abstains from destroying seed groups and vegetable groups. Partaking one meal per day,
  abstains from food at night and at untimely hours. Abstains from dance, singing, music,
  decorations, flowers and scents, ointments and adornments. Abstains from high and stately
  beds. Abstains from accepting gold and silver, uncooked rice and uncooked flesh,. Abstains
  from accepting women and girls, slaves, men or women, Abstains from accepting goats and
  cows, fowl and pigs, elephants, cattle, horses and mares. </p>
  <p>Abstains, from, accepting fields and wealth, doing the work of a messenger, buying and
  selling, and unfair ways of weighing and measuring. Abstains from cutting severing,
  destroying, highway robbery, and wrong ways of obtaining morsels. </p>
  <p>Satisfied, covering the body with robes, and feeding the belly with morsels, goes with
  all the belongings when he goes. Like the birds small and large that go with the weight of
  their wings. Likewise satisfied covering the body with robes and feeding the belly with
  morsels goes with all the belongings when he goes. Endowed with this mass of virtues, he
  experiences the pleasure of blamelessness internally. Seeing a form with the eye, does not
  take the sign or the elements. Abiding with the mental faculty of the eye uncontrolled,
  demerit may seep, through covetousness and displeasure. He abides protecting the mental
  faculty of the eye. Hearing a sound with the ear&#133;re.. Cognizing a smell with the
  nose&#133;re&#133;tasting a taste with the tongue..re.. Cognizing a touch with the
  body..re..Cognizing an idea with the mind, does not take the sign or the element. Abiding
  with the mental faculty of the mind uncontrolled, demerit may seep, through covetousness
  and displeasure. He abides protecting the mental faculty of the mind. Endowed with the
  noble ones&#146; control of the mental faculties, he experiences the untouched pleasure of
  the mental faculties. Coming forward or turning back is aware. Looking on and looking
  aside is aware, bending and stretching is aware, bearing bowl and the three robes is
  aware. Tasting, drinking, eating and enjoying is aware. Going, standing, sitting, lying
  when awake, and keeping silence is aware. Endowed with this mass of virtues, with this
  control of the mental faculties of the noble ones, with the mindfulness of the noble ones
  he abides, in a secluded dwelling. Such as a forest, the root of a tree, a mountain
  grotto, a cave, a charnel ground, a jungle forest, an open space, or a heap of straw.
  Returning from the alms round and after the meal is over, he sits legs crossed, the body
  straight and mindfulness established in front. </p>
  <p>Dispelling, covetousness for the world he abides, cleaning the mind of covetousness.
  .He abides cleaning the mind of anger, compassion aroused forallbornlives. Dispelling
  sloth and torpor he abides, mindful and aware of a perception of light and mindfully
  cleans sloth and torpor. Dispelling restlessness and worry he abides with a mind
  internally appeased, restlessness and worry dispelled. Abides doubts dispelled of merit
  that should be done and should not be done. </p>
  <p>The bhikkhu dispelling the five hindrances and making the minor defilements
  weak,secludes the mind from sensual, angry and hurting thoughts. With thoughts and thought
  processes and with joy and pleasantness, born of seclusion, abides in the first jhana.
  Sandaka, when the noble disciple of the Teacher attains that noble distinction, he has
  wisely lived the holy life and is convinced of it as merit. Again the bhikkhu overcoming
  thoughts and thought processes, appeases the mind internally in a single point. Without
  thoughts and thought processes and with joy and pleasantness born of concentration abides
  in the second jhana. Sandaka, when the noble disciple of the Teacher has attained to that
  noble distinction, he has wisely lived the holy life and even while doing so is convinced
  of it, as merit. Again, the bhikkhu with equanimity to joy and detachment abides mindful
  and aware experiencing pleasantness with the body too, and attains to the third jhaana.
  The noble ones say this is abiding in pleasanatness, mindful of equanimity. Again, the
  bhikkhu dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness and earlier having dispelled pleasure
  and displeasure, and mindfulness purified with equanimity abides in the fourth jhana.
  Sandaka, when the noble disciple of the Teacher has attained to that noble distinction, he
  has wisely lived the holy life and even while doing so is convinced of it as merit. . </p>
  <p>When the mind is concentrated, pure, free from minor defilements, is malleable workable
  not disturbed, he directs the mind for the knowledge of previous births.Recollects the
  manifold previous births, one birth, two births, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty,
  forty, fifty, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, innumerable
  forward cycles of births, innumerable backward cycles of births, innumerable forward and
  backward cycles of births. There I was of such name, clan, disposition, supports,
  experienced such pleasant and unpleasant feelings, in such a life span. Disappearing from
  there was born there with such name, clan, disposition, supports, experienced such
  pleasant and unpleasant feelings, in such a life span. Disappearing from there is born
  here. Thus with all modes and all details manifold previous births are recollected.
  Sandaka, when the noble disciple of the Teacher has attained to that noble distinction, he
  has wisely lived the holy life and even while doing so is convinced of it as merit. </p>
  <p>When the mind is concentrated, pure, free from minor defilements malleable workable not
  disturbed, he directs the mind for the knowledge of the disappearing and appearing of
  beings. With the heavenly eye purified beyond human, he sees beings disappear and appear
  unexalted and exalted, beautiful and ugly, in good and bad states according to their
  actions. These good beings misbehaving by body, speech and mind, blaming noble ones, with
  the wrong view of actions, after death are born in loss, in decrease, in hell. As for
  these good beings, well behaved in body speech and mind, not blaming noble ones, with the
  right view of actions after death are born in heaven. Thus with the heavenly eye purified
  beyond human he sees beings disappearing and appearing. Sandaka, when the noble disciple
  of the Teacher has attained to that noble distinction, he has wisely lived the holy life
  and even while doing so is convinced of it as merit.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>When the mind is concentrated, pure, free from minor defilements, malleable workable
  not disturbed, he directs the mind for the destruction of desires. Knows, this is
  unpleasant, this is the arising of unpleasantness, this is the cessation of unpleasantness
  and this is the path to the cessation of unpleasantness as it really is.Knows these are
  desires, this is the arising of desires, this is the cessation of desires and this is the
  path to the cessation of desires as it really is. He who knows and sees thus, is released
  from sensual desires, releasd from desires &#145;to be&#146; and released from desires of
  ignorance. When released knows, I&#146;m released, birth is destroyed, the holy life is
  lived. What should be done, is done, there is nothing more to wish. Sandaka, when the
  noble disciple of the Teacher has attained to that noble distinction, he has wisely lived
  the holy life and even while doing so is convinced of it as merit.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good, Ananda, the bhikkhu, perfect, destroyed desires, has done what should be
  done, put down the weight, has come to the highest good does he partake sensuality?&#146;
  &#145;Sandaka, the bhikkhu who is perfect, has destroyed desires, has done what should be
  done, put down the weight, has come to the highest good, has destroyed the desire &#145;to
  be&#146;, and is rightly knowing released, could not go beyond five things. It is not
  possible that the bhikkhu who has destroyed desires, with awareness, would destroy the
  life of living things, take what is not given, indulge in sexuality and tell lies. He
  would not amass things for sensual partaking as it was done when leading a household life.
  Sandaka, the bhikkhu who is perfect, destroyed desires, has done what should be done, put
  down the weight, has come to the highest good, would not do these five things, it is
  impossible that he should do them. </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Ananda, to a bhikkhu perfect, has destroyed desires, has done what should be
  done, put down the weight, come to the highest good, destroyed the desires &#145;to
  be&#146; and is rightly knowing released, is knowledge and vision constantly and
  continually established, as my desires are destroyed?&#146; &#145;Sandaka, I will give you
  a comparison, for some wise men understand when a comparison is given. Sandaka, a
  man&#146;s hands and feet are cut off. In whatever posture he may be he would know my
  hands and feet are cut and reflecting would know my hands and feet are cut. In like
  manner, the bhikkhu who is perfect, has destroyed desires, has done what should be done,
  put down the weight, has come to the highest good, has destroyed the desires &#145;to
  be&#146; and is rightly knowing released, would know constantly and continually my desires
  are destroyed.&#146; </p>
  <p>&#145;Good Gotama, about how many are led across in this Dispensation?&#146;
  &#145;Sandaka, not one, not even one hundred, not two hundred, not three hundred, not four
  hundred, not five hundred yet many more are led across in this dispensation.&#146;
  &#145;Wonderful and surprising good Ananda, there was no praising of one&#146;s own
  teaching nor disparaging another&#146;s teaching, yet many are led across. As for these
  ascetics, they are the sons of dead women. They praise themselves, disparage others, and
  show only three as led across. They are Nanda Vaccha, Sankicca and Makkhali Gosala.&#146; </p>
  <p>Then the wandering ascetic Sandaka addressed his own gathering: &#145;Good sirs, lead
  the holy life in the dispensation of the recluse Gotama. Give up gain honour and
  fame.&#146;Thus the wandering ascetic Sandaka aroused interest in his gathering to lead
  the holy life in the dispensation of the Blessed One. </p>
