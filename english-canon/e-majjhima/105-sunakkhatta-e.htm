  <p>I heard thus.</p>
  <p>At one time the Blessed One was living in the peaked hall in the Great forest in
  Vesaali. At that time many bhikkhus were declaring their attainment of perfection in the
  presence of the Blessed One. Birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived. What should be
  done is done, there is nothing more to wish. Sunakkhatta, the son of the Licchavis heard
  many bhikkhus declaring 'Birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived. What should be done
  is done, there is nothing more to wish.' He approached the Blessed One, worshipped and sat
  on a side and said. 'Venerable sir, I heard many bhikkhus declaring Birth is destroyed,
  the holy life is lived. What should be done is done, there is nothing more to wish. Of
  those declaring perfection how many declare perfection rightfully and are there certain
  ones declaring perfection out of conceit?' </p>
  <p>'Sunakkhatta those declaring perfection in my presence, birth is destroyed, the holy
  life is lived. What should be done is done, there is nothing more to wish. Some declare
  perfection rightfully and there are certain ones declaring perfection out of conceit.
  There Sunakkhatta, those bhikkhus who declare perfection rightfully, it is so to them.
  About those who declare perfection out of conceit, it occurs to the Blessed One thus. 'To
  these ones the Teaching should be given. Yet there are the fools who concoct a question
  and approach the Blessed One to ask it. Then it occurs to the Blessed One, to these the
  Teaching should be given. It happens that there comes a change to him who hears it. (*1) </p>
  <p>'Venerable sir, this is the time to give the Teaching. Hearing it from the Blessed One
  the bhikkhus will bear it in mind.' </p>
  <p>'Then Sunakkhatta listen. I will teach.' Sunakkhatta the son of the Licchavis agreed. </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said.'Sunakkhatta, these five are the strands of sense pleasures
  agreeable pleasant forms cognizable by eye consciousness arousing fondness and sense
  desires. Agreeable pleasant sounds cognizable by ear consciousness arousing fondness and
  sense desires, agreeable smells, agreeable tastes, and agreeable touches cognizable by
  body consciousness arousing fondness and sense desires. Sunakkhatta these are the five
  strands of sense pleasures.. </p>
  <p>It happens that a certain person intent on the materiality of the world, thinks, talks,
  finds pleasure and associates others intent on the materiality of the world. His attention
  does not settle when words on imperturbability are spoken. He does not think, talk, find
  pleasure and associate those interested in imperturbability. Sunakkhatta, a man gone away
  from his village long ago, meeting a man gone away from it recently would engage in talk
  and tell about the prosperity and the well being of the village or hamlet. Would this man,
  give attention, listen to it and be happy hearing it?' </p>
  <p>'Venerable sir, he would listen to it.' </p>
  <p>In the same manner, a certain person intent on the materiality of the world, thinks,
  talks, finds pleasure and associates others intent on the materiality of the world. His
  attention does not settle when words on imperturbability are spoken. He does not think,
  talk, find pleasure and associate those interested in imperturbability. He is one intent
  on the materiality of the world. </p>
  <p>Sunakkhatta, a certain person intent on imperturbability thinks, talks, finds pleasure
  and associates others intent on imperturbability. His attention does not settle when words
  on materiality of the world are spoken. He does not think, talk, find pleasure and
  associate those interested in the materiality of the world. (*2) Like a yellow leaf strewn
  from the bond would not regain its greenness. In the same manner a person intent on
  imperturbability, thinks, talks, finds pleasure and associates others intent on
  imperturbability. His attention does not settle when words on materiality of the world are
  spoken. He does not think, talk, find pleasure and associate those interested in the
  materiality of the world. The man intent on imperturbability is unyoked from the bonds of
  the material world. </p>
  <p>Sunakkhatta, a certain person intent on the sphere of nothingness, thinks, talks, finds
  pleasure and associates others intent on nothingness. His attention does not settle when
  words on imperturbability are spoken. He does not think, talk, find pleasure and associate
  those interested in imperturbability Like a huge rock that has split could not be fixed
  again.. In the same manner a person intent on the sphere of nothingness, thinks, talks,
  finds pleasure and associates others intent on nothingness. His attention does not settle
  when words on imperturbability are spoken. He does not think, talk, find pleasure and
  associate those interested in imperturbability. The man intent on nothingness is unyoked
  from the bonds of imperturbability.. </p>
  <p>Sunakkhatta, a certain person intent on the sphere of neither perception nor non
  perception, thinks, talks, finds pleasure and associates others intent on neither
  perception nor non perception. His attention does not settle when words on nothingness are
  spoken. He does not think, talk, find pleasure and associate those interested in
  nothingness Like a man who has eaten his fill would throw the remains. Sunakkhatta, would
  that man eat that food again?' 'No, venerable sir he would not.' 'In the same manner a
  person intent on the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception, thinks, talks, finds
  pleasure and associates others intent on neither perception nor non-perception. His
  attention does not settle when words on nothingness are spoken. He does not think, talk,
  find pleasure and associate those interested in nothingness. The man intent on neither
  perception nor non perception is unyoked from the bonds of nothingness. </p>
  <p>Sunakkhatta, a certain person intent on rightful extinction, thinks, talks, finds
  pleasure and associates others intent on rightful extinction. His attention does not
  settle when words on neither perception nor non-perception are spoken. He does not think,
  talk, find pleasure and associate those interested in neither perception nor
  non-perception Like a palm of which the top is cut would not grow again Sunakkhatta, In
  the same manner a person intent on rightful extinction, thinks, talks, finds pleasure and
  associates others intent on rightful extinction. His attention does not settle when words
  on neither perception nor non perception are spoken. He does not think, talk, find
  pleasure and associate those interested in neither perception nor non perception. The man
  intent on rightful extinction is unyoked from the bonds of neither perception nor non
  perception. </p>
  <p>Sunakkhatta, it might occur to a certain bhikkhu, craving is the arrow poisoned with
  ignorance and molested by interest, greed and anger. The arrow of ignorance is dispelled
  in me, the poisonous ignorance is got over, I'm rightfully intent on extinction, thus he
  becomes conceited, this is not suitable for one intent on extinction. He yokes himself to
  seeing unsuitable sights, hearing unsuitable sounds, sensing unsuitable smells, tasting
  unsuitable tastes, sensing unsuitable touches and thinking unsuitable thoughts, as a
  result his mind becomes corrupt overcome with greed and he comes to death or deathly
  unpleasantness. When a man, is shot with a poisoned arrow, his friends, co associates, and
  blood relations call a surgeon to attend on him. With an instrument he opens up the wound,
  strives for the arrow, and pulls it out. Thinking there is some poison left, he tells him.
  'Good man the poison is removed, yet do not partake unsuitable food , if you do, the wound
  will fester. From time to time wash the wound and annoint it, if you do not the wound will
  be covered with blood and pus. Do not walk about in the hot air, if you do, your wound
  will fester. Good man live in such a manner to heal your wound. It occurs to him. The
  arrow is pulled out, the poison is dispelled without a remainder, there is no danger to
  me. So he partakes unsuitable food and the wound festers, does not wash and annoint the
  wound from time to time and the wound gets covered with blood and pus. He walks about in
  the hot air and the wound gets covered with fine dust. He does not protect the wound and
  live in a manner to heal the wound. So he dies on account of the wound or feels deathly
  unpleasantness. In the same manner it might occur to a certain bhikkhu, craving is the
  arrow poisoned with ignorance and molested by interest, greed and anger. The arrow of
  ignorance is dispelled in me, the poisonous ignorance is got over, I'm rightfully intent
  on extinction, thus he becomes conceited, this is not suitable for one intent on
  extinction. He yokes himself to seeing unsuitable sights hearing unsuitable sounds,
  sensing unsuitable smells, tasting unsuitable tastes, sensing unsuitable touches and
  thinking unsuitable thoughts, as a result his mind becomes corrupt, overcome with greed
  and he comes to death or deathly unpleasantness. </p>
  <p>Sunakkhatta, it might occur to a certain bhikkhu, craving is the arrow poisoned with
  ignorance and molested by interest, greed and anger. The arrow, of ignorance is dispelled
  in me, the poisonous ignorance is got over. He becomes rightfully intent on extinction,
  and does not get yoked to things unsuitable for extinction. He does not yoke himself to
  seeing unsuitable sights, hearing unsuitable sounds, sensing unsuitable smells, tasting
  unsuitable tastes, sensing unsuitable touches and thinking unsuitable thoughts, as a
  result his mind does not become corrupt, and not overcome with greed, he does not come to
  death or deathly unpleasantness. Like a man shot with a poisoned arrow, is made to attend
  by a surgeon by his friends, co associates, and blood relations. With an instrument he
  opens up the wound, strives for the arrow, and pulls it out. Thinking there is some poison
  left, he tells him. 'Good man the poison is removed, yet do not partake unsuitable food ,
  if you do, the wound will fester. From time to time wash the wound and annoint it, if you
  do not the wound will be covered with blood and pus. Do not walk about in the hot air, if
  you do, your wound will fester. Good man live in such a manner to heal your wound. It
  occurs to him. The arrow is pulled out, the poison is dispelled without a remainder, there
  is no danger to me. Yet he partakes only suitable food, the wound does not fester, he
  washes and annoints the wound from time to time and the wound does not get covered with
  blood and pus. He does not walk about in the hot air and the wound does not get covered
  with fine dust. He protects the wound and lives in a manner to heal the wound. So he does
  not die on account of the wound nor does he feel deathly unpleasantness. In the same
  manner it might occur to a certain bhikkhu, craving is the arrow poisoned with ignorance
  and molested by interest, greed and anger. The arrow of ignorance is dispelled in me, the
  poisonous ignorance is got over, I'm rightfully intent on extinction, this is not suitable
  for one intent on extinction. He does not yoke himself to seeing unsuitable sights,
  hearing unsuitable sounds, sensing unsuitable smells, tasting unsuitable tastes, sensing
  unsuitable touches and thinking unsuitable thoughts, as a result his mind is not
  corrupted, nor overcome with greed, and he does not come to death or deathly
  unpleasantness. </p>
  <p>Sunakkhatta, this is a simile to explain it. This is its meaning. Wound is a synonymn
  for the six internal spheres. Poisonous anger is a synonymn for ignorance. Arrow is a
  synonymn for greed. Striving is a synonymn for mindfulness. Instrument is the synonymn for
  the noble one's wisdom. Surgeon is a synonymn for the Thus Gone One, perfect and
  rightfully enlightened </p>
  <p>'Sunakkhatta, the bhikkhu controlled in the six doors of mental contact, knows that
  endearment is the root for unpleasantness, destroying endearment is released from
  endearment. (*3) That the body will be settled with endearment or the mind will be advised
  for settlement, is not a possibility. (*4) Sunakkhatta, just as there is a prepared drink,
  colourful and sweet smelling, with poison mixed in it. A man who does not like to die or
  feel unpleasant comes along. Sunakkhatta, would that man drink that, if he knew, drinking
  this I will die or come to deathly unpleasantness?' </p>
  <p>'Venerable sir, he would not drink it.' 'In the same manner Sunakkhatta, the bhikkhu
  controlled in the six doors of mental contact, knows that endearment is the root for
  unpleasantness, destroying endearment is released from endearment. That the body will be
  settled with endearment or the mind will be advised for settlement, is not a possibility.
  Just as there is a poisonous snake and a man who does not like to die or feel unpleasant
  comes along. Would that man hold that snake with his hand if he knew, stung by this snake,
  I will meet death or deathly unpleasantness? </p>
  <p>'Venerable sir, he would not.' 'In the same manner Sunakkhatta, the bhikkhu controlled
  in the six doors of mental contact, knows that endearment is the root for unpleasantness,
  destroying endearment is released from endearment. That the body will be settled with
  endearment or the mind will be advised for settlement, is not a possibility.' </p>
  <p>The Blessed One said thus and Sunakkhatta the son of the Licchavis was delighted in the
  words of the Blessed One. </p>
  <p><strong>Notes </strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. It happens, there comes a change in him. '<em>Iti assa pi hoti a~n~nathatta.m'</em>.
    This means when he hears the Teaching, he would change his mind, improve his view ie.
    become one of right view and ultimately enter the stream of the Teaching. This is the
    first stage of sainthood in Buddhist parlance. </p>
    <p>2. A certain person intent on imperturbability, thinks, talks, finds pleasure and
    associates others intent on imperturbability. His attention does not settle when words on
    the materiality of the world are spoken. He does not think, talk, find pleasure and
    associate those interested in the materiality of the world.'<em>Yam idha purisapuggalo
    aana~njaadhimutto assa. aana~njaadhimuttassa purisapuggalassa tappatiruupi c'eva kathaa
    san.thaati tad anudhamma.m ca anuvitakketi anuvicaareti ta.n ca purisa.m bhajati tena ca
    vitti.m aapajjati, lokaamispa.tisa.myuttaaya ca pana kathaaya kaccamaanaa na sussuusati na
    sota.m odhahati na a~n~naa citta.m upa.t.thapeti na ca ta.m purisa.m bhajati na ca tena
    vitti.m aapajjati</em>'. Imperturbability is quite the opposite of the material world. Yet
    it is only turning away from the material world, with tears, there is no attainment what
    so ever, and there is much more to be done before any attainment is attained. One should
    not be proud of this turning away for any reason. </p>
    <p>3. The bhikkhu controlled in the six doors of mental contact, knows that endearment is
    the root of unpleasantness, destroying endearment is released from endearment. <em>'upadhii
    dukkahassa muulanti iti viditvaa nirupadhi upadhisankhaye vimutto.'</em> Endearment is the
    attachment to wife and children, gold and silver, wealth and property, and all other
    personal belongings. This inter attachment shared on both sides is endearment. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>4.The body will be settled with endearment,or the mind will be advised for settlement,
    is not a possibility. <em>'upadhismi.m vaa kaaya.m upasa.mharissati citta.m vaa
    uppadessatii ti na eta.m vijjati.'</em> The body, here is the six doors of internal mental
    contact, which causes all external data to enter our mind and causes endearment to go to
    and fro. In short it is endearment that causes unpleasantness. Yet someone should not be
    misguided to wrong actions hurting others and developing a lot of remorse in oneself. For
    this will not help him or others to end unpleasantness, which is an ailment in the mind.
    The the most important aspect of the Teaching of the Blessed One is ending unpleasantness.
    We have to be quite truthful and honest on this, and should not have pitfalls about this. </p>
