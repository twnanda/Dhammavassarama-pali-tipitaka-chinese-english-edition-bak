      VI - <BR>ANALYSIS OF MATTER</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
      color=#800080>Introduction</FONT></P></B>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman"><I>[The first Edition comprised 
      2 Volumes. The first Volume contained Chapter I to V and the second 
      Volume, Chapter VI to IX.]</I></FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The first five chapters of the 
      Abhidhammattha Sangaha deal with the 89 and 121 types of consciousness, 52 
      mental states, various thought-processes in the course of one's lifetime 
      and at rebirth, 31 planes of existence, and classification of Kamma. In 
      one sense they form one complete book. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The remaining four chapters are 
      devoted to <I>rupa</I> (matter), Nibbana, <I>paticca-samuppada</I> (the 
      Law of Dependent Arising), <I>patthana naya</I> (Causal Relations), 
      Categories of Good and Evil, Mental Culture, Path of Purity, and Great 
      Attainments. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The sixth chapter is confined 
      mainly to <I>rupa</I> and Nibbana.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Twenty-eight species of Rupa 
      are enumerated. What they are, how they arise, persist, and perish, are 
      also explained. <I>Rupa</I> is the third <I>paramattha</I> mentioned in 
      the Abhidhamma, and is one of the two composite factors of this so-called 
      being - the other being <I>nama</I> (mind). As <I>nama,</I> so <I>rupa</I> 
      too has been microscopically analysed. But no logical definition of 
      <I>rupa</I> is found either in the Text or in the Commentaries. 
      </FONT></P><I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Rupa</I> is derived from 
      <I>rup, </I>to break up, to perish<I> (nasa). </FONT></P></I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">According to the Vibhavini 
      Tika, <I>rupa</I> is that which transforms or assumes a different mode 
      owing to the adverse physical conditions of cold heat, etc. <I>(sitonhadi 
      virodhippaccayehi vikaram apajjati). </FONT></P></I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">From a Buddhist standpoint 
      <I>rupa</I> not only changes but also perishes <I>(khaya, vaya).</I> It 
      endures only for seventeen thought-moments. <I>Rupa</I> changes so rapidly 
      that one cannot strike an identical place twice. </FONT></P><I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Rupa</I> is also explained as 
      that which manifests itself <I>(rup - pakasane).</I> </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Scholars suggest various 
      renderings for <I>rupa.</I> It is generally rendered by 'form', 'body', 
      'matter', 'corporeality', etc. meanings differ according to the context. 
      One particular meaning is not universally applicable. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">From a philosophical 
      standpoint, 'matter' is the nearest equivalent for <I>rupa,</I> although 
      scientists too find it difficult to define matter. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">It should be noted that the 
      atomic theory prevailed in India in the time of the Buddha. 
      <I>Paramanu</I> was the ancient term for the modern atom. According to the 
      ancient belief one <I>ratharenu</I> consists of 36 <I>tajjaris;</I> one 
      <I>tajjari,</I> 36 <I>anus;</I> one <I>anu,</I> 36 <I>paramanus.</I> The 
      minute particles of dust seen dancing in the sunbeam are called 
      <I>ratharenus.</I> One <I>paramanu</I> is therefore, 1/46, 656th part of a 
      <I>ratharenu.</I> This <I>paramanu</I> was considered indivisible. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">With His supernormal knowledge 
      the Buddha analysed this so-called <I>paramanu</I> and declared that it 
      consists of <I>paramatthas</I> - ultimate entities which cannot further be 
      subdivided. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The <I>paramatthas</I> are 
      <I>pathavi, apo, tejo,</I> and <I>vayo.</I> One must not understand that 
      these elements are earth, water, fire and air, as some Greek thinkers 
      believed in the past. </FONT></P><B>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Pathavi</B> means the element 
      of extension, the substratum of matter. Without it objects cannot occupy 
      space. The qualities of hardness and softness which are purely relative 
      are two conditions of this particular element. It may be stated that this 
      element is present in earth, water, fire and air. For instance, the water 
      above is supported by water below. It is this element of extension in 
      conjunction with the element of motion, that produces the upward pressure. 
      Heat or cold is the <I>tejo</I> element, while fluidity is the <I>apo</I> 
      element </FONT></P><B>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Apo</B> is the element of 
      cohesion. Unlike pathavi it is intangible. It is this element that makes 
      scattered particles of matter cohere, and gives rise to the idea of 
      'body'. When solid bodies are melted, this element becomes more prominent 
      in the resulting fluid. This element is found even in minute particles 
      when solid bodies are reduced to powder. The elements of extension and 
      cohesion are so closely interrelated that when cohesion ceases extension 
      disappears. </FONT></P><B>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Tejo</B> is the element of 
      heat. Cold is also a form of <I>tejo.</I> Both heat and cold are included 
      in <I>tejo</I> because they possess the power of maturing bodies, Tejo, in 
      other words, is the vitalizing energy. Preservation and decay are also due 
      to this element. Unlike the other three essentials of matter, this element 
      has the power to regenerate matter by itself. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Inseparably connected with heat 
      is <B>vayo,</B> the element of motion. Movements are caused by this 
      element. Motion is regarded as the force or the generator of heat. "Motion 
      and heat in the material realm correspond respectively to consciousness 
      and Kamma in the mental." </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">These four elements coexist and 
      are inseparable, but one may preponderate over another as, for instance, 
      <I>pathavi</I> in earth, <I>apo</I> in water, <I>tejo</I> in fire, and 
      <I>vayo</I> in air. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">They are also called 
      Mahabhutas, or Great Essentials because they are invariably found in all 
      material substances ranging from the infinitesimally small cell to the 
      most massive object. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Dependent on them are the four 
      subsidiary material qualities of colour <I>(vanna),</I> smell 
      <I>(gandha),</I> taste <I>(rasa),</I> and nutritive essence <I>(oja).</I> 
      These eight coexisting forces and qualities constitute one material group 
      called <I>'suddhatthaka rupa kalapa</I> - pure-octad material group'. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The remaining twenty kinds of 
      <I>rupa</I> are equally important. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">It should be noted that 
      physical life-principle <I>(rupa jivitindriya)</I> and sex are also 
      conditioned by Kamma. Life in inorganic matter should be differentiated 
      from life in animate beings. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The fact that <I>rupas</I> 
      arise in four ways such as Kamma, mind, seasonal phenomena, and food, will 
      be a novel idea to modern thinkers. All these four sources can, to a great 
      extent, be brought under one's control. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">To some extent we are 
      responsible for the creation of our own material phenomena, desirable or 
      undesirable. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The accumulated Karmic 
      tendencies created by persons in the course of their previous lives, play 
      at times a greater role than the hereditary parental cells and genes, in 
      the formation of physical characteristics.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The Buddha, for instance, 
      inherited like every other person, the reproductive cells and genes from 
      His parents. But physically there was none comparable to Him in His long 
      line of honorable ancestors. In the Buddha's own words, He belonged not to 
      the royal lineage, but to that of the Aryan Buddhas. He was certainly a 
      superman, an extraordinary creation of His own Kamma.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">According to the Lakkhana Sutta 
      (D. 30) the Buddha inherited these exceptional features, such as the 32 
      major marks, as the result of his past meritorious deeds. The ethical 
      reason for acquiring each physical feature is clearly explained in the 
      Sutta. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">In the sixth chapter only a few 
      lines are devoted to the fourth <I>paramattha</I> - Nibbana - the 
      <I>summum bonum</I> of Buddhism. But the path to Nibbana is described in 
      detail in the ninth chapter. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The seventh chapter enumerates 
      all ethical states and classifies them into various groups. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The two most profound 
      philosophical teachings of Buddhism - namely, the Law of Dependent Arising 
      <I>(paticca-samuppada)</I> and the twenty-four Causal Relations<I> 
      (Patthana) </I>are described in the eighth chapter. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The last chapter is the most 
      important and the most interesting, as it deals with Mental Culture 
      <I>(bhavana)</I> and Emancipation, the quintessence of Buddhism. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">To understand the intricacies 
      of Abhidhamma one should critically read and reread the Abhidhammattha 
      Sangaha patiently and carefully, pondering at the same time on the 
      profound teachings embodied therein. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">One who understands the 
      Abhidhamma well can fully comprehend the Word of the Buddha and thereby 
      realize one's ultimate goal. </FONT></P>

            <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">§ 2. Matter is 
            twofold-namely, the four Great Essentials (8), and material

            <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">How? </FONT></P>
            <DIR>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">(1) Essential material 
            qualities - the element of extension (10), the element of cohesion

            <BR>(2) Sensitive material qualities (14) viz: eye, ear, nose,

            <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Thus these eighteen (22)

      evidently supported by the Upanishads. The Buddha could have accepted this 
      popular theory, but He did not commit Himself. In the Patthana, the Book 
      of Relations, the Buddha refers to the basis of consciousness in such 
      indirect terms as <I>"yam rupam nissaya''</I> "depending on that material 
      thing", without positively asserting whether that <I>rupa</I> was either 
      the heart <I>(hadaya)</I> or the brain. But, according to the views of 
      commentators like Venerable Buddhaghosa and Anuruddha, the seat of

      such it is eternal. <I>Akasa</I> is a dhatu in the sense of a non-entity

      They are so called because they take external objects as pasture. 
      According to the Abhidhammattha Sangaha, sight and sound are regarded as 
      objects that do not approach the eye and ear respectively as in the case 
      of bodily contacts, etc. Both eye and ear cognize distant objects without 
      any direct approach. In the case of other objects they directly contact 
      the sense-organs. For instance, taste must directly touch the tongue. So 
      are the other two objects. This may be the reason, irrespective of the

      do not reach, the objects. </FONT></P>

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Notes: </FONT></P></B>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">52. <B>Rhupasamutthana</B> - 
      Buddhism does not attempt to solve the problem of the ultimate origin of 
      matter. It takes for granted that matter exists and states that 
      <I>rupa</I> develops in four ways. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">53. <B>Kammaja</B> - Strictly 
      speaking, by Kamma are meant past moral and immoral types of 
      consciousness. It is only those classes of consciousness pertaining to the 
      <I>kama</I> and <I>rupa</I>-spheres that tend to produce <I>rupa.</I> They 
      are 12 types of immoral consciousness, 8 types of moral consciousness, and 
      the 5 moral <I>rupa jhanas.</I> A moral or immoral birth-reproductive 
      Kamma generated at the dying moment of a person, conditions the 
      rebirth-consciousness <I>(patisandhi-citta)</I> in a subsequent birth. 
      Simultaneous with the arising of the rebirth-consciousness, <I>rupas</I> 
      conditioned by past Kamma spring up at every instant, like the flame of a 
      lamp, up to the 17th thought-moment reckoned from the dying moment of the 
      person. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">At the very moment of 
      conception there arise, as a result of the reproductive Karmic force, 
      three <I>dasakas</I> or 'decads' - namely, the <I>kaya, bhava,</I> and 
      <I>vatthu</I> - body, sex, and base decads. The body decad is composed of 
      the four elements, four derivatives, vitality and the <I>kayapasada.</I> 
      The sex-decad and the base-decad are similarly constituted. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">54. <B>Cittaja</B> - Mind, the 
      invisible but more powerful composite factor of the so-called being, has 
      the potentiality to produce <I>rupa.</I> In other words, good and bad 
      thoughts produce desirable and undesirable material phenomena. This is 
      apparent from the physical changes that result from thoughts generated by 
      a person. According to Abhidhamma, it is from the arising moment of the 
      first <I>bhavanga,</I> that is, immediately after the 
      rebirth-consciousness, that material phenomena arising from mind spring 
      up. The rebirth-consciousness does not produce mind-born <I>rupas,</I> 
      since Kamma does that function, and since it is a newcomer to the fresh 
      existence. No mind-born <I>rupas</I> arise at the static and perishing 
      thought-moments, as they are weak. The ten sense-cognitives lack the 
      potentiality to produce <I>rupa.</I> The four <I>arupa vipaka</I> 
      <I>jhanas</I> do not produce <I>rupa,</I> as they are developed through 
      non-attachment to <I>rupa. </FONT></P></I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">It is stated that <I>jhana</I> 
      factors are essential to produce mind-born <I>rupa.</I> One who possesses 
      <I>jhanas</I> can therefore produce powerful <I>rupas</I> which would 
      enable him to live even without edible food. The mentally alert do not 
      lack vitality. One who experiences Nibbanic bliss could live without any 
      food for a considerable period. For instance, the Buddha fasted 49 days

            <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">§ 6. All these material 
            qualities are obtained, with no deficiency, according to 
            circumstances, during lifetime in the <I>kama</I>-sphere. But at 
            conception, to moisture-born beings and to those of spontaneous 
            birth, there arise at most the seven decads - eye, ear, nose, 
            tongue, body, sex and base. As a minimum sometimes, eye, ear, nose, 
            and sex decads are not obtained. This is how deficiencies of 
            material groups should be understood. </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">To the womb-born 
            creatures there arise three decads - body, sex and base. Sometimes, 
            however, the sex-decad is not obtained. From the conception and 
            thereafter, during lifetime, gradually there arise eye-decads and so 
            forth. </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Thus the continuity of 
            material groups produced in four ways - namely, Kamma-born from the 
            time of conception, mind-born from the second moment of 
            consciousness, season-born from the time of the static stage, 
            food-born from the time of the diffusion of nutritive essence - 
            uninterruptedly flows on in the <I>kama</I>-sphere till the end of 
            life, like the flame of a lamp, or the stream of a river. 
</FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">But at the time of death, 
            from the seventeenth moment, reckoned backward from the 
            decease-consciousness starting from the static stage of 
            consciousness, kamma-born material phenomena no longer arise. 
            Kamma-born material qualities that arose earlier exist till the 
            decease-moment and then cease. Following that, the 
            consciousness-born and nutriment-born material phenomena come to 
            cessation. Thereafter a continuity of material qualities produced by 
            physical changes persists while what is called a corpse lasts. 
            </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Thus to the dead persons, 
            again in a subsequent life, material qualities similarly arise 
            starting from the conception. </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">In the <I>rupa</I>-plane 
            decads of nose, tongue, body, sex and the material groups produced 
            by food do not arise. Therefore to them at the time of rebirth there 
            arise four material groups produced by Kamma, such as the three 
            decads of eye, ear, and base, and the vital nonad. During life 
            material qualities produced by mind and physical changes arise. 
            </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">But to the mindless 
            beings there do not arise eye, ear, base and sound. Similarly 
            mind-born material qualities do not arise. Therefore at the moment 
            of their rebirth only the vital nonad arises. During lifetime 
            material qualities produced by physical changes, with the exception 
            of sound, continue. </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Thus in the three planes 
            of <I>kama, rupa</I> and <I>asañña</I> (Mindless) the procedure of 
            material phenomena should be understood in two ways as regards 
            rebirth and lifetime. </FONT></P>
            <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">In the <I>kama</I>-sphere 
            are obtained 28 material qualities, 23 in the <I>rupa</I>-plane, 17

      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">As all mental states possess 
      four common characteristics, so <I>rupas</I> found in the aforesaid groups 
      possess four salient characteristics. For instance, in the 'eye-decad' all 
      the ten associated <I>rupas</I> arise and cease together

      of the 'eye-decad' does not serve as a basis for the associated 
      <I>rupas</I> of the 'ear-decad'. These four characteristics apply only to 
      the associated <I>rupas</I> of each particular group.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">58. This section deals with the 
      manner in which these material groups come into being and how they exist 
      during lifetime, at the moment of conception, and in different states of 
      birth.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">According to Buddhism there are 
      four kinds of birth - namely, egg-born beings <I>(andaja),</I> womb-born 
      beings <I>(jalabuja),</I> moisture-born beings <I>(samsedaja), </I>and 
      beings having spontaneous births <I>(opapatika).</I> </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Embryos that take moisture as 
      nidus for their growth, like certain lowly forms of animal life, belong to 
      the third class. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Sometimes moisture-born beings 
      lack certain senses and have no sex. They all must possess a consciousness 
      as they are all endowed with the base-decad, that is, the seat of 
      consciousness. Beings having a spontaneous birth are generally invisible 
      to the physical eye. Conditioned by their past Kamma, they appear 
      spontaneously, without passing through an embryonic stage. Petas and Devas 
      normally, and Brahmas belong to this class.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Some of those who have 
      spontaneous birth in the <I>kama</I>-sphere are asexual. But all beings 
      who are Spontaneously born in the <I>rupa</I>-sphere are not only asexual 
      but are also devoid of sensitive nose, tongue, and body, though they 
      possess those physical organs. The sensitive material qualities 
      <I>(pasadarupas) </I>of those particular organs are lost as they are not 
      of any practical use to Brahmas. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Egg-born beings are also 
      included among womb-born beings. At the moment of conception they all 
      obtain the three decads of body, sex, and the seat of consciousness. At 
      times some are devoid of both masculinity and femininity. From this it is 
      seen that even eggs are constituted with a consciousness.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">59. <B>Nibbana</B>, Sanskrit 
      Nirvana, is composed of <I>ni</I> and <I>vana.</I> <I>Ni + vana </I>= 
      Nivana = Nibana = Nibbana. <I>Ni</I> is a particle implying negation. 
      <I>Vana</I> means weaving or craving. It is this craving which acts as a 
      cord to connect the series of lives of any particular individual in the 
      course of his wanderings in Samsara.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">As long as one is entangled by 
      craving or attachment, one accumulates fresh Karmic forces which must 
      materialize in one form or other in the eternal cycle of birth and death. 
      When all forms of craving are extirpated, Karmic forces cease to operate, 
      and one, in conventional terms, attains Nibbana, escaping the cycle of 
      birth and death. The Buddhist conception of Deliverance is this escape 
      from the ever-recurring cycle of birth and death, and is not merely an 
      escape from 'sin and hell'. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Etymologically, Nibbana, 
      derived from <I>ni + vu,</I> to weave, means non-craving or non-attachment 
      , or 'departure from craving'. Strictly speaking, Nibbana is that Dhamma 
      which is gained by the complete destruction of all forms of craving. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Nibbana is also derived from 
      <I>ni + va,</I> to blow. In that case Nibbana means the blowing out, the 
      extinction, or the annihilation of the flames of lust, hatred, and 
      ignorance. It should be understood that the mere destruction of passions 
      is not Nibbana <I>(khayamattam eva na nibbananti vattabbam). </I>It is 
      only the means to gain Nibbana, and is not an end in itself. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Nibbana is an ultimate reality 
      <I>(vatthu-dhamma)</I> which is supramundane <I>(lokuttara), </I>that is, 
      beyond the world of mind and body or the five 'aggregates'. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Nibbana is to be understood by 
      intuitive knowledge and inferential knowledge <I>(paccakkha or pativedha 
      ñana and anumana or anubodha ñana). </I>To express both ideas it is stated 
      that Nibbana is to be realized by means of the wisdom pertaining to the 
      four Paths of Sainthood and that it becomes an object to the Paths and 
      Fruits. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Intrinsically 
      <I>(sabhavato)</I> Nibbana is peaceful (santi). As such it is unique 
      <I>(kevala).</I> This single Nibbana is viewed as twofold according to the 
      way it is experienced before and after death. The text uses a simple but 
      recondite Pali phrase - <I>karanapariyayena.</I> The Ceylon Commentary 
      explains the cause for naming it as such with respect to its having or not 
      having the aggregates as the remainder <I>(sa-upadisesadivasena paññapane 
      karanabhutassa upadisesabhavabhavassa lesena).</I> Adding a note on this 
      term S. Z. Aung writes: "The Ceylon Commentaries explain it by 
      <I>paññapane karanassa lesena</I> - by way of device of the means (of 
      knowing) in the matter of language." - Compendium, p. 168, n. 
      6.</FONT></P><B>

      <I>Upadi</I>, derived from<I> upa + a + da,</I> to take, means the five 
      aggregates as they are firmly grasped by craving and false views. It also 
      signifies passions <I>(kilesas). </I>According to the text and the 
      Commentarial interpretations, Nibbana, experienced by Sotapannas, 
      Sakadagamis, and Anagamis, is <I>saupadisesa-nibbanadhatu</I> as they have 
      the body and some passions still remaining. Nibbana of the Arahats is also 
      <I>saupadisesa-nibbanadhatu</I> as they have the body still remaining. It 
      is only the Nibbana of the Arahats after their death that is termed 
      <I>anupadisesa-nibbanadhatu</I> because the aggregates and the passions 
      are discarded by them. </FONT></P>
