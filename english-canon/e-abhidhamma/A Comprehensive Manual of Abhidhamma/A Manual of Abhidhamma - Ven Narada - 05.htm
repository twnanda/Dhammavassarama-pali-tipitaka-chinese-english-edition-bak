      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">1. Bhumi. </B>derived from 
      <I>bhu,</I> to be, lit., means a place where beings exist. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">According to Buddhism the 
      earth, an almost insignificant speck in the universe, is not the only 
      habitable world, and humans are not the only living beings, Infinite are 
      world systems and so are living beings. Nor is "the impregnated ovum the 
      only route to rebirth" "By traversing one cannot reach the end of the 
      world," says the Buddha.</FONT></P>
      <DIR>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">* "There are about 1,000,000 
      planetary systems in the Milky Way in which life exists." See Fred Hoyle, 
      The Nature of the Universe, pp. 87-89.</FONT></P></DIR>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">2. <B>Apaya</B> = <I>apa + 
      aya.</I> That which is devoid of happiness is apaya. It is viewed both as 
      a mental state and as a place. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">3. States where sense-pleasures 
      abound. See Chapter I. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">4. and 5. See Chapter I. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">6. <B>Niraya</B> = <I>ni + 
      aya;</I> devoid of happiness. According to Buddhism there are several 
      woeful states where beings atone for their evil kamma. They are not 
      eternal hells where beings are subject to endless suffering. Upon the 
      exhaustion of the evil Kamma there is a possibility for beings born in 
      such states to be reborn in good states as the result of their past good 
      actions. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">7. <B>Tiracchana</B> = 
      <I>tiro,</I> across; <I>acchana,</I> going. Animals are so called because 
      as a rule quadrupeds walk horizontally. Buddhist belief is that beings are 
      born as animals on account of evil Kamma. There is, however, the 
      possibility for animals to be born as human beings. Strictly speaking, it 
      should be said that an animal may manifest itself in the form of a human 
      being, or <I>vice versa,</I> just as an electric current can be manifested 
      in the forms of light, heat, and motion successively - one not necessarily 
      being evolved from the other. An animal may be born in a blissful state as 
      a result of the good Kamma accumulated in the past. There are at times 
      certain animals, particularly dogs and cats, who live a more comfortable 
      life than even human beings. It is also due to their past good Kamma. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">It is one's Kamma that 
      determines the nature of one's material form, which varies according to 
      the skill or unskilfulness of one's actions. And this again depends 
      entirely on the evolution of one's understanding of reality. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">8. <B>Peta</B> = <I>pa + 
      ita;</I> lit., departed beings, or (those) absolutely devoid of happiness. 
      They are not disembodied spirits or ghosts. Although they possess material 
      forms, generally they are invisible to the physical eye. They have no 
      plane of their own, but live in forests, dirty surroundings, etc. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">9. <B>Asura</B> - lit., those 
      who do not sport or those who do not shine. These Asuras should be 
      distinguished from another class of Asuras who are opposed to Devas, and 
      who live in the Tavatimsa plane (see note 12). </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">10. <B>Manussa</B> - lit., 
      those who have an uplifted or developed mind <I>(mano ussannam etesam). 
      </I>Its Sanskrit equivalent is <I>Manushya,</I> which means the sons of 
      <I>Manu.</I> They are so called because they became civilized after 
      <I>Manu</I> the seer. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The human realm is a mixture of 
      both pain and happiness. Bodhisattas prefer the human realm, as they get a 
      better opportunity to serve the world and perfect the requisites for 
      Buddha hood. Buddhas are always born as human beings. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">11. <B>Catummaharajika</B> - 
      This is the lowest of the heavenly realms where the four Guardian Deities 
      reside with their followers.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">12. <B>Tavatimsa</B> - lit., 
      thirty-three. Sakka, the king of the gods, resides in this celestial 
      plane. The origin of the name is attributed to a story which states that 
      thirty-three selfless volunteers led by Magha, having performed charitable 
      deeds, were born in this heavenly realm. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">13. <B>Yama </B>- derived from 
      <I>yam,</I> to destroy. That which destroys pain is 
<I>yama.</FONT></P></I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">14. <B>Tusita</B> - lit., 
      happy-dwellers. Traditional belief is that the future Bodhisatta dwells at 
      present in this celestial plane, awaiting the right opportunity to be born 
      as a human being and become a Buddha. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">15. <B>Nimmanarati</B> - Those 
      who delight in the created mansions. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">16. <B>Paranimmitavasavatti</B> 
      - lit., those who bring under their sway things created by others. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">These are the six Celestial 
      planes - all temporary blissful abodes - where beings are supposed to live 
      happily enjoying fleeting pleasures of sense. Superior to these Sensuous 
      planes are the Brahma realms where beings delight in jhanic bliss, 
      achieved by renouncing sense-desires. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">17. These are the three Brahma 
      realms where beings who have developed the first jhana are born. The 
      lowest of these three is Brahma Parisajja, which, literally, means "Those 
      who are born amongst the attendants of Maha-Brahmas." The second is Brahma 
      Purohita which means Brahma's Ministers. The highest of the first three is 
      Maha Brahma. It is so called because these beings exceed others in 
      happiness, beauty and age-limit, owing to the intrinsic merit of their 
      mental development. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Those who develop the first 
      jhana to a normal extent are born in the first plane; those who have 
      developed to a medium degree are born in the second; and those who have 
      perfect control of the first jhana are born amongst the Maha Brahmas in 
      the third plane. The three divisions of the other jhanic planes should be 
      similarly understood. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">18. <B>Asasññasatta</B> - This 
      is supposed to be a plane where beings are born without a consciousness. 
      Here only a material flux exists, normally both mind and matter are 
      inseparable. By the power of meditation it is possible, at times, to 
      separate matter from mind as in this particular case. When Arahat attains 
      the <I>Nirodha</I> <I>Samapatti,</I> his consciousness ceases to exist 
      temporarily. Such a state is almost inconceivable to us. But there may be 
      many inconceivable things which are actual facts. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">19. Suddhavasa - Only Anagamis 
      and Arahats are found in these planes. Those who attain Anagami in other 
      planes are born in these Pure Abodes. Later, they attain Arahatship and 
      live in those planes till their life-term is over. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">20. See Chapter I. All these 
      four are immaterial planes. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">It should be remarked that the 
      Buddha did not attempt to expound any cosmological theory. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The essence of the Buddha's 
      teaching is not affected by the existence or non-existence of these 
      planes. No one is bound to believe anything if it does not appeal to his 
      reason. Nor is it right to reject anything just because it cannot be 
      conceived by one's limited knowledge. </FONT></P>

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">29. <B>Kamma,</B> Sanskrit 
      Karma, lit. means action, of doing. Strictly speaking, Kamma means all 
      moral and immoral volition (cetana). It covers all that is included in the 
      phrase - "thought, word and deed". It is the law of moral causation. In 
      other words, it is action and reaction in the ethical realm, or "action 
      influence" as Westerners say. It is not fate or predestination. It is 
      one's own doing reacting on oneself. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Every volitional action, except 
      that of a Buddha or of an Arahat, is called Kamma. The Buddhas and Arahats 
      do not accumulate fresh Kamma as they have eradicated ignorance and 
      craving, the roots of Kamma. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Kamma is action, and Vipaka, 
      fruit or result, is its reaction. It is the cause and the effect. Like a 
      seed is Kamma. Vipaka (effect) is like the fruit arising from the tree. As 
      we sow, we reap somewhere and sometime in this life or in a future birth. 
      What we reap today is what we have sown either in the present or in the 
      past. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Kamma is a law in itself, and 
      it operates in its own field without the intervention of an external 
      independent ruling agency. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Inherent in Kamma is the 
      potentiality of producing its due effect. The cause produces the effect; 
      the effect explains the cause. The seed produces the fruit; the fruit 
      explains the seed; such is their relationship. Even so are Kamma and its 
      effect: "the effect already blooms in the cause". </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">According to Abhidhamma, Kamma 
      constitutes the twelve types of immoral consciousness, eight types of 
      moral consciousness pertaining to the Sense-sphere <I>(kamavacara),</I> 
      five types of moral consciousness pertaining to the Realms of Forms 
      <I>(rupavacara), </I>and four types of moral consciousness pertaining to 
      the Formless Realms <I>(arupavacara). </FONT></P></I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The eight types of supramundane 
      consciousness <I>(lokuttara citta)</I> are not regarded as Kamma and 
      <I>vipaka,</I> because they tend to eradicate the roots of Kamma that 
      condition rebirth. In the supramundane consciousness wisdom <I>(pañña)</I> 
      is predominant, while in the ordinary types of consciousness volition 
      <I>(cetana)</I> is predominant. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">These twenty-nine types of 
      consciousness are called Kamma because the reproductive power is inherent 
      in them. Just as every object is accompanied by a shadow, even so every 
      volitional activity is accompanied by its due effect. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">These types of consciousness 
      that are experienced as inevitable consequences of good and bad thoughts, 
      are called resultant consciousness <I>(vipaka).</I> The 23 types (7+8+8) 
      of resultant consciousness pertaining to the Sense-sphere, the five types 
      of resultant consciousness pertaining to the Realms of Form, and the four 
      types of resultant consciousness pertaining to the Formless Realms, are 
      called <I>vipaka</I> or fruition of Kamma. </FONT></P>

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">30. Every birth is conditioned 
      by a past good or bad Kamma which predominates at the moment of death. The 
      Kamma that conditions the future birth is called Reproductive (Janaka) 
      Kamma. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The death of a person is merely 
      "the temporary end of a temporary phenomenon". Though the present form 
      perishes, another form which is neither the same nor absolutely different, 
      takes its place according to the potential thought-vibrations generated at 
      the death moment, as the Kammic force which propels the life-flux still 
      survives. It is this last thought, which is technically called 
      Reproductive Kamma, that determines the state of a person in his 
      subsequent birth. This may be either a good or bad Kamma. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">According to the commentary, 
      Janaka Kamma is that which produces mental aggregates and material 
      aggregates at the moment of conception. The initial consciousness, which 
      is termed the <I>patisandhi viññana</I> (rebirth-consciousness), is 
      conditioned by this Janaka Kamma. Simultaneous with the arising of the 
      rebirth-consciousness there arise the body-decad, sex-decad, and 
      base-decad <I>(kaya-bhava-vatthu dasaka). </FONT></P></I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The body-decad is composed of 
      the four elements - namely, the element of extension <I>(pathavi),</I> the 
      element of cohesion <I>(apo), </I>the element of heat <I>(tejo),</I> the 
      element of motion <I>(vayo);</I> their four derivatives <I>(upadarupa) 
      </I>- namely, colour <I>(vanna),</I> odour <I>(gandha),</I> taste 
      <I>(rasa),</I> nutritive essence <I>(oja);</I> vitality 
      <I>(jivitindriya),</I> and body <I>(kaya). </I>The sex-decad and the 
      base-decad also consist of the first nine plus sex <I>(bhava)</I> and seat 
      of consciousness <I>(vatthu) </I>respectively.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">From this it is evident that 
      the sex is determined at the very conception of a being. I t is 
      conditioned by Kamma and is not a fortuitous combination of sperm and ovum 
      cells. Pain and happiness, which one experiences in the course of one's 
      lifetime, are the inevitable consequences of Janaka Kamma. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">31. <B>Upatthambhaka</B> - that 
      which comes near the Reproductive Kamma and supports it. It is either good 
      or bad, and it assists or maintains the action of the Reproductive Kamma 
      in the course of one's lifetime. Immediately after the conception till the 
      death moment, this Kamma steps forward to support the Reproductive Kamma. 
      A moral Supportive Kamma assists in giving health, wealth, happiness, 
      etc., to the person concerned. An immoral Supportive Kamma, on the other 
      hand, assists in giving pain, sorrow, etc., to the person born with an 
      immoral Reproductive Kamma as, for instance, to a beast of burden. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">32. <B>Upapidaka</B> - 
      Obstructive or Counteractive Kamma which, unlike the previous one, tends 
      to weaken, interrupt and retard the fruition of the Reproductive Kamma. 
      For instance, a person born with a good Reproductive Kamma maybe subject 
      to various ailments, etc., thus preventing him from enjoying the blissful 
      results of his good action. An animal, on the other hand, who is born with 
      a bad Reproductive Kamma, may lead a comfortable life by getting good 
      food, lodging, etc., as a result of his good Counteractive Kamma 
      preventing the fruition of the evil Reproductive Kamma. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">33. <B>Upaghataka</B> - 
      According to the Law of Kamma the potential energy of the Reproductive 
      Kamma could be nullified by a more powerful opposing Kamma of the past, 
      which, seeking an opportunity, may quite unexpectedly operate, just as a 
      counteractive powerful force can obstruct the path of a flying arrow and 
      bring it down to the ground. Such an action is called Destructive Kamma, 
      which is more effective than the previous two in that it not only 
      obstructs but also destroys the whole force. This Destructive Kamma also 
      may be either good or bad. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">As an instance of the operation 
      of all four, the case of Devadatta, who attempted to kill the Buddha and 
      who caused a schism in the Sangha, may be cited. His good Reproductive 
      Kamma conditioned him a birth in a royal family. His continued comforts 
      and prosperity were due to the action of the Supportive Kamma. The 
      counteractive Kamma came into operation when he was subject to much 
      humiliation as a result of his being excommunicated from the Sangha. 
      Finally the Destructive Kamma brought his life to a miserable end. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">34. <B>Garuka</B> - which means 
      either weighty or serious, may be either good or bad. It produces its 
      results in this life, or in the next for certain. If good, it is purely 
      mental as in the case of the <I>jhanas.</I> Otherwise it is verbal or 
      bodily. The five kinds of immoral Weighty Kamma according to their gravity 
      are: - (i) the creation of a schism in the Sangha, (ii) the wounding of a 
      Buddha, (iii) the murder of an Arahat, (iv) matricide, and (v) parricide. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">These are also known as 
      Anantariya Kamma because they definitely produce their effects in the 
      subsequent life. Permanent Skepticism <I>(niyata micchaditthi)</I> is also 
      termed one of the Weighty Kammas. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">If, for instance, any person 
      were to develop the <I>jhanas</I> and later were to commit one of these 
      heinous crimes, his good Kamma would be obliterated by the powerful evil 
      Kamma. His subsequent birth would be conditioned by the evil Kamma in 
      spite of his having gained the <I>jhanas</I> earlier. Devadatta lost his 
      psychic powers and was born in an evil state, because he wounded the 
      Buddha and caused a schism in the Sangha. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">King Ajatasattu would have 
      attained the first stage of sainthood if he had not committed parricide. 
      In this case the powerful evil Kamma acted as an obstacle to his gaining 
      sainthood. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">35. <B>Asanna,</B> or 
      Death-proximate Kamma, is that which one does or remembers immediately 
      before the dying moment. Owing to its significance in determining the 
      future birth, the custom of reminding the dying person of his good deeds 
      and making him do good acts on his death-bed still prevails in Buddhist 
      countries. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Sometimes a bad person may die 
      happily and receive a good birth if fortunately he remembers or does a 
      good act at the last moment. A story runs that a certain executioner, who 
      casually happened to give some alms to the Venerable Sariputta, remembered 
      this good act at the dying moment and was born in a state of bliss. This 
      does not mean that although he enjoys a good birth he will be exempt from 
      the effects of the evil deeds accumulated during his lifetime. They will 
      have their due effects as occasions arise. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">At times a good person may die 
      unhappily by suddenly remembering an evil act of his or by harbouring some 
      unpleasant thought, perchance compelled by unfavourable circumstances. 
      Queen Mallika, the consort of King Pasenadi, led a righteous life, but as 
      a result of remembering, at her death moment, a lie which she had uttered, 
      she had to suffer for about seven days in a state of misery. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">These are only exceptional 
      cases. Such reverse changes of birth account for the birth of virtuous

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Notes: </FONT></P></B>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">51. "Death is the temporary end 
      of a temporary phenomenon." By death is meant the extinction of psychic 
      life <I>(jivitindriya),</I> heat <I>(usma = tejodhatu),</I> and 
      consciousness <I>(viññana),</I> of one individual in a particular 
      existence. Death is not the complete annihilation of a being. Death in one 
      place means birth in another place, just as, in conventional terms, the 
      rising of the sun in one place means the setting of the sun in another 
      place. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">52. What are commonly 
      understood to be natural deaths due to old age may be classed under this 
      category. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">To each of the various planes 
      of existence is naturally assigned a definite age-limit, irrespective of 
      the potential energy of the Reproductive Kamma that has yet to run. One 
      must, however, succumb to death when the maximum age-limit is reached. It 
      may also be said that if the Reproductive Kamma is extremely powerful, the 
      Karmic energy rematerializes itself on the same plane, or on some higher 
      plane as in the case of the devas. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">53. As a rule the thought, 
      volition, or desire, which was extremely strong during lifetime becomes 
      predominant at the moment of death, and conditions the subsequent birth. 
      In this last thought-moment is present a special potentiality. When the 
      potential energy of this Reproductive Kamma is exhausted, the organic 
      activities of the material form, in which is corporealized the life-force, 
      cease even before the approach of old age. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">54. If a person is born at a 
      time when the age-limit is 80 years, and he dies at 80 owing to the 
      exhaustion of the potential force of his Reproductive Kamma, his death is 
      due to the simultaneous expiration of both age and Kamma. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">55. There are powerful actions 
      which suddenly cut off the force of the Reproductive Kamma, even before 
      the expiration of the life-term. A more powerful opposing force, for 
      instance, can check the path of a flying arrow and bring it down to the 
      ground. Similarly, a very powerful Kammic force of the past is capable of 
      nullifying the potential energy of the dying reproductive <I>(janaka)</I> 
      thought-moment, and thus destroy the life of a being. The death of 
      Devadatta was due to an <I>upacchedaka</I> <I>kamma</I> which he committed 
      during his lifetime. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The first three types of death

      be extinguished owing to any of the following four causes, namely, the 
      exhaustion of the wick, the exhaustion of oil, simultaneous exhaustion of

      Death of a person may similarly be caused by any of the aforesaid four

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">56. As a person is about to 
      die, a good or bad action may present itself before his mind's eye. It may 
      be either a meritorious or a demeritorious Weighty action <I>(garuka 
      kamma), </I>such as <I>jhanas</I> (ecstasies), or parricide etc. They are 
      so powerful that they totally eclipse all other actions, and appear very 
      vividly before the mental eye. If there is no Weighty action, he may take 
      for his object of the dying thought a Kamma done or remembered immediately 
      before death <I>(asanna kamma). </FONT></P></I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">If it is a past action,

      sight, sound, smell, taste, touch or idea which was obtained at the time

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">58. By <B>gati nimitta</B> is 
      meant some sign of the place where he is to take birth, an event which 
      invariably happens to dying persons. When these indications of the future 
      birth occur, and if they are bad, they can be turned into good. This is 
      done by influencing the thoughts of the dying person, so that his good 
      thoughts may now act as the Proximate Kamma and counteract the influence 
      of the Reproductive Kamma which would otherwise affect his subsequent 
      birth. </FONT></P>

      actually dies. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Let us imagine for the sake of 
      convenience that the dying person is to be reborn in the human plane and

      psychologically important stage - the <I>javana</I> process - which here 
      runs only for five thought-moments by reason of its weakness, instead of 
      the normal seven. As such it lacks all reproductive power; its main 
      function being the mere regulation of the new existence - 
      <I>abhinavakarana.</I> The object in the present case being desirable, the 
      consciousness he experiences is a moral one - automatic or prompted, 
      accompanied by pleasure, and associated with wisdom or as the case may be. 
      The <I>tadalambana</I> consciousness which has for its function a 
      registering or identifying for two moments of the object so perceived, may 
      or may not follow. After this occurs death consciousness <I>(cuti citta),

      that which is experienced during the <I>javana</I> process. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">With the ceasing of the
