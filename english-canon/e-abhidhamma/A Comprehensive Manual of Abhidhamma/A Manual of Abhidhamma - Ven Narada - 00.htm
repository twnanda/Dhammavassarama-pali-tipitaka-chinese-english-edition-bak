      size=4>PREFACE</FONT></P></B>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=6>A</FONT>bhidhamma, 
      as the term implies, is the Higher Teaching of the Buddha. It expounds the 
      quintessence of His profound doctrine. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The Dhamma, embodied in the 
      Sutta Pitaka, is the conventional teaching <I>(vohara desana),</I> and the 
      Abhidhamma is the ultimate teaching <I>(paramattha desana)</I> </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">In the Abhidhamma both mind and 
      matter, which constitute this complex machinery of man, are 
      microscopically analyzed. Chief events connected with the process of birth 
      and death are explained in detail. Intricate points of the Dhamma are 
      clarified. The Path of Emancipation is set forth in clear terms. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Modern Psychology, limited as 
      it is comes within the scope of Abhidhamma inasmuch as it deals with the 
      mind, with thoughts, thought-processes, and mental states but it does not 
      admit of a psyche or a soul. Buddhism teaches a psychology without a 
      psyche. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">If one were to read the 
      Abhidhamma as a modern textbook on psychology, one would be disappointed. 
      No attempt has here been made to solve all the problems that confront a 
      modern psychologist. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Consciousness is defined. 
      Thoughts are analyzed and classified chiefly from an ethical standpoint. 
      All mental states are enumerated. The composition of each type of 
      consciousness is set forth in detail. The description of thought-processes 
      that arise through the five sense-doors and the mind-door is extremely 
      interesting. Such a clear exposition of thought-processes cannot be found 
      in any other psychological treatise. </FONT></P><I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Bhavanga</I> and <I>Javana</I> 
      thought-moments, which are explained only in the Abhidhamma, and which 
      have no parallel in modern psychology, are of special interest to a 
      research student in psychology. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">That consciousness flows like a 
      stream, a view propounded by some modern psychologists like William James, 
      becomes extremely clear to one who understands the Abhidhamma. It must be 
      added that an Abhidhamma student can fully comprehend the <I>Anatta</I> 
      (No-soul) doctrine, the crux of Buddhism, which is important both from a 
      philosophical and an ethical standpoint. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The advent of death, process of 
      rebirth in various planes without anything to pass from one life to 
      another, the evidently verifiable doctrine of Kamma and Rebirth are fully 
      explained. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Giving a wealth of details 
      about mind, Abhidhamma discusses the second factor of man-matter or 
      <I>rupa.</I> Fundamental units of matter, material forces, properties of 
      matter, source of matter, relationship of mind and matter, are described. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">In the Abhidhammattha Sangaha 
      there is a brief exposition of the Law of Dependent Origination, followed 
      by a descriptive account of the Causal Relations that finds no parallel in 
      any other philosophy. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">A physicist should not delve 
      into Abhidhamma to get a thorough knowledge of physics. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">It should be made clear that 
      Abhidhamma does not attempt to give a systematized knowledge of mind and 
      matter. It investigates these two composite factors of so-called being to 
      help the understanding of things as they truly are. A philosophy has been 
      developed on these lines. Based on that philosophy, an ethical system has 
      been evolved to realize the ultimate goal, Nibbana. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">As Mrs. Rhys Davids rightly 
      says, Abhidhamma deals with "(1) What we find (a) within us (b) around us 
      and of (2) what we aspire to find." </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">In Abhidhamma all irrelevant 
      problems that interest students and scholars, but having no relation to 
      one's Deliverance, are deliberately set aside. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The Abhidhammattha Sangaha, the 
      authorship of which is attributed to venerable Anuruddha Thera, an Indian 
      monk of Kanjevaram (Kañcipura), gives an epitome of the entire Abhidhamma 
      Pitaka. It is still the most fitting introduction to Abhidhamma. By 
      mastering this book, a general knowledge of Abhidhamma may easily be 
      acquired. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">To be a master of Abhidhamma 
      all the seven books, together with commentaries and sub-commentaries, have 
      to be read and re-read patiently and critically. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Abhidhamma is not a subject of 
      fleeting interest designed for the superficial reader. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">To the wise truth-seekers, 
      Abhidhamma is an indispensable guide and an intellectual treat. Here there 
      is food for thought to original thinkers and to earnest students who wish 
      to increase their wisdom and lead an ideal Buddhist life.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">However, to the superficial, 
      Abhidhamma must appear as dry as dust. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">It may be questioned, "Is 
      Abhidhamma absolutely essential to realize Nibbana, the summum bonum of 
      Buddhism, or even to comprehend things as they truly are?" </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Undoubtedly Abhidhamma is 
      extremely helpful to comprehend fully the word of the Buddha and realize 
      Nibbana, as it presents a key to open the door of reality. It deals with 
      realities and a practical way of noble living, based on the experience of 
      those who have understood and realized. Without a knowledge of the 
      Abhidhamma one at times' finds it difficult to understand the real 
      significance of some profound teachings of the Buddha. To develop Insight 
      <I>(vipassana) </I>Abhidhamma is certainly very useful. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">But one cannot positively 
      assert that Abhidhamma is absolutely necessary to gain one's Deliverance. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Understanding or realization is 
      purely personal <I>(sanditthika).</I> The four Noble Truths that form the 
      foundation of the Buddha's teaching are dependent on this one fathom body. 
      The Dhamma is not apart from oneself. Look within, Seek thyself. Lo, the 
      truth will unfold itself. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Did not sorrow-afflicted 
      Patacara, who lost her dear and near ones, realize Nibbana; reflecting on 
      the disappearance of water that washed her feet? </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Did not Culapanthaka, who could 
      not memorize a verse even for four months, attain Arahatship by 
      comprehending the impermanent nature of a clean handkerchief that he was 
      handling, gazing at the sun? </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Did not Upatissa, later 
      venerable Sariputta Thera, realize Nibbana, on hearing half a stanza 
      relating to cause and effect? </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">To some a fallen withered leaf 
      alone was sufficient to attain Pacceka Buddha hood.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">It was mindfulness on 
      respiration <I>(anapana-sati) </I>that acted as the basis for the 
      Bodhisatta to attain Buddha hood. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">To profound thinkers, a slight 
      indication is sufficient to discover great truths. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">According to some scholars, 
      Abhidhamma is not a teaching of the Buddha, but is a later elaboration of 
      scholastic monks. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Tradition, however, attributes 
      the nucleus of the Abhidhamma to the Buddha Himself. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Commentators state that the 
      Buddha, as a mark of gratitude to His mother who was born in a celestial 
      plane, preached the Abhidhamma to His mother Deva and others continuously 
      for three months. The principal topics <I>(matika)</I> of the advanced 
      teaching such as moral states<I> (kusala dhamma), </I>immoral states 
      <I>(akusala dhamma) </I>and indeterminate states <I>(abyakata dhamma), 
      </I>etc., were taught by the Buddha to venerable Sariputta Thera, who 
      subsequently elaborated them in the six books (Kathavatthu being excluded) 
      that comprise the Abhidhamma Pitaka. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Whoever the great author or 
      authors of the Abhidhamma may have been, it has to be admitted that he or 
      they had intellectual genius comparable only to that of the Buddha. This 
      is evident from the intricate and subtle Patthana Pakarana which minutely 
      describes the various causal relations. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">It is very difficult to suggest 
      an appropriate English equivalent for Abhidhamma. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">There are many technical terms, 
      too, in Abhidhamma which cannot be rendered into English so as to convey 
      their exact connotation. Some English equivalents such as consciousness, 
      will, volition, intellect, perception are used in a specific sense in 
      Western Philosophy. Readers should try to understand in what sense these 
      technical terms are employed in Abhidhamma. To avoid any misunderstanding, 
      due to preconceived views, Pali words, though at times cumbersome to those 
      not acquainted with the language, have judiciously been retained wherever 
      the English renderings seem to be inadequate. To convey the correct 
      meaning implied by the Pali terms, the etymology has been given in many 
      instances. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">At times Pali technical terms 
      have been used in preference to English renderings so that the reader may 
      be acquainted with them and not get confused with English terminology. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Sometimes readers will come 
      across unusual words such as corruption, defilement, volitional 
      activities, functional, resultants, and so forth, which are of great 
      significance from an Abhidhamma standpoint. Their exact meaning should be 
      clearly understood.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">In preparing this translation, 
      Buddhist Psychology by Mrs. Rhys Davids and the Compendium of Philosophy 
      (Abhidhammattha Sangaha) by Mr. Shwe Zan Aung proved extremely helpful to 
      me. Liberty has been taken to quote them wherever necessary with due 
      acknowledgment.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">My grateful thanks are due to 
      the Kandy Buddhist Publication Society for the printing of this fourth 
      revised volume, to the printers for expediting the printing, to Miss 
      Rañjani Goonatilaka for correcting the proofs, and to Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi 
      for his useful suggestions. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Above all I have to thank Mr.
