DESCRIPTION OF CONCENTRATION - TAKING A MEDITATION 
SUBJECT<BR><BR><I>(Kammatthana-gahana-niddesa)</I><BR></FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
size=+1>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; [84] Now concentration is described under the heading of 
'consciousness' in the phrase 'develops consciousness and understanding' 
(Ch.I,&sect;l). It should be developed by one who has taken his stand on virtue that 
has been purified by means of the special qualities of fewness of wishes, etc., 
and perfected by observance of the ascetic practices: But that concentration has 
been shown only very briefy and so it is not even easy to understand, much less 
to develop. There is therefore the following set of questions, the purpose of 
which is to show the method of its development in detail:<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; (i) What is concentration?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (ii) In what sense is 
it concentration?<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; (iii) What are its characteristic, function, 
manifestation, and proximate cause?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) How many kinds of 
concentration are there?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (v) What is its 
defilement?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (vi) What is its cleansing?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
(vii) How should it be developed?<BR>&nbsp; (viii) What are the benefits of the 
development of concentration?<BR>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are the 
answers:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) WHAT IS CONCENTRATION? Concentration is of many 
sorts and has various aspects. An answer that attempted to cover it all would 
accomplish neither its intention nor its purpose and would, besides, lead to 
distraction; so we shall confine ourselves to the kind intended here, calling 
concentration profitable unification of mind. {2}<BR>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) IN WHAT 
SENSE IS IT CONCENTRATION? It is concentration <I>(samadhi)</I> in the sense of 
concentrating <I>(samadhana).</I> What is this concentrating? It is the 
centering <I>(adhana)</I> of consciousness and consciousness-concomitants evenly 
<I>(samam)</I> and rightly <I>(samma)</I> on a single object; placing, is what 
is meant. [85] So it is the state, in virtue of which consciousness and its 
concomitants remain evenly and rightly on a single object undistracted and 
unscattered, that should be understood as concentrating.<BR>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) 
WHAT ARE ITS CHARACTERISTIC, FUNCTION, MANIFESTATION, AND PROXIMATE CAUSE? 
Concentration has non-distraction as its characteristic. {3} Its function is to 
eliminate distraction. It is manifested as non-wavering. Because of the words 
'Being blissful, his mind becomes concentrated' (D.i,73) its proximate cause is 
bliss.<BR>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) HOW MANY KINDS OF CONCENTRATION ARE 
THERE?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) First of all it is of one kind, with the 
characteristic of non-distraction. (2) Then it is of two kinds as access and 
absorption; {4} (3) likewise as mundane and supramundane, {5} (4) as with 
happiness and without happiness, and (5) as accompanied by bliss and accompanied 
by equanimity. {6} It is of three kinds (6) as inferior, medium and superior; 
likewise (7) as with applied thought and sustained thought, etc., (8) as 
accompanied by happiness, etc., and (9) as limited, exalted, and measureless. It 
is of four kinds (l0) as of difficult progress and sluggish direct-knowledge, 
etc.; likewise (11) as limited with limited object, etc., (12) according to the 
factors of the four jhanas, (13) as partaking of diminution, etc., (14) as of 
the sense sphere; etc., and (15) as predominance and so on. (16) It is of five 
kinds according to the factors of the five jhanas reckoned by the five-fold 
method.<BR>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Herein, the section dealing with that of one kind 
is evident in meaning. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. In the section dealing with that of 
two kinds, <I>access</I> concentration is the unification of mind obtained by 
the following, that is to say, the six Recollections, Mindfulness of death, the 
Recollection of Peace, the Perception of Repulsiveness in Nutriment, and the 
Defining of the Four Elements, and it is the unification that precedes 
absorption concentration. <I>Absorption</I> concentration is the unification 
that follows immediately upon the preliminary-work (Ch.IV,&sect;74) because of the 
words 'The first-jhana preliminary-work is a condition, 'as proximity condition, 
for the first jhana' (Ptn2.350, Siamese ed.). So it is of two kinds as access 
and absorption.<BR>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. In the second dyad <I>mundane</I> 
concentration is profitable unification of mind in the three planes. 
<I>Supramundane</I> concentration is the unification associated with the noble 
paths, so it is of two kinds as mundane and supramundane.<BR>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. 
In the third dyad concentration <I>with happiness</I> is the unification of mind 
in two jhanas in the fourfold reckoning and in three jhanas in the fivefold 
reckoning. [86] Concentration <I>without happiness</I> is the unification in the 
remaining two jhanas. But access concentration may be with happiness or without 
happiness. So it is of two kinds as with happiness and without happiness. 
<BR>9.&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. In the fourth dyad concentration <I>accompanied by 
bliss</I> is the unification in three jhanas in the fourfold and four in the 
fivefold reckoning. That <I>accompanied by equanimity</I> is that in the 
remaining jhana. Access concentration may be accompanied by bliss or accompanied 
by equanimity. So it is of two kinds as accompanied by bliss and accompanied by 
equanimity. <BR>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. In the first of the triads what has only just 
been acquired is <I>inferior.</I> What is not very well developed is 
<I>medium.</I> What is well developed and has reached mastery is 
<I>superior.</I> So it is of three kinds as inferior, medium, and 
superior.<BR>11.&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. In the second triad that <I>with applied thought 
and sustained thought</I> is the concentration of the first jhana together with 
access concentration. That <I>without applied thought,</I> with <I>sustained 
thought only</I> is the concentration of the second jhana in the fivefold 
reckoning. For when a man sees danger only in applied thought and not in 
sustained thought, he aspires only to abandon applied thought when he passes 
beyond the first jhana, and so he obtains concentration without applied thought 
and with sustained thought only. This is said with reference to him. 
Concentration <I>without applied thought and sustained thought</I> is the 
unification in the three jhanas beginning with the second in the fourfold 
reckoning and with the third in the fivefold reckoning (See D.iii,219). So it is 
of three kinds as with applied thought and sustained thought, and so 
on.<BR>12.&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. In the third triad concentration <I>accompanied by 
happiness</I> is the unification in the two first jhanas in the fourfold 
reckoning and in the three first jhanas in the fivefold reckoning. Concentration 
<I>accompanied by bliss</I> is the unification in those same jhanas and in the 
third and the fourth respectively in the two reckonings. That <I>Accompanied by 
equanimity</I> is that in the remaining jhana. Access concentration may be 
accompanied by bliss and happiness or accompanied by equanimity. So it is of 
three kinds as accompanied by happiness, and so on.<BR>13.&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. In the 
fourth triad <I>limited</I> concentration is unification on the plane of access. 
<I>Exalted </I>concentration is unification in profitable [consciousness, etc.,] 
of the fine-material sphere and imaterial sphere. <I>Measureless</I> 
concentration is unification associated with the noble paths. So it is of three 
kinds as limited, exalted, and measureless.<BR>14.&nbsp;&nbsp; 10. In the first 
of the tetrads there is concentration of <I>difficult progress and sluggish 
direct-knowledge.</I> There is that of difficult progress and swift 
direct-knowledge. There is that of easy progress and sluggish direct-knowledge. 
And there is that of easy progress and swift 
direct-knowledge.<BR>15.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, the development of concentration 
that occurs from the time of the first conscious reaction up to the arising of 
the access of a given jhana is called <I>progress.</I> And the understanding 
that occurs from the time of access until absorption is called 
<I>direct-knowledge.</I> That progress is difficult for some, being troublesome 
owing to the tenacious resistance of the inimical states beginning with the 
hindrances. The meaning is that it is cultivated without ease. [87] It is easy 
for others because of the absence of those difficulties. Also the 
direct-knowledge is sluggish in some and occurs slowly, not quickly. In others 
it is swift and occurs rapidly, not slowly.<BR>16.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, we shall 
comment below upon the suitable and unsuitable (Ch.IV,&sect;35f.), the preparatory 
tasks consisting in the severing of impediments (Ch.IV,&sect;20), etc., and skill in 
absorption (Ch.IV,&sect;42). When a man cultivates what is unsuitable, his progress 
is difficult and his direct-knowledge sluggish. When he cultivates what is 
suitable, his progress is easy and his direct-knowledge swift. But if he 
cultivates the unsuitable in the earlier stage (and the suitable in the later 
stage, or if he cultivates the suitable in the earlier stage and the unsuitable 
in the later stage, then it should be understood as mixed in his case. Likewise 
if he devotes himself to development without carrying out the preparatory tasks 
of severing impediments, etc., his progress is difficult. It is easy in the 
opposite case. And if he is not accomplished in skill in absorption, his 
direct-knowledge is sluggish. It is swift if he is so 
accomplished.<BR>17.&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, they should be understood as classed 
according to craving and ignorance, and according to whether one has had 
practice in serenity and insight. {7} For if a man is overwhelmed by craving, 
his progress is difficult. If not, it is easy. And if he is overwhelmed by 
ignorance, his direct-knowledge is sluggish. If not, it is swift. And if he has 
had no practice in serenity, his progress is difficult. If he has, it is easy. 
And if he has had no practice in insight, his direct-knowledge is sluggish. If 
he has, it is swift.<BR>18.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also they should be understood as 
classed according to defilements and faculties. For if a man's defilements are 
sharp and his faculties dull, then his progress is difficult and his 
direct-knowledge sluggish; but if his faculties are keen, his direct-knowledge 
is swift. And if his defilements are blunt and his faculties dull, then his 
progress is easy and his direct-knowledge sluggish; but if his faculties are 
keen, his direct-knowledge is swift.<BR>19.&nbsp;&nbsp; So as regards this 
progress and this direct-knowledge, when a person reaches concentration with 
difficult progress and sluggish direct-knowledge, his concentration is called 
<I>concentration of difficult progress and sluggish direct-knowledge.</I> 
Similarly in the cases of the remainipg three. So it is of four kinds as of 
difficult progress and sluggish direct-knowledge, and so on.<BR>20.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
11. In the second tetrad there is limited concentration with a limited object, 
there is limited with a measureless object, there is measureless with a limited 
object, and there is measureless with a measureless object. Herein, 
concentration that is unfamiliar and incapable of being a condition for a higher 
jhana [88] is <I>limited.</I> When it occurs with an unextended object 
(Ch.IV,&sect;126), it is <I>with a limited object.</I> When it is familiar, well 
developed and capable of being a condition for a higher jhana, it is 
<I>measureless.</I> And when it occurs with an extended object, it is <I>with a 
measureless object.</I> The mixed method can be understood as the mixture of the 
characteristics already stated. So it is of four kinds as limited with limited 
object, and so on.<BR>21.&nbsp;&nbsp; 12. In the third tetrad the first jhana 
has five factors, that is to say, applied thought, sustained thought, happiness, 
bliss, and concentration, following suppression of the hindrances. The second 
has the three factors remaining after the elimination of applied and sustained 
thought. The third has two factors with the fading away of happiness. The 
fourth, where bliss is abandoned, has two factors with concentration and the 
equanimous feeling that accompanies it. Thus there are four kinds of 
concentration according to the factors of these four jhanas. So it is of four 
kinds according to the factors of the four jhanas.<BR>22.&nbsp;&nbsp; 13. In the 
fourth tetrad there is concentration partaking of diminution, there is 
concentration partaking of stagnation, there is concentration partaking of 
distinction, and there is concentration partaking of penetration. Herein, it 
should be understood that the state of <I>partaking of diminution</I> is 
accessibility to opposition, the state of <I>partaking of stagnation (thiti)</I> 
is stationariness <I>(santhana)</I> of the mindfulness that is in conformity 
with that [concentration], the state of <I>partaking of distinction</I> is the 
attaining of higher distinction, and the state of <I>partaking of 
penetration</I> is accessibility to perception and attention accompanied by 
dispassion, according as it is said 'When a man has attained the first jhana and 
he is accessible to perception and attention accompanied by sense desire, then 
his understanding partakes of diminution. When his mindfulness that is in 
conformity with that stagnates, then his understanding partakes of stagnation. 
When he is accessible to perception and attention unaccompanied by applied 
thought, then his understanding partakes of distinction. When he is accessible 
to perception and attention accompanied by dispassion and directed to fading 
away, then his understanding partakes of penetration' (Vbh.330). The kinds of 
concentration associated with that [fourfold] understanding are also four in 
number. So it is of four kinds as partaking of diminution, and so on. 
<BR>23.&nbsp;&nbsp; 14. In the fifth tetrad there are the following four kinds 
of concentration, that is to say, sense-sphere concentration, 
fine-material-sphere concentration, immaterial-sphere concentration; and 
unincluded, [that is, path,] concentration.<BR>Herein, <I>sense sphere 
concentration</I> is all kinds of access unification. Likewise the other three 
are respectively profitable unification of mind associated with fine-material, 
[immaterial, and path, jhana.] So it is of four kinds as of the sense-sphere, 
and so on.<BR>24.&nbsp;&nbsp; 15. In the sixth tetrad 'If a bhikkhu obtains 
concentration, obtains unification of mind, by making zeal (desire) predominant, 
[89] this is called concentration due to zeal. If ... by making energy 
predominant, ... If ... by making [natural.purity of] consciousness 
predominant,... If ... by making inquiry predominant, this is called 
concentration due to inquiry' (Vbh.216-9). So it is of four kinds as 
predominance.<BR>25.&nbsp;&nbsp; 16. In the pentad there are five jhanas by 
dividing in two what is called the second jhana in the fourfold reckoning (see 
&sect;21), taking the second jhana to be due to the surmounting of only applied 
thought and the third jhana to be due to the surmounting of both applied and 
sustained thought. There are five kinds of concentration according to the 
factors of these five jhanas. So its fivefoldness should be understood according 
to the five sets of jhana factors.<BR>26.&nbsp;&nbsp; (v) WHAT IS ITS DEFILEMENT 
(vi) WHAT IS ITS CLEANSING? Here the answer is given in the Vibhanga: 
'defilement is the state partaking of diminution, cleansing is the state 
partaking of distinction' (Vbh.343). Herein, the state partaking of diminution 
should be understood in this way: 'When a man has attained the first jhana and 
he is accessible to perception and attention accompanied by sense desire, then 
his understanding partakes of diminution' (Vbh.330). And the state partaking of 
distinction should be understood in this way: "When he is accessible to 
perception and attention unaccompanied by applied thought, then his 
understanding partakes of distinction' (Vbh.330).<BR><BR>27.&nbsp;&nbsp; (viii) 
HOW SHOULD IT BE DEVELOPED?<BR><BR><I>[A. Development in Brief]</I><BR><BR>The 
method of developing the kind of concentration associated with the noble paths 
mentioned (&sect;7) under that 'of two kinds as mundane and supramundane' etc., is 
included in the method of developing understanding (Ch.XXII); for in developing 
[path] understanding that is developed too. So we shall say nothing separately 
[here] about how that is to be developed.<BR>28.&nbsp;&nbsp; But mundane 
concentration should be developed by one who has taken his stand on virtue that 
is quite purified in the way already stated. He should sever any of the ten 
impediments that he may have. He should then appproach the Good friend, the 
giver of a meditation subject, and he should apprehend from among the forty 
meditation subjects one that suits his own temperament. After that he should 
avoid a monastery unfavourable to the development of concentration and go to 
live in one that is favourable. Then he should sever the lesser impediments and 
not overlook any of the directions for development. This is in 
brief.<BR><BR><I>[B. Development in Detail]</I><BR><BR>29.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
detail is this:<BR><BR><I>[The Ten Impediments]</I><BR><BR>Firstly it was said 
above, <I>he should sever any of the ten impediments that he may have.</I> [90] 
Now the 'ten impediments' are: <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
dwelling, family, and gain,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A class, and 
building too as fifth,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And travel, kin, 
affliction, books,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And supernatural 
powers: ten.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, the dwelling itself is the 'impediment due 
to the dwelling'. So too, with the family and so on.<BR>30.&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. 
Herein, a single inner room or a single hut or a whole monastery for the 
Community is called a <I>dwelling.</I> This is not an impediment for everyone. 
It is an impediment only for anyone whose mind is exercised about the building, 
etc., that goes on there, or who has many belongings stored there, or whose mind 
is caught up by some business connected with it. For any other it is not an 
impediment.<BR>31.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is a relevant story. Two clansmen left 
Anuradhapura, it seems, and eventually went forth at the Thuparama. {8} One of 
them made himself familiar with the Two Codes, {9} and when he had acquired five 
years seniority, he took part in the Pavarana {l0} and then left for the place 
called, Pacinakhandaraji. {ll} The other stayed on where he was. Now when the 
one who had gone to Pacinakhandaraji had lived there a long time and had become 
an elder, {12} he thought 'This place is good for retreat; suppose I told my 
friend about it?'. So he set out, and in due course he entered the Thuparama. As 
he entered, the Elder of the same seniority saw him, went to meet him, took his 
bowl and robe and did the duties.<BR>32.&nbsp;&nbsp; The visiting Elder went 
into his lodging. He thought 'Now my friend will be sending me ghee or molasses 
or a drink; for he has lived long in this city'. He got nothing that night, and 
in the morning he thought 'Now he will be sending me rice gruel and solid food 
sent by his supporters'. When he saw none, he thought 'There is no one to bring 
it. No doubt they will give it when we go into the town'. Early in the morning 
they went into the town together. When they had wandered through one street and 
had got only a ladleful of gruel, they sat down in a sitting hall to drink it. 
{13}<BR>33.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the visitor thought 'Perhaps there is no individual 
giving of gruel. But as soon as it is the time for the meal people will give 
special food'. But when it was time for the meal, they ate what they had got by 
wandering for alms. Then the visitor said 'Venerable sir, how is this? Do you 
live in this way all the time?' - 'Yes, friend.' - 'Venerable sir, 
Pacinakhadaraji is comfortable; let us go there.' Now as the Elder came out from 
the city [91] by the southern gate he took the Kumbhakaragama road [which leads 
to Pacinakhandaraji]. The visitor asked 'But, venerable sir, why do you take 
this road ?' - 'Did you not recommend Pacinakhandaraji, friend?' - 'But how is 
this, venerable sir, have you no extra belongings in the place you have lived in 
for so long?' - 'That is so, friend. The bed and chair belong to the Community, 
and they are put away [as usual]. There is nothing else'. - 'But, venerable sir, 
I have left my staff and my oil tube and my sandal bag there.' - 'Have you 
already collected so much, friend, living there for just one day?' - 'Yes, 
venerable sir.' <BR>34.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was glad in his heart, and he paid homage 
to the Elder: 'For those like you, venerable sir, everywhere is a forest 
dwelling. The Thuparama is a place where the relics of four Buddhas are 
deposited; there is suitable hearing of the Dhamma in the Brazen Palace; there 
is the Great Shrine to be seen; and one can visit Elders. It is like the time of 
the Buddha. It is here that you should live'. On the following day he took his 
bowl and [outer] robe and went away by himself. It is no impediment for one like 
that.<BR>35.&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. <I>Family</I> means a family consisting of relatives 
or of supporters. For even a family consisting of supporters is an impediment 
for someone who lives in close association with it in the way beginning 'He is 
pleased when they are pleased' (S.iii,11), and who does not even go to a 
neighbouring monastery to hear the Dhamma without members of the family. But 
even mother and father are not an impediment for another, <BR>36. as in the case 
of the young bhikkhu, the nephew of the Elder who lived at the Korandaka 
Monastery. He went to Rohana for instruction, it seems. The Elder's sister who 
was a lay devotee was always asking the Elder how her son was getting on. One 
day the Elder set out for Rohana to fetch him back.<BR>37.&nbsp;&nbsp; The young 
bhikkhu too thought 'I have lived here for a long time. Now I might go and visit 
my Preceptor and find out how the lay devotee is', and he left Rohana. The two 
met on the banks of the [Mahaveli] River. He did the duties to the ELder at the 
foot of a tree. When asked 'Where are you going?', he told him his purpose. The 
Elder said 'You have done well. The lay devotee is always asking after you. That 
was why I came. You may go, but I shall stay here for the Rains', and he 
dismissed him. [92] He arrived at the monastery on the actual day for taking up 
residence for the Rains. The lodging alloted to him happened to be the one for 
which his father had undertaken responsibility.<BR>38.&nbsp;&nbsp; His father 
came on the following day and asked 'To whom was our lodging allotted, venerable 
sirs?'. When he heard that it had fallen to a young visitor, he went to him. 
After paying homage to him, he said 'Venerable sir, there is an obligation for 
him who has taken up residence for the Rains in our lodging'. - 'What is it, lay 
follower?' - 'It is to take alms food only in our house for the three months, 
and to let us know the time of departure after the Pavarana ceremony. He 
consented in silence. The lay devotee went home and told his wife 'There is a 
visiting lord who has taken up residence for the Rains in our lodging. He must 
be carefully looked after', and she agreed. She prepared good food of various 
kinds for him. {l4} Though the youth went to his relatives' home at the time of 
the meal, no one recognized him.<BR>39.&nbsp;&nbsp; When he had eaten alms food 
there during the three months and had completed the residence for the Rains, he 
announced his departure. Then his relatives said 'Let it be tomorrow, venerable 
sir', and on the following day, when they had fed him in their house and filled 
his oil tube and given him a lump of sugar and a nine-cubit length of cloth, 
they said 'Now you are leaving venerable sir'. He gave his blessing and set out 
for Rohana.<BR>40.&nbsp;&nbsp; His preceptor had completed the <I>Pavarana</I> 
ceremony and was on his way back. They met at the same place as before. He did 
the duties to the Elder at the foot of a tree. The Elder asked him 'How was it, 
my dear, did you see the good woman lay devotee?' He replied 'Yes, venerable 
sir', and he told him all that had happened. He then anointed the Elder's feet 
with the oil, made him a drink with the sugar and presented him with the length 
of cloth. He then, after paying homage to the Elder, told him 'Venerable,sir, 
only Rohana suits me', and he departed. The Elder too arrived back at his 
monastery, and next day he went into the village of 
Korandaka.<BR>41.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lay devotee, his sister, had always kept 
looking down the road, thinking 'My brother is now coming with my son'. When he 
saw him coming alone, she thought 'My son must be dead; that is why the elder is 
coming alone', and she fell at the Elder's feet, lamenting and weeping. 
Suspecting that it must have been out of fewness of 'Wishes that the youth had 
gone away without announcing himself, [93] the Elder comforted her; and told her 
all that had happened, and he took the length of cloth out of his bag and showed 
it to her.<BR>42.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was appeased. She prostrated herself in the 
direction taken by her son and she said 'Surely the Blessed One taught the way 
of the Rathavinita, the way of the Nalaka, the way of the Tuvataka, and the way 
of the Great Noble Ones' Heritages {15} showing contentment with the four 
requisites and delight in development, making a bhikkhu such as my son a 
body-witness. So, although for three months he ate in the house of the mother 
who bore him, yet he never said "I am your son, you are my mother"! Oh admirable 
man'!. Even mother and father are no impediment for one such as him, so how much 
less any other family that supports him.<BR>43.&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. <I>Gain</I> is 
the four requisites. How are they an impediment? Wherever a meritorious bhikkhu 
goes people give him a large supply of requisites. With giving blessings to them 
and teaching them the Dhamma he gets no chance to do the ascetic's duties. From 
sunrise till the first watch of the night he never breakes his association with 
people. Again even at dawn alm-food eaters fond of opulence come and say 
'Venerable sir, such and such a man lay follower, woman lay follower, friend, 
friend's daughter, wants to see you', and being ready to go, he replies 'Take 
the bowl and robe, friend'. So he is always on the alert. Thus these requisites 
are an impediment for him. He should leave his group and wander by himself where 
he is not known. This is the way his impediment is severed.<BR>44.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
4. <I>Class</I> is a class (group) of students of Suttas or students of 
Abhidhamma. If with the group's instuction and questioning he gets no 
opportunity for the ascetic's duties, then that group is an impediment for him. 
He should sever that impediment in this way: if those bhikkhus have already 
acquired the main part and little still remains, he should finish that off and 
then go to the forest. If they have only acquired little and much still remains, 
[94] he should, without travelling more than a league, approach another 
instructof of a class within the radius of a league and say 'Help those 
venerable ones with instruction, etc.' If he does not find anyone in this way, 
he should take leave of the class, saying 'I have a task to see to, friends; go 
where it suits you!', and he should do his own work.<BR>45&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. 
<I>Building (kamma)</I> is new building work <I>(nava-kamma).</I> Since one 
engaged in this must know about what [material] has and has not been got by 
carpenters, etc., and must see about what has and has not been done, it is 
always an impediment. It should be severed in this way. If little remains, it 
should be completed. If much remains, it should be handed over to the Community 
or to bhikkhus who are entrusted with the Community's affairs, if it is a new 
building for the Community; or if it is for himself, it should be handed over to 
those whom he entrusts with his own affairs, but if these are not available, he 
should relinquish it to the Community and depart.<BR>46.&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. 
<I>Travel</I> is going on a journey. I f someone is expected to give the Going 
Forth somewhere else, or if some requisite is obtainable there, and he cannot 
rest content without getting it [that will be an impediment; for] even if he 
goes into the forest to do the ascetic's duties, he will find it hard to get rid 
of thoughts about the journey. So one in this position should apply himself to 
the ascetic's duties after he has done the journey and transacted the 
business.<BR>47.&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. <I>Kin</I> in the case of the monastery means 
Teacher, Preceptor, co-resident, pupil, those with the same Preceptor, as 
oneself, and those with the same Teacher as oneself; and in the case of the 
house, it means mother, father, brother, and so on. When they are sick they are 
an impediment for him. Therefore that impediment should be severed by curing 
them with nursing.<BR>48.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, when the preceptor is sick he must 
be cared for as long as life lasts if the sickness does not soon depart. 
Likewise the Teacher at the Going Forth, the Teacher at the Admission, the 
co-resident, the pupils to whom one has given the Admission and the Going Forth, 
and those who have the same Preceptor. But the teacher from whom one takes the 
Dependence, the teacher who gives one instruction, the pupil to whom one has 
given the Dependence, the pupil to whom one is giving instruction, and those who 
have that same teacher as oneself, should be looked after as long as the 
Dependence or the instruction has not been terminated. If one is able to do so, 
one should look after them even beyond that [period].<BR>49.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mother 
and father should be treated like the Preceptor. If they live within the kingdom 
and look to their son for help, it should be given. [95] Also if they have no 
medicine, he should give them his own. If he has none, he should go in search of 
it as alms and give that. But in the case of brothers or sisters, one should 
only give them what is theirs. If they have none, then one should give one's own 
temporarily and later get it back; but one should not complain if one does not 
get it back. It is not allowed either to make medicine for or to give it to a 
sister's hushand who is not related by blood; but one can give it to one's 
sister, saying 'Give it to your husband'. The same applies to one's brother's 
wife. But it is allowed to make it for their children since thev are blood 
relatives.<BR>50.&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. <I>Affliction</I> is any kind of illness. It is 
an impediment when it is actually afflicting; therefore it should be severed by 
treatment with medicine. But if it is not cured after taking medicine for a few 
days, then the ascetic's duties should be done after apostrophizing one's person 
in this way 'I am not your slave, or your hireling. I have come to suffering 
through maintaining you through the beginningless round of 
rebirths'.<BR>51.&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. <I>Books</I> means responsibility for the 
scriptures. That is an impediment only for one who is constantly busy with 
recitations, etc., but not for others. Here are relevant stories. The Elder 
Revata, it seems, the Majjhima reciter, went to the Elder Revata, the dweller in 
Malaya (the Hill Country), and asked him for a meditation subject. The Elder 
asked him 'How are you in the scriptures, friend?' - 'I am studying the Majjhima 
[Nikaya], venerable sir.' - 'The Majjhima is a hard responsibility, friend. When 
a man is still learning the First Fifty by heart, he is faced with the Middle 
Fifty; and when he is still learning that by heart, he is faced with the Last 
Fifty. How can you take up a meditation subject?' - 'Venerable sir, when I have 
taken a meditation subject from you, I shall not look at the scriptures again.' 
He took the meditation subject, and doing no recitation for nineteen years, he 
reached Arahantship in the twentieth year. He told bhikkhus who came for 
recitation 'I have not looked at the scriptures for twenty years, friends, [96] 
yet I am familiar with them. You may begin'. And from beginning to end he had no 
hesitation ever over a single syllable.<BR>52.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Elder Maha-Naga, 
too, who lived at Karuliyagiri (Karaliyagiri) put aside the scriptures for 
eighteen years, and then he recited the Dhatukatha to the bhikkhus. When they 
checked this with the town-dwelling elders [of Anuradhapura], not a single 
question was found out of its order.<BR>53.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Great Monastery 
too the Elder Tipitaka-Cula-Abhaya had the golden drum struck, saying 'I shall 
expound the three Pitakas in the circle of [experts in] the Five Collections of 
discourses', and this was before he had learnt the commentaries. The community 
of Bhikkhus said 'Which teachers' teaching is it? Unless you give only the 
teaching of our own teachers we shall not let you speak'. Also his Preceptor 
asked him when he went to wait on him 'Did you have the drum beaten, friend ?'. 
- 'Yes, venerable sir' - 'For what reason?' - 'I shall expound the scriptures, 
venerable sir.' - 'Friend Abhaya, how do the teachers explain this passage?' - 
'They explain it in this way, venerable sir.' The Elder dissented, saying 'Hum'. 
Again three times, each time in a different way, he said 'They explain it in 
this way, venerable sir'. The elder always dissented, saying 'Hum'. Then he said 
'Friend, your first explanation was the way of the teachers. But it is because 
you have not actually learnt it from the teachers' lips that you are unable to 
maintain that the teachers say such and such. Go and learn it from our own 
teachers'. - 'Where shall I go, venerable sir?' - 'There is an Elder named 
Maha-Dhammarakkhita living in the Tuladharapabbata Monastery in the Rohana 
country beyond the [Mahiveli] River. He knows all the scriptures. Go to him'. 
Saying 'Good, venerable sir', he paid homage to the Elder. He went with five 
hundred bhikkhus to the Elder Maha-Dhammarakkhita, and when he had paid homage 
to him, he sat down. The Elder asked "Why have you come?'. -'To hear the Dhamma, 
venerable sir.' - 'Friend Abhaya, they ask me about the Digha and the Majjhima 
from time to time, but I have not looked at the others for thirty years. Still 
you may repeat them in my presence by night, and I shall explain them to<BR>you 
by day.' He said 'Good, venerable sir', and he acted accordingly. 
<BR>54.&nbsp;&nbsp; The inhabitants of the village had a large pavilion built at 
the door of his dwelling, and they came daily to hear the Dhamma. Explaining by 
day what had been repeated by night, [97] the Elder [Dhammarakkhita] eventually 
completed the instruction. Then he sat down on a mat on the ground before the 
Elder Abhaya and said 'Friend, explain a meditation subject to me'. - 'What are 
you saying, venerable sir, have I not heard it all from you? What can I explain 
to you that you do not already know?' The senior Elder said 'This path is 
<BR>55. different for one who has actually travelled by it'. The Elder Abhaya 
was then, it seems, a Stream Enterer.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Elder Abhaya had 
given his teacher a meditation subject, he returned to Anuradhapura. Later, 
while he was expounding the Dhamma in the Brazen Palace, he heard that the Elder 
had attained nibbana. On hearing this, he said 'Bring me [my] robe, friends'. 
Then he put on the robe and said 'The Arahant path befits our teacher, friends. 
Our teacher was a true thoroughbred. He sat down on a mat before his own Dhamma 
pupil and said, "Explain a meditation subject to me". The Arahant path befits 
our teacher, friends'.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; For such as these books are no 
impediment.<BR>56.&nbsp;&nbsp; 10. <I>Supernormal powers</I> are the supernormal 
powers of the ordinary man. They are hard to maintain, like a prone infant or 
like a baby hare, and the slightest thing breaks them. But they are an 
impediment for insight, not for concentration, since they are obtainable through 
concentration. So the supernormal powers are an impediment that should be 
severed by one who seeks insight: the others are impediments to be severed by 
one who seeks concentration.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This in the first place is the 
detailed explanation of the impediments.<BR>57.&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Approach the Good 
Friend, the giver of a meditation subject</I> (&sect;28): meditation subjects are of 
two kinds, that is, generally useful meditation subjects, and special meditation 
subjects.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, lovingkindness towards the Community of 
Bhikkhus etc., and also mindfulness of death are what are called generally 
useful meditation subjects. Some say perception of foulness, 
too.<BR>58.&nbsp;&nbsp; When a bhikkhu takes up a meditation subject, he should 
first develop lovingkindness towards the Community of Bhikkhus within the 
boundary, {16} limiting it at first [to 'all bhikkhus in this monastery'], in 
this way: 'May they be happy <BR>and free from affliction'. Then he should 
develop it towards all deities within the boundary. Then towards all the 
principal people in the village that is his alms resort; then to [all human 
beings there and to] all living beings dependent on the human beings. With 
lovingkindness towards the Community of Bhikkhus he produces kindliness in his 
co-residents; then they are easy for him to live with. With lovingkindness 
towards the deities within the boundary he is protected by kindly deities with 
lawful protection. [98] With lovingkindness towards the principal people in the 
village that is his alms resort his requisites are protected by well-disposed 
principal people with lawful protection. With lovingkindness to all human beings 
there he goes about without incurring their dislike since they trust him. With 
lovingkindness to all living beings he can wander unhindered 
everywhere.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; With mindfulness of death, thinking 'I have got to 
die', he gives up improper search (see S.ii,194; MA.i,115), and with a growing 
sense of urgency he comes to live without attachment. When his mind is familiar 
with the perception of foulness, then even divine objects do not tempt his mind 
to greed.<BR>59.&nbsp;&nbsp; So these are called generally useful and they are 
called meditation subjects since they are needed {17} generally and desirable 
owing to their great helpfulness and since they are subjects for the meditation 
work intended. <BR>60.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is called a 'special meditation subject' 
is that one from among the forty meditation subjects that is suitable to a man's 
own temperament. It is 'special <I>(parihariya)'</I> because he must carry it 
<I>(pariharitabbatta)</I> constantly about with him, and because it is the 
proximate cause for each higher stage of development.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; So it is 
the one who gives this twofold meditation subject that is called <I>the giver of 
meditation subject.</I><BR>61.&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>The Good Friend</I> is one who 
possesses such special qualities as 
these:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He is revered and dearly 
loved,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one who speaks and suffers 
speech;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The speech he utters is 
profound, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He does not urge without a 
reason' (A.iv,32), and soon.<BR>He is wholly solicitous of welfare and partial 
to progress.<BR>62.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the words beginning 'Ananda, it is 
owing to my being a good friend to them that living beings subject to birth are 
freed from birth' (S.i,88) it is only the Fully Enlightened One who possesses 
all the aspects of the Good Friend. Since that is so, while he is available only 
a meditation subject taken in the Blessed One's presence is well taken. But 
after his final attainment of nibbana, it is proper to take it from anyone of 
the eighty great disciples still living. When they are no more available, one 
who wants to take a particular meditation subject should take it from someone 
with cankers destroyed, who has, by means of that particular meditation subject, 
produced the fourfold and fivefold jhana, and has reached the destruction of 
cankers by augmenting insight that had that jhana as its proximate 
cause.<BR>63.&nbsp;&nbsp; But how then, does someone with cankers destroyed 
declare himself thus: 'I am one whose cankers are destroyed'? Why not? He 
declares himself when he knows that his instructions will be carried out. Did 
not the Elder Assagutta [99] spread out his leather mat in the air and sitting 
cross-legged on it explain a meditation subject to a bhikkhu who was starting 
his meditation subject, because he knew that that bhikkhu was one who would 
carry out his instructions for the meditation subject?<BR>64.&nbsp;&nbsp; So if 
someone with cankers destroyed is available, that is good. If not, then one 
should take it from a Non-returner, a Once-returner, a Stream Enterer, an 
ordinary man who has obtained jhana, one who knows three Pitakas, one who knows 
two Pitakas, one who knows one Pitaka, in descending order [according as 
available]. If not even one who knows one Pitaka is available, then it should be 
taken from one who is familiar with one Collection together with its commentary, 
and one who is himself conscientious. For a teacher such as this who knows the 
texts guards the heritage, and protects the tradition, will follow the teachers' 
opinion rather than his own. Hence the Ancient Elders said three times 'One who 
is conscientious will guard it'.<BR>65.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now those beginning with one 
whose cankers are destroyed mentioned above will describe only the path they 
have themselves reached. But with a learned man, his instructions and his 
answers to questions are purified by his having approachcd such and such 
teachers, and so he will explain a meditation subject showing a broad track, 
like a big elephant going through a stretch of jungle, and he will select suttas 
and reasons from here and there, adding [explanations of] what is suitable and 
unsuitable. So a meditation subject should be taken by approaching the Good 
Friend such as this, the giver of a meditation subject, and by doing all the 
duties to him.<BR>66.&nbsp;&nbsp; If he is available in the same monastery, it 
is good. If not, one should go to where he lives.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; When [a 
bhikkhu] goes to him, he should not do so with feet washed and anointed, wearing 
sandals, with an umbrella, surrounded by pupils, and bringing oil tube, honey, 
molasses, etc.; he should do so fulfilling the duties of a bhikkhu setting out 
on a journey, carrying his bowl and robes himself, doing all the duties in each 
monastery on the way, with few belongings, and living in the greatest 
effacement. When entering that monastery, he should do so [expecting nothing, 
and even provided] with a tooth-stick that he has had made allowable on the way 
[according to the rules]. And he should not enter some other room, thinking 'I 
shall go to the teacher after resting awhile and after washing and annointing my 
feet, and so on'.<BR>67.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why? If there are bhikkhus there who are 
hostile to the teacher, they might ask him the reason for his coming and speak 
dispraise of the teacher, saying 'You are done for if you go to him'; [100] they 
might make him regret his coming and turn him back. So he should ask for the 
teacher's dwelling and go straight there.<BR>68.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the teacher is 
junior, he should not consent to the teacher's receiving his bowl and robe, and 
so on. If the teacher is senior, then he should go and pay homage to him and 
remain standing. When told 'Put down the bowl and robe, friend', he may put them 
down. When told 'Have some water to drink', he can drink if he wants to. When 
told 'You may wash your feet', he should not do so at once, for if the water has 
been brought by the teacher himself, it would be improper. But when told 'Wash, 
friend, it was not brought by me, it was brought by others', then he can wash 
his feet, sitting in a screened place out of sight of the teacher, or in the 
open to one side of the dwelling.<BR>69.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the teacher brings an 
oil tube, he should get up and take it carefully with both hands. If he did not 
take it, it might make the teacher wonder 'Does this bhikkhu resent sharing so 
soon?'; but having taken it, he should not anoint his feet at once. For if it 
were oil for anointing the teacher's limbs, it would not be proper. So he should 
first anoint his head, then his shoulders, etc.; but when told 'This is meant 
for all the limbs, friend, anoint your feet', he should put a little on his head 
and then anoint his feet. Then he should give it back, saying when the teacher 
takes it 'May I return this oil tube, venerable sir?'.<BR>70.&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
should not say 'Explain a meditation subject to me, venerable sir' on the very 
day he arrives. But starting from the next day, he can, if the teacher has a 
habitual attendant, ask his permission to do the duties. If he does not allow it 
when asked, they can be done when the opportunity offers. When he does them, 
three tooth-sticks should be brought, a small, a mediurn, and a big one, and two 
kinds of mouthwashing water and bathing water, that is, hot and cold, should be 
set out. Whichever of these the teacher uses for three days should then be 
brought regularly. If the teacher uses either kind indiscriminately, he can 
bring whatever is available. <BR>71.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why so many words? All should 
be done as prescribed by the Blessed One in the Khandhakas as the Right Duties 
in the passage beginning 'Bhikkhus, a pupil should perform the Duties to the 
teacher [1O1] rightly. Herein, this is the right performance of duties. He 
should rise early; removing his sandals and arranging his robe on one shoulder, 
he should give the tooth-sticks and the mouth-washing water, and he should 
prepare the seat. If there is rice gruel, he should wash the dish and bring the 
rice gruel' (Vin.i,61).<BR>72.&nbsp;&nbsp; To please the teacher by perfection 
in the duties he should pay homage in the evening, and he should leave when 
dismissed with the words 'You may go'. When the teacher asks him 'Why have you 
come?', he can explain the reason for his coming. If he does not ask but agrees 
to the duties being done, then after ten days or a fortnight have gone by he 
should make an opportunity by staying back one day at the time of his dismissal, 
and announcing the reason for his coming; or he should go at an unaccustomed 
time, and when asked 'What have you come for?', he can announce it. If the 
teacher <BR>73.&nbsp;&nbsp; says 'Come in the morning', he should do so. But if 
his stomach burns with a bile affliction at that hour, or if his food does not 
get digested owing to sluggish digestive heat, or if some other ailment afflicts 
him, he should let it be known, and proposing a time that suits himself, he 
should come at that time. For if a meditation subject is expounded at an 
inconvenient time, one cannot give attention.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the 
detailed explanation of the words 'approach the Good Friend, the giver of a 
meditation subject'.<BR>74.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now as to the words, <I>one that suits 
his temperament</I> (&sect;28): there are six kinds of temperament, that is, greedy 
temperament, hating temperament, deluded temperament, faithful temperament, 
intelligent temperament, and speculative temperament. Some would have fourteen, 
taking these six single ones together with the four made up of the three double 
combinations and one triple combination with the greed triad and likewise with 
the faith triad. But if this classification is admitted, there are many more 
kinds of temperament possible by combining greed, etc., with faith etc.; 
therefore the kinds of temperament should be understood briefly as only six. As 
to meaning the temperaments are one, that is to say, personal nature, 
idiosyncrasy. According to [102] these there are only six types of persons, that 
is, one of greedy temperament, one of hating temperament, one of deluded 
temperament, one of faithful temperament, one of intelligent temperament, and 
one of speculative temperament.<BR>75.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, one of faithful 
temperament is parallel to one of greedy temperament because faith is strong 
when profitable [kamma] occurs in one of greedy temperament, owing to its 
special qualities being near to those of greed. For, in an unprofitable way, 
greed is affectionate and not over-austere, and so, in a profitable way, is 
faith. Greed seeks out sense desires as object, while faith seeks out the 
special qualities of virtue and so on. And greed does not give up what is 
harmful, while faith does not give up what is beneficial.<BR>76.&nbsp;&nbsp; One 
of intelligent temperament is parallel to one of hating temperament because 
understanding is strong when profitable [kamma] occurs in one of hating 
temperament, owing to its special qualities being near to those of hate. For, in 
an unprofitable way, hate is disaffected and does not hold to its object, and 
so, in a profitable way, is understanding. Hate seeks out only unreal faults, 
while understanding seeks out only real faults. And hate occurs in the mode of 
condemning living beings, while understanding occurs in the mode of condemning 
formations.<BR>77.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of speculative temperament is parallel to one 
of deluded temperament because obstructive applied thoughts arise often in one 
of deluded temperament who is striving to arouse unarisen profitable states, 
owing to their special qualities being near to those of delusion. For just as 
delusion is restless owing to perplexity, so are applied thoughts that are due 
to thinking over various aspects. And just as delusion vacillates owing to 
superficiality, so do applied thoughts that are due to facile 
conjecturing.<BR>78.&nbsp;&nbsp; Others say that there are three more kinds of 
temperament with craving, pride, and views. Herein craving is simply greed; and 
pride {18} is associated with that. So neither of them exceeds greed. And since 
views have their source in delusion, the temperament of views falls within the 
deluded temperament.<BR>79.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the source of these 
temperaments? And how is it to be known that such a person is of greedy 
temperament, that such a person is of one of those beginning with hating 
temperament? What suits one of what kind of temperament?<BR>80.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Herein, as some say, {19} the first three kinds of temperament to begin with 
have their source in previous habit; and they have their source in the elements 
and humours. Apparently one of greedy temperament has formerly had plenty of 
desirable tasks and gratifying work to do, or has reappeared here after dying in 
a heaven. And one of hating temperament has formerly had plenty of stabbing and 
torturing and brutal work to do or has reappeared here after dying in one of the 
hells or the Naga (serpent) existences. And one [1O3] of deluded temperament has 
formerly drunk a lot of intoxicants and neglected learning and questioning, or 
has reappeared here after dying in the animal existence. It is in this way that 
they have their source, in previous habit, they <BR>81. say. Then a person is of 
deluded temperament because two elements are prominent, that is to say, the 
earth element and the fire element. He is of hating temperament because the 
other two elements are prominent. But he is of greedy temperament because all 
four are equal. And as regards the humours, one of greedy temperament has phlegm 
in excess and one of deluded temperament has wind in excess. Or one of deluded 
temperament has phlegm in excess and one of greedy temperament has wind in 
excess. So they have their source in the elements and the humours, they 
say.<BR>82.&nbsp;&nbsp; [Now it can rightly be objected that] not all of those 
who have had plenty of desirable tasks and gratifying work to do, and who have 
reappeared here after dying in a heaven, are of greedy temperament, or the 
others respectively of hating and deluded temperament; and there is no such law 
of prominence of elements (See Ch.XIV,&sect;43f.) as that asserted; and only the 
pair, greed and delusion, are given in the law of humours, and even that 
subsequently contradicts itself; and no source for even one among those 
beginning with one of faithful temperament is given. Consequently this 
definition is indecisive.<BR>83.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following is the exposition 
according to the opinion of the teachers of the commentaries; for this is said 
in the Explanation of Prominence: 'The fact that these beings have prominence of 
greed, prominence of hate, prominence of delusion, prominence of non-greed, 
prominence of non-hate, prominence of non-delusion, is governed by previous 
root-cause.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'For when in one man at the moment of his 
accumulating [rebirth-producing] kamma greed is strong and non-greed is weak, 
non-hate and non-delusion are strong and hate and delusion are weak, then his 
weak non-greed is unable to prevail over his greed, but his non-hate and 
non-delusion being strong are able to prevail over his hate and delusion. That 
is why, on being reborn through rebirth-linking given by that kamma, he has 
greed, is good-natured and unangry, and possesses understanding with knowledge 
like a lightning flash.<BR>84.&nbsp;&nbsp; 'When at the moment of another's 
accumulating kamma greed and hate are strong and non-greed and non-hate weak, 
and non-delusion is strong and delusion weak, then in the way already stated he 
has both greed and hate, but possesses understanding with knowledge like a 
lightning flash; like the Elder Datta-Abhaya.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'When at the 
moment of his accumulating kamma greed, non-hate and delusion are strong and the 
others are weak, then in the way already stated he both has greed and is dull 
but is good-tempered {20} and unangry like the Elder Bahula.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
'Likewise when at the moment of his accumulating kamma the three, namely, greed, 
hate and delusion are strong and non-greed, etc., are weak, then in the way 
already stated he has both greed and hate and is deluded. [104] 
<BR>85.&nbsp;&nbsp; 'When at the moment of his accumulating kamma non-greed, 
hate and delusion are strong and the others are weak, then in the way already 
stated he has little defilement and is unshakable even on seeing a heavenly 
object but he has hate and is slow in understanding.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'When at 
the moment of his accumulating kamma non-greed, non-hate and delusion are strong 
and the rest weak, then in the way already stated he has no greed and no 
hate<BR>and is good-tempered but slow in understanding.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
'Likewise when at the moment of his accumulating kamma non-greed, hate and 
non-delusion are strong and the rest weak, then in the way already stated he 
both has no greed and possesses understanding but has hate and is 
irascible.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Likewise when at the moment of his accumulating 
kamma the three, that is, non-hate, non-greed, and non-delusion, are strong and 
greed, etc., are weak, then in the way already stated he has no greed and no 
hate and possesses understanding like the Elder 
Maha-Sangharakkhita'.<BR>86.&nbsp;&nbsp; One who, as it is said here, 'has 
greed' is one of greedy temperament; one who 'has hate' and one who 'is dull' 
are respectively of hating temperament and deluded temperament. One who 
'possesses understanding' is one of intelligent temperament. One who 'has no 
greed' and one who 'has no hate' are of faithful temperament because they are 
naturally trustful. Or just as one who is reborn through kamma accompanied by 
non-delusion is of intelligent temperament, so one who is reborn through kamma 
accompanied by strong faith is of faithful temperament, one who is reborn 
through kamma accompanied by thoughts of sense desire is of speculative 
temperament, and one who is reborn through kamma accompanied by mixed greed, 
etc., is of mixed temperament. So it is the kamma productive of rebirth-linking 
and accompanied by some one among the things beginning with greed that should be 
understood as the source of the temperaments.<BR>87.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it was 
asked, <I>and how is it to be known that 'This person is of greedy 
temperament'</I> (&sect;79), and so on. This is explained as 
follows:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'By the posture, by the action, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By eating, seeing, and so on, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the kind of states occurring, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May temperament be recognIzed.' 
<BR>88.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein,<I> by the posture:</I> when one of greedy 
temperament is walking in his usual manner, he walks carefully, puts his foot 
down slowly, puts it down evenly, lifts it up evenly, and his step is springy. 
{21} One of hating temperament walks as though he were digging with the points 
of his feet, puts his foot down quickly, lifts it up quickly, and his step is 
dragged along.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; One of deluded temperament walks with a perplexed 
gait, puts his foot down hesitantly, lifts it up hesitantly, [105] and his step 
is pressed down suddenly. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; And this is said in the account of 
the origin of the Magandiya Sutta: <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The 
step of one of greedy nature, will be 
springy;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The step of one of hating 
nature, dragged along;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deluded, he will 
suddenly press down his step;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one 
without defilement has a step like this' (see SnA.544)<BR>89.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
stance of one of greedy temperament is confident and graceful. That of one of 
hating temperament is rigid. That of one of deluded temperament is muddled. 
Likewise in sitting. And one of greedy temperament spreads his bed unhurriedly, 
lies down slowly, composing his limbs, and he sleeps in a confident manner. When 
woken instead of getting up quickly, he gives his answer slowly as though 
doubtful. One of hating temperament spreads his bed hastily anyhow; with his 
body flung down he sleeps with a scowl. When woken, he gets up quickly and 
answers as though annoyed. One of deluded temperament spreads his bed all awry 
and sleeps mostly face downwards with his body sprawling. When woken, he gets up 
slowly, saying 'Hum'.<BR>90.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since those of faithful temperament, 
etc., are parallel to those of greedy temperament, etc., their postures are 
therefore like those described above. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This firstly is how the 
temperaments may be recognized by the posture.<BR>91.&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>By the 
action:</I> also in the acts of sweeping, etc., one of greedy temperament grasps 
the broom well, and he sweeps cleanly and evenly without hurrying or scattering 
the sand as if he were strewing <I>sinduvara</I> flowers. One of hating 
temperament grasps the broom tightly, and he sweeps uncleanly and unevenly with 
a harsh noise, hurriedly throwing up the sand on each side. One of deluded 
temperament grasps the broom loosely, and he sweeps neither cleanly nor evenly, 
mixing the sand up and turning it over.<BR>92.&nbsp;&nbsp; As with sweeping so 
too with any action such as washing and dyeing robes, and so on. One of greedy 
temperament acts skilfully, gently, evenly and carefully. One of hating 
temperament acts tensely, stiffly and unevenly. One of deluded temperament acts 
unskilfully as if muddled, unevenly, and indecisively. [106] Also one of greedy 
temperament wears his robe neither too tightly nor too loosely, confidently and 
level all round. One of hating temperament wears it too tight and not level all 
round. One of deluded temperament wears it loosely and in a muddled 
way.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Those of faithful temperament, etc., should be understood 
in the same way as those just described, since they are 
parallel.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is how the temperaments may be recognized by the 
actions. <BR>93.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I> By eating:</I> one of greedy temperament likes 
eating rich sweet food. When eating, he makes a round lump not too big and eats 
unhurriedly, savouring the various tastes. He enjoys getting something good. One 
of hating temperament likes eating rough sour food. When eating he makes a lump 
that fills his mouth, and he eats hurriedly without savouring the taste. He is 
aggrieved when he gets something not good. One of deluded temperament has no 
settled choice. When eating, he makes a small unrounded lump, and as he eats he 
drops bits into his dish, smearing his face, with his mind astray, thinking of 
this and that.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Also those of faithful temperament, etc., should 
be understood in the same way as those just described since they are 
parallel.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is how the temperament may be recognized by 
eating.<BR>94.&nbsp;&nbsp; And by<I> seeing and so on:</I> when one of greedy 
temperament sees even a slightly pleasing visible object, he looks long as if 
surprised, he seizes on trivial virtues, discounts genuine faults, and when 
departing, he does so with regret as if unwilling to leave. When one of hating 
temperament sees even a slightly unpleasing visible object, he avoids looking 
long as if he were tired, he picks out trivial faults, discounts genuine 
virtues, and when departing, he does so without regret as if anxious to leave. 
When one of deluded temperament sees any sort of visible object, he copies what 
others do: if he hears others criticizing, he criticizes; if he hears others 
praising, he praises; but actually he feels equanimity in himself - the 
equanimity of unknowing. So too with sounds, and so on. And those of faithful 
temperament, etc., should be understood in the same way as those just described 
since they are parallel.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is how the temperaments may be 
recognized by seeing and so on.<BR>95.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I> By the kind of states 
occurring:</I> in one of greedy temperament there is frequent occurrence of such 
states as deceit, fraud, pride, evilness of wishes, greatness of wishes, 
discontent, foppery and personal vanity. {22} [107] In one of hating temperament 
there is frequent occurrence of such states as anger, enmity, disparaging, 
domineering, envy and avarice. In one of deluded temperament there is frequent 
occurrence of such states as stiffness, torpor, agitation, worry, uncertainty, 
and holding on tenaciously with refusal to relinquish.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; In one of 
faithful temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as free 
generosity, desire to see Noble Ones, desire to hear the Good Dhamma, great 
gladness, ingenuousness, honesty, and trust in things that inspire trust. In one 
of intelligent temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as 
readiness to be spoken to, possession of good friends, knowledge of the right 
amount in eating, mindfulness and full awareness, devotion to wakefulness, a 
sense of urgency about things that should inspire a sense of urgency, and wisely 
directed endeavour. In one of speculative temperament there is frequent 
occurrence of such states as talkativeness, sociability, boredom with devotion 
to the profitable, failure to finish undertaking, smoking by night and flaming 
by day (see M.i,144 - that is to say, hatching plans at night and putting them 
into effect by day), and mental running hither and thither (see 
Ud.37).<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is how the temperaments may be recognized by the 
kind of states occurring.<BR>96.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, these directions for 
recognizing the temperaments have not been handed down in their entirety in 
either the texts or the commentaries; they are only expressed according to the 
opinion of the teachers and cannot therefore be treated as authentic. For even 
those of hating temperament can exhibit postures, etc., ascribed to the greedy 
temperament when they try diligently. And postures, etc., never arise with 
distinct characteristics in a person of mixed temperament. Only such directions 
for recognizing temperament as are given in the commentaries should be treated 
as authentic; for this is said: 'A teacher who has acquired penetration of minds 
will know the temperament and will explain a meditation subject accordingly; one 
who has not should question the pupil'. So it is by penetration of minds or by 
questioning the person, that it can be known whether he is one of greedy 
temperament or one or those beginning with hating 
temperament.<BR>97.&nbsp;&nbsp; What suits one of what kind of temperament? 
(&amp;79). A suitable lodging for one of greedy temperament has an unwashed sill 
and stands level with the ground, and it can be either an overhanging [rock with 
an] unprepared [dripledge] (see Ch.II, note 15), a grass hut, or a leafhouse, 
etc.; it ought to be spattered with dirt, full of bats, {23} dilapidated, too 
high or too low, in bleak surroundings, threatened [by lions, tigers, etc.,] 
with a muddy, uneven path, [108] where even the bed and chair are full of bugs. 
And it should he ugly and unsightly, exciting loathing as soon as looked at. 
Suitable inner and outer garments are those that have torn-off edges with 
threads hanging down all round like a 'net cake', {24} harsh to the touch like 
hemp, soiled, heavy and hard to wear. And the right kind of bowl for him is an 
ugly clay bowl disfigured by stoppings and joins, or a heavy and misshappen iron 
bowl as unappetising as a skull. The right kind of road for him on which to 
wander for alms is disagreeable, with no village near, and uneven. The right 
kind of village for him in which to wander for alms is where people wander about 
as if oblivious of him, where, as he is about to leave without getting alms even 
from a single family, people call him into the sitting hall, saying 'Come, 
venerable sir', and give him gruel and rice, but do so as casually as if they 
were putting a cow in a pen. Suitable people to serve him are slaves or workmen 
who are unsightly, ill-favoured, with dirty clothes, ill-smelling and 
disgusting, who serve him his gruel and rice as if they were throwing it rudely 
at him. The right kind of gruel and rice and hard food is poor, unsightly, made 
up of millet, <I>kudusaka,</I> broken rice, etc., stale buttermilk, sour gruel, 
curry of old vegetables, or anything at all that is merely for filling the 
stomach. The right kind of posture for him is either standing or walking. The 
object of his contemplation should be any of the colour kasinas, beginning with 
the blue, whose colour is not pure.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is what suits one of 
greedy temperament.<BR>98.&nbsp;&nbsp; A suitable resting place for one of 
hating temperament is not too high or too low, provided with shade and water, 
with well-proportioned walls, posts and steps, with well prepared frieze work 
and lattice work, brightened with various kinds of painting, with an even, 
smooth, soft floor, adorned with festoons of flowers and a canopy of many 
coloured cloth like a Brahma-god's divine palace, with bed and chair covered 
with well-spread clean pretty covers, smelling sweetly of flowers, and perfume 
and scents set about for homely comfort, which makes one happy and glad at 99. 
the mere sight of it. The right kind of road to his lodging is free from any 
sort of danger, traverses clean, even ground, and has been properly prepared. 
[109] And here it is best that the lodging's furnishings are not too many in 
order to avoid hiding-places for insects, bugs, snakes and rats: even a single 
bed and chair only. The right kind of inner and outer garments for him are of 
any superior stuff such as China cloth, Somara cloth, silk, fine cotton, fine 
linen, of either single or double thickness, quite light, and well dyed, quite 
pure in colour to befit an ascetic. The right kind of bowl is made of iron, as 
well shaped as a water bubble, as polished as a gem, spotless, and of quite pure 
colour to befit an ascetic. The right kind of road on which to wander for alms 
is free from dangers, level, agreeable, with the village neither too far nor too 
near. The right kind of village in which to wander for alms is where people, 
thinking 'Now our lord is coming', prepare a seat in a sprinkled, swept place, 
and going out to meet him, take his bowl, lead him to the house, seat him on a 
prepared seat and serve him carefully with their <BR>100. own hands. Suitable 
people to serve him are handsome, pleasing, well bathed, well anointed, scented 
{25} with the perfume of incense and the smell of flowers, adorned with apparel 
made of variously-dyed clean pretty cloth, who do their work carefully. The 
right kind of gruel, rice, and hard food has colour, smell and taste, possesses 
nutritive essence, and is inviting, superior in every way, and enough for his 
wants. The right kind of posture for him is lying down or sitting. The object of 
his contemplation should be any one of the colour kasinas, beginning with the 
blue, whose colour is quite pure. This is what suits one of hating temperament. 
The right lodging for one of deluded temperament has a view and is not shut in, 
where the four quarters are visible to him as he sits there. As to the postures, 
walking is right.<BR>The right kind of object for his contemplation is not 
small, that is to say, the size of a winnowing basket or the size of a saucer; 
for his mind becomes more confused in a confined space; so the right kind is an 
amply large kasina. The rest is as stated for one of hating temperament. This is 
what suits one of deluded temperament.<BR>102.&nbsp;&nbsp; For one of faithful 
temperament all the directions given for one of hating temperament are suitable. 
As to the object of his contemplation, one of the Recollections is right as 
well.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; For one of intelligent temperament there is nothing 
unsuitable as far as concerns the lodging and so on.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; For one of 
speculative temperament an open lodging with a view, [110] where gardens, groves 
and ponds, pleasant prospects, panoramas of villages, towns and countryside, and 
the blue gleam of mountains, are visible to him as he sits there, is not right; 
for that is a condition for the running hither and thither of applied thought. 
So he should live in a lodging such as a deep cavern screened by woods like the 
Overhanging Rock of the Elephant's Belly <I>(Hatthikucchipabbhara),</I> or 
Mahinda's Cave. Also an ample-sized object of contemplation is not suitable for 
him; for one like that is a condition for the running hither and thither of 
applied thought. A small one is right. The rest is as stated for one of greedy 
temperament. This is what suits one of speculative temperament.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
These are the details, with definition of the kind, source, recognition, and 
what is suitable, as regards the various temperaments handed down here with the 
words 'that suits his own temperament' (&sect;28).<BR>103.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the 
meditation subject that is suitable to the temperament has not been cleared up 
in all its aspects yet. This will become clear automatically when those in the 
following list are treated in detail. Now it was said above 'and he should 
apprehend from among the forty meditation subjects one that suits his own 
temperament' (&sect;28). Here the exposition of the meditation subject should be 
first understood in these ten ways: (1) as to enumeration, (2) as to which bring 
only access and which absorption, (3) as to the kinds of jhana, (4) as to 
surmounting, (5) as to extension and non-extension, (6) as to object (7) as to 
plane, (8) as to apprehending, (9) as to condition, (10) as to suitability to 
temperament.<BR>104.&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Herein, <I>as to enumeration:</I> it was 
said above 'from among the forty meditation subjects' (&sect;28). Herein, the forty 
meditation subjects are these:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ten 
kasinas (totalities), <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ten kinds of 
foulness, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ten recollections, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; four divine abidings, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; four immaterial states, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One perception, 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One defining.<BR>105.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Herein, the ten kasinas are these: earth kasina, water kasina, fire kasina, air 
kasina, blue kasina, yellow kasina, red kasina, white kasina, light kasina, and 
limited-space kasina. {26}<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The ten kinds of foulness are these: 
the bloated, the livid, the festering, the cut-up, the gnawed, the scattered, 
the hacked and scattered, the bleeding, the worm-infested, and a skeleton. 
{27}<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The ten kinds of recollection are these: recollection of 
the Buddha (the Enlightened One), recollection of the Dhamma (the Law), 
recollection of the Sangha (the Community), recollection of virtue, recollection 
of generosity, recollection of deities, recollection (or mindfulness) of death, 
mindfullness occupied with the body, mindfulness of breathing, and recollection 
of peace. [111]<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The four divine abidings are these: 
lovingkindness, compassion, gladness, and equanimity.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The four 
immaterial states are these: the base consisting of boundless space, the base 
consisting of boundless consciousness, the base consisting of nothingness, and 
the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The one perception is the perception of repulsiveness in 
nutriment.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; The one defining is the defining of the four 
elements.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is how the exposition should be understood 'as to 
enumeration'.<BR>106.&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. <I>As to which bring access only and which 
absorption:</I> the eight recollections&nbsp; - excepting mindfulness occupied 
with the body and mindfulness of breathing -, the perception of repulsiveness in 
nutriment, and the defining of the four elements, are ten meditation subjects 
that bring access only. The others bring absorption. This is 'as to which bring 
access only and which absorption'.<BR>107.&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.<I> As to the kind of 
jhana:</I> among those that bring absorption, the ten kasinas together with 
mindfulness of breathing bring all four jhanas. The ten kinds of foulness 
together with mindfulness occupied with the body bring the first Jhana. The 
first three divine abidings bring three jhanas. The fourth divine abiding and 
the four immaterial states bring the fourth jhana. This is 'as to the kind of 
jhana'.<BR>108.&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. <I>As to surmounting:</I> there are two kinds of 
surmounting, that is to say, surmounting of factors and surmounting of object. 
Herein, there is surmounting of factors in the case of all meditation subjects 
that bring three and four jhanas because the second jhana, etc., have to be 
reached in those same objects by surmounting the jhana factors of applied 
thought and sustained thought, and so on. Likewise in the case of the fourth 
divine abiding; for that too has to be reached by surmounting joy in the same 
object as that of lovingkindness, and so on. But in the case of the four 
immaterial states there is surmounting of the object; for the base consisting of 
boundless space has to be reached by surmounting one or other of the first nine 
kasinas, and the base consisting of boundless consciousness, etc., have 
respectively to be reached by surmounting space, and so on. With the rest there 
is no surmounting. This is 'as to surmounting'.<BR>109.&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. <I>As to 
extension and non-extension:</I> only the ten kasinas among these forty 
meditation subjects need be extended. For it is within just so much space as one 
is intent upon with the kasina that one can hear sounds with the divine ear 
element, see visible objects with the divine eye, and know the minds of other 
beings with the mind.<BR>110.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mindfulness occupied with the body and 
the ten kinds of foulness need not be extended. Why? Because they have a 
definite location and because there is no benefit in it. The definiteness of 
their location will become clear in explaining the method of development 
(Ch.VIII,&sect;83-138 and Ch.VI,&sect;40,41,79). If the latter are extended, it is only a 
quantity of corpses that is extended [112] and there is no benefit. And this is 
said in answer to the question of Sopaka. "Perception of visible forms is quite 
clear, Blessed One, perception of bones is not clear' (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
); for here the perception of visible forms is called 'quite clear' in the sense 
of extension of the sign, while the perception of bones is called 'not <BR>111. 
quite clear' in the sense of its non-extension. But the words 'I was intent upon 
this whole earth with the perception of a skeleton' (Thag.18) are said of the 
manner of appearance to one who has acquired that perception. For just as in 
[the Emperor] Dhammasoka's time the <I>Karavika</I> bird uttered a sweet song 
when it saw its own reflection in the looking-glass walls all round and 
perceived <I>Karavikas</I> in every direction, {28} so the Elder [Singala Pitar] 
thought, when he saw the sign appearing in all directions through his 
acquisition of the perception of a skeleton, that the whole earth was covered 
with bones.<BR>112.&nbsp;&nbsp; If that is so, then is what is called the 
measurelessness of the object of jhana produced on foulness contradicted? {29} 
It is not contradicted. For one man apprehends the sign in a large bloated 
corpse or skeleton, another in a small one. In this way the jhana of the one has 
a limited object and that of the other a measureless object. Or alternatively 
'With a measureless object' (Dhs.182-4 in elision) is said of it referring to 
one who extends it, seeing no disadvantage in doing so. But it need not be 
extended because no benefit results.<BR>113.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest need not be 
extended likewise. Why? When a man extends the sign of in-breaths and 
out-breaths, only a quantity of wind is extended, and it has a definite 
location, [the nosetip.] So it need not be extended because of the disadvantage 
and because of the definiteness of the location. And the divine abidings have 
living beings as their object. When a man extends the sign of these, only the 
quantity of living beings would be extended, and there is no purpose in that. So 
that also need not be extended.<BR>114.&nbsp;&nbsp; When it is said 'Intent upon 
one quarter with his heart endued with lovingkindness' (D. i,,250), etc., that 
is said for the sake of comprehensive inclusion. For it is when a man develops 
it progressively by including living beings in one direction by one house, by 
two houses, etc., that he is said to be 'intent upon one direction', [113] not 
when he extends the sign. And there is no counterpart sign here that he might 
extend. Also the state of having a limited or measureless object can be 
understood here according to the way of inclusion, too.<BR>115.&nbsp;&nbsp; As 
regards the immaterial states as object, space need not be extended since it is 
the mere removal of the kasina [materiality]; for that should be brought to mind 
only as the disappearance of the kasina [materiality]; if he extends it, nothing 
further happens. And consciousness need not be extended since it is a state 
consisting in an individual essence, and it is not possible to extend a state 
consisting in an individual essence. The disappearance of consciousness need not 
be extended since it is mere non-existence of consciousness. And the base 
consisting of neither perception nor non-perception as object need not be 
extended since it too is a state consisting in an individual essence. 
{30}<BR>116.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest need not be extended because they have no 
sign. For it is the counterpart sign {31} that would be extendable, and the 
object of the recollection of the Buddha, etc., is not a counterpart sign. 
Consequently there is no need for extension there.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is 'as 
to extension and non-extension.'<BR>117.&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. <I>As to object:</I> of 
these forty meditation subjects, twenty-two have counterpart signs as object, 
that is to say, the ten kasinas, the ten kinds of foulness, mindfulness of 
breathing, and mindfulness occupied with the body; the rest do not have 
counterpart signs as object. Then twelve have states consisting in individual 
essences as object, that is to say, eight of the ten recollections - except 
mindfulness of breathing and mindfulness occupied with the body -, the 
perception of repulsiveness in nutriment, the defining of the four elements, the 
base consisting of boundless consciousness, and the base consisting of neither 
perception nor non-perception; and twenty-two have [counterpart] signs as 
object, that is to say, the ten kasinas, the ten kinds of foulness, mindfulness 
of breathing, and mindfulness occupied with the body; while the remaining six 
have 'not-so-classifiable' {32} objects. Then eight have mobile objects in the 
early stage though the counterpart is stationary, that is to say, the festering, 
the bleeding, the worm-infested, mindfulness of breathing, the water kasina, the 
fire kasina, the air kasina, and in the case of the light kasina the object 
consisting of a circle of sunlight, etc.; the rest have immobile objects. {33}. 
This is 'as to object'.<BR>118.&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. <I>As to plane:</I> here the 
twelve, namely, the ten kinds of foulness, mindfulness occupied with the body, 
and perception of repulsiveness in nutriment, do not occur among the dieties. 
These twelve and mindfulness of breathing do not occur in the Brahma world. But 
none except the four immaterial states occur in the immaterial becoming. All 
occur among human beings. This is 'as to plane'. [114] <BR>119.&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. 
<I>As to apprehending:</I> here the exposition should be understood according to 
sight, touch and hearsay. Herein, these nineteen, that is to to say, nine 
kasinas omitting the air kasina and the ten kinds of foulness, must be 
apprehended by sight. The meaning is that in the early stage their sign must be 
apprehended by constantly looking with the eye. In the case of mindfulness 
occupied with the body the five parts ending with skin must be apprehended by 
sight and the rest by hearsay, so its object must be apprehended by sight and 
hearsay. Mindfulness of breathing must be apprehended by touch; the air kasina 
by sight and touch; the remaining eighteen by hearsay. The divine abiding of 
equanimity and the four immaterial states are not apprehendable by a beginner; 
but the remaining thirty-five are. This is 'as to 
apprehending'.<BR>120.&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. <I>As to condition:</I> of these 
meditation subjects nine kasinas omitting the space kasina are conditions for 
the immaterial states. The ten kasinas are conditions for the kinds of 
direct-knowledge. Three divine abidings are conditions for the fourth divine 
abiding. Each lower immaterial state is a condition for each higher one. The 
base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception is a condition 
for&nbsp; the attainment of cessation. All are conditions for living in bliss, 
for insight, and for the fortunate kinds of becoming. This is as to 
condition'.<BR>121.&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.<I> As to suitability to temperament:</I> 
here the exposition should be understood according to what is suitable to the 
temperaments. That is to say: firstly the ten kinds of foulness and mindfulness 
occupied with the body are eleven meditation subjects suitable for one of greedy 
temperament. The four divine abidings and four colour kasinas are eight suitable 
for one of hating temperament. Mindfulness of breathing is the one [recollection 
as a] meditation subject suitable for one of deluded temperament and for one of 
speculative temperament. The first six recollections are suitable for one 
faithful temperament. Mindfulness of death, the recollection of peace, the 
defining of the four elements, and the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment, 
are four suitable for one of intelligent temperament. The remaining kasinas and 
the immaterial states are suitable for all kinds of temperament. And any one of 
the kasinas should be limited for one of speculative temperament and measureless 
for one of deluded temperament. This is how the exposition should be understood 
here 'as to suitability to temperament'.<BR>122.&nbsp;&nbsp; All this has been 
stated in the form of direct opposition and complete suitability. But there is 
actually no profitable development that does not suppress greed, etc., and help 
faith, and so on. And this is said in the Meghiya Sutta: '[One] should, in 
addition, {34} develop these four things: 'foulness should be developed for the 
purpose of abandoning greed (lust). Lovingkindness should be developed for the 
purpose of abandoning ill will. [115] Mindfulness of breathing should be 
developed for the purpose of cutting off applied thought. Perception of 
impermanence should be cultivated for the purpose of eliminating the conceit "I 
am"' (A.iv,358). Also in the Rahula Sutta in the passage beginning 'Develop 
lovingkindness, Rahula' (M.i,424) seven meditation subjects are given for a 
single temperament. So instead of insisting on the mere letter, the intention 
should be sought in each instance.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the explanatory 
exposition of the meditation subject referred to by the words <I>and he should 
apprehend ... one</I> [meditation subject] (&sect;28).<BR>123.&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Now the 
words <I>and he should apprehend</I> are illustrated as follows. After 
approaching the Good Friend of the kind described in the explanation of the 
words <I>then approach the Good Friend, the giver of a meditation subject</I> 
(&sect;28 and &sect;57-73), the meditator should dedicate himself to the Blessed One, the 
Enlightened One, or to a teacher, and he should ask for the meditation subject 
with a sincere inclination [of the heart] and sincere 
resolution.<BR>124.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, he should dedicate himself to the 
Blessed One, the Enlightened One, in this way: 'Blessed One, I relinquish this 
my person to you'. For without having thus dedicated himself when living in a 
remote abode he might be unable to stand fast if a frightening object made its 
appearance, and he might return to a village abode, become associated with 
laymen, take up improper search and come to ruin. But when he has dedicated 
himself in this way no fear arises in him if a frightening object makes its 
appearance; in fact only joy arises in him as he reflects 'Have you not wisely 
already dedicated yourself to the Enlightened One?' <BR>125.&nbsp;&nbsp; Suppose 
a man had a fine piece of Kasi cloth. He would feel grief if it were eaten by 
rats or moths; but if he gave it to a bhikkhu needing robes, he would feel only 
joy if he saw the bhikkhu tearing it up [to make his patched cloak]. And so it 
is with this.<BR>126.&nbsp;&nbsp; When he dedicates himself to a teacher, he 
should say 'I relinquish this my person to you, venerable sir'. For one who has 
not dedicated his person thus becomes unresponsive to correction, hard to speak 
to, and unamenable to advice, or he goes where he likes without asking the 
teacher. Consequently the teacher does not help him with either material things 
or the Dhamma, and he does not train him in the cryptic books. {35} Failing to 
get these two kinds of help [116] he finds no footing in the Dispensation, and 
he soon comes down to misconducting himself or to the lay state. But if he has 
dedicated his person, he is not unresponsive to correction, does not go about as 
he likes, is easy to speak to, and lives only in dependence on the teacher. He 
gets the twofold help from the teacher and attains growth, increase and 
fulfilment in the Dispensation. Like the Elder Cula-Pindpatika-Tissa's 
pupils.<BR>127.&nbsp;&nbsp; Three bhikkhus came to the Elder, it seems. One of 
them said 'Venerable sir, I am ready to fall from a cliff the height of one 
hundred men, if it is said to be to your advantage'. The second said 'Venerable 
sir, I am ready to grind away this body from the heels up without remainder on a 
flat stone, if it is said to be to your advantage'. The third said 'Venerable 
sir, I am ready to die by stopping breathing, if it said to be to your 
advantage'. Observing 'These bhikkhus are certainly capable of progress', the 
Elder expounded a meditation subject to them. Following his advice, the three 
attained Arahantship.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the benefit in self dedication. 
Hence it was said above 'dedicating himself to the Blessed One, the Enlightened 
One, or to a teacher'.<BR>128.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I> With a sincere inclination [of the 
heart] and sincere resolution</I> (&sect;123): the meditator's inclination should be 
sincere in the six modes beginning with non-greed. For it is one of such sincere 
inclination who arrives at one of the three kinds of enlightenment, according as 
it is said 'Six kinds of inclination lead to the maturing of the enlightenment 
of the Bodhisattas. With the inclination to non-greed Bodhisattas see the fault 
in greed. With the inclination to non-hate Bodhisattas see the fault in hate. 
With the inclination to non-delusion Bodhisattas see the fault in delusion. With 
the inclination to renunciation Bodhisattas see the fault in house life. With 
the inclination to seclusion Bodhisattas see the fault in society. With the 
inclination to relinquishment Bodhisattas see the fault in all kinds of becoming 
and destiny' (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ). For Stream Enterers, 
Once-returners, Non-returners, those with Cankers Destroyed, Pacceka Buddhas, 
and Fully Enlightened Ones, whether past, future or present, all arrive at the 
distinction peculiar to each by means of these same six modes. That is why he 
should have sincerity of inclination in these six modes.<BR>129.&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
should be whole-heartedly resolved on that. The meaning is [117] that he should 
be resolved upon concentration, respect concentration, incline to concentration, 
be resolved upon nibbana, respect nibbana, incline to nibbana.<BR>When with 
sincerity of inclination and whole-hearted resolution in this way he asks for a 
meditation subject, then a teacher who has acquired the penetration of minds can 
know his temperament by surveying his mental conduct; and a teacher who has not 
can know it by putting such questions to him as 'What is your temperament? ' or 
'What states are usually present in you?' or 'What do you like bringing to 
mind?' or 'What meditation subject does your mind favour?'. When he knows, he 
can expound a meditation subject suitable to that temperament. And in doing so, 
he can expound it in three ways: it can be given to one who has already learnt 
the meditation subject by having him recite it at one or two sessions; it can be 
expounded to one who lives in the same place each time he comes; and to one who 
wants to learn it and then go elsewhere it can be expounded in such a manner 
that it is neither too brief nor too long.<BR>131.&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, when 
firstly he is explaining the earth kasina, there are nine aspects that he should 
explain. They are the four faults of the kasina, the making of a kasina, the 
method of development for one who has made it, the two kinds of sign, the two 
kinds of concentration, the seven kinds of suitable and unsuitable, the ten 
kinds of skill in absorption, evenness of energy, and the directions for 
absorption.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of the other meditation subjects, each 
should be expounded in the way appropriate to it. All this will be made clear in 
the directions for development. But when the meditation subject is being 
expounded in this way, the meditator must apprehend the sign as he 
listens.<BR>132.&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Apprehend the sign</I> means that he must 
connect each aspect thus, 'This is the preceding clause, this is the subsequent 
clause, this is its meaning, this is its intention, this is the simile'. When he 
listens attentively, apprehending the sign in this way, his meditation subject 
is well apprehended. Then, and because of that, he successfully attains 
distinction, but not otherwise. This clarifies the meaning of the words 'and he 
must apprehend'. <BR>133.&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point the clauses <I>approach the 
Good Friend, the giver of a meditation subject, and he should apprehend from 
among the forty meditation subjects one that suits his own temperament</I> (&sect;28) 
have been expounded in detail in all their aspects.<BR><BR>The third chapter 
called 'The Description of <BR>taking a Meditation Subject' in the Treatise 
<BR>on the Development of Concentration in the <BR>Path of Purification composed 
for the <BR>purpose of gladdening good 
people.<BR><BR><BR>[Footnotes]<BR><BR>{1}. The answer to question (vii) 
stretches from Ch.III,&sect;27 to Ch.XI,&sect;119. That to question (viii) from Ch.XI,&sect;I20 
up to the end of Ch.XIII.<BR>{2}. <I>'Cittass ekaggata'</I> is rendered here as 
'unification of mind' in the sense of agreement or harmony (cf. <I>samagga)</I> 
of consciousness and its concomitants in focussing on a single object (see 
A.i,70). It is sometimes rendered 'one-pointedness' in that sense, or in the 
sense of the focussing of a searchlight. It may be concluded that this term is 
simply a synonym for <I>samadhi</I> and nothing more firstly from its use in the 
suttas and secondly from the fact that it is given no separate definition in the 
description of the formations aggregate in Ch.XIV. Cf. gloss at 
MA.i,124.<BR>{3}. 'The characteristic of non-distraction is the individual 
essence peculiar to concentration. Hence no analysis of it is possible, which is 
why he said <I>"It is of one kind with the characteristic of 
non-distraction'"</I> (Pm.91)<BR>{4}. 'Applied-thought that occurs as though 
absorbing <I>(appento)</I> associated states in the object is absorption 
<I>(appana).</I> Accordingly it is described as "absorption, absorbing 
<I>(appana vyappana)"</I> (M.iii,73). Now since that is the most important, the 
usage of the commentaries is to call all exalted and unsurpassed jhana states 
"absorption" [as well as the applied thought itself], and likewise to apply the 
term of common usage "access" to the limited [i.e. sense-sphere] jhana that 
heralds the arising of the former, just as the term "village access", etc., is 
applied to the neighborhood of a village' (Pm.91).<BR>{5}. 'The round 
<I>(vatta,</I> see Ch.XVII,&sect;298) [including fine-material and immaterial 
heavens] is called the world <I>(loka)</I> because of its crumbling 
<I>(lujjana)</I> and disintegrating <I>(palujjana). "Mundane (lokiya)"</I> means 
connected with the world because of being included in it or found there. 
"Supramundane (lokuttara)" means beyond the world, excepted from it, because of 
not being included in it [through being associated with nibbana]' (Pm.91). See 
also 'Nine supramundane states', Ch.VII,&sect;68, 74-f.'<BR>{6}. In loose usage 
<I>piti</I> (happiness) and <I>sukha</I> (pleasure or bliss) are almost 
synonyms. They become differentiated in the jhana formulas (see Ch,IV,&sect;100), and 
then technically <I>piti,</I> as the active thrill of rapture, is classed under 
the formations aggregate and <I>sukha</I> under the feeling aggregate. The 
valuable word 'happiness' was chosen for <I>piti</I> rather than the possible 
alternatives of 'joy' (needed for <I>somanassa),</I> 'interest' (which is too 
flat), 'rapture' (which is overcharged), or 'zest'. For <I>sukha,</I> while 
'pleasure' seemed to fit admirably where ordinary pleasant feeling is intended, 
another, less crass, word seemed necessary for the refined pleasant feeling of 
jhana and the 'bliss' of nibbana (which is not feeling aggregate - see M.i,400). 
'Ease' is sometimes used.<BR>&nbsp;Neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling is 
intended here by "equanimity <I>(upekkha</I> lit. onlooking)"; for it "looks on 
<I>(upekkhati)"</I> at the occurrence of [bodily] pleasure and pain by 
maintaining the neutral (central) mode' (Pm.92).<BR>{7}. <I>'Samatha</I> - 
serenity' is a synonym for absorption concentration, and 'insight 
<I>(vipassana)'</I> a synonym for understanding. <I>Samatha</I> is sometimes 
rendered by 'tranquillity' (reserved here for <I>passaddhi),</I> or 'calm' or 
'quiet'.<BR>{8}. One of the principal monasteries in Anuradhapura.<BR>{9}. 
<I>Dve Matika</I> - the Two Codes': see Ch.I, n.11. But Pm. says here: 
'"Observers of the Codes" are observers of the codes (summaries) of the Dhamma 
and Vinaya' (Pm.117).<BR>{10}. <I>'Pavarana:</I> Ceremony held at the end of the 
Rains, during three months of which season bhikkhus have to undertake to live in 
one place in order to avoid travel while crops are growing. It consists in a 
meeting of the bhikkhus who have spent the Rains together, at which each member 
present invites <I>(pavareti)</I> the Community to point out his faults 
(breaches of Vinaya rules) committed during the preceding three months 
(Vin.i,155).<BR>{11}. <I>'Pacinakhandaraji ti puratthimadisaya pabbatakhandanam 
antare vanarajitthanam'</I> (Pm.97).<BR>{12}. For the first five years after the 
admission <I>(upasampada)</I> a bhikkhu is called a 'new <I>(nava)</I> bhikkhu'; 
from five to ten years he is called a 'middle <I>(majjhima)</I> bhikkhu'; with 
ten or more years seniority he is called an 'elder <I>(thera)</I> 
bhikkhu'.<BR>{13}. The last sentence here might refer to a free mass 
distribution of gruel <I>(yagu),</I> which appears to have been more or less 
constantly maintained at Anuradhapura.<BR>{14}. It is usual to render the set 
phrase <I>'panitam khandaniyam bhojaniyam'</I> by some such phrase as 'sumptuous 
food both hard and soft', which is literal but unfamiliar-sounding.<BR>{15}. 
'The way of the Rathavinita <I>(Rathavinita-patipada'):</I> this is a reference 
to certain suttas that were adopted by bhikkhus as a 'way <I>(patipada)' </I>or 
guide to practice. The suttas mentioned here are Rathavinita (M.i,145), Nalaka 
(Sn., p.131), Tuvataka (Sn., p.179), Noble One's Heritages <I>(ariyavamsa </I>- 
A.ii,27). Other such suttas are mentioned at MA.i,92; iii,6; SA.iii,291. The 
Ariyavamsa Sutta (A.ii,27) itself has a long commentary on practice, and it is 
mentioned in the commentaries as a popular subject for preaching (see, e. g. a 
story in the commentary to A. Tikanipita 42).<BR>{16}. <I>'Sima</I> - boundary': 
loosely used in this sense, it corresponds vaguely to what is meant by 'parish'. 
In the strict sense it is the actual area (usually a 'chapter house') agreed 
according to rule laid down in the Vinaya and marked by boundary stones, within 
which the Community <I>(sangha)</I> carries out its formal acts.<BR>{17}. 
<I>'Atthayitabba</I> - needed': not in P.T.S. Dict., not in T.C.P. 
Dict.<BR>{18}. <I>Mana,</I> usually rendered by 'pride', is rendered here both 
by 'pride' and 'conceit'. Etymologically derived perhaps from <I>maneti</I> (to 
honour) or <I>minati</I> (to measure). In sense, however, it tends to become 
associated with <I>mannati</I> to conceive (false notions, see M.i,1), to 
imagine, to think (as e.g. at Nd1.80, Vbh.390 and comy.). As one of the 
'defilements' (see M.i,36) it is probably best rendered by 'pride'. In the 
expression <I>asmi-mana</I> (often rendered by 'the pride that says "I am"') it 
more nearly approaches <I>mannana</I> (false imagining, misconception, see 
M.iii,246) and is better rendered by 'the conceit "I am" since the word 
'conceit' straddles both the meanings of 'pride (haughtiness)' and 'conception'. 
<BR>{19}. <I>"'Some"</I> is said with reference to the Elder Upatissa. For it is 
put in his way by him in the Vimutti-magga. The word <I>"apparently"</I> 
indicates dissent from what follows' (Pm.103). A similiar passage to that 
referred to appears in Ch.6 of the Chinese version of the Vimuttimagga, the only 
one extant.<BR>{20}. <I>'Silaka</I> - good-tempered ' = <I>sukhasila</I> 
(good-natured - see &sect;83), which = <I>sakhila</I> (kindly - Pm.104). Not in P. 
T.S. Dict.<BR>{21}. <I>'Ukkutika</I> - springy' is glossed here by 
<I>asamphutthamajjham</I> (not touching in the middle - Pm. 106). This meaning 
is not in P.T.S. Dict.<BR>{22}. <I>'Singa</I> - foppery' is not in P.T.S. Dict. 
in this sense. See Vbh.351 and commentary.<BR>&nbsp;<I>'Capalya (capalla)</I> - 
personal vanity': noun from adj. <I>capala.</I> The word <I>'capala'</I> comes 
in an often-repeated passage ... <I>'satha mayavino ketubhino uddhata unnala 
capala mukhara ...'</I> (M.i,32); cf. S.i,203; A.iii.199, etc.), and also at 
M.i,470<I> 'uddhato hoti capalo',</I> with two lines lower <I>'uddhaccam 
capalyam'. Capalya</I> also occurs at Vbh.351 (and M.ii,167). At MA.i,152 
(commenting of M.i,32) we find <I>'capala ti pattacivaramandanadina capallena 
yutta</I> (interested in personal vanity consisting in adorning bowl and robe 
and so on)', and at MA.iii,185 (commenting on M.i,470) <I>'Uddhato hoti capalo 
ti uddhaccapakatiko c'eva hoti civaramandana pattamandana senasanamandana imassa 
va putikayassa kelayanamandana ti evam vuttena tarunadarakacapallena 
samannagato</I> ("he is distracted - or puffed up - and personally vain": he is 
possessed of the callow youth's personal vanity described as adorning the robe, 
adorning the bowl, adorning the lodging, or prizing and adorning this filthy 
body)'. This meaning is confirmed in the commentary to Vbh.251. P.T.S. Dict. 
does not give this meaning at all but only 'fickle', which is unsupported by the 
commentary. T.C.P. Dict. <I>(acapala)</I> also does not give this 
meaning.<BR>&nbsp;As to the other things listed here in the Vis. Text, most will 
be found at M.i,36. For 'holding on tenaciously', etc., see M.i,43.<BR>{23}. 
<I>'Jatuka</I> - a bat': not in P.T.S. Dict. Also at Ch.XI &sect;7.<BR>{24}. 
<I>'Jalapuvasadisa</I> - like a net cake': 'A cake made like a net' (Pm.108); 
possibly what is now known in Ceylon as a 'string hopper', or something like 
it.<BR>{25}. <I>'Surabhi</I> - scented, perfume': not in P.T.S. Dict.; also at 
Ch.VI,&sect;90; X,&sect;60 and Pm.445.<BR>{26}. <I>'"Kasina"</I> is in the sense of 
entirety <I>(sakalatthena)'</I> (MA,iii,260). See Ch.IV,&sect;119 <BR>{27}. Here ten 
kinds of foulness are given. But in the suttas only either five or six of this 
set appear to be mentioned, that is, 'Perception of a skeleton, perception of 
the worm-infested, perception of the livid, perception of the cut-up, perception 
of the bloated' (see A.i,42 and S.v,131; A.ii,17 adds 'perception of the 
festering'). No details are given. All ten appear at Dhs.263-4 and Ps.i,49. It 
will be noted that no order of progress of decay in the kinds of corpse appears 
here; also the instructions in Ch.VI are for contemplating actual corpses in 
these states. The primary purpose here is to cultivate 
'repulsiveness'.<BR>&nbsp;Another set of nine progressive stages in the decay of 
a corpse, mostly differing from these, is given at M.i,58,89, etc., beginning 
with a corpse one day old and ending with bones turned to dust. From the words 
'suppose a bhikkhu saw a corpse thrown on a charnel ground ... he compares this 
same body of his with it thus "This body too is of like nature, awaits a like 
fate, is not exempt from that"' (M.i,58) it can be assumed that these nine, 
which are given in progressive order of decay in order to demonstrate the body's 
impermanence, are not neccesarily intended as contemplations of actual corpses 
so much as mental images to be created, the primary purpose being to cultivate 
impermanence. This may be why these nine are not used here (see 
Ch.VIII,&sect;43).<BR>&nbsp;The word <I>asubha</I> (foul, foulness) is used both of 
the contemplations of corpses as here and of the contemplation of the parts of 
the body (A.v,109).<BR>{28}. The full story, which occurs at MA.iii,382-3 and 
elsewhere is this: 'It seems that when the Karavika bird has pecked a 
sweet-flavoured mango with its beak and savoured the dripping juice, and 
flapping its wings, begins to sing, then quadrupeds caper as if mad. Quadrupeds 
grazing in their pastures drop the grass in their mouths and listen to the 
sound. Beasts of prey hunting small animals pause with one foot raised. Hunted 
animals lose their fear of death and halt in their tracks. Birds flying in the 
air stay with wings outstretched. Fishes in the water keep still, not moving 
their fins. All listen to the sound, so beautiful is the Karavika's song. 
Dhammasoka's queen Asandhamitta asked the Community "Venerable sirs, is there 
anything that sounds like the Buddha?" - "The Karavika bird does." -&nbsp; 
"Where are those birds, venerable sirs?" - "In the Himalaya." She told the king 
"Sire, I wish to hear a Karavika bird". The king despatched a gold cage with the 
order "Let a Karavika bird come and sit in this cage." The cage travelled and 
halted in front of a Karavika. Thinking "The cage has come at the king's 
command; it is imposible not to go", the bird got in. The cage returned and 
stopped before the king. They could not get the Karavika to utter a sound. When 
the king asked "When do they utter a sound?", they replied "On seeing their 
kin". Then the king had it surrounded with looking-glasses. Seeing its own 
reflection and imagining that its relatives had come, it flapped its wings and 
cried out with an exquisite voice as if sounding a crystal trumpet. All the 
people in the city rushed about as if mad. Asandhamitta thought "If the sound of 
this creature is so fine, what indeed can the sound of the Blessed One have been 
like since he had reached the glory of omniscient knowledge?", and arousing a 
happiness that she never again relinquished, she became established in the 
fruition of Stream Entry'.<BR>{29}. See Dhs. p.55; but it comes under the 
<I>'... pe ...',</I> which must be filled in from pp. 37-8, &sect;182 and 
&sect;l84.<BR>{30}. 'It is because only an abstract <I>(parikappaja)</I> object can 
be extended, not any other kind, that he said <I>"it is not possible to extend a 
state consisting in an individual essence"'</I> (Pm.110).<BR>{31}. The word 
<I>'nimitta'</I> in its technical sense is consistently rendered here by the 
word 'sign', which corresponds very nearly if not exactly to most uses of it. It 
is sometimes rendered by 'mark' (which over-emphasizes the concrete), and by 
'image' (which is not always intended). The three kinds, that is, the 
'preliminary-work sign, learning sign and counterpart sign' do not appear in the 
Pitakas. There the use rather suggusts association of ideas as, for example, at 
M.i,180, M.i,119, A.i,4, etc., than the more definitely visualized 'image' in 
some instances of the 'counterpart sign' described in the following 
chapters.<BR>{32}. <I>'Na-vattaba</I> - not-so-classifiable' is an Abhidhamma 
shorthand term for something that, when considered under one of the triads or 
dyads of the Abhidhamma Matika (Dhs., p.1f.), cannot be placed under any one of 
the three, or two, headings.<BR>{33}. <I>'"The festering"</I> is a mobile object 
because of the oozing of the pus, <I>"the bleeding"</I> because of the trickling 
of the blood, <I>"the worm-infested" </I>because of the wriggling of the worms. 
The mobile aspect of the sunshine coming in through a window opening is evident, 
which explains why an object consisting of a circle of sunlight is called 
mobile' (Pm.110).<BR>{34}. 'In addition to tbe five things' (not quoted) dealt 
with earlier in the sutta, namely, perfection of virtue, good friendship, 
hearing suitable things, energy, and understanding.<BR>{35}. <I>'"The cryptic 
books":</I> the meditation-subject books dealing with the truths, the dependent 
origination, etc., which are profound and associated with voidness' (Pm.III),
