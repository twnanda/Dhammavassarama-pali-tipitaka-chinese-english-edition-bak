citta by <B>sobhana and asobhana</B></FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT 
size=+1>&nbsp;<B>Sobhana-dhamma</B> is a good reality [citta and cetasika], 
which includes not only kusala-dhamma.&nbsp; Good realities which are not 
kusala-dhamma are kusala- vipaka, which are the results of kusala-kamma and 
sobhana-kiriya, which are citta and cetasika of the arahanta with completely 
eradicated kusala and akusala.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT 
size=+1>&nbsp;<B>Asobhana-dhamma</B> is the opposite reality [nama-dhamma] of 
sobhana-dhamma.&nbsp; It is not a good reality, which not only includes 
akusala-cetasika.&nbsp; <B>Any citta and cetasika that do not have 
sobhana-cetasika arising with them are asobhana.</B>&nbsp; Therefore the 
sampayutta-dhamma that differentiate citta as good or sobhana and as bad or 
asobhana are the cetasika which comprise the six hetu.&nbsp; The good cetasika 
are the alobha-, adosa- and panna-cetasika etc. which are the sobhana-cetasika 
that render citta good.&nbsp; Therefore the classification of citta by sobhana 
and asobhana types results from the classification by hetu.&nbsp; Any citta that 
is composed of cetasika that are sobhana-hetu is a sobhana-citta.&nbsp; Any 
citta that is composed of cetasika that are asobhana-hetu is an 
asobhana-citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>To study the 
paramattha-dhamma, one must think and consider its logical reasoning 
oneself.&nbsp; When one understands the right and clear reasoning, one would not 
be confused or erroneous even in the matter of sobhana- and 
asobhana-dhamma.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Akusala-citta 
arises concurrently with lobha, dosa and moha.&nbsp; Therefore akusala-citta is 
certainly not a sobhana-citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT 
size=+1>&nbsp;Cakkhu-vinnana-citta does not arise with lobha, dosa, moha or any 
other sobhana-cetasika. Cakkhu-vinnana-citta arises with only seven cetasika, 
namely <B>phassa-cetasika, vedana-cetasika, sanna-cetasika, cetana-cetasika, 
ekaggata-cetasika, jivitindriya-cetasika and manasikara-cetasika.&nbsp; These 
seven cetasika are the sabba-citta-sadharana-cetasika, the cetasika that arises 
with all citta.&nbsp; The citta cannot arise without these seven 
cetasika.</B>&nbsp; No matter which kind of citta, akusala-, kusala-, vipaka-, 
kiriya-, lokuttara-citta or any citta whatever, would have to arise concurrently 
with these seven cetasika.&nbsp; These sabba-citta-sadharana-cetasika are the 
annasamana-cetasika, or cetasika that conform with whatever they arise 
with.&nbsp; Concurring with akusala-citta, the seven 
sabba-citta-sadharana-cetasika are akusala; with kusala-citta, they are kusala 
etc.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT 
size=+1>&nbsp;<B>Cakkhu-vinnana-citta is a vipaka-citta with only the seven 
sabba-citta-sadharana-cetasika, and no other sobhana-cetasika or 
akusala-cetasika of any kind, arising concurrently with it.&nbsp; Therefore, 
cakkhu-vinnana-citta is an asobhana-citta without being an 
akusala-citta.</B></FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;To study the 
dhamma, one must thoroughly understand even the differences between 
akusala-dhamma and asobhana-dhamma.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Akusala-dhamma is 
the reality that is bad or harmful, the hetu for unpleasant, unhappy vipaka to 
arise as result.&nbsp; Asobhana-dhamma is citta and cetasika without 
sobhana-cetasika arising concurrently with it.&nbsp; The Buddha manifested the 
dhamma from diverse perspectives according to the characteristics of the 
distinct dhamma.&nbsp; Thus the student should conscientiously study so as to 
correctly understand the different realities.&nbsp; When he manifested according 
to the three groups, namely kusala-dhamma, akusala-dhamma and abyakata-dhamma, 
one must know that kusala- dhamma is the reality that is hetu causing 
kusala-vipaka to arise; that akusala- dhamma is the reality that is hetu causing 
akusala-vipaka to arise; and that abyakata-dhamma is the reality that is hetu 
causing neither kusala nor akusala realities to arise.&nbsp; Therefore, 
abyakata-dhamma does not cause vipaka-citta and -cetasika, kiriya-citta and 
-cetasika, rupa or nibbana to arise. <B>Therefore, abyakata-dhamma is not only 
citta and cetasika that are vipaka and kiriya but rupa-paramattha and 
nibbana-paramattha are also abyakata-dhamma.</B> Rupa and nibbana can neither be 
kusala nor akusala because they are not citta and cetasika. When the Buddha 
manifested different kinds of dhamma according to the three groups, he 
manifested the four paramattha-dhamma.&nbsp; But when he manifested them 
according to the four jati, he intended only citta and 
cetasika.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Classified by the 
four jati, akusala-citta and its concurrent cetasika are asobhana; kusala-citta 
and its concurrent cetasika are sobhana; any vipaka-citta and kiriya-citta 
without sobhana-cetasika such as alobha-cetasika and adosa-cetasika arising 
simultaneously, are asobhana for they do not arise with sobhana-cetasika; any 
vipaka-citta and kiriya-citta with sobhana-cetasika arising concurrently are 
sobhana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The 
cakkhu-vinnana-kusala-vipaka-citta and the cakkhu-vinnana-akusala-vipaka-citta 
arise concurrently with only seven 
sabba-citta-sadharana-cetasika.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>These ten 
davi-panca-vinnana-citta are therefore asobhana.&nbsp; All other citta that 
arise without sobhana-cetasika are asobhana-citta.&nbsp; Therefore 
<B>kusala-vipaka-citta are not all sobhana-citta.&nbsp; Kusala-vipaka-citta with 
sobhana-cetasika arising concurrently are sobhana-citta.&nbsp; 
Kusala-vipaka-citta without sobhana-cetasika arising concurrently are not 
sobhana-citta.</B>&nbsp; These are the distinctions of each instant of citta in 
daily life.&nbsp; The patisandhicitta in the human plane and that of the 
apaya-bhumi are results of different kamma.&nbsp; The patisandhicitta of those 
in the apaya-bhumi are akusala-vipaka-citta, the result of akusala-kamma causing 
births in the hell plane, in the pitivisaya-bhumi, in the asurakaya-bhumi or the 
animal plane. The patisandhi-citta of those born humans or deva of different 
levels are kusala-vipaka-citta, the results of kusala-kamma causing births in 
the sugati-bhumi.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Though birth in the 
manussa-bhumi (the human plane) is kusala-vipaka, some people are born innately 
handicapped because the kusala-vipaka-citta that performed the function of 
patisandhi are the results of kusala-kamma without panna-cetasika arising with 
them.&nbsp; The kusala-kamma must also be of a very weak kind for the 
kusala-vipaka-citta that performed the patisandhi-kicca not to be composed with 
sobhana-cetasika, or it does not arise with alobha-cetasika or adosa-cetasika 
etc.&nbsp; Since it is the result of a very weak kusala-kamma, the past 
akusala-kamma would beleaguer (the person) and render him deformed from 
birth.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Among those who are 
born without disabilities, all are born distinctly, by family, rank and retinue 
because the kusala-vipa-citta that perform the function of patisandhi differ 
according to the strength of the kusala-kamma that are the causes.&nbsp; If a 
patisandhi-citta results from kusala-kamma with panna-cetasika of a weak kind or 
with none at all, the patisandhi-citta that is kusala-vipaka would arise with 
sobhana-cetasika together with two hetu, namely alobha-cetasika and 
adosa-cetasika, as davi-hetuka-puggala, or a person whose patisandhi-citta is 
without panna-cetasika arising concurrently.&nbsp; That person would be unable 
to&nbsp; attain jhana or lokuttara-dhamma in that lifetime.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Those whose 
patisandhi-citta result from kamma with panna and whose patisandhi-citta arise 
with panna-cetasika concurrently are ti-hetuka-puggala because there are three 
hetu namely, alobha-cetasika, adosa-cetasika and panna (amoha) -cetasika arising 
concurrently.&nbsp; Having heard the dhamma they would examine and understand it 
and be able to develop panna until they achieve jhana-citta or realize the four 
ariya-sacca-dhamma and attain nibbana and become ariya-puggala in that lifetime 
according to their accumulated conditions.&nbsp; However, one should not be 
overconfident.&nbsp; Those who are intelligent, with patisandhi-citta that are 
ti-hetuka, but neglect developing kusala, and not listening to the dhamma, would 
be wise in worldly matters, well-educated or otherwise skillful but would not 
develop panna in the dhamma and would not know the characteristics of realities 
as they truly are.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;In the distant past 
of former lives some might have been interested in the dhamma, might have 
studied the dhamma, or even have become ordained bhikkhu or samanera but to 
realize the ariya-sacca-dhamma, no one knows in which state one would attain 
ariya-sacca-dhamma, as a monk or a lay person.&nbsp; Everyone must develop 
panna, to know the characteristics of realities that are appearing as they 
really are in every lifetime until one reaches the lifetime when panna is sharp 
and strong, able to penetrate the ariya-sacca-dhamma.&nbsp; Even though once one 
might have been interested in the dhamma, its studies and applications, one 
must</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT 
size=+1>&nbsp;not forget that before the full realization of the 
ariya-sacca-dhamma there had been a great deal of amassed akusala to make one 
lose oneself in the pleasure of akusala if one were negligent.&nbsp; Therefore, 
even though the patisandhi-citta is ti-hetuka, whenever one is careless, the 
panna-cetasika of that lifetime would not develop because one did not develop it 
with listening, examining and practicing the dhamma.&nbsp; It would, therefore, 
be a pity that though the patisandhi-citta of that lifetime is ti-hetuka, panna 
is not developed, while it is uncertain which kind of kusala will result in 
which patisandhi-citta in the next life.&nbsp; It could be akusala-vipaka-citta 
causing patisandhi-citta in the apaya-bhumi; or ahetuka-kusala- vipaka-citta 
performing patisandhi as an innate disabled person; or davi-hetuka- vipaka-citta 
performing patisandhi as a davi-hetuka-puggala in the sugati-bhumi, who are 
unable to develop panna to fully realize the 
ariya-sacca-dhamma.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Therefore, it is to 
be regretted that panna is not developed further with each lifetime even though 
it were with ti-hetuka-patisandhi but since panna has not been sufficiently 
developed, there can be no realization of the ariya-sacca-dhamma in this 
lifetime.&nbsp; Not everyone who are ti-hetuka-puggala could realize the 
ariya-sacca-dhamma fully in their present existence.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;While those born 
human without handicaps are sound asleep, their bhavanga-citta would be 
sobhana-citta since their patisandhi-citta are davi-hetuka with alobha-cetasika, 
adosa-cetasika arising concurrently.&nbsp; Some, whose patisandhi-citta are 
ti-hetuka with alobha-cetasika, adosa-cetasika and panna-cetasika arising 
concurrently, while they are sound asleep, kilesa would not arise, nor would 
pleasure or displeasure since there is no seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting , 
thinking (…).&nbsp; But once awaken the akusala-citta that arise each day would 
condition gladness or sadness accordingly.&nbsp; Generally, once one is 
awake&nbsp; there would be more asobhana than kusala daily.&nbsp; Cakkhu-vinnana 
would arise to see visual objects through the eyes only an instant then 
afterwards generally akusala-javana-citta would arise for seven instants; which 
means seven times the number of the cakkhu-vinnana that performs the function of 
seeing each instant.&nbsp; The accumulation in continuation of akusala-dhamma 
each day is extremely great.&nbsp; Therefore one should not be careless.&nbsp; 
Once one had heard the dhamma that the Buddha manifested in detail about which 
instant is sobhana-citta, which asobhana and about whether asobhana-citta is 
akusala, vipaka or kiriya.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT 
size=+1><B>Question:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do the arahanta have 
asobhana-citta?</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT

Yes.</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT 
size=+1><B>Question:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do the arahanta have 
akusala-citta?</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT 
color=#993366><FONT size=+1><B>Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</B>No.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The arahanta have 
asobhana-citta but not akusala-citta because they have cakkhu-vinnana, 
sota-vinnana etc. which are asobhana-citta.&nbsp; But the arahanta do not have 
akusala-citta and kusala-citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp; There are 52 kinds 
of cetasika in all.&nbsp; They are the 13 kinds of annasamana -cetasika, or 
cetasika that are at the same level of the citta and other cetasika they arise 
with; 14 kinds of akusala-cetasika; and 25 sobhana-cetasika.&nbsp; If instead of 
using the term 'sobhana' and 'asobhana' we use ordinary language, the meaning 
will not be accurate according to realities that are sobhana and asobhana.&nbsp; 
For example, when asked whether vedana-cetasika is good, a person answered it is 
so if it is sukha-vedana.&nbsp; Sukha-vedana, from the perspective of the five 
vedana, means vedana-cetasika that arise only with kaya-vinnana-citta that is 
kusala- vipaka the instant it is in contact with pleasant bodysense arammana: 
sukhasahagatam kaya-vinnanam kusala-vipakam.&nbsp; There are no 
sobhana-cetasika, or alobha-cetasika, adosa-cetasika and panna-cetasika, arising 
concurrently.&nbsp; Thus, according to reality, the sukha-vedana that arises 
with kaya-vinnana-kusala-vipaka is asobhana, not sobhana.&nbsp; Because of this, 
the study of dhamma requires precise comprehension of the Pali terms.&nbsp; 
Otherwise, one might misunderstand the realities.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;If the question 
occurs whether the rupa appearing through the eyes at the moment is good or not, 
the answer in ordinary language would not be clear enough.&nbsp; Although the 
sight might be bright and beautiful and pleasing, the rupa is not a 
sobhana-dhamma because it is not a consciousness; not kusala or akusala.&nbsp; 
It does not have metta, karuna, mudita or any realities that are good arising 
concurrently with it.&nbsp; Only citta and cetasika can be sobhana or asobhana. 
Rupa are arammana that are paccaya for citta to arise and take pleasure or 
displeasure in them. Rupa in itself is an abyakata-dhamma: rupa knows nothing, 
not whether citta likes or dislikes it, nor does it intends to make citta like 
or dislike it, because rupa is not a consciousness.&nbsp; Citta, however, wants 
to see sight, to hear sound, to smell nice scents, and to be in contact with 
pleasing objects so that the pleasant feeling would arise again and again when 
one sees sight appearing through the eyes, hear sounds through the ears, smell 
through the nose, taste through the tongue, know bodysense contact through the 
bodysense, or even think about sight, sound, smell, taste, bodysense contact 
every single day.&nbsp; Hence the simile comparing the five khandha: 
rupa-khandha to a receptacle for pleasurable objects, vedana-khandha to 
nourishment in the receptacle, sanna-khandha and sankhara-khandha to the cook 
and his assistants preparing the food, vinnana-khandha to the person who 
partakes of the nutrition, since citta is eminent and presiding in knowing 
arammana.&nbsp; All four nama-khandha must arise together, know the same 
arammana, and be absolutely inseparable.&nbsp; There can not be one nama-khandha 
without the other three, two without the other two or three without the other 
nama-khandha.&nbsp; In the plane of the five khandha, the nama-khandha must 
depend on the rupa-khandha to arise as well.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The study of the 
dhamma regarding the diverse kinds of citta is towards the clear knowledge of 
the characteristics of citta, which are classified into different categories by 
the four jati, by the group of three [kusala-dhamma, akusala-dhamma and 
abyakata-dhamma], by hetu, by asankhara and sasankhara, by sobhana and asobhana, 
and by the distinct component cetasika.&nbsp; The aim is for sati to arise and 
be mindful of, and examine the characteristics of anatta in all realities, which 
is not the self, entity or person.&nbsp; The characteristics of each reality are 
the characteristics of distinct rupa-dhamma and nama-dhamma such as the 
uniqueness of the rupa that appears through the eyes, that through the ears, 
through the nose, the tongue, or the bodysense.&nbsp; The characteristic of the 
citta that is kusala is one, that of akusala is another, that of abyakata is yet 
another.&nbsp; The increasing comprehension would be paccaya causing sati to 
arise and be mindful, and examine the characteristics of realities appearing, 
until there is realization of the characteristics of each reality as it truly 
is, accordingly.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
