<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The fifth 
characteristics of citta is that it is called <B>“citta”</B> because it renders 
(things) intricate.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;A passage in the 
Atthasalini Atthakatha says, “Called <B>‘citta’</B> because it renders (things) 
intricate, in what way?&nbsp; True, normally nothing in this world is more 
intricate than paintings.&nbsp; Among his paintings, the painter's masterpiece 
is more artistic than the rest.&nbsp; An artistic design (citta-sanna) occurs to 
the painter while painting masterpieces that such pictures should be done in 
such fashion.&nbsp; All the intricate work that is done, such as drawing, 
coloring,&nbsp; highlighting and contrasting colors etc. would result from 
intricate sanna.&nbsp; In the masterpiece a certain intricate rupa would issue 
from these intricate actions or designs.&nbsp; The rest of the intricate 
painting would also be finished the way the artist had thought out: this rupa is 
to be above, this below, this on the sides, then the creation proceeds 
accordingly.&nbsp; All the intricate arts in the world [result from the fact] 
that the citta thinks thus.&nbsp; Similarly, the citta that renders intricate is 
called citta because of its intricate nature and actions, as described 
above.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp; In addition, citta 
is said to be even more intricate than designs in paintings because it creates 
all art according to the citta's desire.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;This is only a 
minor detail or the intricacies of paintings.&nbsp; But the intricacy of each 
person's kamma, done every day, physically, verbally and mentally, as 
kusala-kamma: dana, sila, or developing bhavana; or as akusala-kamma: panatipata 
(killing), adinnadana (stealing) etc. would vary greatly, which shows the 
characteristics of the intricacy of citta.&nbsp; Complex external rupa-dhatu 
that are intricate by being diverse plants and grains, flowers, leaves of 
different varieties, by being objects, mountains, rivers are all things 
resulting from different compositions of earth, water, fire and wind, with the 
characteristics of softness, hardness, tension and motion, flowing or adhesion 
of different levels, so that they appear as distinct intricate objects.&nbsp; 
But what is more intricate than external rupa-dhatu is the citta because citta 
is the reality that renders things intricate.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Intricate 
akusala-kamma is the paccaya that results in animals with greatly diverse 
intricate forms.&nbsp; Some are bipeds, some are quadrupeds, some are multipeds, 
while others are apods; some aquatic, some terrestrial.&nbsp; Intricate 
kusala-kamma renders humans different in complexity with sexes, forms and 
features, which gives rise to different expressions (...).&nbsp; There are a 
great number of words, languages used to describe things that show the numerous 
variety of&nbsp; intricacies existing, resulting in as many expressions to call 
things that appear in such complexity.&nbsp; And words are endless and infinite 
because more things made intricate by citta continually occur.&nbsp; Therefore, 
ever more words must be coined to call them.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;One should learn 
that each day wherever one is, whatever one sees or says, is the evidence of the 
intricacy of citta, that rendered the distinct object intricate.&nbsp; The 
Buddha told us to be mindful of the characteristics of the citta of the moment, 
when one sees the diverse complexities that citta renders intricate.&nbsp; The 
citta of this instant, right now, is rendering things intricate further into the 
future.&nbsp; One should not think uniquely of the intricacy of external things 
rendered intricate by citta.&nbsp; The Buddha told us to be mindful of the 
characteristics of the citta that is evolving in the present moment as 
cittanupassana-satipatthana.&nbsp; The knowledge of the characteristics of citta 
must be known at the instant of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, thinking, 
which must be based on one of the six dvara.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Everyone 
thinks.&nbsp; Whenever citta thinks thoughts, those thoughts exist only in the 
instant one is thinking.&nbsp; Citta is a thinking reality.&nbsp; When can one 
know the characteristics of citta if not in the present instant of seeing, 
hearing, smelling,&nbsp; tasting, knowing bodysense contact and thinking right 
now?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;In the 
Samyuttanikaya Khandhavaravagga 2nd Gaddulasutta, 259, the Buddha said, Behold 
Bhikkhu, entities are impure because of impure citta.&nbsp; Entities are purer 
because of bright and clear citta.&nbsp; Behold Bhikkhu, have you seen the citta 
which is called carana (wandering)?&nbsp; The Bhikkhu answered, Yes, 
Sire.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;How does citta 
wander?&nbsp; Through the eyes to see, the ears to hear, the nose smell, the 
tongue taste, bodysense to know contact and mind to think.&nbsp; It seems that 
everyone likes to travel.&nbsp; No one likes to stay in the same old place 
because one wants to see sights, hear sounds, smell, taste, have diverse 
bodysense contact.&nbsp; Therefore, citta would arise and wander through 
different arammana, through distinct dvara, the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, 
bodysense and mind, never to be still.&nbsp; Can the citta of anyone keep 
still?&nbsp; If one knows the characteristics of realities as they truly are, 
one must realize that citta arises to know one arammana or another and then 
falls away.&nbsp; That is knowing characteristics of realities as they truly 
are.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The passage 
continues: the Buddha said citta is thus called carana.&nbsp; You have thought 
with the citta.&nbsp; The citta (is that which thinks) is more intricate even 
than it is carana.&nbsp; Therefore you should examine your citta constantly to 
see if the citta is unclean with raga, dosa or moha, through eternity.&nbsp; 
Entities would be unclean because of impure citta.&nbsp; Entities would be pure 
because of right and clean citta.&nbsp; Behold Bhikkhu, we would not consider 
any kind of reality as intricate as the distinct kinds of animals.&nbsp; Behold 
Bhikkhu, these animals think with the citta.&nbsp; The citta is even more 
variegated than these animals.&nbsp; Because of this you should examine your own 
citta constantly to see whether the citta is impure with raga, dosa or moha, 
through eternity.&nbsp; Behold Bhikkhu, entities would be unclean because of 
impure citta.&nbsp; Entities would be pure because of right and clean 
citta.&nbsp; Behold Bhikkhu, the dyer or the painter that possesses dying 
equipment, lac, tumeric, green and red colors could draw pictures of women or 
men, complete with every organ, great and small, on a clean board or wall or 
cloth.&nbsp; Behold Bhikkhu, so could the ordinary person who has not heard [the 
dhamma] cause rupa to arise when he wishes; cause vedana to arise when he 
wishes; cause sanna to arise when he wishes; cause sankhara to arise when he 
wishes; cause vinnana to arise when he wishes.&nbsp; Behold Bhikkhu, what do you 
think of this?&nbsp; Is the rupa permanent or not?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1><B>Bhikkhu: 
  No</B>, Sire.</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT

<CENTER><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The 8th sutta 
ends.</FONT></FONT></FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The painter uses 
colors to depict different rupa rendering intricate distinct pictures.&nbsp; The 
instant of citta each person is like an artist painting rupa-khandha, 
vedana-khandha, sanna-khandha, sangkhara-khandha, vinnana-khandha to arise in 
the future.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Everyone is 
distinct according to intricacies done in the distant past in the same way that 
citta which is rendering things intricate this instant would result in 
distinctly birth, gender, form and figure, fame and fortune, happiness and 
unhappiness, blame and praise in the future.&nbsp; Therefore one should examine 
the characteristics of the citta appearing which is designing future 
realities.&nbsp; If one is not mindful of the characteristics of the citta at 
this instant, one would not know how truly intricate it is.&nbsp; Though one is 
sitting here, citta would arise in continuation so rapidly.&nbsp; We are sitting 
here but sometimes not only do citta see through the eyes, hear through the 
ears, but there is also citta that think far beyond depending on where the 
thought would travel, or perhaps thinking of creating something 
intricate.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp; In the passage in 
the first Gaddulasutta, 256, the Buddha said, Behold Bhikkhu, a dog tied with a 
rope or chained to a sturdy tether or post would run round the tether or 
post.&nbsp; When it stands, it would stand near the tether or post.&nbsp; Such 
are people who have not heard.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The artist would 
take the painting he created as an object the way that the citta of the ordinary 
person takes rupa for entities, persons, the selves and continues to be attached 
to them in every birth, every lifetime, like a painter who is attached to his 
paintings.&nbsp; As long as the ordinary person does not know the 
characteristics of rupa, vedana, sanna, sangkhara, vinnana, which are realities 
that truly arise and fall away, filled with the self, he would stand near rupa, 
vedana, sanna, sangkhara, vinnana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;A passage&nbsp; in 
the Saratthappakasini Atthakatha Samyuttanikaya Sagathavagga Marasamyutta 
Dutiyavagga the sixth Pattasutta helps us understand the words of the Buddha 
when he manifested the dhamma so that the Bhikkhu would realize, embrace [the 
teachings], take heart and be of good cheer as follows.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Here is the 
analysis in the sixth Pattasutta.&nbsp; Then the Buddha made the Bhikkhu 
realize, embrace [the teachings], take heart and be of good cheer with the 
dhamma about the five upadana-khandha.&nbsp; The Bhikkhu willingly bent 
their&nbsp; minds to achievement, listening attentively.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The word 
<B>“embrace”</B> means to accept, to understand, to examine correctly.&nbsp; 
This is the manifestation of the dhamma by the Buddha for the benefit of right 
understanding, that is, once one has heard, to embrace, to understand, to 
examine correctly that kusala-dhamma is kusala-dhamma, akusala-dhamma is 
akusala-dhamma.&nbsp; If the Buddha had not manifested in detail, many might 
take akusala-dhamma for kusala-dhamma.&nbsp; Because the characteristics of 
kusala-dhamma are not those of akusala-dhamma, and vice-versa, the Buddha always 
manifested the dhamma minutely about the five upadana-khandha, namely citta, 
cetasika and rupa categorized into rupa-khandha, vedana-khandha, sanna-khandha, 
sangkhara-khandha and vinnana-khandha.&nbsp; No matter where one is, one would 
never be beyond the five khandha.&nbsp; So one should study them and consider 
them logically and thoroughly, take them correctly and not misunderstand 
them.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The expression 
<B>“to take heart”</B> is to have diligence in accepting.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;To be able to 
understand realities as they truly are is neither easy nor fast.&nbsp; But the 
dhamma that the Buddha manifested is to make us accept, take heart and have 
diligence in examining until understanding arise, until sati arises and is 
mindful of the characteristics of the realities till there is full realization 
of the characteristics of realities that are appearing normally as they truly 
are.&nbsp; The Buddha did not manifest an unverifiable theory, or something that 
is not appearing before us, but about cakkhu-vinnana, seeing, sight that appears 
through the eyes; he manifested sota-vinnana, the reality that hears sound and 
the sound that comes into contact with the ears; he manifested the dhamma that 
exist, appear for us to prove.&nbsp; Therefore those who have heard the dhamma 
can be heartened or diligent in its study and examining to know the 
characteristics of realities that appear until there is realization of the 
distinct dhamma according to the realities that the Buddha had 
manifested.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The expression 
<B>“to be of good cheer”</B> is to be bright and cheery, flourishing with the 
qualities that one had thoroughly penetrated.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Have you accepted, 
taken heart and been of good cheer?&nbsp; One can be bright and cheery while 
kusala-citta arises.&nbsp; Some are unhappy because they worry that they are 
already aged but sati-patthana has arisen very little.&nbsp; That instant is 
akusala.&nbsp; The Buddha did not manifest the dhamma for the people to have 
more akusala or lots of worries but for people to accept, take heart and be of 
good cheer.&nbsp; All akusala arise because of causes and conditions.&nbsp; They 
cannot be stopped.&nbsp; Each time there is akusala of one kind or another 
arising, that akusala has already occurred.&nbsp; But one can be cheery when 
sati is mindful of the</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT 
color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;characteristics of the akusala that 
appears.&nbsp; One can study and examine the characteristics of the akusala 
appearing to find out that even the akusala-dhamma is not an entity, person or 
the self.&nbsp; When sati arises to be mindful of the characteristics of the 
akusala that is appearing, one could clearly see the instant that the sati is 
being mindful is not all impure because there is no clinging to the akusala 
appearing at that moment as the self, as us, so we would not worry or be 
bothered.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The only way to 
attenuate and abandon akusala-dhamma that arise and not to increase worry is by 
sati being mindful, take note and examine to find that distinct akusala-kamma 
realities are not us, not the self, entity or person.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The word 
<B>“achievement”</B> means examine to know that this aim we can achieve.&nbsp; 
Thus it is the benefit of that teaching.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;To develop 
sati-patthana is not something to be discouraged about.&nbsp; Realities that are 
appearing can be penetrated as realities that arise and fall away, not the self, 
entity or person.&nbsp; In that instant when we examine to find out that the 
benefit can be attained one would not be hopeless since we know that one day we 
can attain it, even if not today.&nbsp; Do not worry that one could never 
clearly know realities today.&nbsp; Sati can start to be mindful today but to 
clearly realize and penetrate the characteristics of realities would happen one 
day since today sati is able to arise and be mindful.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;When one sees that 
the dhamma manifested by the Buddha as beneficent or <B>'attainable to us'</B>, 
one would not be discouraged, and would listen, study realities that the Buddha 
manifested about in more and&nbsp; more detail so as not to forget to be 
mindful.&nbsp; A passage in the Atthakatha Kathavatthu Sasanakathavannana asks, 
Can the Buddha's doctrine be recomposed or altered?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<CENTER><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366>(everyone should consider 
this.)</FONT></FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;All ariya-dhamma, 
such as sati or teachings about kusala-dhamma, are called doctrine.&nbsp; In 
such doctrine, other than the dhamma such as sati-patthana manifested by the 
Buddha, is there any doctrine composed by others that present alternate dhamma 
as the sati-patthana, or akusala-dhamma as kusala-dhamma?&nbsp; Has such 
doctrine ever existed or can it exist in the future?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;This means whether 
the dhamma manifested by the Buddha can be manifested by others who can 
recreate, alter or change realities that the Buddha had manifested as 
sati-patthana etc., or whether anyone can take akusala- dhamma as kusala-dhamma 
and teach others about it, make a new religion by making other kinds of dhamma 
into sati-patthana etc.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;When we have 
considered and understood the reason, we could know that the teachings, that the 
Buddha had become omnisciently enlightened with and manifested, can never be 
changed.&nbsp; None can changed the distinct dhamma that he was enlightened with 
and manifested into other things.&nbsp; Some might misunderstand them but they 
could never change the true characteristics of the dhamma.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;<B>In essence</B>, 
the five meanings of citta, which in the Abhidammatthavibhavini manifested as 
six, the extra one saying that citta is intricate because of the intricacy of 
arammana.&nbsp; This is because citta is able to know every kind of 
arammana.&nbsp; No matter how intricate the reality is, it could be still the 
arammana of citta.&nbsp; Even if the arammana is not paramattha-dhamma, for 
example words or conventional terms in different languages, they can be known by 
citta; citta can have names, words, stories as arammana.&nbsp; Therefore, citta 
is intricate because of arammana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The two 
characteristics of citta are 1) samannalakkhana (common characteristics) and 2) 
sabhavalakkhana (special characteristics).</FONT></FONT></FONT>
