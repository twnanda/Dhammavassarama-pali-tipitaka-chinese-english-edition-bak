<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Citta differ by 
their sampayutta-dhamma, or the cetasika that arise concurrently with them,

  The citta arises with dukkha-vedana-cetasika (unpleasant bodysense 
  feeling)</FONT></FONT></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT 
color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Each time a citta arises there must be 
vedana-cetasika arising concurrently.&nbsp; Therefore vedana-cetasika of one 
kind or another would arise with a citta and while the citta is chief and 
dominant in realizing fully the different characteristics of arammana, the 
vedana-cetasika is the reality that feels glad or sad, happy or unhappy, or 
indifferent while knowing arammana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Since citta are 
differentiated by jati as kusala, akusala, vipaka and kiriya, the cetasika that 
arise concurrently would be of the same jati as that citta.&nbsp; 
Akusala-cetasika could not arise with kusala-citta, vipaka-citta or 
kiriya-citta.&nbsp; Kusala-cetasika could not arise with akusala-citta, 
vipaka-citta or kiriya-citta.&nbsp; Nor could vipaka-cetasika arise with 
akusala-citta, kusala-citta or kiriya-citta.&nbsp; Therefore vedana-cetasika are 
also distinguished by being kusala, akusala, vipaka and kiriya like all other 
cetasika.&nbsp; However, the Buddha did not manifest the characteristics of each 
reality in detail so there could be those who misunderstand the characteristics 
of vedana-cetasika such as physical dukkha-vedana, which are feelings of 
sickness, aches and pains, which arise with the kaya-vinnana-citta, the citta 
that knows bodysense contact, that arises just an instant of citta, unlike the 
feeling of domanassa (unpleasantness) when in contact with the physically 
unpleasant arammana.&nbsp; Since each instant of citta differs in detail by the 
vedana-cetasika arising with it, the Buddha manifested precisely which vedana 
arises concurrently with a distinct kind of akusala-citta, kusala-citta, 
vipaka-citta and kiriya-citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><B><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The instant there is 
pain there is dukkha-vedana through the bodysense which is akusala-vipaka, while 
the instant there is unhappiness, perturbation, and worry because of 
dukkha-vedana, there is no vipaka.&nbsp; At that instant there is akusala-vedana 
arising with akusala-citta so there is unhappiness.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The conscientious 
study of the Abhidhamma would make us correctly understand the characteristics 
of vedana-cetasika that arise with the citta, or else one would be deceptively 
attached to somanassa-vedana, sukha-vedana or upekkha-vedana without recognizing 
which instant of vedana is kusala, which akusala, which vipaka or which is 
kiriya.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;In the 
Anguttaranikaya Ekanipata Dutiyapannasaka Sanimitta the third vagga, 328, there 
is a passage saying: Behold, Bhikkhu, dhamma that is sinful akusala arises 
because there is vedana.&nbsp; Without vedana, it does not arise. By abandoning 
the vedana the dhamma that is sinful akusala would no longer 
be.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;(Other passages are 
about sanna-cetasika, which is the sanna-khandha, other cetasika that are 
sankhara-khandha and the citta which are vinnana-khandha.)</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;This shows that the 
vedana-cetasika, which are feelings, are the basis of tenacious 
attachments.&nbsp; Since there is no knowledge of the truth about 
vedana-cetasika, one cannot abandon the feeling that there is 
oneself.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The knowledge of 
the characteristics of vedana-cetasika would condition and support sati to arise 
and know the characteristics of vedana.&nbsp; Otherwise one would not realize 
that every day there is vedana in the same way that each day there are only 
realities that appear through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind, 
only because citta arise to know these realities.&nbsp; But imagine if one does 
not feel anything, when one sees the world there would be no perturbation.&nbsp; 
If one does not feel any emotion after hearing, one would not feel disturbed 
either.&nbsp; And the same applies to smelling, tasting, knowing bodysense 
contact, there would be no akusala of any kind.&nbsp; But because feelings 
arise, there is attachment and clinging to the feelings and desiring the objects 
that make us feel glad and happy, which cause akusala-dhamma to arise frequently 
without our awareness.&nbsp; All dhamma are anatta and none can prevent 
vedana-cetasika from arising.&nbsp; Whenever citta arises there must be 
vedana-cetasika that feels the arammana of the moment.&nbsp; Even now there must 
be vedana-cetasika of one kind or another being upekkha-vedana, sukha-vedana, 
dukkha-vedana, somanassa-vedana or domanassa-vedana.&nbsp; The aim of studying 
dhamma is not merely to know the number or names but the characteristics of the 
feelings one is having.&nbsp; If sati does not arise to be conscious of the 
feelings that we are having now, even though that feeling is real: it has arisen 
and fallen away, since we do not know the true characteristics of that feeling, 
we would take it for the selves, which are happy, unhappy, glad, sad or 
indifferent.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Therefore as long 
as sati does not arise to be mindful of the characteristics of feelings or 
emotions, there is no way to abandon attachment to realities as entities, 
persons, or the selves, because each would cling to feelings as important 
factors of life.&nbsp; Everyone desires pleasant emotions.&nbsp; No one wants 
unhappy feelings.&nbsp; Therefore no matter how, one would endeavor to make 
sukha-vedana or somanassa-vedana arise without realizing that in that instant 
there is attachment clinging to feelings that arise because of causes and then 
fall away.&nbsp; Since feelings are important things to which all are attached, 
the Buddha manifested that the vedana-cetasika alone is the vedana-khandha 
because it is an important reality that is taken for the self, the entity, the 
person.&nbsp; For the sati to arise and be conscious of the characteristics of 
the truly existing realities that appear, one must rely on studying and 
listening to more and more detailed accounts about realities, examine and prove 
them in daily life also.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;There are 4 jati of 
vedana-cetasika comprising 1) vedana that is kusala,&nbsp; 2) vedana that is 
akusala, 3) vedana that is vipaka and 4) vedana that is kiriya. Vedana is a 
sankhata-dhamma, arising from causes and conditions that compose it. Vedana that 
is vipaka arises from kamma as paccaya. Vedana that are kusala, akusala or 
kiriya are not vipaka.&nbsp; Therefore they do not arise from kamma as paccaya, 
but from other conditions.&nbsp; From the perspective of the five vedana, the 
sukha-vedana, as well as the dukkha-vedana through the bodysense, are of the 
vipaka-jati, arising as result of kamma.&nbsp; The vipaka-vedana-cetasika arises 
from past kamma as paccaya, to know arammana that is in contact with the eyes, 
ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind according to the kind of the distinct 
vipaka.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;When seeing, the 
cakkhu-vinnana is a vipaka-citta arising concurrently with upekkha-vedana, which 
is a vipaka-cetasika, and other vipaka-cetasika.&nbsp; The sota-vinnana, the 
ghana-vinnana, the jivha-vinnana are of the same nature.&nbsp; But the 
kaya-vinnana-akusala-vipaka, which clearly knows the characteristics of the 
photthabbarammana that is in contact with the body, arises concurrently with 
dukkha-vedana and the kaya-vinnana-kusala-vipaka arises concurrently with 
sukha-vedana.&nbsp; No one can change the vedana that arise with distinct kinds 
of citta. Kaya-vinnana arises because of kamma as paccaya: when kayappasada-rupa 
comes into contact with a mahabhuta-rupa (cold, heat, softness, hardness, 
tension or motion) that is ittharammana, sukha-vedana would arise.&nbsp; When 
kayappasada-rupa is in contact with a mahabhuta-rupa that is anittharammana, 
dukkha-vedana would arise.&nbsp; The feeling that arises at the bodysense is 
only either dukkha-vedana or sukha-vedana.&nbsp; It cannot be upekkha-vedana, 
somanassa-vedana or domanassa-vedana at all.&nbsp; One must separate bodily and 
mental feelings.&nbsp; While there is kaya-vinnana, sukha-vedana or 
dukkha-vedana are of vipaka-jati, or the result of past kamma.&nbsp; But the 
moments of trouble, worry and anxiety are the feelings of unhappiness, they are 
not the result of past kamma but that of accumulations of akusala-dhamma, which 
cause unhappy, unpleasant feelings to arise.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><B><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Other than 
dukkha-vedana and sukha-vedana which are only of vipaka-jati, and 
domanassa-vedana which is of uniquely akusala-jati, other vedana, 
somanassa-vedana and upekkha-vedana, can be of other jati: kusala, akusala, 
vipaka or kiriya.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT 
color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp; This is the difference which shows that 
realities would arise according to conditions.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Has one ever been 
mindful of vedana?&nbsp; At this instant vedana is arising and falling 
away.&nbsp; Some might have begun to be mindful and know the characteristics of 
realities that are appearing through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and 
bodysense.&nbsp; Others might begin to be aware of the characteristics of 
nama-dhamma which is a consciousness, while seeing, smelling, tasting, knowing 
bodysense and thinking.&nbsp; But that is not enough because sati must be 
mindful of the characteristics of realities that are appearing through all five 
khandha, namely rupa-, vedana-, sanna-, sankhara- and vinnana-khandha.&nbsp; 
Since sati is not really conscious of the characteristics of realities, it 
cannot eradicate kilesa because kilesa is not something which can be eradicated 
by ignorance, or without sati or real and complete comprehension and 
consciousness of the characteristics of the realities 
appearing.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Is there 
vedana-cetasika while we sleep?&nbsp; It is very beneficial to think about and 
examine dhamma because the more one does so, the more clearly one would 
understand.&nbsp; Thus one should consider whether there is feeling while one is 
asleep.&nbsp; While one is fast asleep, one does not know arammana of this world 
no matter through eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense or mind.&nbsp; One does 
not think nor dream.&nbsp; While one is not dead, one must have bhavanga-citta 
that arises and falls away to maintain that lifetime of that person until one 
awakens and continues to see the world till the time one sleeps again.&nbsp; 
While fast asleep one does not know anything of this world, no matter through 
the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense or mind that one used to see, hear, like 
and think of.&nbsp; While fast asleep there is no arammana appearing but the 
citta still continue to arise and fall away, the four nama-khandha, or the citta 
and cetasika, must arise concurrently inseparably.&nbsp; While deeply sleeping, 
there is vipaka-citta, the result of past kamma, which is why a sleeping person 
is not yet dead since vipaka-citta arise and fall away in continuation.&nbsp; 
Whenever citta arises there must always be cetasika concurrently arising.&nbsp; 
Vedana-cetasika arises with all citta.&nbsp; The vedana-cetasika that arises 
with the bhavanga-citta is a vipaka-cetasika that feels the same arammana as the 
bhavanga-citta, that is the arammana not of this world.&nbsp; Thus one is not 
conscious as one is when the citta is seeing through the eyes or hearing through 
the ears, for example.&nbsp; None could know the characteristics of the 
vedana-cetasika that arises while is fast asleep.&nbsp; But when one is awake 
one should consider what is awake as when one is asleep, one should ponder what 
is asleep. Rupa is not a consciousness, therefore it does not awaken or 
sleep.&nbsp; But nama-dhamma is a consciousness.&nbsp; When it does not know 
arammana that appears in this world, it is said to sleep.&nbsp; But the citta 
continue to arise and fall away, maintaining this lifetime so that one is not 
yet dead.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The instant of 
wakefulness, what is awake?&nbsp; Citta and cetasika are awake by arising to 
know arammana through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind.&nbsp; 
Whenever one knows arammana of this world, one is awake yet one should examine 
things more conscientiously for the purpose of developing sati-patthana.&nbsp; 
The purpose of manifesting the dhamma is to assist sati to be mindful of the 
characteristics of the realities appearing and the viriyarambhakatha or words 
that are beneficial to the arising of viriya to be mindful of characteristics of 
realities that appear.&nbsp; Therefore one should examine whether while awake 
citta and cetasika arise to know arammana of this world the way we understand it 
to.&nbsp; One should think even more profoundly: what is awake?&nbsp; Citta and 
cetasika arise and awake together. Vipaka-citta inevitably arise to experience 
that which appear through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue or bodysense. 
Vipaka-citta is the result of kamma.&nbsp; It arises and falls away.&nbsp; Can 
one stay asleep forever?&nbsp; That is not possible.&nbsp; Kamma does not cause 
one to be born in this lifetime to sleep until death.&nbsp; But kamma are 
conditions for one's eyes, ears, nose, tongue and bodysense to be paccaya for 
citta to arise and see pleasant things as the results of kusala-kamma, 
unpleasant things as results of akusala-kamma; hear pleasant things as the 
results of kusala-kamma, unpleasant ones as results of akusala-kamma 
etc.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Vipaka-citta and 
cetasika therefore arise to know arammana through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, 
bodysense and mind in daily life.&nbsp; What else is there other than 
this?&nbsp; When one is awake, other than vipaka-citta arising to see, hear, 
smell, taste, know bodysense contact, the akusala-kamma or kilesa begin to 
awaken because while sleeping there is still anusaya-kilesa or kilesa that has 
not been eradicated which has been accumulated in all bhavanga-citta that arise 
and fall away. While one is asleep, kilesa does not arise to perform the 
function of feeling emotions because there is not yet seeing, hearing, smelling, 
tasting, knowing bodysense contact of any kind of this world.&nbsp; While fast 
asleep, all kilesa are asleep also.&nbsp; But when awakened, so are the kilesa: 
after seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, knowing bodysense contact, the kilesa 
would arise concurrently with akusala-citta in accordance with the causes and 
conditions that make akusala- dhamma of a certain kind arise.&nbsp; Is that 
good?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Since citta are 
categorized into 4 bhumi, namely kamavacara-bhumi, rupavacara-bhumi, 
arupavacara-bhumi and lokuttara-bhumi.&nbsp; The citta would be finer 
respectively of the levels.&nbsp; But most people's citta are of the 
kamavacara-bhumi, evolving in sight, sound, smell, taste and bodysense contact. 
Kamavacara-bhumi is the lowest level of citta that is, when one wakes up one 
would see, hear, alternately from one sense-door to the other through the eyes, 
ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind.&nbsp; Each day the citta that arise are 
not only of the lower bhumi but also of a lower jati: they are akusala-citta 
that awake each day when the kusala-citta does not arise.&nbsp; When one sees, 
one is pleased, attached.&nbsp; When one hears, one is content and attached to 
the sound heard normally because in general lobha-mula-citta arises more often 
than dosa-mula-citta, which is a coarse, unpleasant characteristic of 
citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;One might admit 
that daily there are more akusala-citta arising than kusala-citta.&nbsp; If one 
does not realize that one could not develop kusala to escape the bad aspect of 
citta and remain full of akusala-citta as always and even be pleased with 
akusala without seeing the harm in it.&nbsp; One should then realize that when 
one wakes up generally kilesa awaken through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, 
bodysense and mind depending upon how troublesome a person's kilesa are and how 
much mental or physical disturbance and unease they can cause.&nbsp; Realizing 
one should increasingly endeavor to develop kusala.&nbsp; Whether dana, sila, 
peace of the citta or any level of sati-patthana that is mindful of realities 
appearing.&nbsp; Not that anyone can abandon lobha and then develop panna to 
become the sotapanna afterwards.&nbsp; Though lobha arises, it is a reality that 
arises because of condition and not an entity, a person or the self.&nbsp; Panna 
must be mindful of the characteristics of lobha as it really is: a reality that 
arises and falls away.</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR>&nbsp;

  arise with citta that are either kusala, akusala, vipaka or 
  kiriya.</FONT></FONT></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT 
color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Domanassa-vedana cannot arise with citta that are 
kusala, vipaka or kiriya.&nbsp; It can only arise with those that are akusala or 
only the 2 dosa-mula-citta.&nbsp; If one does not know this, one might mistake 
akusala as kusala.&nbsp; For example, when one pities people who are in trouble 
and wishes to help them to escape their misfortune, the instant of citta when 
karuna arises is kusala-citta arising concurrently with karuna-cetasika.&nbsp; 
One should know whether there is any unpleasant feeling in the characteristics 
of vedana.&nbsp; If there is domanassa or sorrow and unpleasant feeling, then it 
is akusala-citta and not the same instant as citta arising concurrently with 
karuna-cetasika.&nbsp; With this knowledge one would attenuate the feeling of 
sorrow, domanassa and unpleasantness, which is akusala and be able to help 
others to escape their misfortune with pleasure, not with domanassa or 
sorrow.&nbsp; Therefore one must know which instant is akusala to relinquish 
it.&nbsp; Generally one misunderstands that when one pities a person in trouble 
one should also feel sorrow and suffering in sympathy with that person.&nbsp; At 
that moment if one is asked what one feels, some might say neutral, some glad 
others uneasy.&nbsp; Even while sati is being mindful directly of the 
characteristics of the feeling, it is still difficult to really know the truth 
that the feeling is only a consciousness, a kind of nama-dhamma that arises with 
every citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;When sound appears, 
sota-vinnana-citta is the consciousness that hears the sound, at that instant 
there is vedana-cetasika that feels, arising simultaneously with the 
sota-vinnana-citta.&nbsp; When phassa-cetasika arises in contact with the 
arammana nothing can prevent vedana-cetasika from arising.&nbsp; When sati is 
able to begin to be mindful of the characteristics of the citta or the 
vedana-cetasika, it would become accumulating and beneficial paccaya so that one 
would not forget [to be mindful].&nbsp; Therefore when one feels indifferent, 
glad, happy, sorrow or regret, instead of increasing the feeling, the sati would 
be mindful that the instant is only a feeling that arises because of causes and 
conditions.&nbsp; Therefore sati-patthana is beneficent in the attenuation and 
abandonment of sufferings in moments of unpleasantness.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
