<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Samatha-bhavana is 
not the practice of samadhi.&nbsp; Samadhi is the reality that is steadfast in 
the arammana which is the ekaggata-cetasika that arises with all citta.&nbsp; 
When they are obsessed with the arammana over long periods of time, the 
characteristics of ekaggata-cetasika would appear as samadhi, or unwaveringly 
steadfast to a certain arammana.&nbsp; The ekaggata-cetasika that arise with 
akusala-citta are miccha-samadhi.&nbsp; Those that arise with kusala-citta are 
samma-samadhi.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;To practice samadhi 
so that the citta is engrossed with a certain arammana for long periods of time 
is miccha-samadhi when not composed with panna because at that moment there is 
pleasure in having that citta steadfast with only one arammana. Without panna 
there cannot be knowledge of the differences between lobha-mula-citta and 
kusala-citta because the lobha-mula-citta and the kamavacara-kusala-citta have 
the same kind of vedana arising concurrently with them:</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The 8 
lobha-mula-citta have 4 upekkha-vedana and 4 somanassa-vedana arising 
concurrently.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The 8 
kamavacara-citta have 4 upekkha-vedana and 4 somanassa-vedana arising 
concurrently.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Therefore any 
instant that upekkha-vedana or somanassa-vedana arises it is difficult to know 
whether the citta is lobha-mula-citta or mahakusala-citta when it is neutral, 
not irritated or when there is somanassa, pleased and 
happy.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The differences 
between the 8 lobha-mula-citta and the 8 mahakusala-citta are with the 
lobha-mula-citta there are akusala-cetasika concurrently arising while with the 
mahakusala-citta there are sobhana-cetasika.&nbsp; The akusala-cetasika that 
manifest the differences between the lobha-mula-citta and mahakusala-citta is 
the miccha-ditthi, wrong view and the obhana-cetasika that manifest the 
differences between the kusala-citta and lobha-mula-citta is the samma-ditthi, 
which is panna-cetasika.&nbsp; Therefore the differences between the 8 
lobha-mula-citta and the 8 mahakusala-citta are</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Of the 8 
lobha-mula-citta, 4 arise with ditthi-cetasika and 4 
without.</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT 
size=+1>&nbsp;Of the 8 mahakusala-citta, 4 arise with panna-cetasika and 4 
without.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Therefore those who 
wish to develop samatha-bhavana would have to know the differences between 
lobha-mula-citta and kusala-citta otherwise they would practice samadhi with 
lobha-mula-citta as miccha-samadhi since it is not composed with 
panna.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Generally those who 
practice samadhi do not want the citta to be agitated, irritated or troubled 
with different events.&nbsp; They are pleased to have the citta steadfast in an 
arammana without knowing that while there is still need for citta to be absorbed 
in the desired arammana there is no 
mahakusala-nana-sampayutta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp; To develop 
samatha-bhavana is to develop mahakusala-nana-sampayutta.&nbsp; Those who wish 
to develop samatha-bhavana are those with panna to see the harm of both lobha 
and dosa, not only to see the harm of dosa-mula-citta which are only worries and 
troubles.&nbsp; Those who do not know kilesa and do not see the harm of lobha 
would not develop samatha-bhavana.&nbsp; Therefore those who develop 
samatha-bhavana would be straightforward with the panna to see the harm of lobha 
and have sati-sampajanna to know the different instants of lobha-mula-citta as 
opposed to mahakusala-nana-sampayutta to be able to develop further 
mahakusala-nana-sampayutta until akusala-citta cannot interpose as 
upacara-samadhi then attain appana-samadhi or the pathama-jhana-kusala-citta 
comprising 5 principal elements of jhana as follows: vitakka, vicara, piti, 
sukha and ekaggata.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;To develop 
samatha-bhavana to increase mahakusala-nana-sampayutta-citta until it becomes 
bases for pathama-jhana-kusala-citta, which is rupavacara-kusala is very 
difficult to achieve since it requires a person who is not abhabba-puggala, or 
one who would not be able to attain jhana-citta or lokuttara-citta even having 
developed samatha-bhavana or vipassana-bhavana.&nbsp; Those who are 
bhabba-puggala, or who, having developed samatha- or vipassana-bhavana, would be 
able to attain jhana-citta or lokuttara-citta, must be people 
who</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;1. are without 
vipaka as obstacles or whose patisandhi-citta must be ti-hetuka with 
panna-cetasika arising concurrently with.</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT 
face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1></FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp; 2. are without 
kamma as obstacles or have never performed one of the 5 anantariyakamma, which 
are obstacles to heaven, magga and bala.&nbsp; The 5 anantariyakamma are 
matricide, patricide, arahanticide, causing contusion to the Buddha and 
destroying the unity of the Sangha to perform sangha-kamma 
together.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;3. are without 
kilesa as obstacles or do not have the 3 niyata-miccha-ditthi, namely 
natthika-ditthi, ahetuka-ditthi and akiriya-ditthi.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Even when the 
patisandhi-citta is ti-hetuka, composed with panna but if one is pleased with 
sight, sound, smell, taste, bodysense contact without seeing the harm one would 
not think of attenuating the pleasure with the development of sila and 
bhavana.&nbsp; Therefore to develop samatha-bhavana to the level of 
upacara-samadhi and appana-samadhi is not easy.&nbsp; Just to be preoccupied 
with a chosen arammana does not make it mahakusala-nana-sampayutta that would 
enable one to attain upacara-samadhi.&nbsp; If one mistakes the lobha-mula-citta 
as mahakusala, one would believe that the various nimitta that the citta compose 
as images of hell, heaven, locations and events are upacara-samadhi and 
appana-samadhi, which are distinct levels of jhana-citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Therefore samatha-bhavana 
is a very intricate matter and must be studied to really 
understand.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp; Each day when 
there is seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, knowing bodysense contact and 
thinking there are more akusala-citta arising than kusala-citta.&nbsp; The 
kusala-citta that arises would evolve in dana and sila for only short moments 
each day, each month.&nbsp; Those who see the harm in akusala-citta would 
develop the citta to increase the kusala in the moments that are not dana and 
sila.&nbsp; Each day the development of the citta in order to make it peaceful 
from the akusala is the kusala-bhavana in daily life.&nbsp; Even though one 
might not be able to attain the levels of upacara-samadhi and appana-samadhi, it 
is something worth developing.&nbsp; But to restrain the citta from akusala must 
be with panna that knows how the citta can be calm while seeing, hearing, 
smelling, tasting, knowing bodysense contact and thinking, otherwise 
kusala-citta cannot arise.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The citta that is 
calm from akusala as samatha-bhavana must be kusala-citta with the 40 arammana 
namely 10 kasina, 10 asubha, 10 anusati, aharepatikulasanna, 
catudhatuvavatthana, 4 brahmavihara and 4 arupa-jhana- 
arammana.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Is the citta that 
thinks of earth kusala or akusala?&nbsp; Without panna arising at the instant of 
thinking of earth, it is akusala that wants to think of, be concentrated on 
earth.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;When panna arises, 
the citta that is mindful of earth is kusala.&nbsp; When one knows that all rupa 
that appear cannot be without the earth element.&nbsp; All desirable objects 
there ever were are of only earth.&nbsp; Knowing the real essence of things on 
earth that used to bring pleasure, desire as only earth would attenuate pleasure 
in things, in the instant one is mindful that it is only 
earth.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;For citta to be 
kusala mindful of only earth is difficult because when the arammana comes into 
contact with the eyes, ears, nose, tongue or bodysense, the mind would follow 
the arammana instantly.&nbsp; Therefore the development of samatha-bhavana to 
make the citta peaceful from akusala, more steadfast must depend on the location 
which is quiet, without the disturbances from noises people make; and to make 
the earth a smooth round circle (pathavi-kasina), without defilements that make 
the mind bend towards and take pleasure in forms and features (see details in 
the Visuddhimagga Samadhi-niddesa Pathavi-kasina).&nbsp; While focusing on the 
pathavi-kasina, as the citta is mindful of earth and composed with panna, is 
mahakusala-nana-sampayutta, it would be peaceful.&nbsp; And one must focus on 
the pathavi-kasina to remind one to be mindful only of earth and continuously 
for the citta not to know other arammana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;How difficult to be 
mindful only of earth with the citta that is peaceful from all akusala by 
focusing on pathavi-kasina that is not too small nor too big, not too far nor 
too near, not too high nor too low.&nbsp; Therefore vitakka-cetasika would be 
the indispensable principal element of jhana.&nbsp; The vitakka-cetasika that 
arises with mahakusala-nana-sampayutta must approach the pathavi-kasina with a 
citta that is peaceful from all akusala both with the eyes closed and open, 
until the uggaha-nimitta, or the nimitta of pathavi-kasina, would appear through 
the mano-dvara like in the instant the eyes are open.&nbsp; For some, even with 
patisandhi-citta as ti-hetuka, the uggaha-nimitta never appears. Uggaha-nimitta 
would appear when the mahakusala-nana-sampayutta had increased its peacefulness, 
steadfast in the pathavi-kasina.&nbsp; But even the instant that uggaha-nimitta 
appears, upacara-samadhi has not yet been attained.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;It is far from easy 
to support and assist the mahakusala-nana-sampayutta-citta to be firmly 
established in the uggaha-nimitta continuously and more steadfastly.&nbsp; 
According to the passage in the Visuddhimagga Pathavi-kasina-niddesa, when all 
the nivarana (the akusala-dhamma that overpowers the citta) has died down one by 
one, the citta would be peaceful and steadfast as upacara-samadhi when 
patibhaga-nimitta appears as if emerging from the uggaha-nimitta. 
Patibhaga-nimitta is a brighter and clearer nimitta than uggaha-nimitta.&nbsp; 
When the patibhaga-nimitta appears, the mahakusala-nana-sampayutta-citta would 
be steadfastly peaceful to the level of upacara-samadhi or samadhi close to the 
tightly clasped arammana of the appana-samadhi, which is the 
pathama-jhana-citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;To support and 
assist the mahakusala-nana-sampayutta-citta that is peaceful to the level of 
upacara-samadhi, to continue to be peaceful and increase the peacefulness to be 
more steadfast unto the level of appana-samadhi, which is a citta of the 
rupavacara level as a pathama-jhana-citta to arise, the acquired upacara-samadhi 
must be maintained even as a virtuous lady keeping her treasured pregnancy, 
which is the birthplace of an emperor and must abstain from hetu that are not 
sappaya (dhamma that are convenient and beneficent to the development of 
bhavana) comprising these 7:</FONT></FONT></FONT>

strength of the extremely well-trained, efficient jhana-citta so that the citta 
can be willed to cause mahakusala-nana-sampayutta-citta to arise and recall with 
success moment upon respective past moment.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Only those who 
conscientiously study and understand the causes and results of supernatural 
abilities would be able to distinguish between the real and false supernatural 
qualities.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;To develop 
samatha-bhavana is not to eradicate kilesa complete because it is not the 
realization of the characteristics of realities as they truly are 
normally.&nbsp; When the jhana-citta does not decline and the jhana-vithi-citta 
arises before the cuti-citta, it becomes the kamma-paccaya for 
jhana-vipaka-citta to patisandhi in distinct levels of brahma-bhumi.&nbsp; But 
when the life span of those brahma-bhumi are over, they would have to return to 
this very same kind of existence, with pleasure, satisfaction and attachment in 
sight, sound, smell, taste and bodysense contact.&nbsp; To have accumulated some 
development of samatha-bhavana in former lives through samsara-vatta might give 
some people premonitions, for example.&nbsp; As for people who practice 
meditation and see diverse visions, since it is not the development of 
samatha-bhavana with mahakusala-nana-sampayutta-citta that is peacefully 
steadfast in the arammana respectively until it becomes, with extreme 
difficulty, jhana-citta of distinct levels, it would not be supernatural 
qualities that are uttarimanussadhamma or qualities that exceed the ordinary 
human's.&nbsp; Therefore, when those who practice meditation see different 
things and events, it is the minor result, perhaps right perhaps wrong, of 
meditation which is not the development of samatha-bhavana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The development of 
samatha-bhavana to attain even the level of upacara-samadhi is extremely 
difficult because normally when any arammana comes into contact with the eyes, 
ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind, one would be led by the arammana with 
lobha, dosa or moha.&nbsp; The kusala evolving with dana, sila or bhavana are of 
a tiny proportion compared to the akusala that frequently and rapidly arise in 
daily life through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind.&nbsp; Nor 
can the development of samatha-bhavana eradicate kilesa.&nbsp; The instant 
kilesa arise to overpower the citta the samatha-bhavana that has been developed 
with such perseverance to attain the ability to perform miracles would 
degenerate.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Before the 
enlightenment of the Buddha, there were people who developed samatha-bhavana to 
the attainment of nevasannanasannayatana-jhana and trained the citta until they 
acquired supernatural powers of sight, hearing,&nbsp; recalling past lives and 
the ability to perform miracles.&nbsp; Still, they were unable to realize the 
ariya-sacca-dhamma since they had not developed the cause, namely 
vipassana-bhavana, to perfection to be paccaya for the realization of the 
ariya-sacca-dhamma.&nbsp; And some continue to have wrong view and cling to 
practices that do not lead to the realization of the ariya-sacca-dhamma even 
after the Buddha had become enlightened and manifested the dhamma and among 
those who realized the ariya-sacca-dhamma and became the ariya-savaka, there are 
more who had not attained jhana-citta with the principal elements of jhana, than 
those who had (Samyuttanikaya Sagathavagga Vangisasamyutta Pavaranasutta 
745).</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Thus it is evident 
how difficult it is to correctly develop the right 
samatha-bhavana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR>&nbsp;
