<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The arising and 
falling away of the citta and vithi-citta constitutes normal everyday 
life.&nbsp; However, since there are dhamma terms for their characteristics and 
functions, it confuses us because we do not understand the meanings of the 
technical terms.&nbsp; Nevertheless, those words only represent the 
characteristics of realities in daily life.&nbsp; Therefore, dhamma are not in 
text books but in real life, each time that we are seeing, hearing, smelling, 
tasting, experiencing body sense contact or thinking.&nbsp; Right now, we are 
all seeing.&nbsp; We know now that it is the vithi-citta namely avajjana-citta, 
cakkhu-vinnana-citta, sampaticchanna-citta, santirana-citta, votthapana-citta 
and javana-citta arising and falling away in series.&nbsp; Understanding the 
dhamma would remind us that the javana-vithi-citta that arises when we see, 
hear, or smell etc. are kusala or akusala that arise and fall away, accumulating 
its own continuum and latent tendencies.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The study of the 
four jati of citta, arising as kusala, akusala vipaka and kiriya, tells us which 
citta is the cause for vipaka-citta to arise in the future, and which citta is 
the vipaka or result of a cause that had been done in the past.&nbsp; To study a 
citta to know whether it is a vithi-citta or not, one must also know the jati of 
that citta.&nbsp; For example, the <B>patisandhi-citta</B> is a 
<B>vipaka-citta</B>.&nbsp; It is the result of one of the kamma that we did in 
the past, which is the paccaya for the patisandhi-citta to arise in continuation 
from the cuti-citta from the last lifetime.&nbsp; The patisandhi-citta is a 
vipaka-citta that performs patisandhi-kicca only an instant in each lifetime, in 
any plane.&nbsp; It cannot do so again in that being, only in the first instant 
that arises in sequence to the cuti-citta of the previous lifetime.&nbsp; Then 
the patisandhi-citta falls away.&nbsp; It does not last.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;When the 
patisandhi-citta, which is a vipaka-jati, has fallen away, it is the 
anantara-paccaya for the next citta to arise in continuation immediately.&nbsp; 
The consecutive citta performs bhavanga-kicca.&nbsp; It is then not a 
vithi-citta.&nbsp; Bhavanga-citta is a vipaka-citta.&nbsp; Therefore, kamma is 
not only the paccaya for the patisandhi-citta to arise and fall away, but it 
also causes vipaka-citta to arise and perform the bhavanga-kicca in 
continuation.&nbsp; The first bhavanga-citta that arises in sequence to the 
patisandhi-citta is called <B>pathama-bhavanga</B>.&nbsp; The following bhavanga 
up to the cuti-citta is innumerable.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The sequence of 
bhavanga that arises and falls away continues until the vithi-citta 
arises.&nbsp; First of all is the vithi-citta that performs avajjana-kicca, 
which is either of the two avajjana-citta, namely the panca-dvaravajjana-citta, 
which perform avajjana-kicca through the panca-dvara, and the 
mano-dvaravajjana-citta, which performs avajjana-kicca through the 
mano-dvara.&nbsp; These two citta are kiriya-citta.&nbsp; They are neither 
kusala, akusala nor vipaka because they can know both ittharammana, or pleasant 
arammana, and anittharammana, or unpleasant arammana.&nbsp; As vipaka-citta, the 
akusala-vipaka would only know anittharammana and kusala-vipaka only 
ittharammana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The Atthasalini 
manifested the characteristics of kiriya-citta as only action, and has defined 
their characteristics distinguished by their functions as 
follows:</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Any kiriya-citta 
that is not a javana-citta would not bring any results, like a wind flower 
(vata-pupphan?or, according to the Muladika, mogha-pupphan, meaning fruitless 
flower).&nbsp; Some flowers, when they have fallen, do not bear fruits, 
likewise, the kiriya-citta.&nbsp; <B>The kiriya-citta that is not a 
javana-vithi-citta is either of the panca-dvaravajjana-citta or the 
mano-dvaravajjana-citta.</B>&nbsp; The panca-dvaravajjana-citta performs the 
single function of avajjana-kicca through the panca-dvara.&nbsp; The 
mano-dvaravajjana-citta performs two functions: the avajjana-kicca of the 
mano-dvara and the votthapana-kicca of the panca-dvara.&nbsp; All the other 
kiriya-citta that are javana-citta are the citta of the arahanta, which is 
compared by the Atthasalini as follows: <B>Any citta that is javana (or the 
kiriya-javana-vithi-citta of the arahanta) does not bear fruit like the flower 
of a rootless tree thereby being only action</B> because it evolves with the 
power to accomplish the action.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp; <B>Those who are 
not arahanta have only two kinds of kiriya-citta: panca-dvaravajjana-citta and 
mano-dvaravajjana-citta.</B></FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>All kiriya-citta other 
than these two are citta of the arahanta.&nbsp; Therefore, the arahanta possess 
the two kiriya-citta which are not javana-citta, panca-dvaravajjana-citta and 
mano-dvaravajjana-citta; while their javana-vithi are composed uniquely of 
kiriya-citta, because the arahanta have eradicated all kusala and akusala and 
thus do not have any javana-vithi-citta that are kusala or 
akusala.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;In the process of 
the vithi-citta that knows arammana through the eyes, when the 
panca-dvaravajjana-citta has fallen away, the seeing consciousness, or the 
cakkhu-vinnana-citta, is a vipaka-citta resulting from a past kamma.&nbsp; 
Kusala kamma is the condition for the cakkhu-vinnana-kusala-vipaka to see 
pretty, pleasant rupa that appear through the eyes as ittharammana.&nbsp; 
Akusala kamma is the condition for the cakkhu-vinnana-akusala-vipaka to see 
ugly, unpleasant rupa that appear through the eyes as anittharammana.&nbsp; The 
vithi-citta that hears sound through the ears is a sota-vinnana, also a 
vipaka-citta.&nbsp; No one knows what the sota-vinnana would hear at any given 
moment.&nbsp; All this according to causes, or the kamma done in the past.&nbsp; 
While one smells through the nose, the ghana-vinnana-citta that knows smell is a 
vipaka-citta.&nbsp; When one tastes through the tongue, the jivha-vinnana-citta 
is a vipaka-citta.&nbsp; While experiencing body sense contact, the 
kaya-vinnana-citta that knows cold, heat, softness, hardness, tension, motion 
are vipaka-citta.&nbsp; They result from past kamma and are now paccaya for 
vipaka-citta to arise and experience arammana passed on from 
panca-dvaravajjana-citta.&nbsp; Then when the panca-vinnana-citta that sees, 
hears, smells, tastes or experiences body sense contact has fallen away, it 
becomes the anantara-paccaya for the sampaticchanna-citta to arise and know the 
arammana in turn.&nbsp; Sampaticchanna-citta is also a vipaka-citta because it 
is the result of the same kamma that conditioned the cakkhu-vinnana-citta to 
arise.&nbsp; When the sampaticchanna-citta has fallen away, the same kamma would 
make the santirana-citta, which is a vipaka-citta, to arise and perform 
santirana-kicca subsequently.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Therefore, the 
vithi-citta which are vipaka-citta, arising through panca-dvara, namely the 
cakkhu-, sota-, ghana-, jivha- and kaya-vinnana, the sampaticchanna and 
santirana, do not accumulate continuance (of latent tendencies).&nbsp; They are 
only the result of kamma that arise to perform their individual function then 
fall away.&nbsp; Then the votthapana-citta, namely the mano-dvaravajjana-citta, 
performs the function of votthapana-kicca through the panca-dvara.&nbsp; The 
votthapana-citta is a kiriya-citta which performs the function of 
votthapana-kicca, then falls away, without accumulating tendencies.&nbsp; After 
the votthapana-citta has fallen away, the next citta to arise is the 
javana-vithi-citta, which performs the function of running through the arammana 
as kusala-citta or akusala-citta in those who are not the arahanta.&nbsp; For 
the arahanta, there are kiriya-citta.&nbsp; The javana-vithi-citta arise and 
fall away seven instants, they, therefore, are the moment that one accumulates 
tendencies, which are actually the present moment.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The Atthasalini, 
the commentary of Dhammasangani-pakarana, presents an analogy of the arising and 
experiencing an arammana of the vithi-citta through the panca-dvara as follows: 
"A king sleeps on a royal bed with an attendant massaging his feet, a deaf 
doorman standing at the door, and three guards standing in a row.&nbsp; Then a 
peasant, bearing tribute, comes to knock upon the door.&nbsp; The deaf doorman 
does not hear, so the attendant massaging the king's feet signals, upon which 
the deaf doorman opens the door.&nbsp; The first guard receives the tribute and 
hands it to the second, who passes it on to the third.&nbsp; The third guard 
presents it to the king who partakes of the tribute."&nbsp; This analogy 
demonstrates the process of<B> vithi-citta</B> that arises to experience the 
arammana: the instant the arammana comes into contact with the cakkhuppasada is 
comparable to the peasant bearing tribute to the door.&nbsp; The attendant 
massaging the king's feet is like the <B>panca-dvaravajjana-citta</B> that knows 
there is a visitor knocking.&nbsp; So he signals or [the avajjana-citta] 
perceives the arammana coming into contact and falls away.&nbsp; The 
<B>cakkhu-vinnana-citta</B> then arises in sequence to see through the 
cakkhuppasada.&nbsp; After that the first guard, or the 
<B>sampaticchanna-citta</B>, receives the tribute and passes it on to the 
second, or the <B>santirana-citta</B>, who then passes it on to the third or 
<B>votthapana-citta</B>.&nbsp; The third presents it to the king, or 
<B>javana-citta</B>, and the king absorbs the tribute, or that 
<B>arammana</B>.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;This 
personification clarifies that the kicca or <B>function of arammana is only to 
come into contact with the dvara.</B>&nbsp; The peasant does not enter into the 
presence of the king but the tribute is passed from the first to the second then 
the third guard until it reaches the monarch.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Only the 
cakkhu-vinnana-citta performs the function of seeing the arammana in contact 
with the dvara.&nbsp; The arammana can only impinge upon the pasada-rupa.&nbsp; 
The citta arises in sequence to know the arammana while the arammana cannot 
penetrate beyond pasada.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;When we consider 
this analogy, we could understand the comparison of each vithi-citta that arises 
to perform distinct functions: the cakkhu-vinnana-citta performs the function of 
seeing at the cakkhuppasada-rupa, which is a cakkhu-dvara, like a doorman 
opening the door to look out.&nbsp; The sampaticchanna is the first guard that 
receives the tribute and hands it to the second because after the 
cakkhu-vinnana-citta has performed its function of seeing, it falls away.&nbsp; 
The cakkhu-vinnana-citta cannot receive the arammana the way the 
sampaticchanna-citta does since it can only perform its function of seeing, or 
[the doorman] only sees at the door, or the pasada-rupa.&nbsp; The 
sampaticchanna-citta is like the first guard to perform the function of 
receiving arammana and passing it on to the second or santirana, which examines 
the arammana and passes it on to the votthapana-citta to judge.&nbsp; Then the 
latter presents it to the king, or the javana vithi-citta, to absorb or partake 
of the tribute.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The word "absorb" 
or "partake of" are used to truly clarify the characteristics of kusala- or 
akusala-citta that performs javana-kicca through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, 
body sense or mind.&nbsp; The javana-citta is one that absorbs the arammana with 
lobha, dosa, moha or kusala, or again with the kiriya-citta of the 
arahanta.&nbsp; The javana-citta performs the function of running through the 
arammana not by seeing, receiving, examining or judging it because the preceding 
citta have already done so.&nbsp; Thus they become the paccaya for kusala-citta, 
akusala-citta or kiriya-citta to arise and absorb or run through the arammana 
for seven consecutive instants.&nbsp; The javana-vithi-citta is, therefore, the 
vithi-citta that actually partakes of the arammana.&nbsp; When the process is 
mogha-vara, even with the contact of sound on the sotappasada, there would be no 
hearing.&nbsp; Or when it is the votthapana-vara, the kusala-citta, 
akusala-citta or kiriya-citta would not arise, so how can there be absorption of 
the arammana since the javana-citta did not arise?&nbsp; When the 
javana-vithi-citta arises, it absorbs the arammana because it arises in a series 
of seven of the same kind of citta, whether kusala-javana-vithi-citta, 
akusala-javana-vithi-citta or kiriya-javana-vithi-citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;That the 
javana-vithi-citta arises and falls away absorbing arammana for seven instants 
in a series is because of paccaya, respectively: the first javana-citta is the 
asevana-paccaya for the second javana-vithi-citta to arise and absorb the 
arammana once more.&nbsp; The second javana-vithi-citta is then the 
asevana-paccaya for the third javana-vithi-citta to absorb the arammana still 
again.&nbsp; And so on until the seventh javana-vithi-citta, which is not an 
asevana-</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT 
size=+1>&nbsp;paccaya.&nbsp; The asevana-paccaya is akusala-javana-vithi-citta, 
kusala-javana-vithi-citta or kiriya-javana-vithi-citta that causes the citta of 
the same jati to arise and repeat the javana-kicca.&nbsp; Therefore the former 
is powerful enough to cause akusala-citta and kusala-citta to become 
kamma-paccaya resulting in vipaka-citta in the future as well as become the 
upanissaya-paccaya for future akusala-javana-vithi, kusala-javana-vithi or 
kiriya-javana-vithi to arise.&nbsp; The accumulation of diverse akusala to ever 
greater, denser proportions causes us to become obsessed the moment we open our 
eyes.&nbsp; When there is bhavanga-citta, we do not know arammana through either 
eye, ear, nose, tongue, body sense or mind because thinking or dreaming is 
through the mano-dvara and not bhavanga-citta.&nbsp; Therefore, while there is 
the bhavanga-citta, we do not know any arammana of this world.&nbsp; Although 
this world does not appear at all, there is still anusaya-kilesa.&nbsp; Not 
knowing any arammana of this world does not mean there is no kilesa, because 
there are three levels of kilesa:</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Anusaya-kilesa is the 
minutely fine kilesa that accumulates like sediment in the 
citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Pariyutthana-kilesa is 
the medium kilesa that arises with the javana-vithi-citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Vitikkakama-kilesa is the 
coarse kilesa that arises with the javana-vithi-citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Thus even the citta that 
is not the javana-vithi-citta also has anusaya-kilesa except for that of the 
arahanta that does not have any kilesa at all.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>We should know that 
whenever javana-vithi-citta arises to see that which appears through the eyes, 
hear which appears through the ears, smell through the nose, taste through the 
tongue, experience body sense contact through the body or think through the 
mind, the javana-vithi-citta then accumulates the latent tendencies both of 
akusala and kamavacara-kusala and 
kamavacara-kiriya-javana-vithi.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
