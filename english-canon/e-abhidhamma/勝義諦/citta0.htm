<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;In times past, at 
Salavana where the Malla princes of Kushinara paused to repose, Buddha the 
Arahanta, the Supremely Enlightened, attained nibbana between the twin Sala 
trees, ending every opportunity for all worldly creatures to hear the teachings 
of dhamma from his lips.&nbsp; The Buddha left the dhamma that he had manifested 
and established to be preceptor in his stead when he ceased his existence with 
absolute nibbana.&nbsp; (Digha-nikaya Mahavagga 
Mahaparinibbanasutta)</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Buddhists would pay 
the highest respect to the Buddha's supreme dhamma according to their knowledge 
and comprehension thereof.&nbsp; "For even those that had seen his person, that 
had heard the dhamma teachings from his lips, or even those who had held the rim 
of his clothing as they followed in his footsteps; if they did not know the 
dhamma or see the dhamma, then they had not seen him."&nbsp; (Khuddaka-nikaya 
Itivuttaka Sanghatisutta)</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Buddhism, the 
teachings of the Buddha, comprises three levels:</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>1. <B>Theory</B> 
(Pariyatti) The study of the Dhamma-vinaya (the Buddhist 
teachings)</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT 
size=+1>2.<B> Practice</B> (Patipatti) The development of the dhamma which 
eradicates kilesa (defilements) and dukkha (sufferings)</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>3. <B>Attainment</B> 
(Pativedha) Realization of the dhamma which eradicates defilements and 
sufferings</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The Buddha's word 
"to see" in "Anyone who sees the dhamma is said to have seen theTathagata," 
means seeing, experiencing and attaining the dhamma (truth, reality, that which 
really exists) that the Buddha became enlightened with: the attainment of the 
nine supramundane dhamma (lokuttara-dhamma).&nbsp; The attainment results from 
developing the dhamma at the practice level, which, in turn, is based on the 
theory level.&nbsp; Therefore, the Pariyatti or the study of the Dhamma-vinaya, 
is the sarana (support), the path leading to the development and the attainment 
levels of Buddhism respectively.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The Buddha's dhamma 
teachings have been passed on from the disciple arahanta through the generations 
by rote until set down in writing.&nbsp; The Dhamma-vinaya was organized into 
three divisions called the Tipitaka as follows:</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>1 <B>The 
Vinaya-pitaka</B></FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT 
color=#993366><FONT size=+1>2 <B>The Sutta-pitaka</B></FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>3 <B>The 
Abhidhamma-pitaka</B></FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The Vinaya-pitaka 
concerns primarily codes of conduct, behavioral regulations for a higher level 
of purity; the Sutta-pitaka dhamma precepts he taught different people in 
various places; the Abhidhamma-pitaka aspects of realities including the causes 
and results of all dhamma.&nbsp; The Buddha was enlightened in all aspects of 
realities, including their causes and results.&nbsp; From the time of his 
enlightenment to the time of his Parinibbana (complete termination of 
existences), he taught the dhamma in which he was omnisciently enlightened, to 
benefit worldly creatures, with peerless knowledge, absolute purity and 
boundless benevolence.&nbsp; The Buddha had accumulated parami (omnipotent 
qualities) to achieve enlightenment as the Sammasambuddha (the Supremely 
Enlightened) with sampada&nbsp; (plenitude, accomplishment, accumulations to the 
fullest), namely Hetu-sampada, Phala-sampada and Sattupakara-sampada.&nbsp; 
(Abhidhammatthavibhavinitika)</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1><B>Hetu-sampada</B>, 
plenitude of causes (roots) is the accumulation of omnipotent qualities unto 
fullest accumulations, for the enlightenment and attainment of 
buddhahood.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1><B>Phala-sampada</B>, 
plenitude of results (fruits) comprises the following four:</FONT></FONT></FONT> 

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>1.&nbsp; 
<B>Nana-sampada</B>, the Magga-nana, which is the basis of his omniscience 
(Sabbannuta-nana) and his ten supreme intellectual powers (Dasabala-nana), for 
example; of which the foundation is the Magga-nana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>2.&nbsp; 
<B>Pahana-sampada</B>, the eradication of all defilements including vasana, 
which is improper behavioral and verbal habits which can be eradicated by none 
but the Sammasambuddha.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>3.&nbsp; 
<B>Anubhava-sampada</B>, preeminence in the accomplishment of 
aspirations.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>4.&nbsp; 
<B>Rupa-kaya-sampada</B>, the physical attributes comprising the 
mahapurisa-lakkhana and anubyanjana (major and minor characteristics of the 
Great Man), which are propitious for all the world to 
perceive.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Once the causes, which 
are Parami, reach plenitude, they condition the plenitude of results: the 
enlightenment of the Sammasambuddha.&nbsp; His buddhahood not only eradicates 
his own sufferings, the omnipotence which he had accumulated towards 
enlightenment and omniscience of dhamma was in order to manifest the dhamma and 
render the veneyyasatta (one for whom enlightenment is possible) free from 
sufferings also.&nbsp; If he had accumulated omnipotence merely to eradicate his 
own sufferings, he would not have had the appellation of Sammasambuddha since 
there are two natures of buddha:</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>1.&nbsp; The 
<B>Sammasambuddha</B>&nbsp; who spontaneously attains enlightenment with supreme 
knowledge of all realities, without having heard the dhamma before, who achieves 
omniscience in that dhamma and who achieve mastery in all dhamma that are 
might.&nbsp; (Puggalapannatti-pakarana Ekaniddesa, 
Navakaniddesa)</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>2.&nbsp; The 
<B>Pacceka-buddha</B>&nbsp; who spontaneously attains enlightenment with supreme 
knowledge of all realities, without having heard the dhamma before but who does 
not achieves omniscience in that dhamma and does not achieve mastery in the 
dhamma that are might.&nbsp; (Puggalapannatti-pakarana Ekaniddesa, 
Navakaniddesa)</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Therefore the 
accumulation of causes or Parami towards the achievement of buddhahood as 
result, differs proportionately.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT 
size=+1><B>Sattupakara-sampada</B> includes the plenitude of graciousness and 
perseverance in always assisting worldly creatures, even entities that have done 
wrong such as Devadatta; in waiting for maturity in those whose wisdom faculty 
is not yet mature; and in manifesting the dhamma which would render beings free 
from all sufferings without regard to fame and fortune.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>When the Buddha had 
achieved plenitude of causes and results, he freed the veneyyasatta from 
sufferings, thus rendering plenary the Sattupakara-sampada.&nbsp; Becoming the 
Sammasambuddha is the plenitude of all three sampada.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Thus the dhamma 
that the Buddha taught is the dhamma in which he was enlightened.&nbsp; The 
enlightenment rendered him without defilements and he manifested the dhamma in 
which he was enlightened so that those who practice accordingly would also 
eradicate their defilements.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Therefore Buddhists 
should study and examine to know the dhamma and the truth that he became 
enlightened with, and how the latter differs from the truth as we imagine or 
understand it to be.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The truth in which 
he was enlightened and which he taught so that Buddhists might understand and 
practice accordingly unto realization thereof, is that all things that appear 
are only dhamma of different kinds and natures, not the self, not an entity, nor 
a person.&nbsp; All dhamma arise because there are conditions for the 
arising.&nbsp; Greed, anger, sorrow, suffering, happiness, envy, stinginess, 
benevolence, beneficence, seeing, hearing etc. are all only different realities, 
distinct because of the diverse conditions from which they 
arise.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;That greed, anger, 
and other realities that arise are mistaken for the self, the entity or the 
person constitutes wrong perception and comprehension, because the dhamma arises 
and falls away, ends, changes ceaselessly from birth to death.&nbsp; That they 
are misconceived as the self, entity or person is because of ignorance in the 
truth about dhamma.&nbsp; At the moment of seeing, the seeing which is only a 
kind of reality is taken for the self, hence "we see".&nbsp; When hearing, that 
reality is taken for the self, hence "we hear".&nbsp; When smelling, that 
reality is taken for the self, hence "we smell".&nbsp; When tasting, that 
reality is taken for the self, hence "we taste".&nbsp; When thinking anything, 
that reality is taken for the self, hence "we think", etc.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>When the Buddha was 
enlightened in the truth about all realities, he taught Buddhists that realities 
are not the self, entity nor person but paramattha-dhamma, (the ultimate reality 
or truth); they are realities each with distinct characteristics.&nbsp; None can 
change the characteristics of a specific reality, whether one knows it or 
not.&nbsp; Whether one calls a reality such a word in such language or not call 
it anything at all, the reality remains unchangeable characteristics.&nbsp; 
Whatever reality arises, it arises because of conditions and then falls away, as 
he manifested the dhamma to the Venerable Ananda, <B>"That which has arisen, has 
existed and was conditioned, [that reality] is common to destruction."&nbsp; 
</B>(Dighanikaya Mahavagga Mahaparinibbanasutta)</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;When ignorance 
leads to misunderstanding and believing the reality which arises and falls away 
to be the self, entity or person, it therefore leads to ever-increasing pleasure 
and attachment to social status, title, birth, extraction, caste etc.&nbsp; In 
fact, what we see are only different colors that appear to the eye, and not the 
self, entity or person; sounds that we hear are not the self, entity or person 
but diverse realities that arise because of distinct 
conditions.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>To mistake realities for 
the self, entity or person is parallel to travelers in a place where they see 
mirages before them, but as they approach the mirages disappear, since in 
reality there is no water.&nbsp; The mirages seen are false, illusions as is the 
way realities are mistaken for the self, entity or person from ignorance, from 
memory or from attachment thereof.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The words 
"animals", "persons", "women", "men", and such are pannatti (conventional terms) 
to indicate things seen or heard.&nbsp; In addition, it can be seen that diverse 
objects, sounds, smells, cold, heat, softness, hardness, tension, motion and 
thoughts, however intricate, can not be perceived if there were no realities to 
experience them, as follows: seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, physical 
feeling (cold, heat, softness, hardness, tension, motion), cognition of objects 
and thinking.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Realities that 
experience things such as colors, sounds, smells, tastes, cold, heat, softness, 
hardness, tension, motion, cognition and thoughts on various subjects are what 
the Buddha called citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR>&nbsp;

another kind of reality that arises concurrently with a citta, experiences the

cetasika</B>.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

reality that is not intelligence such as colors, sounds, smells and

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;<B>Nibbana</B> is 
the reality that eradicates defilements and ends sufferings.&nbsp; There are no 
conditions for nibbana; it, therefore, does not arise or fall 
away.</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;When sight is seen 
through the eyes, the eyes do not see anything.&nbsp; Eyes are just a condition 
for seeing, which is a citta, to arise.&nbsp; When sound reaches the ears, the 
ears are not citta because neither sound nor ears are conscious of 
anything.&nbsp; The reality that hears or perceives the sound is a citta.&nbsp; 
Therefore,<B> the citta-paramattha is the reality that experiences colors, 
sounds and diverse things.&nbsp;</B> The paramattha-dhamma, the reality that 
truly exists, is abhidhamma (the omnipresent supreme truth), anatta (non-self), 
not under anyone's control: the reality that evolves according to causes and 
conditions.&nbsp; Even if the Buddha had not been born and enlightened, 
realities would have evolved according to causes and conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
(Anguttaranikaya Uppadasutta)&nbsp; The Buddha is the supreme preceptor because 
he became spontaneously enlightened in all dhamma: that the dhamma are not the 
self, entity or person; and that the dhamma are not under anyone's control 
whomever.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The word "abhi" 
means great.&nbsp;<B> Abhidhamma means the great realities.&nbsp; [These 
realities are great] because they are selfless, not under anyone's 
control.&nbsp;</B> When the Buddha became enlightened, he taught the dhamma in 
which he was omniscient, together with the causes and conditions thereof, 
detailing the characteristics of each reality.&nbsp; He respected the dhamma 
that he was enlightened with .&nbsp; (Sanyuttanikaya 2nd Garavasutta)&nbsp; Nor 
did he preach that all realities were under his control, but that even he could 
not render anyone free from sufferings, or enlighten anyone miraculously.&nbsp; 
Only the practice of dhamma is the condition for the attainment of magga, phala 
or nibbana and the end of sufferings for those who exercise 
it.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Paramattha-dhamma 
or abhidhamma are not realities beyond understanding because paramattha-dhamma 
are realities that truly exist. Therefore, the right understanding is to know 
the truth of paramattha-dhamma according to the characteristics of distinct 
paramattha-dhamma.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Citta is the 
paramattha-dhamma which arises to experience colors, sounds, smells, tastes, 
touches, and other objects according to the type of citta.&nbsp; For example, 
the citta that arises through the eye to see colors is one type of citta; the 
citta that arises through the ear to hear is another type; the citta that arises 
to physically feel cold, heat, softness, hardness, tension, motion is another; 
the citta that arises to think diverse subjects is still another.&nbsp; This 
according to the kind of and the condition from which the citta 
arises.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;At the moment the 
citta is seeing something, not only is there citta, which sees, nor is there 
only the object of the seeing, but <B>there must be both the seeing citta and 
its object</B>.&nbsp; When there is an object being seen, manifestly, at that 
moment there is also seeing consciousness, or citta.&nbsp; But if attention is 
solely directed at the object or thing that is being seen, then the truth, that 
the object seen can only appear because citta arises to do the seeing, will not 
be known.&nbsp; Similarly, when thinking, the subject of thought is a word that 
the citta is thinking of at that moment.&nbsp; <B>When the citta arises to 
experience an object, the object of that citta is called 
arammana.</B></FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The word arammana 
or alambana in the Buddha's dhamma teachings means that which the citta 
experiences.&nbsp; When a citta that arises sees a visual object, the visual 
object is the arammana of that citta.&nbsp; Whenever a citta arises to hear 
sound, the sound is the arammana of that citta.&nbsp; Whenever a citta arises to 
smell, the smell is the arammana of that citta.&nbsp; Whenever a citta arises to 
taste, the taste is the arammana of that citta.&nbsp; Whenever a citta arises to 
feel cold, heat, softness, hardness, tension and motion, the cold, heat, 
softness, hardness, tension and motion is the arammana of that citta.&nbsp; 
Whenever a citta arises to think about diverse subjects, those subjects are the 
arammana of that thinking citta.&nbsp; Every time there is a citta, there is 
always an arammana accompanying it.&nbsp; Whenever a citta arises, it must 
experience arammana.&nbsp; Citta cannot arise without experiencing arammana, nor 
can there be citta, the conscious reality, without arammana, that which is 
experienced.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Citta, which is the 
reality that experiences arammana, does not exist only in Buddhism or in human 
beings.&nbsp; The seeing citta, the hearing citta, for example, are 
paramattha-dhamma, without nationalities.&nbsp; The conventional terming that 
"This person sees, that entity hears etc." is based on rupa and memory.&nbsp; If 
there were no rupa and memory, then there would be no such conventional terming 
about the seeing consciousness and the hearing consciousness as "This person 
sees, that entity hears".&nbsp; Citta is paramattha-dhamma.&nbsp; No matter to 
which entity or person that seeing citta belongs, that seeing consciousness 
which arises must see what appears through the eyes.&nbsp; The hearing citta 
must hear sounds: the seeing citta cannot hear, and the hearing citta cannot 
experience that which appears through the eyes.&nbsp; No one has the power to 
control or change paramattha-dhamma's characteristics and conditions in any 
way.&nbsp; Citta, which is paramattha-dhamma that arises to experience arammana, 
arises because there are conditions for it.&nbsp; When there are no conditions, 
citta cannot arise.&nbsp; For example, when no sound arises through the ears, 
hearing consciousness cannot arise; when smell does not arise through the nose, 
smelling consciousness cannot arise.&nbsp; Each kind of citta can only appear 
when there are conditions for that type of citta to arise.&nbsp; Thus, citta 
that arise are distinguished into 89 kinds or 121 kinds in specifics.&nbsp; But 
there is not one, but always multiple conditions, for each distinct kind of 
citta.&nbsp; For example, seeing consciousness arises because of conditions; 
which are eyes or the eyesense, and rupa or the visual 
object.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Citta is a 
paramattha-dhamma that is not rupa.&nbsp; Whichever paramattha-dhamma is not 
rupa, that paramattha-dhamma is a nama-dhamma (mental phenomenon, intelligence, 
consciousness, a reality which experiences and knows; nama).&nbsp; Citta, 
cetasika and nibbana are nama-dhamma.&nbsp; Rupa is rupa-dhamma (physical 
phenomenon, which cannot experience anything). (Dhammasanganipakarana 
Nikhepakandha)</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;When the citta 
arises to experience arammana, <B>another kind of nama-paramattha arises to 
experience the same arammana simultaneously.&nbsp; That nama-paramattha is 
cetasika-paramattha.&nbsp;</B> Cetasika are, for example, anger, love, 
happiness, suffering, stinginess, jealousy, benevolence and beneficence.&nbsp; 
These realities are cetasika-paramattha, not 
citta-paramattha.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Anger, love, 
happiness, suffering are characteristics that really exist; they are not the 
selves, entities or persons but realities that must arise with citta.&nbsp; 
Cetasika arises at the same time as citta, falls away simultaneously, 
experiences the same arammana and arises at the same place as the citta; 
wherever citta arises and falls away, there also does the cetasika.&nbsp; 
Without citta, the cetasika, such as anger, love, and unhappiness, cannot 
rise.&nbsp; There are 52 kinds of cetasika.&nbsp; Anger (dosa), for example, is 
a cetasika, with coarse and fierce characteristics.&nbsp; Love, (lobha), is 
another kind of cetasika, characterized by clinging, not relinquishing, and 
desire for the arammana.&nbsp; We can see that each type of cetasika is a 
distinct kind of reality, not the same type of conditioned reality.&nbsp; Not 
only are their characteristics different, but the functions of each kind of 
cetasika differ and the results or symptoms that appear differ, as do the 
conditions that cause each kind of cetasika to arise.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Citta-paramattha 
and cetasika-paramattha are nama-dhamma that experience arammana and arise 
concurrently.&nbsp; Cetasika arises at the same time, falls away simultaneously, 
experiences the same arammana and arises at the same place as the citta.&nbsp; 
Wherever citta arises and falls away, there also does the cetasika.&nbsp; Citta 
and cetasika do not separate; one paramattha does not arise and fall away 
without the other.&nbsp; Citta is dominant, presiding in experiencing 
arammana.&nbsp; But while the diverse cetasika that arise with the citta 
experience the same arammana that the citta does, they have distinct 
characteristics and duties in experiencing the arammana according to each 
cetasika's characteristics and functions.&nbsp; Because each citta that arises 
is accompanied by different numbers of cetasika with each cetasika being of a 
different nature; therefore, citta differs into 89 or 121 kinds in 
specifics.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Each kind of citta is 
distinct from the others by experiencing different arammana, by functioning 
differently, or by the accompanying cetasika.&nbsp; For example, a citta has the 
object of seeing as arammana, another has the object of hearing as arammana; a 
citta's function is to see, another's to hear; a citta arises accompanied by 
lobha-cetasika, another by dosa-cetasika.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;When the 
veneyyasatta listen to the abhidhamma, they examine the characteristics of the 
paramattha-dhamma appearing, and, with the wisdom accumulated in the past, they 
realize the truth about the paramattha-dhamma at that very moment.&nbsp; For 
this reason, in the Buddha's times, when the Supreme Preceptor had finished 
dhamma teachings, many people attained enlightenment since they understood the 
dhamma they heard, examined and realized the truth about the characteristics of 
the paramattha-dhamma appearing then.&nbsp; For example, while he taught that 
the cakkhu-vinnana or the seeing-consciousness was impermanent, they had 
sati-sampajanna (mindfulness and clarity of consciousness; awareness) and 
realized that the characteristics of the citta which is seeing are realities 
that are nama-dhamma; and not the self, entity or person.&nbsp; While hearing, 
they were aware, experiencing the realities at that moment.&nbsp; When wisdom 
realized the impermanence, the rising and falling away and the sufferings of the 
paramattha-dhamma that appears at that instant, it abandoned or lessened the 
pleasure and wrong understanding which made them cling to the said 
paramattha-dhamma, and believe the paramattha-dhamma to be the self, to be 
permanent and to be happiness.&nbsp; Therefore, it should correctly be 
understood that the dhamma that the Buddha became enlightened with and taught, 
which later was recorded as the Tipitaka, is about the truth of all 
realities.&nbsp; When paramattha-dhamma is studied and understood, the 
paramattha-dhamma which is appearing should be examined to realize the true 
characteristics of the paramattha-dhamma.&nbsp; Thus, the doubt and the 
ignorance about the conditioned characteristics of that paramattha-dhamma can 
truly be eradicated.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The study to 
understand paramattha-dhamma requires logical reasoning to clearly 
comprehend.&nbsp; For example, one must know whether the reality that sees 
resembles that which hears.&nbsp; If so, how are they alike? If not, how do they 
differ?&nbsp; The reality that sees and the reality that hears are 
paramattha-dhamma, but they are not the same citta because the conditions from 
which they arise are different.&nbsp; The seeing citta depends on the object 
appearing to the eyes coming into contact with the eyesense as conditions to 
arise, while the hearing citta depends on sound coming into contact with the 
earsense as conditions to arise.&nbsp; The seeing citta and the hearing citta 
have different functions and arise from diverse conditions.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

arises because of conditions.&nbsp; One rupa depends on another rupa to arise,

because they arise and fall away in succession so that they appear and can be

and fall away in succession, functioning in diverse ways.&nbsp; Some citta see 
colors, some hear sounds and others think according to the kinds of citta and 
the conditions from which the citta arise.&nbsp; The sequence of citta, cetasika 
and rupa is so rapid that their rising and falling away is not evident, so that 
we think that the rupa gradually changes and that the citta arises when the 
person or entity is born and falls away when the person or entity dies.&nbsp; If 
we do not study, examine and develop sati (mindfulness) and panna (wisdom) to 
realize the aspects of citta and rupa existing, we would not know the 
characteristics of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma or citta, cetasika and rupa which
