<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;<B>The first 
characteristic of citta</B>, as said earlier, is that citta is a reality that 
experiences clearly the arammana.&nbsp; This would help sati to arise and be 
mindful of the characteristics of the citta, while there is seeing, hearing, 
smelling, tasting or knowing body sense contact, and to examine to find out that 
the reality is a citta, not an entity, since the citta is the reality that 
clearly knows the object appearing.</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;<B>The second 
characteristic of citta</B>, ‘called "citta" because it accumulates latent 
tendencies in continuation with the efficiency of the javana-vithi', shows that 
each person has different dispositions because of the amount of lobha, dosa, 
moha or any kind of kusala-kamma accumulated, which gives the individual 
distinct demeanors.</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;<B>The third 
characteristic of citta</B> is that it is called "citta" because it is the 
reality where kamma-kilesa accumulate vipaka.&nbsp; When one understands 
vithi-citta, one would understand the reality that is samsara-vatta, which is 
the arising and evolution of kilesa-vatta, (cycles of kilesa) kamma-vatta and 
vipaka-vatta.&nbsp; For it is called "citta" because it is the reality where 
kamma-kilesa accumulate vipaka.</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The kusala-dhamma 
and akusala-dhamma that arise as javana-vithi, and fall away are accumulated in 
the next citta.&nbsp; Although the citta arises and falls away, the falling away 
of past citta is paccaya for the next citta to arise.&nbsp; Therefore the next 
citta to arise would inherit all that is accumulated in the previous citta 
because the subsequent citta arise with the preceding citta as paccaya.&nbsp; 
Thus the akusala-javana-vithi-citta and the kusala-javana-vithi-citta accumulate 
latent tendencies and would be paccaya for vipaka to 
arise.</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;<B>Kilesa-vatta

accumulates latent tendencies in continuation which are causes to perform 
<B>kamma-vatta</B> or physical, verbal or mental actions of kusala- or 
akusala-kamma.&nbsp; <B>Kamma-vatta</B> is the cause for <B>vipaka-vatta</B> to 
arise, and when the vipaka-citta arises to know arammana through the eye, ear, 
nose, tongue and body sense, it is not without kilesa-vatta because there is 
still pleasure or displeasure in things appearing through the eye, ear, nose, 
tongue, body sense and mind.&nbsp; Since there is kilesa, there is still cause 
to perform kusala-kamma and akusala-kamma.&nbsp; Kusala-kamma and akusala-kamma 
are the causes of akusala-vipaka-citta and kusala-vipaka-citta to arise 
endlessly.&nbsp; As long as panna has not&nbsp; been developed until it is sharp 
enough to clearly realize the ariya-sacca-dhamma, the three samsara-vatta, 
kilesa-vatta, kamma-vatta and vipaka-vatta, would continually arise and

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>What is the use of 
knowing the minute differences in the process of seeing which instant is vipaka 
and which is not?&nbsp; One should know that the dhamma that is the cause is not 
a result.&nbsp; Akusala and kusala are causes and not vipaka.&nbsp; When it is 
vipaka-citta, that is the result of causes, it is not the cause itself.&nbsp; In 
the present instant of seeing, if one knows which instant is vipaka, or the 
result of past kamma, that caused the vipaka-citta to arise, would one still 
think that there is a self that could create any vipaka-citta?&nbsp; If one 
knows the truth about citta the cause and citta the result, one would see the 
anatta in the instant of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, knowing body sense 
contact and thinking.&nbsp; This would be paccaya to help sati to be mindful of 
each reality appearing at that instant as a distinct reality that arises from 
paccaya.</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT 
size=+1></FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Is anyone afraid that 
vipaka-citta would not arise or that there would be no more vipaka?&nbsp; There 
is no need to worry because no matter today, tomorrow, the next month, the next 
year or the next lifetime, there never would be need to fear that vipaka would 
not arise.&nbsp; Because as long as one is not yet an arahanta, there would 
still be paccaya for vipaka-citta to continue to arise.&nbsp; But one should be 
aware of the kinds of vipaka to arise, and of the kamma that cause them.&nbsp; 
This lifetime is the proof of vipaka, how each person has vipaka ensuing from 
kusala-kamma or akusala-kamma in different quantities and 
degrees.</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT

are paccaya for the rupa to move with kusala- or akusala-citta.&nbsp; Thus the 
citta that can perform kamma is not the vipaka-citta.&nbsp; While having a meal, 
the citta that sees is a vipaka-citta, the citta that is pleased with the food 
is a lobha-mula-citta.&nbsp; The citta that is not pleased with the nourishment 
is a dosa-mula-citta.&nbsp; The citta that tastes the sweetness or the sourness 
is the vipaka-citta.&nbsp; The citta that make the rupa move to serve or chew 
and swallow the food with pleasure are lobha-mula-citta.&nbsp; The sati is able 
to arise and be mindful of each kind of citta as it really is.&nbsp; Therefore 
it is not to escape lobha, but to know lobha as it really is, so one can abandon 
it.&nbsp; From birth there normally are paccaya for lobha to arise each 
day.&nbsp; Generally work in any profession is done with lobha.&nbsp; Each day 
so much lobha arises.&nbsp; <B>But when one sees the beneficence of

having a meal, when the lobha-javana-vithi has arisen and fallen away, the 
following javana-vithi would be kusala by being aware of the characteristics of 
citta that is pleased with the food.&nbsp; Or sati might arise to be mindful of

when one wants something, is it pleasant or unpleasant?&nbsp; If there were no 
desire, no lobha, it would be nicer because there would be no clinging, no 
attachment, no wanting.&nbsp; When there is attachment and wanting, avijja 
cannot see that such an instant is a dark and dull reality, impure, unpleasant

pleasure in.&nbsp; Those instants are of clinging, dullness, trouble, 
akusala-dhamma and sometimes some might mistake it for faith, which if 
sati-patthana does not arise, panna does not examine, then there would be no

that arises grows strong, it becomes physical or verbal akusala-kamma.&nbsp; If 
there were no kilesa, no akusala-kamma can arise physically or verbally.&nbsp; 
When the kamma is done, though the citta and cetasika that together arose to do 
the deed had accomplished the kamma and fallen away, the accumulation of the 
kamma continuing in each of the subsequent citta that arises and falls away in 
sequence, is <B>a kamma paccaya or the reality that produces results as the 
arising vipaka-citta and -cetasika.&nbsp; Therefore one must know which citta is 
kilesa, which is kamma and which is vipaka.</B>&nbsp; The citta that sees, 
hears, smells, tastes, knows body sense contact is a vipaka-citta, the result of 
kamma.&nbsp; Everyone wants to see only that which is pleasing, and when one 
does, it is never enough.&nbsp; But even though one has cakkhuppasada, resulting 
from kamma as paccaya, the arammana in contact with the cakkhuppasada and 
appearing to the cakkhu-vinnana, would still depend upon kamma-paccaya.&nbsp; 
When kusala-kamma is the paccaya, it would cause the 
cakkhu-vinnana-kusala-vipaka to arise and see pleasant things.&nbsp; Hearing 
sounds that are pleasing is the result of kusala-kamma.&nbsp; Hearing unpleasant 
sounds is the result of akusala-kamma.&nbsp; Whether the present and the next 
instant would be kusala-vipaka or akusala-vipaka is up to whether it would be 
kusala-kamma or akusala-kamma that would be paccaya for vipaka to arise at which

kamma resulted in seeing a certain thing, and which kamma caused that certain

universally arises.&nbsp; When satipatthana does not arise, one would not know

without his being shot or hurt by anyone else.&nbsp; Past kamma is the paccaya

sati should be mindful of the characteristics of realities that are vipaka-citta
