<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1><B>&nbsp; There are 3 
levels of kilesa </B>namely, anusaya-kilesa, pariyutthana-kilesa and 
Vitikkakama-kilesa.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT 
size=+1><B>&nbsp;Vitikkakama-kilesa </B>is the coarse kilesa, causing one to 
break the sila (precepts) and perform duccarita kamma (wrong action) physically 
or verbally.&nbsp; To virati is to refrain from Vitikkakama-kilesa with 
sila.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT 
size=+1><B>&nbsp;Pariyutthana-kilesa </B>is the medium kind of kilesa that 
arises with akusala-citta but not to the point of breaking the sila and 
performing duccarita kamma.&nbsp; To refrain from pariyutthana-kilesa 
momentarily is called vikkhambhana-pahana with 
jhana-kusala-citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1><B>&nbsp;Anusaya-kilesa 
</B>is a very fine kilesa.&nbsp; When kilesa has not been eradicated, the 
anusaya-kilesa would settle like sediment in the cittas that arise and fall away 
in continuation, like a seed, a paccaya for pariyutthana-kilesa to arise.&nbsp; 
All kilesa would be completely eradicated, never to arise again, when the 
lokuttara-magga-citta clearly realizes the ariya-sacca-dhamma by experiencing 
the characteristics of nibbana according to the levels of the magga-citta, which 
completely eradicates kilesa according to the levels of the specific 
magga-citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Before the 
enlightenment of the Buddha there were people who observed the precepts, 
abstaining from wrong doing and developing samatha-bhavana unto the arupa-jhana 
of the highest level, the nevasannanasannayatana-jhana and temporarily 
suppressed kilesa as vikkhambhana-pahana.&nbsp; But none were able to eradicate 
anusaya-kilesa.&nbsp; When the Buddha had accumulated his parami for four 
asankheyya and a hundred thousand kappa, he became enlightened of the 
anuttarasammasambodhinana (the supreme omniscient self-enlightenment) as the 
Sammasambuddha the Arahanta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;He manifested the 
way to practice towards the realization of the ariya-sacca-dhamma so that there 
were many ariya-sankha-savaka (disciples) who attained the ariya-sacca-dhamma, 
eradicating kilesa.&nbsp; As long as there are those who study and practice the 
dhamma according to what he became enlightened with and manifested in detail all 
through 45 years, they continue to do so.&nbsp; The dhamma manifested by the 
Buddha is refined, intricate, and profound because he manifested the 
characteristics of realities with which he became enlightened by having fully 
realized the truth about the specific realities.<B>&nbsp; Any who do not 
conscientiously study the dhamma he manifested to rightly understand it, would 
not be able to develop panna to fully realize the characteristics of realities 
and be able to eradicate kilesa.</B></FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;For panna to be 
able to fully realize the characteristics of realities as they really are, there 
must be right understanding from the start what are the realities that panna 
would fully realize the truth about: which is all that are real, that are 
appearing through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind at this very 
moment.&nbsp; It means that when there is seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, 
knowing bodysense contact and thinking, there is no knowledge of the true 
characteristics of realities as they truly are.&nbsp; The Buddha manifested the 
realities that arise, appear and evolve through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, 
bodysense and mind every day at each instant in detail, so one might see the 
harm of akusala-dhamma and samsara-vatta.&nbsp; Since one does not see the harm, 
one would not endeavor and persist in developing vipassana, which is the panna 
that fully realizes the characteristics of realities appearing as they truly are 
normally until kilesa can be eradicated.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The development of 
samatha-bhavana and that of vipassana-bhavana differ in the aramana and the 
levels of panna.&nbsp; The former has aramana which render the 
mahakusala-nana-sampayutta-citta peaceful upon contemplation until it is 
steadily and uniquely based on a unique arammana. Vipassana-bhavana has 
paramattha-aramana, namely nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma, that arise, appear and 
fall away as aramana, which the mahakusala-nana-sampayutta-citta begin to take 
note of, examine arammana by arammana, regularly, constantly until it knows that 
they are realities that are not entities, persons, or the selves.&nbsp; The 
result of samatha-bhavana is to be born a brahma-puggala in the 
brahma-bhumi.&nbsp; The result of vipassana-bhavana is that panna, fully 
realizes the characteristics of realities as they truly are and eradicates 
kilesa completely according to the level of lokuttara-magga-citta with nibbana 
as arammana unto the level of arahanta-magga-citta, which completely eradicates 
all kilesa so samsara-vatta would end with no more rebirth.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Those who develop 
vipassana-bhavana must be straight and true and know that they still have all 
the kilesa.&nbsp; They must not desire to eradicate lobha first, because the 
ordinary person cannot precipitate to being an arahanta immediately because they 
must first eradicate the lobha that arises with sakkayaditthi, that clings to 
realities that arise concurrently as the selves, entities and people.&nbsp; Only 
then would other kilesa be eradicated in sequence, 
respectively.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Since one does not 
know that the instant of seeing is not the self, entity or person, how can one 
abandon kilesa, or its effects?&nbsp; The same applies to hearing, smelling, 
tasting, and knowing bodysense contact.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Each reality 
arises, falls away and disappearing completely very rapidly at all times.&nbsp; 
The Buddha manifested the way to practice to develop panna to realize the truth 
about realities: that there is only one way, the development of the eightfold 
ariya-magga namely samma-ditthi (panna-cetasika), samma-sankappa 
(vitaka-cetasika), samma-vaca (samma-vaca-cetasika), samma-kammanta 
(samma-kammanta-cetasika), samma-ajiva (samma-ajiva-cetasika), samma-vayama 
(viriya-cetasika), samma-sati (sati-cetasika) samma-samadhi 
(ekaggata-cetasika).</FONT></FONT></FONT>

lokuttara-citta arises, the fivefold path (excluding the virati because virati 
arise one at a time, the 3 virati-cetasika will arise concurrently only in the 
lokuttara-citta) would arise and perform their functions together in the instant 
that sati is mindful of the characteristics of realities that are either 
nama-dhamma or rupa-dhamma, through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense or 
mind.&nbsp; And the panna-cetasika that arises concurrently with 
samma-</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT

the characteristics of the specific nama-dhamma or rupa-dhamma&nbsp; little by 
little, regularly and constantly until there is clear knowledge whether it is 
nama-dhamma or rupa-dhamma.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The word 
<B>satipatthana</B> has 3 meanings:</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1><B>1) Satipatthana </B>is 
the paramattha-arammana or nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma that sati is mindful of 
(the 4 satipatthana).</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1><B>2) Satipatthana </B>is 
the sati-cetasika that arises with kamavacara-nanasampayutta-citta that is 
mindful of the arammana that are satipatthana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1><B>3) Satipatthana</B> is 
the path taken by the Sammasambuddha the Arahanta and the 
ariya-savanna.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>It is extremely difficult 
and infrequent for the<B> eight ariya-magga </B>or the development of the 4 
satipatthana to be mindful of the characteristics of each reality that arises 
and appears through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind each day to 
arise, according to the causes: avijja, lobha and all the akusala-dhamma 
accumulated over such a long period of time in the samsara-vatta, even including 
this lifetime each day since our birth.&nbsp; Those who understand the causes 
and results of realities as they truly are would therefore be persistent in 
listening to, studying and examining the dhamma to understand about realities 
through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind until it becomes 
paccaya to compose satipatthana to arise and to be correctly mindful, take note, 
examine and study the characteristics of the realities appearing according to 
what one has heard and understood.&nbsp; All dhamma, including satipatthana and 
the eightfold ariya-magga, are anatta.&nbsp; They could arise when there are 
paccaya or when the mahakusala-nana-sampayutta has been sufficiently 
accumulated, there would be no more turning towards other practices than 
mindfulness, noting and examining nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma that is appearing 
through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Those who develop panna 
are straightforward.&nbsp; When satipatthana arises they know it is different 
from the moment of forgetting sati.&nbsp; When satipatthana first arises, it 
does not clearly realize the characteristics of nama-dhamma and 
rupa-dhamma.&nbsp; The perseverance that arises concurrently with satipatthana, 
that is mindful of, takes note and studies the characteristics of nama-dhamma 
and rupa-dhamma that appear are therefore the 4 sammappadhana (the right 
perseverance): sanvarapadhana, pahanapadhana, bhavanapadhana and 
anurakkhanapadhana.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

vipassana-nana does not arise, even though the mano-dvara-vithi-cittas arise in

arise.&nbsp; And after the nama-rupa-pariccheda-nana has arisen, it is 
impossible to mistake the instant which is not vipassana-nana as a

quality of anatta of the vipassana-nana: that vipassana-nana would arise 
according to the eightfold magga (ordinarily the fivefold magga arises) that 
gradually composes unto completion as the specific vipassana-nana.&nbsp; Thus 
the specific vipassana-nana would arise according to causes and 
conditions.&nbsp; Therefore, they develop the causes, namely sati-patthana, are 
mindful, study, examine, take note and know the characteristics of nama-dhamma

conscientiously.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

when sammasana-nana arises they would see nama-dhamma arising and falling away 
as little spheres, one after another.&nbsp; Nama-dhamma is not 
rupa-dhamma.&nbsp; Since they have no knowledge of the characteristics of 
nama-dhamma, not having developed sati-patthana to be mindful of the 
characteristics of specific kinds of nama-dhamma, which is the element of 
consciousness, they think that nama-dhamma that arises and fall away has the 
characteristics of a certain rupa.&nbsp;<B> Those who are impatient to have 
vipassana-nana arise immediately would try to do other things rather than be 
mindful, examine and take note of the characteristics of nama-dhamma and 
rupa-dhamma that arise and appear according to the causes and conditions as they 
truly are.&nbsp; But it is impossible to rush panna at all.&nbsp; The only hetu 
to develop panna to gradually grow is sati-patthana normally, in ordinary 
everyday life.&nbsp; If one does anything else, it is certain that the wrong 
result will issue from the wrong causes.&nbsp; </B>Wrong practice comes from 
desiring quick results because there is no understanding of the correct way to 
practice.&nbsp; Lobha-mula-citta with wrong view would be miccha-magga that 
leads to miccha-vimutti or the wrong freedom because it would not be the right 
freedom from kilesa but which is mistaken as such.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

ariya-puggala in great numbers in the kalasampati, or the times when the Buddha 
had not yet attained absolute nibbana, after his parinibbana up to the present 
days.&nbsp; The realization of the ariyasacca-dhamma would decrease in 
proportion to the study, understanding and right practice and according to 
causes which are the development and the accumulation of panna that is suitable 
for the results.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Before the Buddha's 
enlightenment there were people who developed samatha-bhavana unto the 
achievement of supernatural powers, able to perform miracles, but unable to 
eradicate kilesa completely.&nbsp; After the Buddha had become enlightened with 
the anuttara-sammasambodhi-nana and had manifested the dhamma, there were many 
who realized the ariyasacca-dhamma and some who had developed samatha-bhavana 
unto the level of jhana-citta when they developed sati-patthana, they also 
realized the ariyasacca-dhamma.&nbsp; Therefore there are two kinds of 
ariya-savaka, namely the sukkhavipassaka and the 
cetovimutti.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The ariya-puggala 
who are sukkhavipassaka attained magga-citta without jhana-citta as basis, that 
is those who had not achieved jhana-citta and in whom jhana-citta would not 
arise to be examined.&nbsp; And even if the lokuttara-citta had fully 
experienced nibbana as clearly and closely as the appana-samadhi is tight with 
the distinct arammana of jhana-citta of different levels, since the ariya- 
sukkhavipassaka had not attained jhana, they are unable to achieve 
jhana-samapati.&nbsp; The categorization of citta as 89 is in the sense of the 
ariya-puggala who are sukkhavipassaka.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;As the 
ariya-puggala who are cetovimutti, they attained magga-citta with jhana-citta as 
basis.&nbsp; Therefore, they would be the ones who attained jhana with vasi 
(skill and power). Jhana-citta would arise as arammana for the mahakusala 
nana-sampayutta-citta to examine until it can attain lokuttara-magga-citta and 
lokuttara-phala-citta by the examination of that jhana-citta.&nbsp; The 
ariya-puggala who had attained enlightenment as well as distinct levels of 
jhana&nbsp; components are cetovimutti because they transcend kilesa with panna 
as well as the peace of different stages of jhana-citta. The categorization of 
citta as 121 is in the sense of the ariya-puggala who are 
cetovimutti.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

had attained jhana-citta and possessed the 5 vasi--the proficiency in commencing

jhana-samapatti </B>with jhana-vithi-citta arising and falling away continuously 
through the mano-dvara without any bhavanga-citta interposing during the 
designated time.&nbsp; During the jhana-samapatti, mental and physical dukkha 
are exempted because at that time there is peace without any other 
arammana.&nbsp; There is uniquely the happiness of peace from the absorption of 
the arammana of the jhana.&nbsp; Therefore that moment is 
jhana-samapatti.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1><B>The ariya-puggala who

lokuttara-tatiyajjhana-phala-citta, the lokuttara-catutthajjhana-phala-citta or 
the lokuttara-pancama-jhana-phala-citta--arising with nibbana as arammana during 
the designated period without any bhavanga-citta interposing.&nbsp; 
Phala-samapatti is the absorption of the lokuttara-jhana respective of the level

elements of the specific jhana.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

phala-samapatti-vithi is about to arise, the kamavacara-citta arising before is 
not called parikamma or upacara but all three are anuloma because they are 
favorable to the arising of lokuttara-phala-citta that had already arisen before 
to arise with nibbana as arammana again according to the level of 
lokuttara-jhana.&nbsp; It is different from parikamma, upacara and anuloma of 
the magga-vithi when the magga-vithi-citta would arise to eradicate kilesa 
completely. Phala-samapatti is the period during which the phala-citta arise 
with nibbana as arammana during the designated time.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

cannot support the body more than seven days.&nbsp; To achieve 
nirodha-samapatti, which suspends the arising of citta and cetasika temporarily, 
there must be two powers combined, both samatha and Vipassana.&nbsp; Even the 
anagami-puggala and the arahanta who had not attained 
nevasannanasannayatana-jhana cannot achieve nirodha-samapatti, nor can the

nirodha-samapatti, one must begin respectively with pathamajjhana.&nbsp; Upon

examine sankhara as impermanent, dukkha and anatta, then attain the tatiyajhana. 
Upon leaving the tatiyajjhana one must examine sankhara as impermanent, dukkha
