      <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=+1>1. &nbsp; [587] Now it was said earlier 
        (Ch.XIV,&sect;32) that he 'should first fortify his knowledge by learning and 
        questioning about those things that are the "soil" after he has 
        perfected the two purifications - Purification of Virtue and 
        Purification of Consciousnesss - that are the "roots"'. Now of those, 
        Purification of Virtue is the quite purified fourfold virtue beginning 
        with Patimokkha restraint; and that has already been dealt with in 
        detail in the description of Virtue (Chs.I and II); and this 
        Purification of Consciousness, namely, the eight attainments, together 
        with access concentration, has also been dealt with in details in all 
        its aspects in the Description of Concentration (Chs.III to XIII), 
        stated under the heading of 'Consciousness' [in the introductory verse]. 
        So those two Purifications should be understood in detail as given 
        there.<BR>2. &nbsp; But it was said above (Ch.XIV,&sect;32) that, 'The five 
        purifications, Purification of View, Purification by Overcoming Doubt, 
        Purification by Knowledge and Vision of What is the Path and What is Not 
        the Path, Purification by Knowledge and Vision of the Way, and 
        Purification by Knowledge and Vision, are the "trunk". Herein, 
        'Purification of View' is the correct seeing of mentality-materiality.

        consisting of applied thought, etc., and the states associated with 
        them, [that is, feeling, perception, and so on]. When he has done so, 
        all that should be defined as 'mentality <I>(nama)'</I> in the sense of

        occurrence is supported by and he sees that it is supported [558] by the 
        matter of the elements, which are the heart's support, and the 
        remaining, support. He defines all that as 'materiality <I>(rupa)'</I> 
        because it is molested <I>(ruppana)'</I> [by cold, etc.]. After that he 
        defines in brief as 'mentality-materiality <I>(nama rupa)'</I> the 
        mentality that has the characteristic of 'bending' and the materiality 
        that has the characteristic of 'being 
      molested'.<BR><BR></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=+1>&nbsp; But one whose vehicle is pure insight, 
        or that same aforesaid one whose vehicle is serenity, discerns the four 
        elements in brief or in detail in one of the various ways given in the 
        chapter on the Definition of the Four Elements (Ch.XI,&sect;27ff.). Then when 
        the elements have become clear in their correct essential 
        characteristics, firstly, in the case of head hair originated by kamma 
        there become plain ten instances of materiality, <I>(rupani)</I> with 
        the body decad thus: the four elements and colour, odour, flavour, 
        nutritive essence, and life, and body-sensitivity. And because the sex 
        decad is present there too there are another ten [that is the same nine 
        with sex instead of body-sensitivity]. And since the 
        octad-with-nutritive-essence-as-eighth [that is the same nine with sex 
        instead of essence-as-eighth [that is, the four elements and colour, 
        odour, flavour, and nutritive-essence,] originated by nutriment, and 
        that originated by temperature, and that originated by consciousness are 
        present there too, there are another twenty-four. So there is a total of 
        forty-four instances of materiality in the case of each of the 
        twenty-four bodily parts of fourfold origination. But in the case of the 
        four, namely, sweat, tears, spittle, and snot, <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/5fn" name=5txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm18.html#5fn">{5}</A> which are 
        originated by temperature and by consciousness, there are sixteen 
        instances of materiality with the two 
        octads-with-nutritive-essences-as-eighth in each. In the case of the 
        four, namely, gorge, dung, pus, and urine, which are originated by 
        temperature, eight instances of materiality become plain in each with 
        the octad-with-nutritive-essence-as-eighth in what is originated only by 
        temperature. This in the first place is the method in the case of the 
        thirty-two bodily aspects.<BR>6. &nbsp; But there are ten more aspects 
        <A href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/6fn" name=6txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm18.html#6fn">{6}</A> that become 
        clear when those thirty-two aspects have become clear. And as regards 
        these, firstly nine instances of materiality, that is, the 
        octad-with-nutritive-essence-as-eighth plus life, become plain in the 
        case of the kamma-born part of heat (fire) that digests what is eaten, 
        etc., and likewise nine [instances of materiality], that is, the 
        octad-with-nutritive-essence-as-eighth plus sound, in the case of the 
        consciousness-born part [of air consisting] of in-breaths and 
        out-breaths; and thirty-three instances of materiality, that is, the 
        [kamma-born] life-ennead and three 
        octads-with-nutritive-essence-as-eighth, in the case of each of the 
        remaining eight [parts] that are fourfold origination.<BR>7. &nbsp; And 
        when these instances of materiality derived [by clinging] from the 
        primaries have thus become plain in detail in the case of these 
        forty-two aspects, [that is, 32 parts of the body, 4 modes of fire and 6 
        modes of air,] another sixty instances of materiality become plain with 
        the physical [heart] basis and the [five] sense doors, that is, with the 
        heart-basis decad and the five decads beginning with the eye 
        decad.<BR>&nbsp; Taking all these together under the characteristic of 
        'being<BR>8. molested', he sees them as 'materiality'. When he has 
        discerned materiality thus, the immaterial states become plain to him in 
        accordance with the sense doors, that is to say, the eighty-one kinds <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/7fn" name=7txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm18.html#7fn">{7}</A> of mundane 
        consiousness consisting of the two sets of five consciousness ((34)-(38) 
        and (50)-(54)), the three kinds of mind element ((39), (55) and (70)) 
        and the sixty-eight [589] kinds of mind-consciousness element; and then 
        seven consciousness-concomitants, that is, (i)contact, feeling, 
        perception, (ii) volition, (vii) life, (viii) steadiness of 
        consciousness, and (xxx) attention, which are invariably conascent with 
        all these consciousnesses. The supramundane kinds of consciousness, 
        however, are not discernible either by one who is practising pure 
        insight or by one whose vehicle is serenity because they are out of 
        their reach. Taking all these immaterial states together under the 
        characteristic of 'bending', he sees them as 'mentality'.<BR>&nbsp; This 
        is how one [meditator] defines mentality-materiality in detail through 
        the method of defining the four elements.<BR><BR></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=+1>9. &nbsp; Another does it by means of the 
        eighteen elements. How? Here a Bhikkhu considers the elements thus; 
        'There are in this person the eye element, ... the mind-consciousness 
        element'. Instead of taking the piece of flesh variegated with white and 
        black circles, having length and breadth, and fastened in the eye socket 
        with a string of sinew, which the world terms 'an eye', he defines as 
        'eye element' the eye sensitivity of the kind described among the kinds 
        of derived materiality in the<BR>10. Description of the Aggregates 
        (Ch.XIV,&sect;47). But he does not define as 'eye element' the remaining 
        instances of materiality, which total 53, that is, the 9 conascent 
        instances of materiality consisting of the 4 primary elements, which are 
        its support, the 4 concomitant instances of materiality, namely, colour, 
        odour, flavour, and nutritive essence, and the sustaining life faculty; 
        and also the 20 kamma-born instances of materiality that are there too, 
        consisting of the body decad and sex decad; and the 24 un-clung-to 
        instances of materiality consisting of the 3 
        octads-with-nutritive-essence-as-eighth, which are originated by 
        nutriment and so on. The same method applies to the ear element and the 
        rest. But in the case of the body element the remaining instances of 
        materiality total 43, though some say 45 by adding sound and making nine 
        each for the temperature-born and consciousness-born<BR>11. [sound]. So 
        these five sensitivities, and their five respective objective fields, 
        that is, visible data, sounds, odours, flavours, and tangible data, make 
        ten instances of materiality, which are ten [of the eighteen] elements. 
        The remaining instances of materiality are the mental-data element 
        only.<BR>&nbsp; The consciousness that occurs with the eye as its 
        support and contingent upon a visible datum is called 'eye-consciousness 
        element' [and likewise with the ear and so on]. In this way the two sets 
        of five consciousness are the five 'consciousness elements'. The three 
        kinds of consciousness consisting of mind element ((39), (55) and (70)) 
        are the single 'mind element'. The 68 kinds of mind-consciousness 
        element are the 'mind-consciousness element.' So all the 81 kinds of 
        mundane consciousness make up seven kinds of consciousness element; and 
        the contact, etc., associated therewith are the mental-data 
        element.<BR>&nbsp; So 10 1/2 elements are materiality and 7 1/2 elements 
        [590] are mentality. This is how one [meditator] defines 
        mentality-materiality by means of the 18 
      elements.<BR><BR></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=+1>12. &nbsp; Another does it by means of the 12 
        bases. How? He defines as 'eye base' the sensitivity only, leaving out 
        the 53 remaining instances of materiality, in the way described for the 
        eye element. And in the way described there [he also defines] the 
        elements of the ear, nose, tongue, and body, as 'ear base, nose base, 
        tongue base, body base'. He defines five states that are their 
        respective objective fields as 'visible-data base, sound base, odour 
        base, flavour base, tangible-data base.' He defines the seven mundane 
        consciousness elements as 'mind base'. He defines the contact, etc., 
        associated therewith, and also the remaining instances of materiality as 
        mental-data base.' So here 10 1/2 bases are materiality and 1 1/2 bases 
        are mentality. This is how one [meditator] defines mentality-materiality 
        by means of the 12 bases.<BR><BR></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

      Aggregates]</FONT><BR></DIV>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=+1>13. &nbsp; Another defines it more briefly 
        than that by means of the aggregates? How? Here a bhikkhu defines as 
        'the materiality aggregate' all the following 27 instances of 
        materiality, that is, the 17 instances of materiality consisting of the 
        four primaries of fourfold origination in this body and dependent 
        colour, odour, flavour, and nutritive-essence, and the five 
        sensitivities beginning with the eye sensitivity, and the materiality of 
        the physical [heart] basis, sex, life faculty, and sound of twofold 
        origination, which 17 instances of materiality are suitable for 
        comprehension since they are produced and are instances of concrete 
        materiality; and then the 10 instances of materiality, that is, bodily 
        intimation, verbal intimation, the space element, and the lightness, 
        malleability, wieldiness, growth, continuity, ageing, and impermanence, 
        of materiality, which 10 instances of materiality are, however, not 
        suitable for comprehension since they are merely the mode-alteration, 
        and the limitation-of-interval; they are not produced and are not 
        concrete materiality, but they are reckoned as materiality because they 
        are mode-alterations, and limitation-of-interval, of various instances 
        of materiality. - So he defines all these 27 instances of materiality as 
        'the materiality aggregate'. He defines the feeling that arises together 
        with the 81 kinds of mundane consciousness as the 'feeling aggregate', 
        the perception associated therewith as the 'perception aggregate, the 
        formations associated therewith as the formations aggregate', and the 
        consciousness as the 'consciousness aggregate'. - So by defining the 
        materiality aggregate as 'materiality' and the four immaterial 
        aggregates as 'mentality' he defines mentality-materiality by means of 
        the five aggregates.<BR><BR></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=+1>15. &nbsp; [591] But if he has discerned 
        materiality in one of these ways, and while he is trying to discern the 
        immaterial it does not become evident to him owing to its subtlety, then 
        he should not give up but should again and again comprehend, give 
        attention to, discern, and define materiality only. For in proportion as 
        materiality becomes quite definite, disentagled and quite clear to him, 
        so the immaterial states that have that [materiality] as their object 
        become plain of themselves too.<BR>16. &nbsp; Just as, when a man with 
        eyes looks for the reflexion of his face in a dirty looking-glass and 
        sees no reflexion he does not throw the looking glass away because the 
        reflexion does not appear; on the contrary he polishes it again and 
        again, and then the reflexion becomes plain of itself when the looking 
        glass is clean, - and just as, when a man needing oil puts sesamum flour 
        in a basin and wets it with water and no oil comes out with only one or 
        two pressings he does not throw the sesamum flour away; but on the 
        contrary he wets it again and again with hot water and squeezes and 
        presses it, and as he does so clear sesamum oil comes out, - or just as, 
        when a man wanting to clarify water has taken a <I>katuka</I> nut and 
        put his hand inside the pot and rubbed it once or twice the water does 
        not come clear, he does not throw the <I>katuka</I> nut away; on the 
        contrary he rubs it again and again, and as he does so the fine mud 
        subsides and the water becomes transparent and clear, - so to, the 
        bhikkhu should not give up, but he should again and again comprehend, 
        give attention to, discern and define materiality only.<BR>17. &nbsp; 
        For in proportion as materiality becomes quite definite, disentangled 
        and quite clear to him, so the defilements that are opposing him 
        subside, his consciousness becomes clear like the water above the 
        [precipitated] mud, and the immaterial states that have that 
        [materiality] as their object become plain of themselves too. And this 
        meaning can also be explained in this way by other analogies such as the 
        [pressing of] sugarcane, [the beating of] criminals [to make them 
        confess], [the taming of] an ox, the churning of curds [to produce

        feeling, or through consciousness. How?<BR>19. &nbsp; 1. (a) When he 
        discerns the [four primary] elements in the way beginning 'The earth 
        element has the characteristic of hardness' (Ch.XI,&sect;93), contact becomes 
        evident to him as the first conjunction. Then feeling associated with 
        that as the feeling aggregate, the associated perception as the 
        perception aggregate, the associated volition together with the 
        aforesaid contact as the formations aggregate, and the associated 
        consciousness as the consciousness aggregate.<BR>&nbsp; 1. (b) [592] 
        Likewise [when he has discerned them in this way,] 'In the head hair it 
        is the earth element that has the characteristic of hardness, ... in the 
        in-breaths and out-breaths it is the earth element that has the 
        characteristic of hardness' (Ch.XI,&sect;31), contact becomes evident as the 
        first conjunction. Then the feeling assoicated with it as the feeling 
        aggregate, ... the associated consciousness as the consciousness 
        aggregate.<BR>&nbsp; This is how immaterial states become evident 
        through contact.<BR>20. &nbsp; 2. (a) To another [who discerns the four 
        primary elements in the way beginning] 'The earth element has the 
        characteristic of hardness' the feeling that has as its object and 
        experiences its stimulus [as pleasant, etc.,] becomes evident as the 
        feeling aggregate, the perception associated with that as the perception 
        aggregate, the contact and the volition asociated with that as the 
        formations aggregate, and the consciousness associated with that as the 
        formations aggregate, and the consciousness associated with that as the 
        consciousness aggregate.<BR>&nbsp; 2. (b) Likewise [to one who discerns 
        them in this way] 'In the head hair it is the earth element that has the 
        characteristic of hardness, ... in the in-breaths and out-breaths it is 
        the earth element that has the characteristic of hardness; the feeling 
        that has that as its object and experiences its stimulus becomes evident 
        as the feeling aggregate, ... and the consciousness associated with that 
        as the consciousness aggregate.<BR>&nbsp; This is how the immaterial 
        states become evident through feeling.<BR>21. &nbsp; 3. (a) To another 
        [who discerns the four primary elements in the way beginning] 'The earth 
        element has the characteristic of hardness' the consciousness that 
        cognizes the object becomes evident as the consciousness aggregate, the 
        feeling associated with it as the feeling aggregate, the associated 
        perception as the perception aggregate, and the associated contact and 
        volition as the formations aggregate.<BR>&nbsp; 3. (b) Likewise [to one 
        who discerns them in this way] 'In the head hair it is the earth element 
        that has the characteristic of hardness, ... in the in-breaths and 
        out-breaths it is the earth element that has the characteristic of 
        hardness' the consciousness that cognized the object becomes evident as 
        the consciousness aggregate, ... and the associated contact and volition 
        as the formations aggregate.<BR>&nbsp; This is how the material state 
        become evident through consciousness.<BR>22. &nbsp; In the case of [the 
        ways of discerning materiality as consisting of] the 42 aspects of the 
        elements beginning with the head hair [that is, 32 aspects of the body, 
        4 aspects of the fire element and 6 aspects of the air element,] either 
        by these same means given above or by means of the method beginning 'In 
        the kamma-originated head hair it is the earth element that has the 
        characteristic of hardness' - and also in the case of the methods of 
        discerning materiality as consisting of the eye, etc. - by means of the 
        four primary elements in each, the constructing should be done by 
        working out all the differences in each method.<BR>23. &nbsp; Now it is 
        only when he has become quite sure about discerning materiality in this 
        way that immaterial states become quite evident to him in the three 
        aspects. Therefore he should only undertake the task of discerning the 
        immaterial states after he has completed that, not otherwise. If he 
        leaves off discerning materiality when, say, one or two material states 
        have become evident in order to begin discerning the immaterial, then he 
        falls from his meditation subject like the mountain cow already 
        described under the Development of the Earth Kasina (Ch.IV,&sect;130). [593] 
        But if he undertakes the task of discerning the immaterial after he is 
        already quite sure about discerning materiality thus, then his 
        meditation subject comes to growth, increase and 
        perfection.<BR><BR></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=+1>24. &nbsp; He defines the four immaterial 
        aggregates that have thus become evident through contact, etc., as 
        'mentality'. And he defines their objects, namely, the four primaries 
        and the materiality derived from the four primaries, as 'materiality'. 
        So, as one who opens a box with a knife, as one who splits a twin 
        palmyra bulb in two, he defines all states of the three planes <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/9fn" name=9txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm18.html#9fn">{9}</A> , the eighteen 
        elements, twelve bases, five aggregates, in the double way as 
        'mentality-materiality', and he concludes that over and above mere 
        mentality-materiality there is nothing else that is a being or a person 
        or a deity or a Brahma.<BR>25. &nbsp; After defining 
        mentality-materiality thus according to its true nature, then in order 
        to abandon this wordly designation of 'a being' and 'a person' more 
        thoroughly, to surmount confusion about beings and to establish his mind 
        on the plane of non-confusion, he makes sure that the meaning defined, 
        namely, 'This is mere mentality-materiality, there is no being, no 
        person' is confirmed by a number of Suttas. For this has been 
        said:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As 
        with the assembly of parts<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The word "chariot" is 
        countenanced,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, when the aggregates are 
        present,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A 
        being" is said in common usage' (S.i,135).<BR>26. &nbsp; Again, this has 
        been said: 'Just as when a space is enclosed with timber and creeper and 
        grass and clay, there comes to be the term "house", so too, when a space 
        is enclosed with bones and sinews and flesh and skin, there comes to be 
        the term "material form <I>(rupa)"</I> (M.i,190).<BR>27. &nbsp; And 
        again this has been said:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is ill alone that rises,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ill that remains, ill that 
        departs,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Nothing rises else than ill<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And nothing ceases else than ill (S.i,135).<BR>28. 
        &nbsp; So in many hundred suttas it is only the mentality-materiality 
        that is illustrated, not a being, not a person. Therefore, just as when 
        the component parts such as axles, wheels, frame poles, etc., are 
        arranged in a certain way, there comes to be the mere term of common 
        usage 'chariot', yet in the ultimate sense when each part is examined, 
        there is no chariot, - and just as when the component parts of a house 
        such as wattles, etc., are placed so that they enclose a space in a 
        certain way, there comes to be the mere term of common usage 'house', 
        yet in the ultimate sense there is no house, and just as when the 
        fingers, thumb, etc., are placed in a certain way, there comes to be the 
        mere term of common usage [594] 'fist', - with body and strings, 'lute'; 
        with elephants, horses, etc., 'army'; with surrounding walls, houses, 
        states, etc., 'city'; - just as when trunk, branches, foliage, etc., are 
        placed in a certain way, there comes to be the mere term of common usage 
        'tree', yet in the ultimate sense, when each component is examined, 
        there is no tree, - so to, when there are the five aggregates [as 
        objects] of clinging, there comes to be the mere term of common usage 'a 
        being', 'a person', yet in the ultimate sense, when each component is 
        examined, there is no being as a basis for the assumption 'I am' or 'I'; 
        in the ultimate sense there is only mentality-materiality. The vision of 
        one who sees in this way is called correct vision.<BR>29. &nbsp; But 
        when a man rejects this correct vision and assumes that a [permanent] 
        being exists, he has to conclude either that is comes to be annihilated 
        or that it does not. If he concludes that it does not come to be 
        annihilated, he falls into the eternity [view]. If he concludes that it 
        does come to be annihilated, he falls into the annihilation [view]. Why? 
        Because [the assumption] precludes any gradual change like that of milk 
        into curd. So he either holds back, concluding that the assumed being is 
        eternal, or he overreaches, concluding that is comes to be 
        annihilated.<BR>30. &nbsp; Hence the Blessed One said 'There are two 
        kinds of view, bhikkhus, and when deities and human beings are obsessed 
        by them, some hold back and some overreach; only those with eyes see. 
        And how do some hold back? Dieties and human beings love becoming, 
        delight in becoming, rejoice in becoming. When Dhamma is taught to them 
        for the ceasing of becoming, their minds do not enter into it, become 
        settled, steady and resolute. Thus it is that some hold back. And how do 
        some overreach? Some are ashamed, humiliated and disgusted by that same 
        becoming, they are concerned with non-becoming in this way: "Sirs, when 
        with the break up of the body this self is cut off, annihilated, does 
        not become any more after death, that is peaceful, that is sublime, that 
        is true". Thus it is that some overreach. And how do those with eyes 
        see? Here a bhikkhu sees what is become as become. Having seen what is 
        become as become, he has entered upon the way to dispassion for it, to 
        the fading away of greed for it, to its cessation. This is how one with 
        eyes sees.' (Iti.43; Ps.i,159).<BR>31. &nbsp; Therefore, just as a 
        marionette is void, soulless and without curiosity, and while it walks 
        and stands merely through the combination of strings and wood, [595] yet 
        it seems as if it had curiousity and interestedness, so too, this 
        mentality-materiality is void, soulless and without curiosity, and while 
        it walks and stands merely through the combination of the two together, 
        yet it seems as if it had curiousity and interestedness. This is how it 
        should be regarded. Hence the Ancients said:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mental and material are really 
        here,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But 
        here there is no human being to be found,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For it is void and merely 
        fashioned like a doll - <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just suffering piled up like grass and 
        sticks.<BR><BR></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=+1>32. &nbsp; And this should be explained not 
        only by means of the simile of the marionette, but also by means of the 
        analogies of the sheaves of reeds and so on. For just as when two 
        sheaves of reeds are propped one against the other, each one gives the 
        other consolidating support, and when one falls the other falls, so too, 
        in the five-constituent becoming mentality-materiality occurs as an 
        interdependent state, each of its components giving the other 
        consolidating support, and when one falls owing to death, the other 
        falls too. Hence the Ancients said:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mental and 
        material<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are 
        twins and each supports the other;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When one breaks up they both break 
        up<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through 
        interconditionality.<BR>33. &nbsp; And just as when sound occurs having 
        as its support a drum that is beaten by a stick, then the drum is one 
        and the sound another, the drum and the sound are not mixed up together, 
        the drum is void of the sound and the sound is void of the drum, so too, 
        when mentality occurs having as its support the materiality called the 
        physical basis, the door and the object, then the materiality is one and 
        the mentality is another, the mentality and the materiality are not 
        mixed up together, the mentality is void of the materiality and the 
        materiality is void of the mentality; yet the mentality occurs due to 
        the materiality as the sound occurs due to the drum. Hence the Ancients 
        said:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        pentad based on contact comes not from the eye,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or from things seen, or something 
        that is in between;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to a cause it comes to be, and formed as 
        well,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just 
        as the sound that issues from a beaten drum.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pentad based on contact comes 
        not from the ear,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or yet from sound, or something that is in 
        between;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due 
        to a cause ... <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pentad based on contact comes not from the 
        nose<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or yet 
        from smells, or something that is in between;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to a cause ... 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pentad 
        based on contact comes not from the tongue,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or yet from tastes, or something 
        that is in between;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [596] Due to a cause ... <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pentad based on contact comes 
        not from the body,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or yet from touch, or something that is in 
        between;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due 
        to a cause ... <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being formed, it does not come from the material 
        basis,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor 
        does it issue from the mental-datum base;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to a cause it comes to be, and 
        formed as well,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the sound that issues from a beaten 
        drum.<BR>34. &nbsp; Furthermore, mentality has no efficient power, it 
        cannot occur by its own efficient power ... It does not eat, it does not 
        drink, it does not speak, it does not adopt postures. And materiality is 
        without efficient power; it cannot occur by its own efficient power. For 
        it has no desire to eat, it has no desire to drink, it has no desire to 
        speak, it has no desire to adopt postures. But rather it is when 
        supported by materiality that mentality occurs. When mentality has the 
        desire to eat, the desire to drink, the desire to speak, the desire to 
        adopt a posture, it is materiality that eats, drinks, speaks and adopts 
        a posture.<BR>35. &nbsp; But for the purpose of explaining this meaning 
        they gave this simile as an example: a man born blind and a 
        stool-crawling cripple wanted to go somewhere. The blind man said to the 
        cripple, 'Look, I can do what should be done by legs, but I have no eyes 
        with which to see what is rough and smooth'. The cripple said 'Look, I 
        can do what should be done by eyes, but I have no legs with which to go 
        and come'. The blind man was delighted, and he made the cripple climb up 
        on his shoulder. Sitting on the blind man's shoulder the cripple spoke 
        thus 'Leave the left, take the right; leave the right, take the 
        left.'<BR>&nbsp; Herein, the blind man has no efficient power; he is 
        impotent; he cannot travel by his own efficient power, by his own 
        strength. And the cripple has no efficient power; he is impotent; he 
        cannot travel by his own efficient power, by his own strength. But there 
        is nothing to prevent their going when they support each other. So too, 
        mentality has no efficient power; it does not arise or occur in such and 
        such functions by its own efficient power. And materiality has no 
        efficient power, it does not arise or occur in such and such functions 
        by its own efficient power. But there is nothing to prevent their 
        occurrence when they support each other.<BR>36. &nbsp; Hence, this is 
        said:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They 
        cannot come to be by their own strength,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or yet maintain themselves by 
        their own strength;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relying for support on other 
        states,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weak 
        in themselves, and formed, they come to be;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [597] They come to be with others 
        as condition.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are aroused by others as their 
        objects,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        They are produced by object and condition,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And each by something other than 
        itself.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just as men depend upon<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A boat for 
        traversing the sea,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So does the mental body 
        need<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The matter-body for occurrence.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as the boat 
        depends upon<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The men for traversing the sea,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So does the 
        matter-body need<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mental body for 
        occurence.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Depending each upon the other<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boat and 
        men go on the sea.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so do mind and matter 
        both<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Depend the one upon the other.<BR>37. &nbsp; The 
        correct vision of mentality and materiality, which, after defining 
        mentality-materiality by these various methods, has been established on 
        the plane of non-confusion by overcoming the perception of a being, is 
        what should be understood as Purification of View. Other terms for it 
        are 'Defining of Mentality-materiality' and 'Delimitation of

        Mentality should be taken here as the four aggregates beginning with 
        feeling and belonging to the three planes, not omitting consciousness as 
        in the case of "With consciousness as condition, mentality-materiality" 
        and not including the supramundane aggregates associated with nibbana' 
        (Pm.744 Burmese ed.).<BR><BR><A

        Serenity <I>(samatha)</I> is a general term for concentration, as the 
        complement of insight <I>(vipassana),</I> which is roughly the 
        equivalent of understanding <I>(panna).</I><BR><BR><A

        who is beginning this work has difficulty in discerning the highest form 
        of becoming, that is, the base consisting of neither perception nor 
        non-perception' (Pm.744). This is owing to the diminished perception 
        (see M.iii,28).<BR><BR><A

        S.ii,23-4. 'Bending in the direction of the object means that there is 
        no occurence without an object; it is in the sense of that sort of 
        bending, or it is in the sense of bestowing a name <I>(nama-karana)</I> 
        (Pm.744). 'Name-and-form' has many advantages over 
        'mentality-materiality' if only because it preserves the integrity of 
        <I>nama</I> and excludes any metaphysical assumption of matter existing 
        as a substance behind apparent forms.<BR><BR><A

        'Because sweat, etc., arise owing to heat, fatigue etc., and owing to 
        mental perturbation they are called "originated by temperature and by 
        consciousness"'(Pm.745).<BR>&nbsp; There are seven kinds of decads: 
        those of the physical basis of mind (heart), sex, living physical eye, 
        ear, nose, tongue, and body. The first nine components of a decad are 
        the same in all instances, and by themselves they are called the 'life 
        ennead'. The first eight components by themselves are called the 
        'octad-with-nutritive-essence-as-eighth'. This octad plus sound is 
        called the 'sound ennead'. In general these are called 'material groups 
        <I>(rupa kalapa)'.</I> But this kind of 'group <I>(kalapa)'</I> has 
        nothing to do with the 'comprehension by groups 
        <I>(kalapa-sammasana)'</I> of Ch.XX, which is simply generalization 
        (from one's own particular experience to each of the five aggregates as 
        past, etc., i.e. as a 'group'). The 'material groups' are not in the 
        Pitakas.<BR><BR><A href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm18.html#6txt"

        are four aspect of the fire element and six aspects of the air element; 
        what heats, what consumes, what burns up, what digests; up-going winds 
        (or forces), down-going winds, winds in the stomach, winds in bowels, 
        winds in the limbs, breaths. See Ch.XI,&sect;37 and 82.<BR><BR><A

        exalted consciousness of the fine-material and immaterial spheres is 
        only quite plain to one who has attained the attainments'

        well as by means of the elements, etc., materiality can also be 
        discerned through the faculties, the truths, and the dependent 
        origination. How?<BR>&nbsp; 'Firstly, through the faculties; These 
        seven, namely the five beginning with the eye plus femininity and 
        masculinity are materiality; the eleven consisting of the mind-faculty, 
        the five feeling faculties, and the five beginning with faith, are 
        mentality: the life faculty is both mentality and materiality. The last 
        three, being supramundane, are not intended here.<BR>&nbsp; 'The truth 
        of suffering is both mentality and materiality; the truth of origin is 
        mentality; the other two are not intended here because they are 
        supramundane.<BR>&nbsp; 'In the Stucture of Conditions, the first three 
        members are mentality; the fourth and fifth are mentality and 
        materiality; the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth are mentality; the 
        tenth is both mentality and materiality; the last two are each mentality 
        and materiality' (Pm.747-8).<BR><BR><A

        <I>'"All states of the three planes"</I> is said all-inclusively owing 
        to the necessity not to omit anything suitable for comprehension. For it 
        must be fully understood without any exception, and greed must be made 
        to fade away absolutely so that the mind may be liberated by the fading 
        away of greed. That is why the Blessed One said "Bhikkhus, without 
        directly knowing, without fully understanding all, without causing the 
        fading away of greed for it without abandoning it, the mind is incapable 
        of the destruction of suffering" (S.iv,17). If all the states of the 
        three planes are taken as mentality-materiality without exception then 
        how should one deal with what has been conceived by those outside the 
        Dispensation as verbal meanings, such as the Primordial Essence 
        <I>(pakati),</I> etc. [e.g. of the Samkhya], the Substance 
        <I>(drabya),</I> etc. [e.g. of the Vaisesika], the soul <I>(jiva),</I> 
        etc., and the Body <I>(kaya),</I> etc. [&nbsp; &nbsp; ]? Since these are 
        like the hallucination of lunatics and are taught by the not fully 
        enlightened, what other way of dealing with them is there than to ignore 
        them? Or alternatively, their existence or non-existence can be 
        understood as established by their inclusion within 
        mentality-materiality' (Pm.751-2). There follows a long paragraph 
        showing 'Wherever the verbal meaning of self is expressed by some such 
        metaphor as world-soul <I>(purisa),</I> self <I>(atta, atman),</I> soul 
        <I>(jiva),</I> etc., these being themselves conceived in their various 
        ways on the basis of mere mentality-materiality, are mere 
        mentality-materiality, too' (Pm.754-5).<BR><BR></FONT>
