        Becoming]<BR><BR><A name=Wheel></A>[i. The 
        Wheel]<BR><BR></FONT></DIV><FONT size=+1>273. &nbsp; Now here at the end 
        sorrow, etc., are stated. Consequently the ignorance stated at the 
        beginning of the Wheel of Becoming thus, 'With ignorance as condition 
        there are formations', is established by the sorrow and so on. So it 
        should according be understood that<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Becoming's Wheel reveals no known 
        beginning;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        No maker, no experiencer there;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Void with a twelvefold voidness, and 
        nowhere<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It 
        ever halts; for ever it is spinning.<BR>274. &nbsp; But (1) How is 
        ignorance established by sorrow etc.? (2) How has this Wheel of Becoming 
        no known beginning? (3) How is there no maker or experiencer there? (4) 
        How is it void with twelve-fold voidness?<BR>275. &nbsp; 1. Sorrow, 
        grief and despair are inseparable from ignorance; and lamentation is 
        found in one who is deluded. So firstly when these are established, 
        ignorance is established. Furthermore, 'With the arising of cankers 
        there is the arising of ignorance' (M.i,54) is said, and with arising of 
        cankers these things beginning with sorrow come into being. How?<BR>276. 
        &nbsp; Firstly sorrow about separation from sense desires as object has 
        its arising in the canker of sense desire, according as it is 
        said,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If, 
        desiring and lusting his desires elude him,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'He suffers as though an arrow had 
        pierced him' (Sn.767)<BR>and according as it is said 'Sorrow springs 
        from sense desires'<BR>277. &nbsp; (Dh.215). And all these come about 
        with the arising of the canker of views, according as it is said 'In one 
        who [577] posseses [the view] "I am materiality", "My mentality", with 
        the change and transformation of materiality there arise sorrow and 
        lamentation, pain, grief and despair' (S.iii,3).<BR>278. &nbsp; And as 
        with the arising of the canker of views, so also with the arising of the 
        canker of becoming, according as it is said 'Then whatever deities there 
        are, long-lived, beautiful, blissful, long-resident in grand palaces, 
        when they hear the Perfect One's teaching of the Dhamma, they feel fear, 
        anxiety and a sense of urgency' (S.iii,85), as in the case of dieties 
        harassed by the fear of death on seeing the five signs. <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/43fn" name=43txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17C.html#43fn">{43}</A> <BR>279. 
        &nbsp; And as with the arising of the canker of becoming, so also with 
        the canker of ignorance, according as it is said 'The fool, bhikkhus, 
        experiences pain and grief here and now in three ways' 
        (M.iii,163).<BR>&nbsp; Now these states come about with the arising of 
        cankers, and so when they are established, they establish the cankers 
        which are the cause of ignorance. And when the cankers are established, 
        ignorance is also established because it is present when its condition 
        is present. This in the first place is how ignorance, etc., should be 
        understood to be established by sorrow and so on. <BR>280. &nbsp; 2. But 
        when ignorance is established since it is present when its condition is 
        present, and when 'with ignorance as condition there are formations; 
        with formations as condition, consciousness', there is no end to the 
        succession of cause with fruit in this way. Consequently the Wheel of 
        Becoming with its twelve factors, revolving with the linking of cause 
        and effect, is established as having 'no known beginning'.<BR>281. This 
        being so, are not the words 'With ignorance as condition there are 
        formations' as an exposition of a simple beginning contradicted? - This 
        is not an exposition of a simple beginning. It is an exposition of a 
        basic state (see &sect;107). For ignorance is the basic state for the three 
        rounds (see 298). It is owing to his seizing ignorance that the fool 
        gets caught in the round of the remaining defilement, in the rounds of 
        kamma, etc., just as it is owing to seizing a snake's head that the arm 
        gets caught in [the coils of] the rest of the snake's body. But when the 
        cutting off of ignorance is effected, he is liberated from them just as 
        the arm caught [in the coils] is liberated when the snake's head is cut 
        off according as it is said, 'With the remainderless fading away and 
        cessation of ignorance' (S.ii,1), and so on. So this is an exposition of 
        the basic state whereby there is bondage for him who grasps it, and 
        liberation for him who lets go: it is not an exposition of a simple 
        beginning.<BR>&nbsp; This is how the Wheel of Becoming should be 
        understood to have no known beginning. [578]<BR>282. &nbsp; 3. This 
        Wheel of Becoming consists in the occurrence of formations, etc., with 
        ignorance, etc., as the respective reasons. Therefore it is devoid of a 
        maker supplementary to that, such as a Brahmaa conjectured thus, 
        'Brahmaa the Great, the Highest, the Creator' (D.i,18), to perform the 
        function of Maker of the round of rebirths; and it is devoid of any self 
        as an experiencer of pleasure and pain conceived thus 'This self of mine 
        that speaks and feels' (Cf.M.i,8). This is how it should be understood 
        without any maker or experiencer.<BR>283. &nbsp; 4. However, ignorance - 
        and likewise the factors consisting of formations, etc. - is void of 
        lastingness since its nature is to rise and fall, and it is void of 
        beauty since it is defiled and causes defilement, and it is void of 
        pleasure since it is oppressed by rise and fall, and it is void of any 
        selfhood susceptible to the wielding of power since it exists in 
        dependence on conditions. Or ignorance - and likewise the factors 
        consisting of formations, etc. - is neither self nor self's nor in self 
        nor possessed of self. That is why this Wheel of Becoming should be 
        understood thus 'Void with a twelvefold voidness'.<BR><BR></FONT>
        <DIV align=center><FONT color=#009900 size=+2><A name=3x></A>[ii. The 
        Three Times]<BR><BR></FONT></DIV><FONT size=+1>284. &nbsp; After knowing 
        this, again,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Its roots are ignorance and craving;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its times are three as past and so 
        on,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To which 
        there properly belong<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two, eight, and two, from its [twelve] 
        factors.<BR>285. &nbsp; The two things, ignorance and craving, should be 
        understood as the root of this Wheel of Becoming. Of the derivation from 
        the past, ignorance is the root and feeling the end. And of the 
        continuation into the future, craving is the root and ageing-and-death 
        the end. It is twofold, in this way.<BR>286. &nbsp; Herein, the first 
        applies to one whose temperament is [false] view, and the second to one 
        whose temperament is craving. For in the round of rebirth ignorance 
        leads those whose temperament favours [false] view, and craving those 
        whose temperament favours craving. Or the first has the purpose of 
        eliminating the annihilation view because, by the evidence of the fruit, 
        it proves that there is no annihilation of the causes; and the second 
        has the purpose of eliminating the eternity view because it proves the 
        ageing and death of whatever has arising. Or the first deals with the 
        child in the womb because it illustrates successive occurrence [of the 
        faculties], and the second deals with one apparitionally born because of 
        [their] simultaneous appearance.<BR>287. &nbsp; The past, the present 
        and the future are its three times. Of these, it should be understood 
        that, according to what is given as such in the texts, the two factors 
        ignorance and formations belong to the past time, the eight beginning 
        with consciousness belong to the present time, and the two, birth and 
        ageing-and-death, belong to the future time. [579]<BR><BR></FONT>
        <DIV align=center><FONT color=#009900 size=+2><A name=3x></A>[iii. Cause 
        and Fruit]<BR><BR></FONT></DIV><FONT size=+1>288. &nbsp; Again it should 
        be understood thus:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) It has three links with cause, fruit, 
        cause,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As 
        first parts; and (2) four different sections;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Its spokes are twenty 
        qualities;<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (4) With triple 
        round it spins for ever.<BR>289. &nbsp; 1. Herein, between formations 
        and rebirth-linking consciousness there is one link consisting of 
        cause-fruit. Between feeling and craving there is one link consisting of 
        fruit-cause. And between becoming and birth there is one link consisting 
        of cause-fruit. This is how it should be understood that <I>it has three 
        links with cause, fruit, cause, as first parts.</I><BR>290. &nbsp; 2. 
        But there are four sections, which are determined by the beginnings and 
        ends of the links, that is to say, ignorance / formations is one 
        section; consciousness / mentality-materiality / sixfold-base / contact 
        / feeling is the second; craving / clinging / becoming is the third; and 
        birth / ageing-and-death is the fourth. This is how it should be 
        understood to have <I>four different sections.</I><BR>291. &nbsp; 3. 
        Then <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) 
        There were five causes in the past, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) And now there is a fivefold 
        fruit;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) 
        There are five causes now as well,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) And in the future fivefold 
        fruit.<BR>&nbsp; It is according to these twenty spokes called 
        'qualities' that the words <I>its spokes are twenty qualities</I> should 
        be understood.<BR>292. &nbsp; (a) Herein, [as regards the words] 
        <I>There were five causes in the past, </I>firstly only these two, 
        namely, ignorance and formations are mentioned. But one who is ignorant 
        hankers, and hankering, clings, and with his clinging as condition there 
        is becoming, therefore craving, clinging and becoming are included as 
        well. Hence it is said: 'In the previous kamma-process becoming, there 
        is delusion, which is <I>ignorance;</I> there is accumulation, which is 
        <I>formations;</I> there is attachment, which is <I>craving;</I> there 
        is embracing, which is <I>clinging;</I> there is volition, which is 
        <I>becoming;</I> thus these five things in the previous kamma-process 
        becoming are conditions for rebirth-linking here [in the present 
        becoming]' (Ps.i,52).<BR>293. &nbsp; Herein, <I>In the previous 
        kamma-process becoming</I> means in kamma-process becoming done in the 
        previous birth. <I>There is delusion, which is ignorance</I> means that 
        the delusion that there then was about suffering, etc., deluded whereby 
        the man did the kamma, was ignorance. <I>There is accumulation, which is 
        formations</I> means the prior volitions arisen in one who prepares the 
        things necessary for a gift during a month, perhaps, or a year after he 
        has had the thought 'I shall give a gift'. [580] But it is the volitions 
        of one who is actually placing the offerings in the recipients' hands 
        that are called 'becoming'. Or alternatively, it is the volition that is 
        accumulation in six of the impulsions of a single adverting that is 
        called 'formations', and the seventh volition is called 'becoming'. Or 
        any kind of volition is called 'becoming' and the accumulations 
        associated therewith are called 'formations'. <I>There is attachment, 
        which is craving</I> means that in one performing kamma whatever 
        attachment there is and aspiration for its fruit as rebirth-process 
        becoming is craving. <I>There is embracing, which is clinging</I> means 
        that the embracing, the grasping, the adherence, which is a condition 
        for kamma-process becoming and occurs thus 'By doing this I shall 
        preserve, or I shall cut off, sense desire in such and such a place', is 
        called clinging. <I>There is volition, which is becoming</I> means the 
        kind of volition stated already at the end of the [sentence dealing 
        with] 'accumulation' is 'becoming'. This is how the meaning should be 
        understood.<BR>294. (b) <I>And now there is a fivefold fruit </I>(&sect;291) 
        means what is given in the text beginning with consciousness and ending 
        with feeling, according as it is said: 'Here [in the present becoming] 
        there is rebirth-linking, which is <I>consciousness;</I> there is 
        descent [into the womb], which is <I>mentality-materiality;</I> there is 
        sensitivity, which is <I>sense-base;</I> there is what is touched, which 
        is <I>contact;</I> there is what is felt, which is <I>feeling;</I> thus 
        these five things here in the [present] rebirth-process becoming have 
        their conditions <A href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/44fn" 
        name=44txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17C.html#44fn">{44}</A> in kamma 
        done in the past' (Ps.i,52).<BR>295. &nbsp; Herein, <I>there is 
        rebirth-linking, which is consciousness</I> means that is what is called 
        'rebirth linking' because it arises linking the next becoming that is 
        consciousness. <I>There is descent [into the womb], which is 
        mentality-materiality</I> means that is what consists in the descent of 
        the material and immaterial states into a womb, their arrival and entry 
        as it were that is mentality-materiality. <I>There is sensitivity, which 
        is sense base;</I> this is said of the five bases beginning with the 
        eye. <I>There is what is touched, which is contact</I> means that it is 
        what is arisen when an object is touched or in the touching of it, that 
        is contact. <I>There is what is felt, which is feeling</I> means that is 
        what is felt as results [of kamma] that is arisen together with rebirth 
        linking consciousness, or with the contact that has the sixfold base as 
        its condition, that is feeling. Thus should the meaning be 
        understood.<BR>296. &nbsp; (c) <I>There are five causes now as well</I> 
        (&sect;291) means craving, and so on. Craving, clinging and becoming are 
        given in the text. But when becoming is included, the formations that 
        precede it or that are associated with it are included too. And by 
        including craving and clinging, the ignorance associated with them, 
        deluded by which a man performs kamma, is included too. So they are 
        five. Hence it is said 'Here [in the present becoming] with the maturing 
        of the bases there is delusion, which is <I>ignorance;</I> there is 
        accumulation which is <I>formations;</I> there is attachment, which is 
        <I>craving;</I> there is embracing, which is <I>clinging;</I> there is 
        volition, which is <I>becoming;</I> thus these five things here in the 
        [present] kamma-process becoming are conditions for rebirth-linking in 
        the future' (Ps.i,52). [581]<BR>&nbsp; Herein, the words <I>Here [in the 
        present becoming] with the maturing of the bases</I> point out the 
        delusion existing at the time of the performance of the kamma in one 
        whose bases have matured. The rest is clear.<BR>297. &nbsp; (d) <I>And 
        in the future fivefold fruit:</I> the five beginning with consciousness. 
        These are expressed by the term 'birth'. But 'ageing-and-death' is the 
        ageing and the death of these [five] themselves. Hence it is said 'In 
        the future there is rebirth-linking, which is <I>consciousness;</I> 
        there is descent [into the womb], which is <I>mentality-materiality; 
        </I>there is sensitivity, which is <I>sense-base;</I> there is what is 
        touched, which is <I>contact;</I> there is what is felt, which is 
        <I>feeling;</I> thus these five things in the future rebirth-process 
        becoming have their condition <A href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/44fn" 
        name=44txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17C.html#44fn">{44}</A> in kamma 
        done here [in the present becoming]' (Ps.i,52).<BR>&nbsp; So this [Wheel 
        of Becoming] has twenty spokes with these qualities.<BR>298. &nbsp; 4. 
        <I>With triple round it spins for ever</I> (&sect;288): here formations and 
        becoming are the <I>round of kamma.</I> Ignorance, craving and clinging 
        are the <I>round of defilements.</I> Consciousness, 
        mentality-materiality, sixfold base, contact and feeling are the 
        <I>round of result.</I> So this Wheel of Becoming, having a triple round 
        with these three rounds, should be understood to spin, revolving again 
        and again, for ever; for the conditions are not cut off as long as the 
        round of defilement is not cut off.<BR><BR></FONT>

        thus,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) As

        the truths:] profitable and unprofitable kamma are stated in the 
        Saccavibha"nga (Vbh. 106f.) without distinction as the origin of 
        suffering and so formations due to ignorance [stated thus] 'With 
        ignorance as condition there are formations' are the second truth with 
        the second truth as source. Consciousness due to formations is the first 
        truth with the second truth as source. The states beginning with 
        mentality-materiality and ending with resultant feeling, due 
        respectively to consciousness, etc., are the first truth with the first 
        truth as source. Craving due to feeling is the second truth with the 
        first truth as source. Clinging due to craving is the second truth with 
        the second truth as source. Becoming due to clinging is first and second 
        truths with the second truth as source. Birth due to becoming is the 
        first truth with the second truth as source. Ageing-and-death due to 
        birth is the first truth with the first truth as source. This in the 
        first place is how [the Wheel of Becoming] should be known 'as to ... 
        source in the four truths' in whichever way is appropriate.<BR>301. 
        &nbsp; 2. <I>[As to function:]</I> ignorance confuses beings about 
        physical objects [of sense-desire] and is a condition for the 
        manifestation of formations; likewise [kamma-]formations [582] form the 
        formed and are a condition for consciousness; consciousness recognizes 
        an object and is a condition for mentality-materiality; 
        mentality-materiality is mutually consolidating and is a condition for 
        the sixfold base; the sixfold base occurs with respect to its own 
        [separate] objective fields and is a condition for contact; contact 
        touches an object and is a condition for feeling; feeling experiences 
        the stimulus of the object and is a condition for craving; craving lusts 
        after lust-arousing things and is a condition for clinging; clinging 
        clings to clinging-arousing things and is a condition for becoming; 
        becoming flings beings into the various kinds of destiny and is a 
        condition for birth; birth gives birth to the aggregates owing to its 
        occurring as their generation and is a condition for ageing-and-death; 
        and ageing-and-death ensures the decay and dissolution of the aggregates 
        and is a conditon for the manifestation of the next becoming because it 
        ensures sorrow, etc. <A href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/45fn" 
        name=45txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17C.html#45fn">{45}</A> - So this 
        [Wheel of Becoming] should be known accordingly as occurring in two ways 
        'as to function' in whichever way is appropriate to each of its 
        parts.<BR>302. &nbsp; <I>[As to prevention:]</I> the clause 'With 
        ignorance as condition there are formations' prevents seeing a maker; 
        the clause 'With formations as condition, consciousness' prevents seeing 
        the transmigration of a self; the clause 'With consciousness as 
        condition, mentality-materiality' prevents perception of compactness 
        because it shows the analysis of the basis conjectured to be 'self'; and 
        the clauses beginning 'With mentality-materiality as condition, the 
        sixfold base' prevent seeing any self that sees, etc., cognizes, 
        touches, feels, craves, clings, becomes, is born, ages and dies - So 
        this Wheel of Becoming should be known 'as to prevention' of wrong 
        seeing appropriately in each instance.<BR>303. &nbsp; 4. <I>[As to 
        simile:]</I> ignorance is like a blind man because there is no seeing 
        states according to their specific general characteristics; formations 
        with ignorance as condition are like the blind man's stumbling; 
        consciousness with formations as condition is like the stumbler's 
        falling; mentality-materiality with consciousness as condition is like 
        the appearance of a tumour on the fallen man; the sixfold base with 
        mentality-materiality as condition is like a gathering that makes the 
        tumour burst; contact with the sixfold base as condition is like hitting 
        the gathering in the tumour; feeling with contact as condition is like 
        the pain due to the blow; craving with feeling as condition is like 
        longing for a remedy; clinging with craving as condition is like seizing 
        what is unsuitable through longing for a remedy; [583] becoming with 
        clinging as condition is like applying the unsuitable remedy seized; 
        birth with becoming as condition is like the appearance of a change [for 
        the worse] in the tumour owing to the application of the unsuitable 
        remedy; and ageing-and-death with birth as condition is like the 
        bursting of the tumour after the change.<BR>&nbsp; Or again, ignorance 
        here as 'no theory' and 'wrong theory' (see &sect;52) befogs beings as a 
        cataract does the eyes; the fool befogged by it involves himself in 
        formations that produce further becoming, as a cocoon-spinning 
        caterpillar does with the strands of the cocoon; consciousness guided by 
        a minister establishes himself on a throne; [death] consciousness 
        conjecturing about the sign of rebirth generates mentality-materiality 
        in its various aspects in rebirth-linking, as a magician does an 
        illusion; the sixfold base planted in mentality-materiality reaches 
        growth, increase and fulfilment, as a forest thicket does planted in 
        good soil; contact is born from the impingement of the bases, as fire is 
        born from the rubbing together of fire sticks; feeling is manifested in 
        one touched by contact, as burning is in one touched by fire; craving 
        increases in one who feels, as thirst does in one who drinks salt water; 
        one who is parched [with craving] conceives longing for the kinds of 
        becoming, as a thirsty man does for drinks; that is his clinging; by 
        clinging he clings to becoming as a fish does to the hook through greed 
        for the bait; when there is becoming there is birth, as when there is a 
        seed there is a shoot; and death is certain for one who is born, as 
        falling down is for a tree that has grown up.<BR>&nbsp; So this Wheel of 
        Becoming should be known thus 'as to simile' too in whichever way is 
        appropriate.<BR>304. &nbsp; 5. <I>[Kinds of profundity:]</I> now the 
        Blessed One's word, 'This dependent origination is profound, Aananda, 
        and profound it appears' (D.ii,55) refers to profundity (a) of meaning, 
        (b) of law, (c) of teaching, and (d) of penetration. So this Wheel of 
        Becoming should be known 'as to the kinds of profundity' in whichever 
        way is appropriate.<BR>305. &nbsp; (a) Herein, the meaning of 
        ageing-and-death produced and originated wth birth as condition is 
        profound owing to difficulty in understanding its origin with birth as 
        condition thus: Neither does ageing-and-death not come about from birth, 
        nor, failing birth, does it come about from something else; it arises 
        [only] from birth with precisely that nature [of ageing-and-death]. And 
        the meaning of formations produced and originated with ignorance as 
        condition are treatable in like manner. That is why this Wheel of 
        Becoming is profound in meaning. This firstly is the profundity of 
        <I>meaning</I> here. [584] For it is the fruit of a cause that is called 
        'meaning' according as it is said 'Knowledge about the fruit of a cause 
        is the discrimination of meaning' (Vbh.293).<BR>306. &nbsp; (b) The 
        meaning of ignorance as condition for formations is profound since it is 
        difficult to understand in what mode and on what occasion <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/46fn" name=46txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17C.html#46fn">{46}</A> ignorance is 
        a condition for the several formations ... The meaning of birth as a 
        condition for ageing-and-death is similarly profound. That is why this 
        Wheel of Becoming is profound in law. This is the profundity of 
        <I>law</I> here. For 'law' is a name for cause according as it is said 
        'Knowledge about cause is discrimination of law' (Vbh.293).<BR>307. 
        &nbsp; (c) Then the teaching of this [dependent origination] is profound 
        since it needs to be given in various ways for various reasons, and none 
        but omniscient knowledge gets fully established in it; for in some 
        places in the suttas it is taught in forward order, in some in backward 
        order, in some in forward and backward order, in some in forward or in 
        backward order starting from the middle, in some in four sections and 
        three links, in some in three sections and two links and in some in two 
        sections and one link. That is why this Wheel of Becoming is profound in 
        teaching. This is the profundity of <I>teaching.</I><BR>308. &nbsp; (d) 
        Then the individual essences of ignorance, etc., owing to the 
        penetration of which, ignorance, etc., are rightly penetrated as to 
        their specific characteristic, are profound since they are difficult to 
        fathom. That is why this Wheel of Becoming is profound in penetration. 
        For here the meaning ignorance as unknowing and unseeing and 
        non-penetration of the truth is profound; so is the meaning of formation 
        as forming and accumulating with and without greed; so is the meaning of 
        consciousness as void, uninterested, and manifestation of 
        rebirth-linking without transmigration; as is the meaning of 
        mentality-materiality as simultaneous arising, as resolved into 
        components or not, and as bending [on to an object] <I>(namana)</I> and 
        being molested <I>(ruppana);</I> so is the meaning of the sixfold base 
        as predominance, world, door, field, and possession of objective field; 
        so is the meaning of contact as touching, impingement, coincidence, and 
        concurrence; so is the meaning of feeling as the experiencing of the 
        stimulus of an object, as pleasure or pain or neutrality, as soulless, 
        and as what is felt; so is the meaning of craving as a delighting in, as 
        a committal to, as a current, as a bindweed, as a river, as the ocean of 
        craving, and as impossible to fill; so is the meaning of clinging as 
        grasping, seizing misinterpreting, adhering, and hard to get by; so is 
        the meaning of becoming as accumulating, forming, and flinging into the 
        various kinds of generation, destiny, station, and abode; so is the 
        meaning of birth as birth coming to birth, descent [into the womb], 
        rebirth, and manifestation; and so is the meaning of ageing-and-death as 
        destruction, fall, break-up and change. This is profundity of 
        <I>penetration.</I><BR>309. &nbsp; 6. Then [585] there are four methods 
        of treating the meaning here. They are (a) the Method of Identity, (b) 
        the Method of Diversity, (c) the Method of Uninterest, <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/47fn" name=47txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17C.html#47fn">{47}</A> and (d) the 
        Method of Ineluctable Regularity. So this Wheel of Becoming should also 
        be known accordingly 'as to the kinds of method'. <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/48fn" name=48txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17C.html#48fn">{48}</A> <BR>310. 
        &nbsp; (a) Herein, the non-interruption of the continuity in this way 
        'With ignorance as condition there are formations; with formations as 
        condition, consciousness', just like a seed's reaching the state of a 
        tree through the state of the shoot, etc., is called the 'Method of 
        Identity'. One who sees this rightly abandons the annihilation view by 
        understanding the unbrokenness of the continuity that occurs through the 
        linking of cause and fruit. And one who sees it wrongly clings to the 
        eternity view by apprehending identity in the non-interruption of the 
        continuity that occurs through the linking of cause and fruit.<BR>311. 
        &nbsp; (b) The defining of the individual characteristic of ignorance, 
        etc., is called the 'Method of Diversity'. One who sees this rightly 
        abandons the eternity view by seeing the arising of each new state. And 
        one who sees it wrongly clings to the annihilation view by apprehending 
        individual diversity in the events in a single continuity as though it 
        were a broken continuity.<BR>312. (c) The absence of interestedness on 
        the part of ignorance such as 'Formations must be made to occur by me', 
        or on the part of formations such as 'Consciousness must be made to 
        occur by us', and so on, is called the 'Method of Uninterestedness'. One 
        who sees this rightly abandons the self view by understanding the 
        absence of a maker. One who sees it wrongly clings to 
        moral-inefficacy-of-action view, because he does not perceive that the 
        causative function of ignorance, etc., is established as a law by their 
        respective individual essences.<BR>313. &nbsp; (d) The production of 
        only formations, etc., respectively and no others with ignorance, etc., 
        as the respective reasons, like that of curd etc., with milk, etc., as 
        the respective reasons, is called the 'Method of Ineluctable 
        Regularity'. One who sees this rightly abandons the no-cause view and 
        the moral-inefficacy-of-action view by understanding how the fruit 
        accords with its condition. One who sees it wrongly by apprehending it 
        as non-production of anything from anything, instead of apprehending the 
        occurrence of the fruit in accordance with its conditions, clings to the 
        no-cause view and to the doctrine of fatalism.<BR>&nbsp; So this Wheel 
        of Becoming,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        As to source in the [four] Truths,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to function, prevention, 
        similies,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Kinds of profundity, and methods,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should be known 
        accordingly.<BR>344. &nbsp; There is no one, even in a dream, who has 
        got out of the fearful round of rebirths, which is ever destroying like 
        a thunderbolt, unless he has severed with the knife of knowledge well 
        whetted on the stone of sublime concentration, this Wheel of Becoming, 
        which offers no footing owing to its great profundity and is hard to get 
        by owing to the maze of many methods. [586]<BR>&nbsp; And this has been 
        said by the Blessed One: 'This dependent origination is profound, 
        Aananda, and profound it appears. And, Aananda, it is through not 
        knowing, through not penetrating it, that this generation has become a 
        tangled skein, a knotted ball of thread, root-matted as a reed bed, and 
        finds no way out of the round of the rebirths, with its states of loss, 
        unhappy destinies, ... perdition' (D.ii,55).<BR>&nbsp; Therefore, 
        practising for his own and others' benefit and welfare, and abandoning 
        other duties,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let a wise man with mindfulness<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So practice that he may 
        begin<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To 
        find a footing in the deeps<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        regards these four paragraphs from the Patisambhida (see &sect;&sect;292, 294, 296 
        and 298); all four end with the word <I>'paccayaa'</I> (nom.pl. and 
        abl.s. of <I>paccaya</I> = condition). In the first and third paragraphs 
        (&sect;&sect;292 and 296) this is obviously nom. pl. and agrees with the <I>'ime 
        pa~nca dhammaa'</I> (these five things). But in the second and fourth 
        paragraphs the context suggests <I>vipaakaa</I> (results) instead of 
        conditions. However there is no doubt that the accepted reading is 
        <I>paccayaa</I> here too; the passages is also quoted in Ch.XIX, &sect;13, in 
        the Sammohavinodani (Paccayaakaara-Vibha"nga commentary = present 
        context,) and at MA.i,53. The Paramatthama~njuusaa and Muula-tiikaa do 
        not mention this point. The Saddhammappakaasinii (Pa.tisambhidaa 
        commentary) comments on the first para: <I>'Purimakammabhavasmim</I> ti 
        atiitajaatiyaa kammabhave kariiyamaane pavattaa; <I>idha pa.tisandhiyaa 
        paccayaa</I> ti paccupannaa pa.tisandhiyaa paccayabhuutaa', and on the 
        second para 'Idh'upapattibhavasmi.m <I>pure katassa kammassa 
        paccayaa</I> ti paccupanne vipaakabhave atiitajaatiya.m katassa kammasa 
        paccayena pavattii ti attho'. The Tiikaa to the Majjima-nikaaya 
        commentary (MA,i,53) says of the second paragraph <I>'Ime paccayaa</I> 
        ti ime vi~n~naa.naadaya pa~nca ko.t.thaasikaa dhammaa, purimabhave 
        katassa, kammassa, kammavattassa, paccayaa, paccayabhaavato, tam 
        pa.ticca, idha, etarahi, upapattibhavasmi.m upapattibhavabhaavena vaa 
        hontii ti attho'. From these comments is is plain enough that 
        <I>'paccayaa'</I> in the second and fourth paragraphs is taken as abl. 
        sing. (e.g., <I>avijjaa-paccayaa sa"nkhaaraa).</I> There is a parallel 
        ablative construction with genitive at Ps.ii,72,1.8: 'Gatisampattiyaa 
        ~naa"nasampayutte <I>atthanna.m hetuuna"m paccayaa</I> uppatti hoti'. 
        Perhaps the literal rendering of the second and fourth paragraphs' final 
        sentence might be: Thus there are these five things here in the 
        [present] rebirth-process becoming with their condition [consisting] of 
        kamma done in the past', and so on. The point is unimportant.<BR><BR><A

        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17C.html#48txt">{48}</A> &nbsp; The 
        Dependent Origination, or Stucture of Conditions, appears as a flexible 
        formula with the intention of describing the ordinary human situation of 
        a man in his world (or indeed any conscious event where ignorance and 
        craving have not entirely ceased). That situation is always complex, 
        since it is implicit that Consciousness with no Object, or Being 
        (<I>bhava</I> becoming, or however rendered) without Consciousness (of 
        it), is impossible except as an artificial abstraction. The Dependent 
        Origination, being designed to portray the essentials of that situation 
        in the limited dimensions of words and using only elements recognizable 
        in experience, is not a logical proposition (Descartes' <I>Cogito</I> is 
        not a logical proposition). Nor is it a temporal cause-and-effect chain: 
        each memeber has to be examined as to its nature in order to determine 
        what its relations to the other are (e.g.) whether successive in time or 
        consacent, positive or negative, etc., etc.). A purely cause-and-effect 
        chain would not represent the pattern of a situation that is always 
        complex, always subjective-objective, static-dynamic, positive-negative, 
        and so on. Again, there is no evidence of any historical development in 
        the various forms given <I>within the limit of the Sutta Pi.taka</I> 
        (leaving aside the <I>Pa.tisambhidaamagga</I> ), and historical 
        treatment within that particular limit is likely to mislead, if it is 
        hypothesis with no foundation.<BR>&nbsp; Parallels with European thought 
        have been avoided in this translation. But perhaps an exception can be 
        made here, with due caution, in the case of Descartes. The revolution in 
        European thought started by his formula <I>cogito ergo sum</I> (I think, 
        therefore I am) is not yet ended. Now it will perhaps not escape notice 
        that the two elements, 'I think' and 'I am', in what is not a logical 
        proposition parallel to some extent the two members of the Dependent 
        Origination, Consciousness and Being (Becoming). In other words, 
        Consciousness activated by Craving and Clinging as the dynamic factory 
        guided and blinkered by ignorance ('I think' or 'consciousness with the 
        conceit "I am"') conditions Being ('therefore I am') in a complex 
        relationship with other factors relating subject and object (not 
        accounted for by Descartes). The parallel should not be pushed too far. 
        In fact it is only introduced because in Europe the Dependent 
        Origination seems to be very largely misunderstood with many strange 
        interpretations placed upon it, and because the <I>Cogito</I> does seem 
        to offer some sort of reasonable approach.<BR>&nbsp; In this work, for 
        convenience because of the special importance attached here to the 
        aspect of the death-rebirth link, the Dependent Origination is 
        considered from only one standpoint, namely, as applicable to a period 
        embracing a minimum of three lives. But this in not the only 
        application. With suitable modifications it is also used in the 
        Vibha"nga to describe the structure of the Complex in each one of the 89 
        single type-consciousnesses laid down in the Dhammasa"nga.nii; and 
        Bhadantaacariya Buddhaghosa says 'This Structure of Conditions is 
        present not only in (a continuity period consisting of) multiple 
        consciousness but also in each consciousness single as well' (VbhA. 
        199-200). Also the Pa.tisambhidaamagga gives five expositions, four 
        describing dependent origination in one life, the fifth being made to 
        present a special inductive generalization to extend what is observable 
        in this life (the fact that consciousness is always preceded by 
        consciousness, cf. this Ch. &sect;83f. - i.e. that it always has a past and 
        is inconceivable without one) back beyond birth, and (since craving and 
        ignorance ensure its expected continuance) on after death. There are 
        besides, various other, differing, applications indicated by the variant 
        forms given in the Suttas themselves.<BR><BR></FONT>
