        (cont'd.) &nbsp; According to the Suttanta method [530] <I>ignorance</I> 
        is unknowing about the four instances beginning with suffering. 
        According to the Abhidhamma method it is unknowing about the eight 
        instances [that is to say, the above-mentioned four] together with [the 
        four] beginning with the past; for this is said 'Herein, what is 
        ignorance? It is unkowing about suffering, [unknowing about the origin 
        of suffering, unknowing about the cessation of suffering, unknowing 
        about the way leading to the cessation of suffering,] unknowing about 
        the past, unknowing about the future, unknowing about the past and 
        future, unknowing about specific conditionality and conditionally-arisen 
        states' (cf. Dhs.1162). <BR>59. &nbsp; Herein, while ignorance about any 
        instance that is not the two supramundane truths can also arise as 
        object (see &sect;102), nevertheless here it is only intended [subjectively] 
        as concealment. For when [thus] arisen it keeps the truth of 
        <I>suffering</I> concealed, preventing penetration of the true 
        individual function and characteristic of that truth. Likewise, origin, 
        cessation, and the path, bygone five aggregates called <I>the past,</I> 
        coming five aggregates called <I>the future,</I> both of these together 
        called <I>the past and future,</I> and both specific conditionality and 
        conditionally-arisen states together called <I>specific conditionality 
        and conditionally-arisen states</I> - all of which it keeps concealed, 
        preventing their true individual functions and characteristics being 
        penetrated thus: This is ignorance, these are formations. That is why it 
        is said, 'It is unknowing about suffering ... unknowing about specific 
        conditionality and conditionally-arisen states'.<BR></FONT>

        name=Formations></A>[ii. Formations]<BR><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><FONT 
        size=+1><FONT size=+1>60. &nbsp; <I>Formations</I> are the six mentioned 
        in brief above thus 'the three, namely, formations of merit, etc., and 
        the three, namely, the bodily formation, etc.' (&sect;44); but in detail here 
        the [first] three formations are twenty-nine volitions, that is to say, 
        the formation of merit consisting of thirteen volitions, counting the 
        eight sense-sphere profitable volitions that occur in giving, in virtue, 
        etc., and the five fine-material profitable volitions that occur in 
        development [of meditation]; then the formation of demerit consisting of 
        the twelve unprofitable volitions that occur in killing living things, 
        etc.; then the formation of the imperturbable consisting in the four 
        profitable volitions associated with the immaterial sphere, which occur 
        in development [of those meditations].<BR>61. &nbsp; As regards the 
        other three, the bodily formation is bodily volition, the verbal 
        formation is verbal volition, and the mental formation is mental 
        volition. This triad is mentioned in order to show that at the moment of 
        the accumulation of the kamma the formations of merit, etc., occur in 
        these [three] kamma doors. For the eight sense-sphere profitable and 
        twelve unprofitable volitions, making twenty, are the bodily formation 
        when they occur in the body door and produce bodily intimation. Those 
        same volitions [531] are called the verbal formation when they occur in 
        the speech door and produce verbal intimation. But volition connected 
        with direct-knowledge is not included here in these two cases because it 
        is not a condition for [resultant rebirth-linking] consciousness later. 
        And like direct-knowledge volition, so also volition connected with 
        agitation is not included; therefore that too should not be included as 
        a condition for [rebirth-linking] consciousness. However, all these have 
        ignorance as their condition. And all the twenty-nine volitions are the 
        mental formation when they arise in the mind door without originating 
        either kind of intimation. So this triad comes within the first triad, 
        and accordingly, as far as the meaning is concerned, ignorance can be 
        understood as condition simply for formations of merit and so on.<BR>62. 
        &nbsp; Herein, it might be [asked]: How can it be known that these 
        formation have ignorance as their condition? - By the fact that they 
        exist when ignorance exists. For when unknowing - in other words, 
        ignorance - of suffering, etc., is unabandoned in a man, owing firstly 
        to his unknowing about suffering and about the past, etc., then he 
        believes the suffering of the round of rebirths to be pleasant and he 
        embarks upon the three kinds of formations which are the cause of that 
        very suffering. Owing to his unknowing about suffering's origin he 
        embarks upon formations that, being subordinated to craving, are 
        actually the cause of suffering, imagining them to be the cause of 
        pleasure. And owing to his unknowing about cessation and the path, he 
        misperceives the cessation of suffering to be in some particular destiny 
        [such as the Brahma world] that is not in fact cessation; he 
        misperceives the path to cessation, believing it to consist in 
        sacrifices, mortification for immortality, etc., which are not in fact 
        the path to cessation; and so while aspiring to the cessation of 
        suffering, he embarks upon the three kinds of formation in the form of 
        sacrifices, mortification for immortality, and so on.<BR>63. &nbsp; 
        Furthermore, his non-abandonment of that ignorance about the four truths 
        in particular prevents him from recognizing as suffering the kind of 
        suffering called the fruit of merit, which is fraught with the many 
        dangers beginning with birth, ageing, disease and death, and so he 
        embarks upon the formation of merit classed as bodily, verbal, and 
        mental formations in order to attain that [kind of suffering], like one 
        desiring celestial nymphs [who jumps over] a cliff. Also not seeing how 
        that fruit of merit reckoned as pleasure eventually breeds great 
        distress owing to the suffering in its change and that it gives little 
        satisfaction, he embarks upon the formation of merit of the kinds 
        already stated, which is the condition for that very [suffering in 
        change], like a moth that falls into a lamp's flame, and like the man 
        who wants the drop of honey and licks the honey-smeared knife-edge. Also 
        not seeing the danger in the indulgence of sense-desires, etc., with its 
        result, [wrongly] perceiving pleasure and overcome by defilements, he 
        embarks upon the formation of demerit that occurs in the three doors [of 
        kamma], like a child who plays with filth, and like a man who wants to 
        die and eats poison. Also, unaware of the suffering due to formations 
        and the suffering-in-change [inherent] in kamma-results in the 
        immaterial sphere, owing to the perversion of [wrongly perceiving them 
        as] eternal, etc., he embarks upon the formation of the imperturbable 
        which is a mental formation, like one who has lost his way and takes the 
        road to a goblin city.<BR>64. &nbsp; So formations exist only when 
        ignorance exists, [532] not when it does not; and that is how it can be 
        known that these formations have ignorance as their condition.<BR>&nbsp; 
        This is said too 'Not knowing, bhikkhus, in ignorance, he forms the 
        formation of merit, forms the formation of demerit, forms the formation 
        of the imperturbable. As soon as a bhikkhu's ignorance is abandoned and 
        clear vision arisen, bhikkhus, with the fading away of ignorance and the 
        arising of clear vision he does not form even formations of merit' 
        (cf.S.ii,82).<BR>65. &nbsp; Here it might be said: Let us then firstly 
        agree that ignorance is a condition for formations. But it must now be 
        stated for which formations, and in which way it is a 
        condition.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp;Here is the reply: Twenty-four conditions 
        have been stated by the Blessed One as follows.<BR></FONT></FONT><BR>

        non-disappearance condition' (Ptn1.1).<BR>&nbsp;67. &nbsp; (1) Herein it 
        is a root-cause and a condition, thus it is <I>root-cause condition.</I> 
        It is by its being a root-cause that it is a condition; what is meant is 
        that it is a condition owing to its status as root-cause. The same 
        method applies in the case of object condition and the rest.<BR>&nbsp; 
        Herein, 'cause <I>(hetu)'</I> is a term for a part of a syllogism, for a 
        reason, and for a root. For with the words 'proposition 
        <I>(patinna)',</I> 'cause (= <I>hetu</I> = middle term)', etc., in the 
        world it is a member of a syllogism that is called a 'cause'. But in the 
        Dispensation, in such passages as 'Those states that are produced from a 
        cause' (Vin.i,40) it is a reason <I>(karana);</I> and in such passages 
        as 'Three profitable [root-]causes, three unprofitable [root-]causes' 
        (Dhs.1053) it is a root <I>(mula)</I> that is called a 'cause'. The last 
        is intended here.<BR>68. &nbsp; As to 'condition <I>(paccaya)'</I> , the 
        word-meaning here is this: It [the fruit,] comes from that, depending 
        thereon <I>(paticca etasma eti),</I> thus that is a condition 
        <I>(paccaya</I> see note 2); the meaning is, [a state] occurs by not 
        dispensing with that. What is meant is: when a state is indispensable to 
        another state's presence or arising, the former is a condition for the 
        latter. But as to characteristic, a condition has the characteristic of 
        assisting; for any given state [533] that assists the presence or 
        arising of a given state is called the latter's condition. The words, 
        condition, cause, reason, source, originator, producer, etc., are one in 
        meaning though different in the letter. So, since it is a cause in the 
        sense of a root, and a condition in the sense of assistance, briefly a 
        state that is assistantial in the sense of a root is a [root-]cause 
        condition.<BR>69. &nbsp; The intention of [some] teachers is that it 
        establishes the profitable, etc., state in what is profitable, etc., as 
        paddy seeds, etc., do for paddy, etc., and as the colour of gems, etc., 
        do for the lustre of gems, and so on. <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/10fn" name=10txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B2.html#10fn">{10}</A> &nbsp; But 
        if that is so, then [it follows that] the state of root-cause condition 
        does not aply to the kinds of materiality originated by it, for it does 
        not establish any profitableness, etc., in them. Nevertheless it is a 
        condition for them, for this is said 'Root-causes are a condition, as 
        root-cause condition, for the states associated with a root-cause and 
        for the kinds of materiality originated thereby' (Ptn1.1). Again, the 
        indeterminateness of root-cause-less consciousness is established 
        without it. And the profitableness, etc., of those with root-cause is 
        bound up with wise attention, etc., not with the associated root-causes. 
        And if the profitableness, etc., resided in the associated root-causes 
        as an individual essence, then either the non-greed bound up with the 
        root-cause in the associated states would be only profitable or it would 
        be only indeterminate; but since it can be both, profitableness, etc., 
        in the root-causes must still be sought for, just as in the associated 
        states [such as wise attention, and so on].<BR>70. &nbsp; But when the 
        root-causes' sense of root is taken as establishing stableness, rather 
        than as establishing profitableness, etc., there is no contradiction. 
        For states that have obtained a root-cause condition are firm, like 
        trees, and stable; but those without root-cause are, like moss [with 
        roots no bigger than] sesamum seeds, etc., unstable. So an assistantial 
        state may be understood as a root-cause condition, since it establishes 
        stableness through being of assistance in the sense of a root.<BR>71. 
        &nbsp; (2) As to the others that follow, a state that assists by being 
        an object is an <I>object condition.</I> Now there are no states that 
        are not object conditions; for the passage beginning 'The visible-data 
        base [is a condition, as object condition,] for the eye-consciousness 
        element' concludes thus 'When any states, as states of consciousness and 
        consciousness-concomitants, arise contingent upon any states, these 
        [latter] states are conditions, as object condition, for those [former] 
        states' (Ptn1.1). <A href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/11fn" 
        name=11txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B2.html#11fn">{11}</A> For just as 
        a weak man both gets up and stands by hanging on to <I>(alambitva)</I> a 
        stick or rope, so states of consciousness and consciousness-concomitants 
        always arise and are present contingent upon visible data, etc., as 
        their object <I>(arammana = alambana).</I> Therefore all states that are 
        objects of consciousness and consciousness-concomitants should be 
        understood as object condition. [534]<BR>72. &nbsp; (3) A state that 
        assists in the sense of being foremost is a <I>predominance 
        condition.</I> It is of two kinds as conascent and as object. Herein, 
        because of the passage beginning 'Predominance of zeal is a condition, 
        as predominace condition, for states associated with zeal and for the 
        kinds of materiality originated thereby' (Ptn1.2), it is the four states 
        called zeal, [purity of] consciousness, energy, and inquiry, that should 
        be understood as predominance condition; but not simultaneously, for 
        when consciousness occurs with emphasis on zeal and putting zeal 
        foremost, then it is zeal not the others, that is predominant. So with 
        the rest. But the state, by giving importance to which, immaterial 
        states occur, is their <I>object-predominance.</I> Hence it is said 
        'When any states, as states of consciousness and 
        consciousness-concomitants arise by giving importance to any states, 
        these [latter] states are a condition, as predominance condition, for 
        those [former] states' (Ptn1.2).<BR>73. &nbsp; (4), (5) A state that 
        assists by being proximate is a <I>proximity condition.</I> A state that 
        assists by being contiguous is a <I>contiguity condition.</I> The 
        explanation of this pair of conditions is very diffuse, but 
        substantially it is this: <A href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/12fn" 
        name=12txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B2.html#12fn">{12}&nbsp;</A> the 
        regular order of consciousness begins thus, mind element is proximate 
        (next) after eye consciousness, mind-consciousness element is proximate 
        (next) after eye consciousness, mind-consciousness element is proximate 
        (next) after mind element, and this is established only by each 
        preceding consciousness, not otherwise; consequently a state that is 
        capable of arousing an appropriate kind of consciousness proximate 
        (next) to itself is a proximity condition. Hence it is said 'Proximity 
        condition: eye consciousness and the states associated therewith are a 
        condition, as proximity condition, for mind-element and for the states 
        associated therewith' (Ptn1.2).<BR>74. &nbsp; (5) Proximity condition is 
        the same as <I>contiguity condition.</I> The difference here is only in 
        the letter, there is none in the meaning; just as in the case of the 
        words 'growth' and 'continuity' (Ch.XIV,&sect;66), etc., and as in the case 
        of the 'terminology dyad', 'language dyad' (Dhs.1306), and so on.<BR>75. 
        &nbsp; The opinion of [certain] teachers <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/13fn" name=13txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B2.html#13fn">{13}</A> &nbsp; is 
        that proximity condition refers to proximity of aim (fruit) and 
        contiguity condition refers to proximity of time. But that is 
        contradicted by such statements as 'The profitable [consciousness] 
        belonging to the base consisting of neither perception nor 
        non-perception in one who emerges from cessation is a condition, as 
        contiguity condition, for fruition attainment [consciousness]' 
        (Ptn1.160).<BR>76. &nbsp; Now they say in this context that 'The ability 
        of states to produce [their fruit] is not diminished, but the influence 
        of meditative development prevents states from arising in proximity'. 
        But that only establishes that there is no proximity of time; and we 
        also say the same, namely, that there is no proximity of time there 
        owing to the influence of development. [535] But since there is no 
        proximity of time, the state of contiguity condition is therefore 
        impossible [according to them] since their belief is that the contiguity 
        condition depends on proximity of time (cf.MA.ii,363). Instead of 
        adopting any such misinterpretation the difference should be treated as 
        residing in the letter only, not in the meaning. How? There is no 
        interval <I>(antara)</I> between them, thus they are proximate 
        <I>(an-antara);</I> they are quite without interval because [even the 
        distinction of] co-presence is lacking, thus they are contiguous 
        <I>(samanantara).</I><A href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/14fn" 
        name=14txt></A> <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B2.html#14fn">{14}</A> <BR>77. 
        &nbsp; A state that, while arising, assists [another state] by making it 
        arise together with itself is a <I>conascence condition,</I> as a lamp 
        is for illumination. With the imaterial aggregates, etc., it is sixfold, 
        according as it is said '(i)The four immaterial aggregates are a 
        condition, as conascence condition, for each other; (ii) the four great 
        primaries are ... for each other; (iii) at the moment of descent into 
        the womb mentality and materiality are ... for each other; (iv) states 
        of consiousness and its concomitants are ... for the kinds of 
        materiality originated by consciousness; (v) the great primaries are ... 
        for derived materiality; (vi) material states are sometimes [as at 
        rebirth-linking] a condition, as conascence condition, and sometimes [as 
        in the course of an existence] not a condition as conascence condition, 
        for immaterial states' (Ptn1.3). This refers only to the heart 
        basis.<BR>78. &nbsp; (7) A state that assists by means of mutual 
        arousing and consolidating is a <I>mutuality condition,</I> as the three 
        sticks of a tripod give each other consolidating support. With the 
        immaterial aggregates, etc., it is threefold, according as it is said 
        'The four immaterial aggregates are a condition as mutuality condition, 
        [for each other;] the four great primaries are conditions, as mutuality 
        condition, [for each other;] at the moment of descent into the womb 
        mentality and materiality are conditions, as mutuality condition, [for 
        each other]' (Ptn1.3).<BR>79. &nbsp; (8) A state that assists in the 
        mode of foundation and in the mode of support is a <I>support 
        condition,</I><SUPPORT i="" condition,<> as the earth is for trees, as 
        canvas is for paintings, and so on. It should be understood in the way 
        stated for conascence thus 'The four immaterial aggregates are a 
        condition, as support condition, for each other' (Ptn1.3), but the sixth 
        instance has been set forth in this way here 'The eye base [is a 
        condition, as support condition,] for the eye-consciousness element [and 
        for the states associated therewith]; the ear base ...; the nose base 
        ...; the tongue base ...; the body base is a condition, as support 
        condition, for the body-consciousness element and for the states 
        associated therewith; the materiality with which as their support the 
        mind element and the mind-consciousness element occur is a condition, as 
        support condition, for the mind element, and for the states associated 
        therewith' (Ptn1.4).<BR>80. &nbsp; (9) <I>Decisive support 
        condition;</I> firstly here is the word-meaning: [536] it is treated as 
        support, not dispensed with, by its own fruit because [its own fruit's] 
        existence is dependent on it, thus it is the support. But just as great 
        misery is despair, so great support is decisive support. This is a term 
        for a cogent reason. Consequently a state that assists by being a cogent 
        reason should be understood as a decisive support condition.<BR>&nbsp; 
        It is threefold, namely (a) object-decisive-support, (b) 
        proximate-decisive-support, and (c) natural-decisive-support, 
        condition.<BR>81. &nbsp; (a) Herein, firstly 
        <I>object-decisive-support-condition</I> is set forth without 
        differentiating it from object-predominance in the way beginning 'Having 
        given a gift, having undertaken the precepts of virtue, having done the 
        duties of the Uposatha, a man gives that importance and reviews it; he 
        gives importance to former things well done and reviews them. Having 
        emerged from jhana, he gives jhana importance and reviews it. Trainers 
        give importance to change-of-lineage and review it. They give importance 
        to cleansing and review it. <A href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/15fn" 
        name=15txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B2.html#15fn">{15}</A> Trainers, 
        having emerged from a path, give importance to the path and review it' 
        (Ptn1.165). Herein, the object, in giving importance to which, 
        consciousness and consciousness-concomitants arise, is necessarily a 
        cogent one among these objects. So their difference may be understood in 
        this way: <I>object-predominance</I> is in the sense of what is to be 
        given importance to, and object-decisive-support is in the sense of a 
        cogent reason.<BR>82. &nbsp; (b) Also <I>proximate-decisive-support 
        condition</I> is set forth without differentiating it from the proximity 
        condition in the way beginning 'Any preceding profitable aggregates are 
        conditions, as decisive-support condition, for any succeeding 
        aggregates' (Ptn1.165). But in the exposition there is a distinction, 
        because in the exposition of the schedule <I>(matika-nikkhepa)</I> they 
        are given as proximity in the way beginning 'Eye-consciousness element 
        and the states associated therewith are conditions, as proximity 
        condition, for mind element and for the states associated therewith' 
        (Ptn1.2) and as decisive-support in the way beginning 'Any preceding 
        profitable states are a condition as decisive-support condition, for any 
        succeeding profitable states' (Ptn1,4), though it comes to the same 
        thing as regards the meaning. Nevertheless <I>proximity</I> may be 
        understood as the ability to cause the ocurrence of an appropriate 
        consciousness arising proximate (next) to itself, and <I>decisive 
        support</I> as the preceding consciousness's cogency<BR>83. in the 
        arousing of the succeeding consciousnesses. For while in the cases of 
        root-cause and other such conditions consciousness can arise actually 
        without any of those conditions, however, there is no arising of 
        consciousness without a proximate consciousness [to precede it], so this 
        is a cogent condition. Their difference, then, may be understood in this 
        way <I>proximity condition</I> arouses an appropriate consciousness 
        proximate (next) to itself, while <I>proximity-decisive-support 
        condition</I> is a cogent reason.<BR>84. &nbsp; (c) As to 
        <I>natural-decisive-support:</I> the decisive-support is natural, thus 
        it is a natural-decisive-support. Faith, virtue, etc., produced in, or 
        climate, food, etc., habitual to, one's own continuity, are called 
        natural. Or else, it is a decisive-support by nature, [537] thus it is a 
        natural-decisive-support. The meaning is that it is unmixed with object 
        and proximity. It should be understood as variously divided up in the 
        way beginning 'Natural-decisive-support: with faith as decisive support 
        a man gives a gift, undertakes the precepts of virtue, does the duties 
        of the Uposatha, arouses jhana, arouses insight, arouses the path, 
        arouses direct knowledge, arouses attainment. With virtue ... With 
        learning ... With generosity ... With understanding as decisive-support 
        a man gives a gift ... arouses an attainment. Faith, virtue, learning, 
        generosity, understanding, are conditions, as decisive-support 
        condition, for [the repeated arising of] faith, virtue, learning, 
        generosity, understanding' (Ptn1.165). So these things beginning with 
        faith are natural-decisive-support since they are both natural and 
        decisive-supports in the sense of a cogent reason.<BR>85. &nbsp; (10) A 
        state that assists by being present, having arisen previously, is a 
        <I>prenascence condition.</I> It is elevenfold as physical basis and 
        object in the five doors, and as the heart basis, according as it is 
        said 'The eye base is a condition, as prenascence condition, for the 
        eye-consciousness element and for the states associated therewith. The 
        ear base ... The nose base ... The tongue base ... The body base ... The 
        visible-data base ... The sound base ... The odour base ... The flavour 
        base ... The tangible-data base is a condition, as prenascence 
        condition, for the body-consciousness element and for the states 
        associated therewith. The visible-data base ... The sound base ... The 
        odour base ... The flavour base ... the tangible data base [is a 
        condition, as prenascence condition,] for the mind element. The 
        materiality with which as their support the mind element and 
        mind-consciousness element occur is a condition, as prenascence 
        condition, for the mind-element and for the states associated therewith, 
        and it is sometimes [as in the course of an existence] a condition, as 
        prenascence condition, sometimes [as at rebirth linking] not a condition 
        as prenascence condition, for the mind-consciousness element and for the 
        states associated therewith' (Ptn1.4-5).<BR>86. &nbsp; (11) An 
        immaterial state that [while present] assists prenascent material states 
        [also present] by consolidating them is a <I>postnascence condition,</I> 
        like the volition of appetite for food, which assists the bodies of 
        vultures' young. Hence it is said 'Postnascent [538] states of 
        consciousness and its concomitants are a condition, as postnascence 
        condition, for the prenascent [copresent] body' (Ptn1.5).<BR>87. &nbsp; 
        (12) A state that assists the efficiency and power of the proximate 
        (next) in the sense of repetition is a <I>repetition condition,</I> like 
        repeated application to books and so on. It is threefold as profitable, 
        unprofitable, and functional, impulsion; for it is said 'Preceding 
        profitable states are a condition, as repetition condition, for 
        succeeding profitable states ... Preceding unprofitable ... Preceding 
        functional indeterminate states are a condition as repetition condition, 
        for succeeding functional indeterminate states' (Ptn1.5)<BR>88. &nbsp; 
        (13) A state that assists by means of the action called intervening of 
        consciousness is a <I>kamma condition.</I> It is twofold as (a) 
        profitable and unprofitable volition acting from a different time and 
        (b) as all conascent volition (see Ptn1.172), according as it is said 
        'Profitable and unprofitable kamma is a condition, as kamma condition, 
        for resultant aggregates and for the kinds of materiality due to kamma 
        performed. Conascent volition is a condition, as kamma condition, for 
        associated states and for the kinds of materiality originated thereby' 
        (Ptn1.5).<BR>89. &nbsp; (14) A resultant state that, by effortless 
        quiet, assists effortless quiet [in other states] is a <I>kamma-result 
        condition.</I> In the course of an existence it is a condition for 
        states originated by it, and at rebirth-linking for the kinds of 
        materiality due to kamma performed, and in both cases for the associated 
        states, according as it is said 'One resultant indeterminate aggregate 
        is a condition, as kamma-result condition, for three aggregates and for 
        the kinds of materiality originated by consciousness ... At the moment 
        of rebirth linking one resultant indeterminate aggregate [is a condition 
        ...] for three aggregates ... Three aggregates are a condition, as 
        kamma-result condition, for two aggregates and for the kinds of 
        materiality due to kamma performed. Aggregates are a condition as 
        kamma-result condition, for the physical basis' (Ptn1.173).<BR>90. 
        &nbsp; (15) The four kinds of nutriment, which assist material and 
        immaterial states by consolidating them, are <I>nutriment 
        conditions,</I> according as it is said 'Physical nutriment is a 
        condition, as nutriment condition, for this body. Immaterial nutriments 
        are conditions, as nutriment condition, for associated states and for 
        the kinds of materiality originated by them' (Ptn1.5). But in the 
        Question Section it is said 'At the moment of rebirth-linking resultant 
        indeterminate nutriments are conditions, as nutriment condition, for 
        aggregates associated therewith and for the kinds of materiality due to 
        kamma performed' (Ptn1.175).<BR>91. &nbsp; (16) Leaving out the 
        femininity and masculinity faculties, the twenty remaining faculties 
        (see Ch. XVI,&sect;1), which assist in the sense of predominance, [539] are 
        <I>faculty conditions.</I> Herein, the five, namely, the eye-faculty, 
        etc., are conditions only for immaterial states, the rest are conditions 
        for material and immaterial states, according as it is said 'The eye 
        faculty [is a condition, as faculty condition,] for eye-consciousness 
        element and for the states associated therewith. The material life 
        faculty is a condition, as faculty condition, for the body-consciousness 
        element and for the states associated therewith. The material life 
        faculty is a condition, as faculty condition, for the kinds of 
        materiality due to kamma performed. The immaterial faculties are a 
        condition, as faculty condition, for the states associated therewith and 
        for the kinds of materiality originated thereby' (Ptn1.5-6). But in the 
        Question Section it is said 'At the moment of rebirth-linking resultant 
        indeterminate faculties are a condition, as faculty condition, for 
        associated aggregates and for the kinds of materiality due to kamma 
        performed' (Ptn1.175).<BR>92. &nbsp; (17) All the seven jhana factors 
        classed as profitable, etc. - leaving out the pair, pleasant and painful 
        feeling, in the case of the two sets of five consciousness -, which 
        factors assist in the sense of constituting a state of jhana, are 
        <I>jhana conditions,</I> according as it is said 'The jhana factors are 
        a condition, as jhana condition, for the states associated with jhana 
        and for the kinds of materiality originated thereby' (Ptn1.6). But in 
        the Question Section it is said 'At the moment of rebirth-linking 
        resultant indeterminate jhana factors are condition, as jhana condition, 
        for associated aggregates and for the kinds of materiality due to kamma 
        performed' (Ptn1.175).<BR>93. &nbsp; (18) The twelve path factors 
        classed as profitable, etc., which assist in the sense of an outlet from 
        whatever it may be, are <I>path conditions,</I> according as it is said, 
        'The path factors are a condition, as path condition, for states 
        associated therewith and the kinds of materiality originated thereby' 
        (Ptn1.6). But in the Question Section it is said 'At the moment of 
        rebirth-linking resultant indeterminate path factors are a condition, as 
        path condtion, for aggregates associated therewith and for the kinds of 
        materiality due to kamma performed' (Ptn1.176).<BR>&nbsp; But these two, 
        namely, jhana and path conditions, should be understood as inapplicable 
        to the two sets of five consciousnesses and to the consciousness without 
        root-cause ((34)-(41), (50)-(56), (70)-(72)).<BR>94. &nbsp; (19) 
        Immaterial states that assist by the kind of association consisting in 
        having the same physical basis, same object, same arising, same 
        cessation are <I>association conditions,</I> according as it is said 
        'The four immaterial aggregregates are a condition, as association 
        condition, for each other' (Ptn.1.6).<BR>95. &nbsp; (20) Material states 
        that assist immaterial states, and immaterial states that assist 
        material states by not having sameness of physical basis, etc., are 
        <I>dissociation conditions.</I> This is threefold as conascent, 
        postnascent, and prenascent, for this is said 'Conascent profitable 
        aggregates are a condition, as dissociation condition, for the kinds of 
        materiality originated by consciousness. Postnascent [540] profitable 
        [mental] aggregates are a condition, as dissociation condition, for this 
        prenascent body' (Ptn1.176). But in the analysis of the conascent in the 
        indeterminate clause it is said 'At the moment of rebirth-linking 
        resultant indeterminate aggregates are a condition, as dissociation 
        condition, for the kinds of materiality due to kamma performed. The 
        aggregates are a condition, as dissociation condition, for the physical 
        basis, and the physical basis for the aggregates' (Ptn1.176). But the 
        prenascent should be understood as the eye faculty, etc., and the 
        physical basis, according as it is said 'The prenascent eye base [is a 
        condition, as dissociation condition,] for eye consciousness ... The 
        body base is a condition, as dissociation condition, for body 
        consciousness. The physical basis [is a condition, as dissociation 
        condition,] for resultant-indeterminate and functional-indeterminate 
        aggregates ... The physical basis [is a condition, as dissociation 
        condition,] for profitable aggregates ... The physical basis [is a 
        condition, as dissociation condition,] for unprofitable aggregates' 
        (Ptn1.176-7).<BR>96. &nbsp; (21) A state that, by means of existingness 
        characterized by presence, assists a like state by consolidating it is a 
        <I>presence condition.</I> A sevenfold summary is laid down for it 
        according to immaterial aggregates, great primaries, 
        mentality-materiality, consciousness and consciousness-concomitant, 
        great primaries, bases, and physical [heart] basis, according as it is 
        said 'The four immaterial aggregates are a condition, as presence 
        condition, for each other. The four great primaries ... are ... for each 
        other. At the time of descent into the womb mentality and materiality 
        [are a condition, as presence condition,] for each other. States of 
        consciousness and consciousness-concomitants are ... for the kinds of 
        materiality originated by consciousness. The four great primaries are 
        ... for derived materiality. The eye base is ... for the 
        eye-consciousness element [and for the states associated therewith]. The 
        [ear base ... nose base ... tongue base ...] body base is ... for 
        body-consciousness element ... The visible-data base [is ... for the 
        eye-consciousness element ... The sound base ... odour base ... flavour 
        base ...] The tangible-data base is a condition, as presence condition, 
        for the body-consciousness element and for the states associated 
        therewith. The visible-data base ... The [sound base ... odour base ... 
        flavour base ...] tangible-data base is a condition, as presence 
        condition, for the mind element and for the states associated therewith. 
        The materiality with which as their support the mind element and 
        mind-consciousness element occur is a condition, as presence condition, 
        for the mind element, for the mind-consciousness element, and for the 
        states<BR>97. associated therewith' (Ptn1.6). But in the Question 
        Section, after setting forth conascence, prenascence, postnascence, 
        nutriment, and faculty, the description is given first under conascence 
        in the way beginning 'One aggregate is a condition, as presence 
        condition, for three aggregates and for materiality originated thereby' 
        (Ptn1.178). Under prenascence the description is given according to the 
        prenascent eye and so on. Under prenascence the description is given 
        according to the prenascent eye and so on. Under postnascence the 
        description is given according to postnascent consciousness and 
        consciousness-concomitants as conditions for this body. Under nutriments 
        and faulties [respectively] the description is given thus 'Physical 
        nutriment is a condition, as presence condition, for this body' [541] 
        and 'The material life faculty is a condition, as presence condition, 
        for materiality due to kamma performed' (Ptn1.178). <A

        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B2.html#16fn">{16}</A> <BR>98. 
        &nbsp; (22) Immaterial states that, by their ceasing in contiguity 
        [before], assist by giving opportunity to immaterial states that arise 
        proximately (next) after them are <I>absence conditions,</I> according 
        as it is said 'States of consciousness and consciousness-concomitants 
        that have ceased in contiguity before are a condition, as absence 
        condition, for present states of consciousness and 
        consciousness-concomitants' (Ptn1.7).<BR>99. &nbsp; (23) Those same 
        states, because they assist by their disappearance, are a 
        <I>disappearance condition,</I> according as it is said 'States of 
        consciousness and consciousness-concomitants that have disappeared in 
        contiguity are a condition, as disappearance condition, for present 
        states of consciousness and consciousness-concomitants' 
        (Ptn1.7).<BR>100. &nbsp; (24) The same states that are presence 
        condition, because they assist by their non-disappearance, should be 
        understood as a <I>non-disappearance-condition.</I> Or this dyad is 
        stated as an embellishment of teaching to suit the needs of those who 
        are teachable, just as, [in the Matika of the Dhammasangani,] the 
        'dissociated-from-cause dyad' is given after the 'causeless

        size=+1>101. &nbsp; Now as regards these twenty-four conditions, 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those 
        of merit ignorance<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        ways<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for 
        the last kind only once.<BR>102. &nbsp; Herein, <I>for those of merit 
        ignorance is a condition in two ways:</I> it is a condition in two ways, 
        namely as object condition and as support condition. For ignorance is a 
        condition, as object condition, for formations of merit of the sense 
        sphere at the time of comprehending [by means of insight] ignorance as 
        liable to destruction and fall; and it is likewise for those of the 
        fine-material sphere at the time of knowing a confused mind by means of 
        direct-knowledge consciousness [through penetrating others' minds and so 
        on]. But it is a condition, as decisive support condition, in two cases, 
        that is to say, [for the sense-sphere formation] in one who, for the 
        purpose of surmounting ignorance, fulfils the various instances of 
        sense-sphere merit-making consisting in giving, etc., and [for the 
        fine-material-sphere formation] in one who arouses the fine-material 
        jhanas [for the same purpose]. Likewise in one who effects that merit 
        while aspiring to the delight of sense-sphere becoming and fine-material 
        becoming because he is confused by ignorance.<BR>103. &nbsp; <I>And for 
        the next in many ways:</I> it is a condition for formations of demerit 
        in many ways. How? As object condition at the time of the arising of 
        greed, etc., contingent upon ignorance; as object-predominance and 
        object-decisive-support respectively at the times of giving importance 
        [to ignorance] and enjoying [it]; as decisive-support in one who, being 
        confused by ignorance and unaware of danger, kills living things, etc.; 
        as proximity, contiguity, proximity-decisive-support, repetition, 
        absence, and disappearance, for the second impulsion and those that 
        follow; as root-cause, conascence, mutuality, support, association, 
        presence, and non-disappearance, in one doing anything unprofitable. It 
        is thus a condition in many ways.<BR>104. &nbsp; <I>But for the last 
        kind only once:</I> [542] it is reckoned as a condition in one way, 
        namely, as decisive-support condition only, for formations of the 
        imperturbable. But its relation as decisive-support condition should be 
        understood as stated under the formations of 
merit.<BR><BR></FONT></FONT>

        be asked: But how is this? Is ignorance the only condition for 
        formations, or are there other conditions? What is the position here? 
        For firstly, if it is the only one, there follows the assertion of a 
        single cause; <A href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B2.html#17fn" 
        name=17txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B2.html#17fn">{17}</A> but then if 
        there are others, the description of it as a single cause, namely, 'With 
        ignorance as condition there are formations' is incorrect. - It is not 
        incorrect. Why not? Here is the reason:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor from a single cause 
        arise<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One 
        fruit or many, nor one fruit from many;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tis helpful, though, to 
        utilize<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One 
        cause and fruit as representative.<BR>106. &nbsp; Here there is no 
        single or multiple fruit of any kind from a single cause, nor a single 
        fruit from multiple causes, but only multiple fruit from multiple 
        causes. So from multiple cause, in other words, from temperature, earth, 
        seed and moisture, is seen to arise a multiple fruit, in other words, 
        the shoot, which has visible form, odour, taste and so on. But one 
        representative cause and fruit given in this way 'With ignorance as 
        condition there are formations; with formations as condition,<BR>107. 
        consciousness' have a meaning and a use. For the Blessed One employs one 
        representative cause and fruit when it is suitable for the sake of 
        elegance in instruction and to suit the idiosyncrasies of those 
        susceptible of being taught. And he does so in some instances because it 
        is the most obvious, and in some instances because it is not common to 
        all.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; In the passage 'with contact as condition, 
        feeling' (M.i,261) he mentions a single cause and fruit because they are 
        basic factors. For contact is the basic cause of feeling since the kinds 
        of feeling are defined according to the kinds of contact [as 
        'eye-contact-born feeling' and so on], and feeling is contact's basic 
        fruit since contact is defined according to the kinds of feeling [that 
        it produces]. He mentions a single cause in the passage 'Disease due to 
        phlegm' (A.v.110) because that is the most obvious. For here what is 
        obvious is the phlegm, not the kamma, etc., [mentioned later in the same 
        sutta]. He mentioned a single cause in the passage 'Bhikkhus, any states 
        whatever that are unprofitable are all rooted in unwise attention' 
        (cf.S.v,91) because it is not common to all. For unwise attention to 
        unprofitable things is not common to all [states] in the way that, say, 
        physical basis and object are common to<BR>108. all. Consequently 
        although other causes of formations such as physical basis and object, 
        conascent states, etc., are actually existent, still ignorance may be 
        understood as the representative cause of formations [firstly] because 
        it is the basic factor as the cause of other causes of formations such 
        as craving, etc., as it is said 'Craving increases in one who dwells 
        seeing enjoyment' (S.ii,84) and 'With the arising of ignorance there is 
        the arising of cankers' (M.i,55), and again because it is the most 
        obvious, 'Not knowing, bhikkhus, in ignorance, he forms the formation of 
        merit' (cf.S.ii,82), and lastly because it is not common to all. [543] 
        So the use of one representative cause and fruit should in each instance 
        be understood according to this explanation of it. <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/18fn" name=18txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B2.html#18fn">{18}</A> <BR>109. 
        &nbsp; Here it may be asked: We admit that. But ignorance is 
        reprehensible and has entirely undesirable fruit. How then can it 
        rightly be a condition for formations of merit and of the imperturbable? 
        Sugarcane does not grow from [bitter] nimba seeds. - Why should it not 
        be right? For in the world [that is, even among thinkers outside the 
        dispensation it is recognized that]<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both as opposed and 
        unopposed<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
        state's conditions may be found,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And both as like and unlike 
        too:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That 
        does not make it their <I>result.</I><BR>110. &nbsp; It is established 
        in the world that when states have a condition, it may be opposed or 
        unopposed to them as to presence, individual essence, function, and so 
        on. For a preceding consciousness is a condition, opposed to presence, 
        for the succeeding consciousness; and the preceding training is a 
        condition likewise for the plying of crafts, etc., which take place 
        subsequently. Kamma is a condition, opposed as to individual essence, 
        for materiality; and so are milk, etc., for curds, and so on. Light is a 
        condition, opposed as to function, for eye consciousness; and so are 
        molasses, etc., for intoxicants, and so on. But eye-cum-visible-data, 
        etc., are respectively a condition, unopposed as to presence, for eye 
        consciousness, and so on. And the first impulsion, and those that 
        follow, are a condition, unopposed as to individual essence and 
        function, for the impulsions that follow them. And just as conditions 
        operate as opposed and unopposed, so also they operate as like and 
        unlike. Materiality - for example, temperature and nutriment - is a 
        condition for materiality: the like for the like. And so are paddy 
        seeds, etc., for paddy crops, and so on. The material is a condition for 
        the immaterial, and so is the immaterial for the material: the unlike 
        for the like. And so are ox hair and ram's hair, horns, curd, and 
        sesamum flour, etc., respectively for <I>dabba</I> grass, reeds, 
        <I>bhutinaka</I> grass, and so on. <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B2.html#19fn" name=19txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B2.html#19fn">{19}</A> And those 
        states for which these are the opposed and unopposed, like and unlike, 
        conditions are not the <BR>111. <I>results</I> of these states as well. 
        So although this ignorance has entirely undesirable fruit for its result 
        and is reprehensible in its individual essence, yet it should be 
        understood as a condition, opposed or unopposed and like or unlike as 
        the case may be, as to presence, function, and individual essence, for 
        all these formations of merit and so on. And its state as a condition 
        has already been given in the way beginning 'For when unknowing - in 
        other words, ignorance - of suffering, etc., is unabandoned in a man, 
        owing firstly to his unknowing about suffering and about the past, etc., 
        then he believes the suffering of the round of rebirths to be pleasant 
        and the embarks upon the three kinds of formations, which are the cause 
        of that very suffering' (&sect;62).<BR>112. &nbsp; Moreover there is this way 
        of explanation as well:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now when a man is ignorant<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of death and rebirth and the 
        round,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        characteristics of the formed<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dependently arisen states, 
        [544]<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in 
        his ignorance he forms<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Formations of this triple kind,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then ignorance itself will 
        be<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Condition 
        for each of the three.<BR>113. &nbsp; But how does a man who is confused 
        about these things perform these three kinds of formations? Firstly when 
        he is confused about death, instead of taking death thus, 'Death in 
        every case is break-up of aggregates, he figures that it is a [lasting] 
        being that dies, that it is a [lasting] being's transmi-<BR>114. gration 
        to another incarnation, and so on. When he is confused about 
        reappearance, instead of taking rebirth thus, 'Birth in every case is 
        manifestation of aggregates', he figures that it is a lasting being's 
        manifestion in a new body.<BR>115. &nbsp; When he is confused about the 
        round of rebirths, instead of taking the round of rebirths as pictured 
        thus,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        endless chain of aggregates,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of elements, of bases too,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That carries on 
        unbrokenly<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Is what is called 'the round of births',<BR>he figures that it is a 
        lasting being that goes from this world to another world, that comes 
        from another world to this world.<BR>116. When he is confused about the 
        characteristic of formations, instead of apprehending their specific and 
        general characteristics, he figures that formations are self, belong to 
        a self, are<BR>117. lasting, pleasant, beautiful. When he is confused 
        about dependently arisen states, instead of taking the occurrence of 
        formations to be due to ignorance, etc., he figures that it is a self 
        that knows or does not know, that acts and causes action, that appears 
        in rebirth-linking, and he figures that atoms, an Overlord, etc., shape 
        its body in the various states of the embryo and endow it with 
        faculties, and that when it has been endowed with faculties it touches, 
        feels, craves, clings, and endeavours, and that it becomes anew in the 
        next becoming; or he figures thus, 'All beings ... [are] moulded by 
        fate, coinci-<BR>118. dence and nature' (D.i,53). Thus he figures, 
        blinded by ignorance. He is like a blind man who wanders about the 
        earth, encountering now right and now wrong paths, now heights and now 
        hollows, now even and uneven ground, and so he forms formations now of 
        merit, now of demerit<BR>119. and now imperturbable. Hence this is 
        said:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As one 
        born blind, who gropes along<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without assistance from a 
        guide,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Chooses a road that may be right<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At one time, at another 
        wrong,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So 
        while the foolish man pursues<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The round of births without a 
        guide,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now 
        to do merit he may choose<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now demerit in such plight.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when the Law he comes to 
        know<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And 
        penetrates the Truths beside,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then ignorance is put to flight<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At last, and he in peace may 
        go.<BR>This is the detailed explanation of the clause 'With ignorance as 
        condition there are formations'. [545]<BR><BR></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

        a presence condition is that which is unhelpful by its absence of 
        existingness <I>(atthi-bhavabhava)</I> and becomes helpful by obtaining

        absence of existingness to those states that have nibbana as their 
        object, become helpful to them by obtaining existingness. Or 
        alternatively, the presence condition, which by its non-existingness is 
        the opposite of helpfulness to those states that are associated with 
        arising, etc., is helpful to them by its existingness. So nibbana is not 
        a presence condition' (Pm.597).<BR>It may be noted that <I>atthi</I> has 
        more than one use, among which the following two may be mentioned: (1) 
        <I>atthi</I> (is) = <I>upalabbhaniya</I> (is (a) 'apprehendable', and 
        (b) not a self-contradictory impossibility) - '<I>atthi bhikkhave, 
        ajatam</I> - There is an unborn' (Ud.80) and the discussion on the 
        existence of nibbana (Vis.Ch.XVI,&sect;67ff.). (2) <I>Atthi</I> (is) =

        <I>atthi-paccaya</I> (presence condition), being implicitly equated with
