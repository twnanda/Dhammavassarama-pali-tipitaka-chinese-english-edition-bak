        clause, <I>with formations as condition, consciousness,</I> 
        consciousness is sixfold as eye consciousness, and so on. Herein, eye 
        consciousness is twofold, namely, profitable [kamma-]resultant and 
        unprofitable [kamma-]resultant (see Table III for bracketed numbers that 
        follow). Likewise ear, nose, tongue, and body consciousness ((34)-(38) 
        and (50)-(54)). But mind consciousness is twenty-two-fold, namely, the 
        two profitable and unprofitable resultant mind elements ((39) and (55)), 
        the three root-cause-less mind-consciousness elements ((40), (41) and 
        (50)), the eight sense-sphere resultant consciousnesses with root-cause 
        ((42)-(49)), the five of the fine-material sphere ((57)-(61)), and the 
        four of the immaterial sphere ((62)-(65)). So all the thirty-two mundane 
        resultant cnsciousnesses ((34)-(65)) are included by these six kinds of 
        consciousness. But the supramundane kinds do not belong to the 
        exposition of the round [of becoming], and so they are not 
        included.<BR>121. &nbsp; Here it may be asked: But how is it to be known 
        that this consciousness of the kind stated actually has formations as 
        its condition? - Because there is no kamma-result when there is no 
        stored-up kamma. For this consciousness is kamma-result, and 
        kamma-result does not arise in the absence of stored-up kamma. If it 
        did, then all kinds of kamma-resultant consciousness would arise in all 
        kinds of beings, and they do not do so. This is how it should be known 
        that such consciousness has formations as its condition.<BR>122. &nbsp; 
        But which kind of consciousness has which kind of formations as its 
        condition?<BR>&nbsp; Firstly, the following sixteen kinds arise with the 
        sense-sphere formation of merits as condition: the five profitable 
        resultant beginning with eye consciousness ((34)-(38)), and in the case 
        of mind consciousness one kind of mind element (39) and two kinds of 
        mind-consciousness element ((40)-(41)), and the eight kinds of 
        sense-sphere resultant ((42)-(49)), according as it is said 'Owing to 
        profitable kamma of the sense sphere having been performed, stored up, 
        resultant eye consciousness' (Dhs.431), 'ear, nose, tongue, body 
        consciousness' (Dhs.443), 'resultant mind element, arises' (Dhs.455), 
        'mind-consciousness element accompanied by joy, arises' (Dhs.469), 
        'mind-consciousness element accompanied by equanimity, arises' 
        (Dhs.484), 'accompanied by joy and associated with knowledge ... 
        accompanied by joy; associated with knowledge and prompted ... 
        accompanied by joy and disassociated from knowledge ... accompanied by 
        joy, dissociated from knowledge and prompted ... accompanied by 
        equanimity and associated with knowledge ... accompanied by equanimity, 
        associated with knowledge and prompted ... accompanied by equanimity and 
        dissociated from knowledge ... accompanied by equanimity dissociated 
        from knowledge and prompted' (Dhs.498).<BR>123. &nbsp; There are five 
        kinds of resultant fine-material-sphere consciousness ((57)-(61)) with 
        the fine-material-sphere formation of merit as condition, according as 
        it is said: 'Owing to that same profitable kamma of the fine-material 
        sphere having been performed, stored up, [by the development of that 
        same profitable jhana,] [546] secluded from sense-desires ... he enters 
        upon and dwells in the resultant first jhana ... fifth jhana' 
        (Dhs.499).<BR>124. &nbsp; There are seven kinds of consciousness with 
        the formation of demerit as condition: the five unprofitable resultant 
        beginning with eye consciousness ((50)-(54)), one mind element (55) and 
        one mind-consciousness element (56), according as it is said: 'Because 
        of unprofitable kamma having been performed and stored up, resultant eye 
        consciousness, has arisen ... ear ... nose ... tongue ... body 
        consciousness has arisen' (Dhs.556), 'resultant mind element' (Dhs.562), 
        'resultant mind-consciousness element has arisen' (Dhs.564).<BR>125. 
        &nbsp; There are four kinds of immaterial resultant consciousness 
        ((62)-(65)) with the formation of the imperturbable as condition 
        according as it is said: 'Owing to that same profitable kamma of the 
        immaterial sphere having been perfomed, stored up [by the development of 
        that same profitable immaterial jhana, with the abandoning of bodily 
        pleasure and pain ... he enters upon and dwells in the resultant fourth 
        jhana, which,] with the complete surmounting of perceptions of material 
        form ... is accompanied by the base consisting of boundless space' 
        (Dhs.501), 'accompanied by the base consisting of boundless 
        consciousness' (Dhs.502), 'accompanied by the base consisting of 
        nothingness' (Dhs.503), 'accompanined by the base consisting of neither 
        perception nor non-perception' (Dhs.504).<BR>126. &nbsp; After knowing 
        what kind of consciousness has what formations as its condition, one 
        should now understand how it occurs as follows.<BR><BR></FONT>

        size=+1>&nbsp; Now this resultant consciousness all occurs in two ways, 
        namely, (a) in the course of an individual existence (or continuity), 
        and (b) at the rebirth-linking [moment].<BR>&nbsp; Herein there are the 
        two fivefold consciousness ((34)-(38)) and ((50)-(54)), two mind 
        elements (39) and (55), and root-cause-less mind-consciousness element 
        accompanied by joy (40), that is, thirteen, which occur only in the

        size=+1><FONT size=+1>127. &nbsp; Firstly in one who has been reborn by 
        means of either profitable-result or unprofitable-result: according as 
        his faculties mature, so the five profitable-resultant eye, etc., 
        consciousnesses occur accomplishing the respective functions of 
        <I>seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, </I>and <I>touching</I> 
        ((d)-(h)), contingent respectively upon a desirable or desirable-neutral 
        visible datum, etc., as object that has come into the focus of the eye, 
        etc., and having the sensitivity of the eye, etc., as [material] 
        support. And likewise the five unprofitable-resultant consciousnesses; 
        the only difference being this, that the visible data, etc., as object 
        for these are undesirable or undesirable-neutral. And these ten are 
        invariable as to their door, object, physical basis, and position [in 
        the congnitive series], and invariable as to their functions.<BR>128. 
        &nbsp; After that, next to the profitable-resultant mind element (39) 
        occurs accomplishing the function of <I>receiving</I> (i), contingent 
        upon the same object as that of the former, and having the heart-basis 
        as support. [547] And next after the unprofitable-resultant eye, etc., 
        concsiousness, the unprofitable-resultant mind element (55) occurs 
        likewise. But these two, while variable as to door and object, are 
        invariable as to physical basis and position, and invariable as to 
        function.<BR>129. &nbsp; Then next to the profitable-resultant mind 
        element, the root-cause-less mind-consciousness element accompanied by 
        joy (40) occurs accomplishing the function of <I>investigation</I> (j), 
        contingent upon the same object as that of the mind element, and having 
        the heart-basis as support. And when the object is a vivid one in any of 
        the six doors belonging to sense sphere beings, usually at the end of 
        impulsions associated with greed it holds up the [renewal of the] course 
        of the life-continuum (b) by occurring either once or twice as 
        <I>registration</I> (m), having the same object as that apprehended by 
        the impulsions - so it is said in the Majjhima Commentary.<A name=21txt 
        ref="#21fn"></A> <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B3.html#21fn">{21}</A> But in the 
        Abhidhamma Commentary two turns of consciousness have been handed down 
        with respect to <I>registration.</I> This consciousness has two names, 
        'registration' <I>(tad-arammana</I> - lit., <I>having that object</I> 
        that the preceding impulsions had) and 'aftermath life-continuum' 
        <I>(pitthi-bhavanga</I> - see Ch.XIV,&sect;122). It is variable as to door 
        and object, it is variable as to physical basis and it is variable as to 
        position and function.<BR>&nbsp; This in the first place, it should be 
        understood, is how thirteen kinds of consciousness occur only in the 
        course of an individual existence in the five-constituent kind of 
        becoming.<BR>130. &nbsp; As to the remaining nineteen ((41)-(49) and 
        (56)-(65)), there is none that does not occur as a rebirth-linking (a) 
        appropriate to it (see &sect;133). But in the course of an individual 
        existence, firstly two, namely, profitable-resultant and 
        uprofitable-resultant root-cause-less mind-consciousness element ((41) 
        and (56)) occur accomplishing four functions, that is to say, the 
        function of <I>investigating</I> in the five doors (j) next after 
        profitable-resultant and unprofitable-resultant mind element, the 
        function of <I>registration</I> (m) in the six doors in the way already 
        stated, the function of <I>life-continuum</I> (b) that continues after 
        rebirth-linking given by themselves, as long as there is no 
        thought-arising to interrupt the life-continuum, and lastly, the 
        function of <I>death</I> (n) at the end [of the course of an existence]. 
        And so these two are invariable as to [possession of heart-]basis, and 
        variable as to door, object, position and function.<BR>131. &nbsp; The 
        eight sense-sphere consciousnesses with root-cause ((42)-(49)) occur 
        accomplishing three functions, namely, the function of 
        <I>registration</I> (m) in the six doors in the way already stated, the 
        function of <I>life-continuum</I> (b) after rebirth-linking given by 
        themselves, as long as there is no thought arising to interrupt the 
        life-continuum, and lastly the function of <I>death</I> (n) at the end. 
        And they are invariable as to [possession of heart-]basis, and variable 
        as to door, object, position, and function.<BR>132. &nbsp; The five 
        fine-material consciousnesses ((57)-(61)) and the four immaterial 
        consciousnesses ((62)-(65)) occur accomplishing two functions, namely, 
        the function of <I>life-continuum</I> (b) that continues after 
        rebirth-linking given by themselves, as long as there is no 
        thought-arising to interrupt the life-continuum, and the function of 
        <I>death</I> (n) at the end. As regards these, those of the 
        fine-material sphere are invariable as to [possession of heart-]basis 
        and as to their object, and they are variable as to position and 
        function, while the others occur invariably without [heart-]basis, and 
        they are invariable as to object, and variable as to position and 
        function.<BR>&nbsp; This, in the first place, is how the thirty-two-fold 
        resultant consciousness occurs in the course of an individual existence 
        with formations as condition.<BR>&nbsp; And there [in the course of an 
        existence] these several formations are conditions, as kamma condition 
        and decisive-support condition, for this [thirty-two-fold resultant 
        consciousness. [548]<BR><BR></FONT></FONT></FONT>

        But what was said above, namely, 'as to the remaining nineteen, there is 
        none that does not occur as a rebirth-linking appropriate to it' (&sect;130), 
        is hard to understand since it is too brief. Hence, in order to show the 
        details it may be asked: (i) How many kinds of rebirth-linking are 
        there? (ii) How many kinds of rebirth-linking consciousness? (iii) Where 
        and by what means does rebirth-linking come about? (iv) What does 
        rebirth-linking consciousness] have as its object?<BR>134. &nbsp; (i) 
        Including the rebirth-linking of non-percipient beings there are twenty 
        kinds of rebirth-linking.<BR>&nbsp; (ii) There are nineteen kinds of 
        rebirth-linking consciousness as already described.<BR>&nbsp; (iii) 
        Herein, rebirth-linking by means of the unprofitable-resultant 
        root-cause-less mind-consciousness element (56) comes about in the 
        states of loss. Rebirth-linking by means of the profitable-resultant 
        (41) comes about in the human world among those blind from birth, born 
        deaf, born mad, born drivelling (see M.i.20; MA.i,118), the sexless, and 
        so on. Rebirth-linking by means of the eight principal-resultant 
        consciousness with root-cause ((42)-(49)) comes about among deities of 
        the sense sphere and the meritorious among men. That by means of the 
        five fine-material resultant kinds comes about in the fine-material 
        Brahma World. That by means of the four immaterial-sphere resultant 
        kinds comes about in the immaterial world. So rebirth-linking 
        [consciousness], conforms to the means by which, and the place in which, 
        it comes about.<BR>&nbsp; (iv) Briefly rebirth-linking [consciousness] 
        has three kinds of objects, namely, 'past', 'present', and 
        'not-so-classifiable' (see Ch.III,n.32). Non-percipient rebirth-linking 
        has no object.<BR>135. &nbsp; Herein in the base consisting of boundless 
        consciousness and the base consisting of neither perception nor 
        non-perception the object of rebirth-linking is <I>past</I>. That of the 
        ten kinds of sense-sphere rebirth-linking is <I>past</I> or 
        <I>present</I> . That of the rest is <I>not-so-classifiable.</I> But 
        while the rebirth-linking consciousness occurs thus with three kinds of 
        objects, the death consciousness, next to which it occurs, has only a 
        'past' or a 'not-so-classifiable' object, there being no death 
        consciousness with a 'present' object. Consequently it should be 
        understood how it occurs in the happy destinies and the unhappy 
        destinies as follows, that is to say, how rebirth-linking consciousness 
        with one of three kinds of objects occurs next to death consciousness 
        with one of two kinds of objects.<BR>136. &nbsp; <I>[From happy to 
        unhappy destiny.]</I> For example, firstly in the case of a person in 
        the happy destinies of the sense-sphere who is an evil-doer, when he is 
        lying on his death-bed, his evil kamma according as it has been stored 
        up, or its sign, comes into focus in the mind door. For it is said, 
        'Then [the evil deeds that he did in the past] ... cover him [and 
        overspread him and envelop him]' (M.iii,164), and so on. Then next to a 
        cognitive series of impulsions ending in registration <A name=22txt 
        ref="#22fn"></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B3.html#22fn">{22}</A> that arose 
        contingent upon that [kamma or its sign], death consciousness arises 
        making the life-continuum's objective field its object. When it has 
        ceased, rebirth-linking consciousness arises contingent upon that same 
        kamma or kamma sign that had come into focus, and it does so located in 
        the unhappy destiny, being driven there by the force of defilements that 
        have not been cut off. [549] This is the kind of rebirth-linking that 
        has a <I>past</I> object and comes next to death consciousness with a 
        <I>past</I> object.<BR>137. &nbsp; In another's case, owing to kamma of 
        the kind already described, there comes into focus at the mind door at 
        the time of death the sign of the unhappy destinies with the appearance 
        of fire and flames, etc., in the hells, and so on.<A name=23txt 
        ref="#23fn"></A> <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B3.html#23fn">{23}</A> So when the 
        life-continuum has twice arisen and ceased, three sorts of 
        cognitive-series consciousness arise contingent upon that object, 
        namely, the one adverting, impulsion numbering five because of the 
        slowing down due to the nearness of death, and two registration. After 
        that, one death consciousness arises making the life-continuum's 
        objective fields its object. At this point eleven consciousnesses have 
        elapsed. Then, having that same object, which has a life span of the 
        remaining five conscious moments, his rebirth-linking consciousness 
        arises. This is the kind of rebirth-linking that has a <I>present</I> 
        object and comes next to a death with a <I>past </I>object.<BR>138. 
        &nbsp; In another's case at the time of death there comes into focus in 
        one of the five doors an inferior object that is a cause of greed, and 
        so on. When a series of consciousnesses up to determining have arisen in 
        due succession, there arise impulsion numbering five because of slowing 
        down due to the nearness of death, and two registration. After that, one 
        death consciousness making the life-continuum's objective field its 
        object. At this point fifteen consciousnesses have elapsed, namely, two 
        life-continuum, one each adverting, seeing, receiving, investigating and 
        determining, five impulsion, two registration, and one death 
        consciousness. Then having that same object, which has a life span of 
        the remaining one conscious moment, his rebirth-linking consciousness 
        arises. This also is the kind of rebirth-linking that has a 
        <I>present</I> object and comes next to a death consciousness with a 
        <I>past</I> object.<BR>&nbsp; This, firstly, is how rebirth-linking in 
        an unhappy destiny with past and present objects occurs next to death 
        consciousness in a happy destiny with a past object.<BR>139. &nbsp; 
        <I>[From unhappy to happy destiny.]</I> In the case of one in an unhappy 
        destiny who has stored up blameless kamma all should be understood in 
        the same way, substituting the bright for the dark side thus: His good 
        kamma, [according as it has been stored up], or its sign, comes into 
        focus in the mind door [and continuing] in the way already 
        stated.<BR>&nbsp; This is how rebirth-linking occurs in a happy destiny 
        with past and present objects next to death consciousness in an unhappy 
        destiny with a past object.<BR>140. &nbsp; <I>[From happy to happy 
        destiny.]</I> In the case of one in a happy destiny who has stored up 
        blameless kamma, when he is lying on his death-bed, his blameless kamma 
        according as it has been stored up, or its sign, comes into focus in the 
        mind door. For it is said, 'Then [the good deeds he did in the past] ... 
        cover him [and overspread him and envelop him]' (M.iii,171), and so on. 
        And that applies only in the case of one who has stored up blameless 
        sense-sphere kamma. [550] But in the case of one who has stored up kamma 
        of the exalted spheres only the sign of the kamma comes into focus. Then 
        next to the cognitive series of impulsions ending in registration, or of 
        simple impulsions, that arose contingent upon that [kamma or its sign], 
        death consciousness arises making the life-continuums's objective field 
        its object. When it has ceased, rebirth-linking consciousness arises 
        contingent upon that same kamma or sign of kamma that had come into 
        focus, and it does so located in the happy destiny, being driven there 
        by the force of defilements that have not been cut off. This is the kind 
        of rebirth-linking that has a <I>past</I> or a 
        <I>not-so-classifiable</I> object and comes next to death concsiousness 
        with a <I>past</I> object.<BR>141. &nbsp; In another's case, owing to 
        blameless sense-sphere kamma, there comes into focus in the mind door at 
        the time of death the sign of happy destiny, in other words, the 
        appearance of the mother's womb <A name=24txt ref="#24fn"></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B3.html#24fn">{24}</A> in the case 
        of the human world or the appearance of pleasure-groves, divine palaces, 
        wishing-trees, etc., in the case of the divine world. His 
        rebirth-linking consciousness arises next to the death consciousness in 
        the order shown for the sign of an unhappy destiny. This is the kind of 
        rebirth-linking that has a <I>present</I> object and comes next to death 
        consciousness with a <I>past</I> object.<BR>142. &nbsp; In another's 
        case, relatives present [objects to him] at the five sense doors, such 
        as a visible datum object, perhaps flowers, garlands, flags, banners, 
        etc., saying 'This is being offered to the Blessed One for your sake, 
        dear, set your mind at rest'; or a sound as object, perhaps, preaching 
        of the Dhamma, offerings of music, etc.; or a taste as obect perhaps 
        honey, molasses, etc., saying 'Taste this, dear, it is a gift to be 
        given for your sake'; or a tangible datum as object, perhaps Chinese 
        silk, silk of Somara, saying 'Touch this, dear, it is a gift to be given 
        for your sake'. Now when that visible datum, or whatever it may be, as 
        object has come into focus for him and the consciousnesses ending in 
        determining have arisen in due succession, there arise in him impulsion 
        numbering five because of slowing down due to the nearness of death, and 
        two registration; after that, one death consciousness, making the 
        life-continuum's objective field its object. At the end of that, having 
        that same object, which lasts only a single conscious moment, 
        rebirth-linking consciousness arises. This also is the kind of 
        rebirth-linking with a <I>present</I> object and comes next to a death 
        consciousness with a <I>past</I> object.<BR>143. &nbsp; But in the case 
        of another who is in a happy destiny and has obtained exalted 
        [consciousness] through earth-kasina jhana, etc., at the time of his 
        death there comes into focus at the mind door the sense-sphere 
        profitable kamma or the sign of the kamma or the sign of the destiny, or 
        else the sign of the earth kasina, etc., or else the exalted 
        consciousness, [551] or else there comes into focus a superior object of 
        the eye or ear that is a cause for profitable rebirth. When the 
        consciousnesses ending in determining have arisen in due succession, 
        there arise in him impulsion numbering five because of slowing down due 
        to the nearness of death. But in those who belong to an exalted destiny 
        there is no registration. So the one death consciousness arises next to 
        the impulsion and making the life-continuum's objective field its 
        object. At the end of that, rebirth-linking consciousness arises located 
        in one of the happy destinies of the sense sphere or exalted sphere, and 
        having as its object whichever one among the aforesaid objects has 
        appeared. This is the kind of rebirth-linking with a <I>past, 
        present,</I> or <I>not-so-classifiable</I> object next to death 
        consciousness in a happy destiny with a <I>not-so-classifiable</I> 
        object.<BR>144. &nbsp; Rebirth-linking next to immaterial-sphere death 
        should be understood in this way too.<BR>&nbsp; This is how 
        rebirth-linking occurs with a past, present, or not-so-classifiable, 
        object next to death consciousness in a happy destiny with a past, or 
        not-so-classifiable object.<BR>145. <I>[From unhappy to unhappy 
        destiny.]</I> In the case of one in an unhappy destiny who is an 
        evil-doer, that kamma, or its sign, or the sign of the destiny, comes 
        into focus in the mind door, or in the five doors, as the object that is 
        the cause for the unprofitable rebirth. Then his rebirth-linking 
        consciousness arises in due succession at the end of the death 
        consciousness and located in the unhappy destiny and with one of those 
        objects as its object.<BR>&nbsp; This is how rebirth-linking occurs with 
        a past or present object next to death in an unhappy destiny with a past 
        object.<BR><BR></FONT>

        Kamma is a Condition]<BR><BR></FONT></DIV><FONT size=+1>&nbsp; Up to 
        this point there has been shown the occurrence of the <BR>146. nineteen 
        consciousnesses as rebirth-linking. Also all this [is further 
        classified; for]<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While it occurs in linking 
        thus,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has 
        a double class beside<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though kamma, and as mixed and 
        not,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And is 
        still further classified.<BR>147. &nbsp; When this nineteenfold 
        kamma-resultant consciousness occurs thus in rebirth-linking, it does so 
        by means of kamma in two ways; for according to the way in which the 
        kamma that generates it occurs, the kamma can be its condition both as 
        kamma condition acting from a different time and as decisive-support 
        condition, since this is said: 'Profitable ... [and] unprofitable kamma 
        is a condition, as decisive-support condition, for [its] result' 
        (Ptn1,167 and 169).<BR>148. &nbsp; It should be undersood that when it 
        occurs thus, its <I>double class,</I> etc., is <I>mixed and not,</I> and 
        it is <I>still further classified.</I><BR>&nbsp; For example: though 
        this [type of consciousness] occurs in one way only as rebirth-linking, 
        still it is twofold as divided into mixed and unmixed with materiality; 
        [552] it is threefold as divided according to sense-desire, 
        fine-material, and immaterial, becoming (M.i,50); it is fourfold as 
        egg-born, womb-born, putrescence-(moisture-)born, and of apparitional 
        generation (M.i,73); it is fivefold according to destiny (M.i,73); it is 
        sevenfold according to the stations of consciousness (D.iii,253), and it 
        is eightfold according to the abodes of beings [excluding non-percipient 
        beings] (see D.iii,263).<BR>&nbsp; Herein,<BR>149.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;The mixed is double, sexed and not,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that with sex is double 
        too;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        least decads the first has got<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Respectively are three and two.<BR>150. &nbsp; <I>The 
        mixed is double, sexed and not:</I> that rebirth-linking consciousness, 
        which, leaving aside the immaterial becoming, arises here mixed with 
        materiality, is twofold as 'with sex' and 'without sex', <A name=25txt 
        ref="#25fn"></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B3.html#25fn">{25}</A> because it 
        arises in the fine-material sphere without the sex called femininity 
        faculty and masculinity faculty, and because - leaving aside the 
        rebirth-linking of one born as a eunuch - it arises in the sense-sphere 
        becoming together with that [twofold] sex.<BR>&nbsp; <I>And that with 
        sex is double too:</I> there also that with sex is twofold because it 
        arises in association with either the female or the male sex.<BR>151. 
        <I>The least decads the first has got, respectively are three or two</I> 
        together with the rebirth-linking consciousness that is mixed with 
        materiality and comes first in the pair 'mixed and unmixed', there 
        arise, at the least, the two decads (see Ch.XVIII&sect;5f.) of physical basis 
        and body, or else the three decads of physical basis, body, and sex. 
        There is no reducing <BR>152. the materiality below that. But when that 
        minimal amount arises in the two kinds of generation termed egg-born and 
        womb-born, it amounts to no more than a drop of cream of ghee on a 
        single fibre of new-born [kid's] wool, and it is known as the 'embryo in 
        the first stage' (S.i,206).<BR>153. &nbsp; Herein, how the different 
        kinds of generation come about may be understood according to the kind 
        of destiny. For as regards these,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No first three generations 
        are<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In hell, 
        or with the deities,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Save those of earth; all four are 
        found<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 
        three other destinies.<BR>154. &nbsp; Herein, by the words <I>with 
        deities</I> it should be understood that, as in hell and among deities - 
        excepting earth dieties -, so also among the ghosts consumed with 
        thirst, the first three kinds of generation are not found; for they are 
        apparitional only. But in the remaining three kinds of destiny, in other 
        words, among animals, ghosts and human beings, and among the earth 
        dieties excepted above, there are all four kinds of generation. 
        Now<BR>155. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fine-material gods have 
        thirty-nine;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The apparitional and moisture-born<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have seventy material 
        instances<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 
        most, and they have thirty at the least.<BR>156. &nbsp; Firstly, among 
        the fine-material Brahmas of apparitional generation there arise 
        together with rebirth-linking consciousness thirty and also nine 
        material instances [553] with the four groups, namely, the decads of the 
        eye, ear, and physical basis, and the ennead of life. But leaving the 
        fine-material Brahmas aside, among the others of apparitional generation 
        and those of the moisture-born generation there are seventy instances of 
        materiality at the most with the decads of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, 
        body, physical basis and sex. And these are invariably to be found among 
        dieties [of the sense sphere]. Now the group of material states 
        comprising the ten material instances, namely, colour, odour, flavour, 
        nutritive-essence, and the four primary elements, with eye-sensitivity 
        and life, and called the 'eye-decad'. The remaining [groups of 
        material<BR>157. states] should be understood in the same way. At the 
        least, thirty material instances arise with the decads of the tongue, 
        body, and physical basis, in those who are blind from birth, deaf, 
        noseless, <A name=26txt ref="#26fn"></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B3.html#26fn">{26}</A> and 
        sexless. Between the most and the least, the allotment should be 
        understood according as appropriate.<BR>158. &nbsp; After knowing this, 
        again,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One 
        ought to consider the [pair] death and birth<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under aggregates, object, cause, 
        destiny, feeling,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Happiness, and then thinking applied and 
        sustained,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Distinguishing them by unlikeness and likeness.<BR>159. &nbsp; The 
        meaning is this: there is rebirth-linking that is twofold as mixed and 
        unmixed [with materiality], and there is the death consciousness next 
        before it, and their unlikeness and likeness according to these 
        aggregates, etc., must be known. How? <BR>160. &nbsp; Sometimes, next to 
        a four-aggregate immaterial death there is a four-aggregate 
        rebirth-linking having a like object; sometimes there is an exalted 
        rebirth-linking with an internal object next to an unexalted death with 
        an external object. This, firstly, is the method in the case of the 
        immaterial planes.<BR>&nbsp; Sometimes there is a five-aggregate 
        sense-sphere rebirth-linking next to a four-aggregate immaterial death. 
        Sometimes there is a four-aggregate immaterial rebirth-linking next to a 
        five-aggregate sense-sphere death or a fine-material-sphere 
        death.<BR>&nbsp; Thus there is a rebirth-linking with a <I>present</I> 
        object <A name=27txt ref="#27fn"></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B3.html#27fn">{27}</A> next to a 
        death with a <I>past</I> object, there is a rebirth-linking in a certain 
        unhappy destiny next to death in a certain happy destiny, there is 
        rebirth-linking with root-cause next to root-cause-less death, there is 
        triple-root-cause rebirth-linking next to double-root-cause death, there 
        is rebirth-linking accompanied by joy next to death accompanied by 
        equanimity, there is rebirth-linking with happiness next to death 
        without happiness, there is rebirth-linking with applied thought next to 
        death without applied thought, there is rebirth-linking with sustained 
        thought next to death without sustained thought, there is 
        rebirth-linking with applied and sustained thought next to death without 
        applied and sustained thought.<BR>&nbsp; In this way they can be coupled 
        together by opposites as appropriate.<BR>161. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A 
        mere state that has got its conditions<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ushers in the ensuing 
        existence;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        While it does not migrate from the past,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With no cause in the past it is 
        not.<BR>162. &nbsp; So it is a mere material and immaterial state, 
        arising when it has obtained its conditions, that is spoken of, saying 
        that it comes into the next becoming; it is not a lasting being, [554] 
        not a soul. And it has neither transmigrated from the past becoming nor 
        yet is it manifested here without cause from that.<BR>163. &nbsp; We 
        shall explain this by the normal process of human death and 
        rebirth-linking. When in the past becoming a man near to a natural or 
        violent death is unable to bear the onset of the unbearable daggers of 
        the [painful] feelings that end in death as they sever the ligatures of 
        the joints in all the limbs, his body gradually withers like a green 
        palm leaf lying in the glare of the sun, and when the faculties of the 
        eye, etc., have ceased and the body faculty, mind faculty, and life 
        faculty remain on in the heart-basis alone, then consciousness, which 
        has as its support the heart-basis alone still remaining at that moment, 
        either occurs contingent upon some kamma classed as 'weighty', 
        'repeated', performed 'near' [to death] or previously <A name=28txt 
        ref="#28fn"></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B3.html#28fn">{28}</A> in other 
        words, the formation that has obtained the remaining conditions, or 
        contingent upon the objective field made to appear by the kamma, in 
        other words, the sign of the kamma or sign of the destiny. <A name=29txt 
        ref="#29fn"></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B3.html#29fn">{29}</A> And while 
        it is occurring thus, because craving and ignorance have not been 
        abandoned, craving pushes it and the conascent formations fling it 
        forward <A name=30txt ref="#30fn"></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B3.html#30fn">{30}</A> on that 
        objective field, the dangers in which are concealed by ignorance. And 
        while, as a continuous process, <A name=31txt ref="#31fn"></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B3.html#31fn">{31}</A> it is being 
        pushed by craving and flung forward by formations, it abandons its 
        former support, like a man who crosses a river by hanging on to a rope 
        tied to a tree on the near bank, and, whether or not it gets a further 
        support originated by kamma, it occurs by means of the conditions 
        consisting only in object condition, and so on.<BR>164. &nbsp; The 
        former of these [two states of consciousness] is called 'death 
        <I>(cuti)'</I> because of falling <I>(cavana),</I> and the latter is 
        called 'rebirth-linking <I>(pati-sandhi)'</I> because of linking 
        <I>(patisandhana)</I> across the gap separating the beginning of the 
        next becoming. But it should be understood that it has neither come here 
        from the previous becoming nor has it become manifest without the kamma, 
        the formations, the pushing, the objective field, etc., as 
        cause.<BR>165.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; An echo, or its like, 
        supplies<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        figures here; connectedness<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By continuity denies<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identity and otherness.<BR>166. 
        &nbsp; And here let the illustration of this consciousness be such 
        things as an echo, a light, a seal impression, a looking-glass image, 
        for the fact of its not coming here from the previous becoming and for 
        the fact that it arises owing to causes that are included in past 
        becomings. For just as an echo, a light, a seal impression, and a 
        shadow, have respectively sound, etc., as their cause and come into 
        being without going elsewhere, so also this consciousness.<BR>167. 
        &nbsp; And with a stream of continuity there is neither identity nor 
        otherness. For if there were absolute identity in a stream of 
        continuity, there would be no forming of curd from milk. And yet if 
        there were absolute otherness, the curd would not be derived from the 
        milk. And so too with all casually arisen things. And if that were so 
        there would be an end to all wordly usage, which is hardly desirable. So 
        neither absolute identity nor absolute otherness should be assumed here. 
        [555]<BR>168. &nbsp; Here it might be asked: If no transmigration is 
        manifested, then after the cessation of the aggregates in this human 
        person, that fruit could be another person's or due to other [kamma], 
        since the kamma that is the condition for the fruit does not pass on 
        there [to where the fruit is]? And whose is the fruit since there is no 
        experiencer? Therefore this formulation seems to be 
        unsatisfactory.<BR>169. &nbsp; Here is the reply:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In continuity the 
        fruit<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is 
        neither of nor from another,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeds' forming processes will 
        suit<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To show 
        the purport of this matter.<BR>170. &nbsp; When a fruit arises in a 
        single continuity, it is neither another's nor from other [kamma] 
        because absolute identity and absolute otherness are excluded <A 
        name=32txt ref="#32fn"></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B3.html#32fn">{32}</A> there. The 
        formative processes of seeds establish the meaning of this. For once the 
        formative processes of a mango seed, etc., have been set afoot, when the 
        particular fruit arises in the continuity of the seed's [growth], later 
        on owing to the obtaining of conditions, it does so neither as fruit of 
        other seeds nor from other formative processes as condition; and those 
        seeds or formative processes do not themselves pass on to the place 
        where the fruit is. This is the analogy here. And the meaning can also 
        be understood from the fact that the arts, crafts, medicine, etc., 
        learnt in youth give their fruit later on in matu-<BR>171. rity. Now it 
        was also asked, 'Whose is the fruit, since there is no experiencer?' 
        Herein, <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        'Experiencer' is a convention<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For mere arising of the fruit;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They say 'It fruits' as a 
        convention,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        When on a tree appears its fruit.<BR>172. &nbsp; Just as it is simply 
        owing to the arising of tree fruits, which are one part of the phenomena 
        called a tree, that it is said 'The tree fruits' or 'the tree has 
        fruited', so it is simply owing to the arising of the fruit consisting 
        of the pleasure and pain called experience, which is one part of the 
        aggregates called 'deities' and 'human beings', that it is said 'a deity 
        or a human being experiences or feels pleasure or pain'. There is 
        therefore no need at all here for a superfluous experiencer.<BR>173. 
        &nbsp; But it may be said: That may be so; but then these formations 
        must be the conditions for the fruit either when they are present or 
        when they are not present, and if it is when they are present, their 
        result must come about only at the moment of their occurrence; but if it 
        is when they are not present, they must bear fruit constantly both 
        before and after their occurrance. It can be 
        replied:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        They are conditions when performed;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They bear fruit once, but not 
        again;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        Agent and such similes<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will serve to make the meaning plain.<BR>174. &nbsp; 
        Formations are conditions for their own fruit because they have been 
        performed, not because of presence or non-presence, acording as it is 
        said [556] 'Due to profitable kamma of the sense sphere having been 
        performed, stored up [in the past], resultant eye consciousness arises 
        [in the present]' (Dhs.43), and so on. Having become conditions for 
        their own fruit according to their capacity, they do not again bear 
        fruit since the result has already ripened. And in explaining the 
        meaning of this the analogy of the agent, etc., should be understood. 
        For just as in the world when someone becomes an agent with the aim of 
        completing some business or other, and he buys goods, say, or obtains a 
        loan, it is simply the fact of his performing the transaction that is 
        the condition for completing that business, not the transaction's actual 
        presence or non-presence; and after the completion of the business he 
        has no further liability. Why not? Because the business has been 
        completed. So it is because they have been performed that formations are 
        conditions for their own fruit, and they do not bear fruit after they 
        have already given fruit according to their capacity.<BR>&nbsp; Up to 
        this point the occurence, with formations as condition, of 
        rebirth-linking consciousness that occurs in the two ways as mixed and 
        unmixed [with materiality] has been illustrated.<BR><BR></FONT>

        order to eliminate confusion about all these thirty-two kinds of 
        resultant consciousness,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One should of these formations 
        see<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 
        which and how they are conditions<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In birth and life in all the 
        three<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kinds 
        of becoming and the rest.<BR>176. &nbsp; Herein, the three kinds of 
        becoming, the four kinds of generation, the five kinds of destiny, the 
        seven stations of consciousness, and the nine abodes of beings are what 
        are called 'The kinds of becoming and the rest'. The meaning is that it 
        should be recognized for what kinds of resultant consciousnesses these 
        [formations] are conditions in rebirth-linking and in the course of an 
        individual existence, and in what way they are conditions, in the 
        various kinds of becoming and so on.<BR>177. &nbsp; Herein, firstly as 
        regards the <I>formation of merit:</I> the formation of merit comprising 
        the eight volitions of the sense sphere ((1)-(8)) is a condition in two 
        ways, as kamma condition acting from a different time and as 
        decisive-support condition, equally for all the nine kinds of resultant 
        consciousnesses ((41)-(49)) in rebirth-linking in a happy destiny in the 
        sense-sphere becoming. That formation comprising the five profitable 
        volitions of the fine-material sphere ((9)-(13)) [is a condition] in 
        like manner for the five kinds of rebirth-linking in the fine-material 
        becoming ((57)-(61)).<BR>178. &nbsp; That of the sense sphere divided up 
        as aforesaid is a condition in two ways, as aforesaid, for seven kinds 
        of limited[-sphere] resultant consciousnessess ((34)-(40)) - excluding 
        the root-cause-less mind-consciousness element accompanied by equanimity 
        (41) - in the course of an existence, but not in rebirth-linking, in the 
        happy destinies in the sense-sphere becoming. And that same formation is 
        a condition, likewise for five kinds of resultant consciousness ((34), 
        (35), (39)-(41)) in the course of an existence, not in rebirth-linking, 
        in the fine-material becoming. It is a condition likewise for eight 
        kinds of limited[-sphere] resultant consciousness ((34)-(41)) in the 
        course of existence, not in rebirth-linking, in the unhappy destinies in 
        the sense-sphere becoming. [557] For then it is a condition [for such 
        profitable resultant consciousness occurring] in hell encountering a 
        desirable object [on such occassions] as the Elder Maha-Moggallana's 
        visits to hell and so on. But among animals and powerful ghosts too a 
        desirable object is obtained [through the same condition].<BR>179. 
        &nbsp; This eightfold formation of merit is also a condition likewise 
        for sixteen kinds of profitable resultant consciousness in the course of 
        an existence ((34)-(41)) and in rebirth-linking ((42)-(49)) in the happy 
        destinies in the sense-sphere becoming. It is also a condition equally 
        for all ten kinds of resultant consciousness in the course of an 
        existence ((34), (35), (39)-(41)) and in rebirth-linking ((57)-(61)) in 
        the fine-material becoming.<BR>180. &nbsp; The <I>formation of 
        demerit,</I> comprising the twelve unprofitable volitions ((22)-(33)), 
        is a condition likewise in the unhappy destinies in the sense-sphere 
        becoming for one kind of consciousness in rebirth-linking (56), not in 
        the course of an existence; also for six kinds in the course of an 
        existence ((50)-(55)), not in rebirth-linking; and for all the seven 
        kinds partly in the course of an existence and partly in 
        rebirth-linking. And in the happy destinies in the sense-sphere becoming 
        it is a condition likewise for those same seven kinds in the course of 
        an existence, not in rebirth-linking. In the fine-material becoming it 
        is a condition likewise for four kinds of resultant consciousness 
        ((50)-(51)), (55), (56)) in the course of an existence, not in 
        rebirth-linking. Then it is a condition for [Brahmas'] seeing 
        undesirable visible data and hearing undesirable sounds that are in the 
        sense sphere: there are no undesirable visible data, etc., in the Brahma 
        World itself; and likewise in the divine world of the sense sphere. <A 
        name=33txt ref="#33fn"></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B3.html#33fn">{32}</A> <BR>181. 
        &nbsp; The <I>formation of the imperturbable</I> is a condition likewise 
        for four kinds of resultant consciousness ((62)-(65)) in the course of 
        an existence and in rebirth-linking in the immaterial 
        becoming.<BR>&nbsp; This firstly is how it should be understood what 
        kinds of resultant consciousness these formations are conditions for in 
        rebirth-linking and in the [three] kinds of becoming, and in what way 
        they are conditions. And it should also be understood in this same way 
        of the kinds of generations and so on.<BR>182. &nbsp; Here is a 
        statement of the bare headings starting from the beginning.<BR>&nbsp; Of 
        these [three kinds of] formations, firstly the formation of merit, when 
        giving rebirth-linking, produces the whole of its result in two of the 
        kinds of becoming; likewise in the four kinds of generation beginning 
        with the egg-born, in two of the kinds of destiny, in other words, the 
        divine and the human; in four of the stations of consciousness, [the 
        human, and the planes of the first, second and third jhanas,] described 
        thus 'Different in body and different in perception, ... different in 
        body and same in perception, ... same in body and different in 
        perception, ... same in body and same in perception, ... (D.iii,253); 
        and in only four of the abodes of beings, because in the abode of 
        non-percipient beings it only forms materiality. Therefore it is a 
        condition in the way already stated for twenty-one kinds of resultant 
        consciousness in these two kinds of becoming, four kinds of generation, 
        two kinds of destiny, four stations of consciousness, and four abodes of 
        beings according as they are produced in rebirth-linking ((41)-(49)), 
        (57)-(61)) [558] and the course of an existence ((34)-(41)), as 
        appropriate.<BR>183. &nbsp; The formation of demerit as rebirth-linking 
        ripens in the sense-sphere becoming only, in the four kinds of 
        generation, in the remaining three destinies, in the one station of 
        consciousness described thus 'different in body and same in perception' 
        (D.iii,253), and in the one corresponding abode of beings. Therefore it 
        is a condition in the way already stated for seven kinds of resultant 
        consciousness in one kind of becoming, in four kinds of generations, in 
        three kinds of destiny, in one station of consciousness, and in one 
        abode of beings, both in rebirth-linking (56) and in the course of an 
        existence ((50)-(56)).<BR>184. &nbsp; The formation of the imperturbable 
        as rebirth linking ripens in the immaterial becoming, in the 
        apparitional kind of generation only, in the divine destiny only, in the 
        three stations of consciousness beginning with base consisting of 
        boundless space, and in the four abodes of beings beginning with the 
        base consisting of boundless space, and in the four abodes of beings 
        beginning with the base consisting of boundless space ((62)-(65)). 
        Therefore it is a condition in the way already stated for the four kinds 
        of consciousness in one kind of becoming, in one kind of generation, in 
        one kind of destiny, in three stations of consciousness, and in four 
        abodes of beings, both in rebirth-linking and the course of becoming. <A

        destinies, in the first two stations of consciousness, and in two abodes

        twenty-three kinds of consciousness in one kind of becoming, four 
        generations, five destinies, two stations of consciousness, and two 
        abodes of beings, both in rebirth-linking and in the course of an 
        existence. The same method applies to the verbal formation. But the 
        mental formation does not fail to ripen anywhere except in one abode of 
        beings. Therefore it is a condition in the way already stated for the 
        thirty-two kinds of resultant consciousness, as appropriate, in the 
        three kinds of becoming, four generations, five destinies, seven 
        stations of consciousness, and eight abodes of beings, both in 
        rebirth-linking and in the course of an existence. There is no 
        consciousness with formations as condition in the non-percipient abode 
        of beings. Furthermore in the case of non-percipient beings, the 
        formation of merit is a condition, as kamma condition acting from a 
        different time, for the kinds of materiality due to kamma 
        performed.<BR><BR></FONT>
