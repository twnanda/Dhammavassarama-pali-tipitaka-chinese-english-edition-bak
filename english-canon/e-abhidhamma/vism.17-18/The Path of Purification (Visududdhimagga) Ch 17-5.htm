        size=+1>186. &nbsp; For the clause 'With consciousness as condition, 
        mentality-materiality':<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) By analysis of mind and 
        matter,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) 
        Occurrence in becoming etcetera,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Inclusion, and (4) manner of 
        condition,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        The exposition should be known.<BR>187. &nbsp; <I>By analysis of mind 
        and matter:,</I> here 'mind <I>(nama</I> = mentality)' is the three 
        aggregates, that is, feeling, perception, and formations, because of 
        their bending <I>(namana)</I> on to the object. 'Matter <I>(rupa</I> - 
        materiality)' is the four great primary elements and the materiality 
        derived [by clinging] from the four great primaries. Their analysis is 
        given in the Description of the Aggregates (Ch.XIV,34f. and 125f.). This 
        in the first place is how the exposition of mentality-materiality should 
        be known 'by analysis'.<BR>188. &nbsp; <I>2. By occurence in becoming 
        etcetera:</I> excepting one abode of beings [that is, the 
        non-percipient,] mentality occurs in all the kinds of becoming, 
        generation, destiny, and station of consciousness, and in the remaining 
        abodes of beings. Materiality occurs in two kinds of becoming, four 
        kinds of generation, five destinies, the first four stations of 
        consciousness, and the first five abodes of beings.<BR>189. &nbsp; Now 
        when this mentality-materiality occurs thus, [559] then in the case of 
        sexless embryos and the egg-born, at the moment of their rebirth-linking 
        there are manifested as materiality two organic continuities, that is, 
        the two decads of physical basis and body, and also the three immaterial 
        aggregates. So in their case there are in detail these twenty-three 
        states, namely, twenty states as concrete matter and three immaterial 
        aggregates, which should be understood as 'mentality-materiality with 
        consciousness as condition'. But omitting repetitions,<A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/35fn" name=35txt></A> <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B4.html#35fn">{35}</A> and so 
        cancelling nine material instances (see Ch.XI,&sect;88) from one of the 
        organic continuities, fourteen states remain.<BR>&nbsp; By adding the 
        sex decad for those possessed of sex [before making the above 
        cancellation] there are thirty-three. And omitting repetitions and so 
        cancelling eighteen material instances [nine each,] from two of the 
        organic continuities, fifteen states remain.<BR>191. &nbsp; In the 
        sense-sphere becoming, seven organic continuities are manifested as 
        materiality, and also three immaterial aggregates at the moment of 
        rebirth-linking of the remaining kinds of apparitionally born or of the 
        moisture-born possessing sex and matured sense bases. So in their case 
        in detail these seventy-three states, namely, seventy instances of 
        concrete materiality and three immaterial aggregates, should be 
        understood as 'mentality-materiality with formations as condition'. But 
        omitting repetitions and so cancelling fifty-four material instances 
        [nine each,] from six of the organic continuities, nineteen states, 
        remain.<BR>&nbsp; This is the maximum. But at minimum the computation of 
        'mentality-materiality with consciousness as condition' in the 
        rebirth-linking of those who lack such and such an organic continuity 
        can be understood in brief and detail by reducing it appropriately. [The 
        blind, for instance, lack the eye decad.]<BR>192. &nbsp; For 
        mentality-materiality immaterial beings have only the three [mental] 
        aggregates; while non-percipient beings have only the life-faculty 
        ennead, and that represents materiality.<BR>193. &nbsp; In the course of 
        an existence, in all places where materiality occurs there is manifested 
        the temperature-originated bare [material] octad, which is due 
        [initially] to the temperature that occurred together with the 
        rebirth-linking consciousness at the moment of its presence.<A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/36fn" name=36txt></A> <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B4.html#36fn">{36}</A> 
        Rebirth-linking consciousness does not originate materiality. For, just 
        as a man who is falling into a chasm cannot support another, so it, too, 
        is unable to originate materiality because of its weakness, which is due 
        to the weakness of the physical basis. But from the first life-continuum 
        after the rebirth-linking consciousness onwards [560] the bare octad 
        originated by consciousness appears. And at the time when sound becomes 
        manifest there is the sound ennead due both to temperature occurring 
        after the moment of rebirth-linking and to consciousness.<BR>194. &nbsp; 
        The bare octad originated by nutriment appears in beings in the womb who 
        live on matter consisting of physical nutriment as soon as their body is 
        suffused by nutriment swallowed by the mother; for it is 
        said:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And 
        so it is that when his mother<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Eats, consuming food and 
        drink,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'One 
        hidden in his mother's womb<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Thereby obtains his nourishment' 
        (S.i,206).<BR>&nbsp; And it appears in apparitionally born beings as 
        soon as they first swallow the spittle that has come into their own 
        mouths.<BR>&nbsp; So, with the twenty-six [material instances] 
        consisting of the bare octad originated by nutriment, and of the, at 
        most, two [sound] enneads originated respectively by temperature and 
        consciousness, and also with the already-mentioned seventy 
        kamma-originated instances (&sect;191) that arise three times in each 
        conscious moment [at the instants of arising, presence, and 
        dissolution], there are thus ninety-six material instances; and with the 
        three immaterial aggregates there is thus a total of ninety-nine 
        states.<BR>195. &nbsp; Or because sound is not regularly present since 
        it is only sometimes manifested, subtracting it therefor as twofold 
        [being temperature-originated and consciousness-originated], there are 
        these ninety-seven states to be understood as 'mentality-materiality 
        with consciousness as condition' in all beings, according as it happens 
        to be produced. For whether these beings are sleeping or idling or 
        eating or drinking, these states keep on occurring in them day and night 
        with consciousness as condition. And we shall explain later how they 
        have consciousness as their condition (see &sect;200ff.).<BR>196. &nbsp; Now 
        although this kamma-born materiality is the first to find a footing in 
        the several kinds of becoming, generation, destiny, station of 
        consciousness, and abode of beings, it is nevertheless unable to carry 
        on without being consolidated by materiality of triple origination [by 
        consciousness, temperature, and nutriment], nor can that of triple 
        origination do so without being consolidated by the former. But when 
        they thus give consolidating support to each other, they can stand up 
        without falling, like sheaves of reeds propped together on all four 
        sides, even though battered by the wind, and like [boats with] broken 
        floats<A href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/37fn" name=37txt></A> <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B4.html#37fn">{37}</A> that have 
        found a support, even though battered by waves somewhere in mid-ocean, 
        and they can last one year, two years, ... a hundred years, until those 
        beings' life span or their merit is exhausted.<BR>&nbsp; This is how the 
        exposition should be understood here 'by occurrence in becoming 
        etcetera'.<BR>197. &nbsp; <I>3. By inclusion:</I> now there is (a) the 
        simple mentality with consciousness as condition in both the course of 
        an existence and rebirth-linking in the immaterial sphere, and in the 
        course of an existence in the five-constituent becoming, and (b) the 
        simple materiality with consciousness as condition in both cases among 
        the non-percipient, and in the course of an existence in the 
        five-constituent becoming, and (c) the [combined] mentality-materiality 
        [561] with consciousness as condition in both cases in the 
        five-constituent becoming. All that mentality and materiality and 
        mentality-materiality should be understood as 'mentality-materiality 
        with consciousness as condition', including them under 
        mentality-materiality according to the method that allows any one part 
        to represent any remaining one of its kind.<A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/38fn" name=38txt></A> <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B4.html#38fn">{38}</A> <BR>198. 
        &nbsp; Is this correct in view of the absence of consciousness in 
        non-percipient beings? - It is not incorrect. For<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This consciousness, as cause of 
        mind<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And 
        matter, is twice reckoned:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Result, and also not-result.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherefore this is correctly 
        said.<BR>199. &nbsp; The consciousness that is the cause of 
        mentality-materiality is reckoned to be twofold classed as resultant and 
        not resultant. And since in the case of non-percipient beings 
        materiality is originated by kamma it has as its condition 
        kamma-formation consciousness that occurred in the five-constituent 
        becoming. This applies also to the kamma-originated materiality arising 
        in the course of an existence in the five-constituent becoming at the 
        moment of profitable or any other consciousness. So this is 
        correct.<BR>&nbsp; This is how the exposition can also be known here 'by 
        inclusion'.<BR>200. &nbsp; <I>4. By manner of condition:</I> 
        here:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Resultant-consciousness conditions<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mentality first in nine 
        ways,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then 
        basis matter in nine ways,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And other matter in eight ways,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Formation-consciousness 
        conditions<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        This matter in a single way.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest of consciousness 
        conditions<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        This matter as the case may be.<BR>201. &nbsp; Rebirth-linking or some 
        other kind of resultant consciousness is a condition in nine ways, as 
        conascence, mutuality, support, association, kamma-result, nutriment, 
        faculty, presence, and non-disappearance, conditions, either at 
        rebirth-linking or in the course of an existence, for that mentality 
        called resultant, whether mixed with materiality or not. At 
        rebirth-linking it is a condition in nine ways, as conascence, 
        mutuality, support, kamma-result, nutriment, faculty, dissociation, 
        presence, and non-disappearance, conditions, for the materiality of the 
        physical [heart] basis. It is a condition, in eight ways, namely, as the 
        above conditions omitting the mutuality condition, for materiality other 
        than the materiality of the physical basis.<BR>&nbsp; Kamma-formation 
        consciousness is a condition in one way only, as decisive-support 
        condition, for the materiality of non-percipient beings, or for the 
        kamma-born materiality in the five-constituent becoming, according to 
        the Suttanta method.<BR>&nbsp; All the remaining kinds of consciousness 
        from the time of the first life-continuum [consciousness following 
        rebirth-linking] onwards should be understood as a condition for some 
        kind of mentality-materiality as appropriate. But since the whole 
        contents of the Patthana must be cited in order to show how it acts in 
        detail, we do not undertake that.<BR>202. &nbsp; Here it may be asked: 
        But how is it to be known [562] that the mentality-materiality of 
        rebirth-linking has consciousness as its condition? - From Suttas and 
        from logic. For in the Suttas it is established in many places that 
        feeling, etc., have consciousness as condition in the way beginning 
        'States with parallel occurrence through consciousness' (Dhs.1522). But 
        as to logic,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        From matter seen here to be born<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of consciousness a man can 
        tell<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That 
        consciousness is a condition<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For matter when unseen as well.<BR>&nbsp; Whether 
        consciousness likes it or not, [certain] material instances are seen to 
        arise in conformity with it. And the unseen is inferred from the seen. 
        So it can be known, by means of the consciousness-born materiality that 
        is seen, that consciousness is also a condition for the unseen 
        materiality of rebirth-linking. For it is said in the Patthana that, 
        like the consciousness-originated, also the kamma-originated has 
        consciousness as its condition (see Ptn1.172-3).<BR>&nbsp; This is how 
        the exposition should be known 'by manner of condition'.<BR>&nbsp; This 
        is the detailed explanation of the clause 'With consciousness as 
        condition, mentality-materiality'.<BR><BR></FONT>

        Sixfold Base]<BR><BR></FONT></DIV><FONT size=+1>203. &nbsp; As to the 
        clause 'With mentality-materiality as condition, the sixfold 
        base':<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three 
        aggregates are 'Mind'; the basis,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Primaries, and the rest, are 
        'Matter':<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        And while all that conditions this<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A part can represent the 
        rest.<BR>204. &nbsp; In the case of the mentality-materiality that is 
        here a condition for the sixfold base, mentality is the three aggregates 
        beginning with feeling, while materiality should be understood as that 
        included in one's own continuity stated thus 'primaries and the rest are 
        "Matter-"', that is to say, the four primaries, six physical bases, and 
        life faculty, [since they are conditioning factors] invariably. But this 
        mentality and this materiality and this mentality-materiality each one 
        representing the rest as 'mentality-materiality' should be understood as 
        a condition for the sixfold base consisting of the sixth base and the 
        sixfold base each one representing the rest as the 'sixfold base'. Why? 
        Because in the immaterial becoming there is only mentality as a 
        condition, and that is a condition only for the sixth base, [namely, the 
        mind base,] not for any other. For it is said in the Vibhanga 'With 
        mentality as condition, the sixth base' (Vbh.179).<BR>205. &nbsp; Here 
        it may be asked: But how is it to be known that mentality-materiality is 
        a condition for the sixfold base? - Because the latter exists when 
        mentality-materiality exists. For a given base exists when a given kind 
        of mentality and materiality exists not otherwise. But the way in which 
        the one comes to exist when the other does will be explained below in 
        the section dealing with how it is a condition. [563] 
        Therefore,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 
        wise man should contrive to tell<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which one conditions which, and 
        how,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 
        rebirth and in life as well;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [The explanation follows now.]<BR>206. &nbsp; Herein 
        what follows illustrates the meaning.<BR><BR></FONT>

        seven ways and six to be<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Condition at the minimum.<BR>207. &nbsp; How? In 
        rebirth-linking, firstly, mentality is a condition in seven ways at the 
        minimum, as conascence, mutuality, support, association, kamma-result, 
        presence, and non-disappearance, condition, for the sixth base. Some 
        mentality however, is a condition, as root-cause condition, [that is, 
        greed, etc.,] and some as nutriment condition [that is, contact and 
        mental volition]. So it is also a condition in other ways. It is by the 
        [two latter] that the maximum and minimum should be understood. In the 
        course of an existence, too, resultant mentality is a condition as 
        already stated. But the other [non-resultant] kind is a condition in six 
        ways at minimum, as the aforesaid conditions except for kamma-result 
        condition. Some, however, is a condition as root-cause condition, and 
        some as nutriment condition. So it is also a condition in other ways. It 
        is by these that the maximum and minimum should be 
        understood.<BR>208.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In five-constituent 
        becoming<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 
        rebirth, mind in the same ways<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acts as condition for the 
        sixth,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And 
        for the others in six ways.<BR>209. &nbsp; Besides the immaterial 
        states, also in the five-constituent becoming that resultant mentality, 
        in association with the heart-basis, is a condition in seven ways at the 
        minimum, for the sixth, the mind base, in the same way as was said with 
        respect to the immaterial states. But in association with the four 
        primary elements, it is a condition in six ways, as conascence, support, 
        kamma-result, dissociation, presence, and non-disappearance, conditions, 
        for the other five beginning with the eye base. Some, however, is a 
        condition as root-cause condition, and some as nutriment condition. It 
        is by these that the maximum and minimum should be understood.<BR>210. 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Result is for result 
        condition<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        During a life in the same ways;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While non-result the 
        non-resultant<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixth conditions in six ways.<BR>211. For as in 
        rebirth-linking, so also in the course of an existence in the 
        five-constituent becoming, resultant mentality is a condition in the 
        seven ways at minimum for the resultant sixth base. But non-resultant 
        mentality is a condition in ways at minimum for the non-resultant sixth 
        base, leaving out kamma-result condition. The maximum and minimum should 
        be understood in the way already stated.<BR>212.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp; And during life, result conditions<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other five in fourfold 
        way;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        non-resultant kind can be<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Explained in the aforesaid way. [564]<BR>213. &nbsp; 
        Again in the course of an existence, the other resultant mentality, 
        which has as its physical basis the eye sensitivity, etc., is a 
        condition in four ways, as postnascence, dissociation, presence, and 
        non-disappearance, conditions, for the rest of the five begining with 
        the eye base. And as the resultant, so also the non-resultant is 
        explained; therefore [the mentality] classed as profitable, etc., should 
        be understood as their condition in four ways.<BR>&nbsp; This firstly is 
        how it should be understood what bases mentality alone is a condition 
        for in rebirth-linking and in the course of an existence, and how it is 
        a condition.<BR><BR></FONT>

        to matter, the materiality of the physical [heart] basis is a condition 
        in the rebirth-linking in six ways, as conascence, mutuality, support, 
        dissociation, presence, and non-disappearance, condition, for the sixth, 
        the mind base. But the four primaries are in general, that is to say, in 
        rebirth-linking and in the course of an existence, conditions, in four 
        ways, as conascence, support, presence, and non-disappearance, 
        conditions, for any of the five bases beginning with the eye, whenever 
        they arise.<BR>216.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Life and in lifetime food

        the sixth in fivefold way.<BR>217. &nbsp; But in rebirth-linking and in 
        the course of an existence the material life [faculty] is a condition in 
        three ways, as presence, non-disappearance, and faculty, conditions, for 
        these five beginning with the eye. Nutriment too is a condition in three 
        ways, as presence, non-disappearance, and nutriment, condition, and that 
        is so in the course of an existence not in rebirth-linking, and applies 
        when the bodies of beings subsisting on nutriment are suffused with the 
        nutriment. In the course of an existence, not in rebirth-linking, those 
        five bases beginning with the eye are condition in six ways, as support, 
        prenascence, faculty, dissociation, presence, and non-disappearance, 
        condition, for [that part of] the sixth, the mind base, comprising eye, 
        ear, nose, tongue, and body, consciousness. But in the course of an 
        existence, not at rebirth-linking, the materiality of the [heart] basis 
        is a condition in five ways, as support, prenascence, dissociation, 
        presence, and non-disappearance, conditions, for the remaining mind base 
        apart from the five consciousnesses.<BR>&nbsp; This is how it should be 
        understood what bases materiality alone is a condition for in 
        rebirth-linking and in the course of an existence, and how it is a 
        condition. [565]<BR><BR></FONT>

        the trio of aggregates with the materiality of the [heart] basis, is a 
        condition, as conascence, mutuality, support, kamma-result, association,

        Contact]<BR><BR></FONT></DIV><FONT size=+1>220. &nbsp; As to the clause 
        'With the sixfold base as condition, contact':<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contact is briefly of six 
        kinds<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With 
        eye-contact and others too;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to each consciousness<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is in detail 
        thirty-two.<BR>221. &nbsp; Briefly with the clause 'With the sixfold 
        base as condition, contact', there are only the six kinds beginning with 
        eye contact, that is to say, eye contact, ear contact, nose contact, 
        tongue contact, body contact, and mind contact. But in detail the five 
        profitable resultant and the five unprofitable resultant beginning with 
        eye contact make ten; the rest, which are associated with the twenty-two 
        kinds of mundane resultant consciousness, make twenty-two. So all these 
        come to thirty-two ((34)-(65)), like the consciousness with formations 
        as condition given above.<BR>222. &nbsp; But as to the sixfold base that 
        is a condition for these thirty-two-fold contact: 
        herein,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some 
        wise men take the sixfold base<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be the five internal bases<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the sixth; but others 
        count<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These 
        plus the six external bases.<BR>223. &nbsp; Herein firstly there are 
        those who take this to be an exposition of the occurrence of what is 
        clung to, [that is kammically-acquired aggregates,] and they maintain 
        that the conditioning [bases] and the conditionally-arisen [contact] are 
        only what is included in one's own continuity. They take any one part to 
        represent any remaining one of its kind, since the condition for contact 
        in the immaterial states is the sixth base [only], according to the text 
        'With the sixth base as condition, contact' (Vbh.179) and elsewhere it 
        is the sixfold base inclusively. So they have it that 'sixfold base' 
        means the internal [five] beginning with the eye plus the sixth (mind) 
        base. For that sixth base and that sixfold base are styled 'sixfold 
        base' means the same internal [five] plus the sixth plus the external 
        ones beginning with visible data. For that sixth base and that [partial] 
        sixfold base and the sixfold base along with these [external ones] each 
        representing the rest [566] are styled sixfold base too.<BR>224. &nbsp; 
        Here it may be asked: One kind of contact does not derive from all the 
        bases, nor all the kinds of contact from one base. And yet 'With the 
        sixfold base as condition, contact' is said in<BR>225. the singular. Why 
        is that? - Here is the answer: It is true that neither is one derived 
        from all nor all from one. However, one is derived from many. For eye 
        contact is derived from the eye base, from the visible-data base, from 
        the mind base reckoned as eye-consciousness, and from the mental-datum 
        base consisting of the remaining associated states. And each case should 
        be construed as appropriate in this way. 
        Therefore,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Though stated in the singular,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shows therewith in all such 
        cases<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That 
        this contact, though only one,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is yet derived from several bases.<BR>&nbsp; 
        <I>Though stated in the singular:</I> the meaning is, by this statement 
        in the singular that 'With the sixfold base as condition, contact', it 
        is pointed out by the Blessed One <I>(Tadin)</I> that contact, which is 
        of one kind, comes into being from many bases.<BR><BR></FONT>

        prenascence, faculty, dissociation, presence, and non-disappearance, 
        conditions, for contact classed in five ways as eye contact, and so on. 
        But these and mental data as object are conditions likewise, and as 
        object condition too, for mind contact, so 'the external six as 
        contact's conditionality according to each case we fix.'<BR>&nbsp; This

        are<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At nine 
        and eighty sorts assessed.<BR>229. &nbsp; In the analysis of this clause 
        [in the Vibhanga] only six kinds of feeling according to door are given 
        thus 'Eye-contact-born feeling, ear-, nose-, tongue-, body-, 
        mind-contact-born feeling' (Vbh.136). [567] Still when classed according 
        to association with the eighty-nine kinds of consciousness, they are 'at 
        nine and eighty sorts assessed'.<BR>230.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; But 
        from the nine and eighty feelings<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirty-two, no more,

        Herein, contact in the five doors<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conditions five in eightfold

        Herein, in the five doors contact beginning with eye contact is a 
        condition in eight ways, as conascence, mutuality, support, result, 
        nutriment, association, presence, and non-disappearance, conditions, for 
        the five kinds of feeling that have respectively eye sensitivity, etc., 
        as their physical basis. But that contact beginning with eye contact is 
        a condition in one way only, as decisive-support condition, for the rest 
        of resultant feeling in the sense sphere occurring in each door as 
        receiving, investigation and registration.<BR>232. &nbsp; <I>In the mind

        kinds of resultant feeling in the three planes occurring with 
        rebirth-linking, life-continuum and death. But the mind contact 
        associated with mind-door adverting is a condition in one way only, as 
        decisive-support condition, for the kinds of feeling that occur in the

        &nbsp; As regards the clause 'With feeling as condition, 
        craving',<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Six cravings, for things visible<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all the rest, are treated 
        here;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And 
        each of these, when it occurs,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can in one of three modes appear.<BR>234. &nbsp; Six 
        kinds of craving are shown in the analysis of this clause [in the 
        Vibhanga] as 'visible-data, craving, sound, odour, flavour, 
        tangible-data, and mental-data, craving' (Vbh.136), called after their 
        objects, as a son is called after his father 'banker's son', 'brahman's 
        son'.<BR>&nbsp; Each of these six kinds of craving is reckoned threefold 
        according to its mode of occurence as craving for sense desire, craving 
        for becoming, or craving for non-becoming.<BR>235. &nbsp; When 
        visible-data craving occurs enjoying with sense-desire enjoyment a 
        visible datum as object that has come into the focus of the eye, it is 
        called craving for sense desires. But when [that same visible-data 
        craving] occurs along with the eternity view that assumes that same 
        object to be lasting and eternal, [568] it is called craving for 
        becoming; for it is the greed accompanying the eternity view that is 
        called craving for becoming. When it occurs along with the annihilation 
        view that assumes that same object to break up and be destroyed, it is 
        called craving for non-becoming; for it is the greed accompanying the 
        annihilation view that is called craving for non-becoming. So also in 
        the case of craving for sounds, and so on.<BR>&nbsp; These amount to 
        eighteen kinds of craving. The eighteen with respect to one's own 
        visible data (one's own appearance), etc., and eighteen with respect to 
        external [visible data (another's appearance), etc.,] together make 
        thirty-six kinds. Thirty-six in the past, thirty-six in the future, and 
        thirty-six in the present, make one-hundred-and-eight kinds of craving. 
        When these are reduced again, they should be understood to amount to the 
        six kinds only with visible data, etc., as object; and these, to three 
        only, as craving for sense desires, and so on.<BR>236. &nbsp; Out of 
        selfish affection for feeling after taking pleasure in it when it arises 
        through a visible datum as object, etc., these beings accord much honour 
        to painters, musicians, perfumers, cooks, weavers, distiller of elixirs, 
        <A href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/39fn" name=39txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B4.html#39fn">{39}</A> physicians, 
        etc., who furnish respectively visible data as object, etc., just as, 
        out of affection for a child they reward the child's nurse after taking 
        pleasure in the child. That is why it should be understood that these 
        three kinds of craving have feeling as their 
        condition.<BR>237.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What is intended here is 
        but<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Resultant pleasure feeling; hence<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        Clinging]<BR><BR></FONT></DIV><FONT size=+1>239. &nbsp; As regards the 
        clause 'With craving as condition clinging', <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four clingings need to be 
        explained<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        (1) As to analysis of meaning,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) As to the brief and full 
        account<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of 
        states, (3) and also as to order. [569]<BR>240. &nbsp; Herein, this is 
        the explanation: firstly there are these four kinds of clinging here, 
        namely, sense-desire clinging, [false-]view clinging, rite-and-ritual 
        clinging, and self-doctrine clinging.<BR>241. &nbsp; 1. The <I>analysis 
        of meaning</I> is this: it clings to the kind of sense-desire called 
        sense-desire's physical-object (see Ch.IV, note 24), thus it is 
        sense-desire clinging. Also it is sense-desire and it is clinging, thus 
        it is sense-desire clinging. Clinging <I>(upadana)</I> is firm grasping; 
        for here the prefix <I>upa</I> has the sense of firmness, as in 
        <I>upayasa</I> (great misery - see &sect;48) and <I>upakuttha</I> (great 
        pox), <A href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/41fn" name=41txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B4.html#41fn">{41}</A> and so on. 
        Likewise, it is [false] view and it is clinging, thus it is [false-]view 
        clinging; or, it clings to [false-]view, thus it is [false-]view 
        clinging; for in [the case of the false view] 'The world is self and 
        eternal' (D.i.14), etc., it is the latter kind of view that clings to 
        the former. Likewise, it clings to rite and ritual and it is clinging, 
        thus it is rite-and-ritual clinging; also, it is rite and ritual and it 
        is clinging, thus it is rite-and-ritual clinging; for ox asceticism, ox 
        vows, etc., (see M.i,387f.) are themselves kinds of clinging, too, 
        because of the misinterpretation (insistence) that purification comes 
        about in this way. Likewise, they indoctrinate by means of that, thus 
        that is doctrine; they cling by means of that, thus that is clinging. 
        What do they indoctrinate with? What do they cling to? Self. The 
        clinging to doctrines of self is self-doctrine clinging. Or by means of 
        that they cling to a self that is a mere doctrine of self; thus that is 
        self-doctrine clinging. This firstly, is the 'analysis of 
        meaning'.<BR>242. &nbsp; 2. But as regards the <I>brief and full account 
        of states,</I> firstly in brief sense-desire clinging is called 
        'firmness of craving' since it is said, 'Herein, what is sense-desire 
        clinging? That which in the case of sense desires is lust for sense 
        desires, greed for sense desires, delight in sense desires, craving for 
        sense-desire, fever of sense desire, infatuation with sense desire, 
        committal to sense desire; that is called sense-desire clinging' 
        (Dhs.1214). 'Firmness of craving is a name for the subsequent craving 
        itself, which has become firm by the influence of previous craving, 
        which acts as its decisive-support condition. But some have said: 
        Craving is the aspiring to an object that one has not yet reached, like 
        a thief's stretching out his hand in the dark; clinging is the grasping 
        of an object that one has reached, like the thief's grasping his 
        objective. These states oppose fewness of wishes and content and so they 
        are the roots of the suffering due to seeking and guarding (see 
        D.ii,58f.). The remaining three kinds of clinging are in brief simply 
        [false] view.<BR>243. &nbsp; In detail, however, sense-desire clinging 
        is the firm state of the craving described above as of 
        one-hundred-and-eight kinds with respect to visible data, and so on. 
        [False-]view clinging is the ten-based wrong view, according as it is 
        said 'Herein, what is [false-]view clinging? There is no giving, no 
        offering, ... [no good and virtuous ascetics and brahmans who have 
        themselves] realized by direct-knowledge and declare this world and the 
        other world: such view as this, ... such perverse assumption, is called 
        [false-]view clinging' (Vbh.375; Dhs.1215). Rite-and-ritual clinging is 
        the adherence [to the view that] purification comes through rites and 
        rituals, according as it is said 'Herein, what is rite-and-ritual 
        clinging? ... that purification comes through a rite, that purification 
        comes through a ritual, [570] that purification comes through a rite and 
        ritual: such view as this, ... such perverse assumption, is called 
        rite-and-ritual clinging' (Dhs.1216). Self-doctrine clinging is the 
        twenty-based [false] view of individuality, according as it is said 
        'Herein, what is self-doctrine clinging'. Here the untaught ordinary ... 
        untrained in good men's Dhamma (Law), sees materiality as self ... such 
        perverse assumption, is called self-doctrine clinging' 
        (Dhs.1217).<BR>&nbsp; This is the 'brief and full account of 
        states'.<BR>244. &nbsp; 3. <I>As to order:</I> here order is threefold 
        (see Ch.XIV&sect;211), that is to say, order of arising, order of abandoning 
        and order of teaching.<BR>&nbsp; Herein, order of arising of defilements 
        is not meant literally because there is no first arising of defilements 
        in the beginningless round of rebirths. But in a relative sense it is 
        this: usually in a single becoming the misinterpretation of (insistence 
        on) eternity and annihilation are preceded by the assumption of a self. 
        After that, when a man assumes that this self is eternal, 
        rite-and-ritual clinging arises in him for the purpose of purifying the 
        self. And when a man assumes that this self is eternal, rite-and-ritual 
        clinging arises in him for the purpose of purifying the self. And when a 
        man assumes that it breaks up, thus disregarding the next word, 
        sense-desire clinging arises in him. So self-doctrine clinging arises 
        first, and after that, [false-]view clinging, and rite-and-ritual 
        clinging or sense-desire clinging. This, then, is their order of arising 
        in one becoming.<BR>245. &nbsp; And here [false] view clinging, etc., 
        are abandoned first because they are eliminated by the path of 
        Stream-entry. Sense-desire clinging is abandoned later because it is 
        eliminated by the Path of Arahantship. This is the order of their 
        abandoning.<BR>246. &nbsp; Sense-desire clinging, however, is taught 
        first among them because of the breadth of its objective field and 
        because of its obviousness. For it has a broad objective field because 
        it is associated with eight kinds of consciousness ((22)-(29)). The 
        others have a narrow objective field because they are associated with 
        four kinds of consciousness ((22), (23), (26), (27) and (22) etc.). And 
        usually it is sense-desire clinging that is obvious because of this 
        generation's love of attachment (see M.i.167), not so the other kinds. 
        One possessed of sense-desire clinging is much given to display and 
        ceremony (see M.i.265) for the purpose of attaining sense desires. 
        [False-]view clinging comes next to the [sense-desire clinging] since 
        that [display and ceremony] is a [false] view of his.<A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/42fn" name=42txt></A> <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B4.html#42fn">{42}</A> And that is 
        then divided in two as rite-and-ritual clinging and self-doctrine 
        clinging. And of these two, rite-and-ritual clinging is taught first, 
        being gross, because it can be recognized on seeing [it in the forms of] 
        ox practice and dog practice. And self-doctrine clinging is taught last 
        because of its subtlety. This is the 'order of teaching'.<BR><BR></FONT>

        clinging taught in this way, craving for sense desires is a condition in 
        one way, as decisive-support, for the first kind, namely sense-desire 
        clinging, because it arises in relation to the objective field in which 
        craving delights. But it is a condition in seven ways, as conascence, 
        mutuality, support, association, presence, non-disappearance, and 
        root-cause, or in eight ways, as [those and] decisive-support as well, 
        for the remaining three kinds. And when it is a condition as 
        decisive-support, then it is never conascent.<BR>&nbsp; This is the 
        detailed explanation of the clause 'With craving as condition, 
        clinging'. [571]<BR><BR></FONT>

        &nbsp; As to the clause 'With clinging as condition, 
        becoming',<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        (1) As to meaning, (2) as to state,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Purpose, (4) analysis, (5) 
        synthesis,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        (6) And which for which becomes conditions.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The exposition should be 
        known.<BR>250. &nbsp; Herein, it becomes <I>(bhavati),</I> thus it is 
        becoming <I>(bhava).</I> That is twofold as kamma-process becoming and 
        there is rebirth-process becoming' (Vbh.137). Herein, the kamma process 
        itself as becoming is 'kamma-process becoming'; likewise the rebirth 
        process itself as becoming is 'rebirth-process becoming'. And here, 
        rebirth is becoming since it becomes; but just as 'The arising of 
        Buddhas is bliss' (Dh.194) is said because it causes bliss, so too kamma 
        should be understood as 'becoming', using for it the ordinary term for 
        its fruit, since it causes becoming. This firstly is how the exposition 
        should be known here 'as to meaning.'<BR>251. &nbsp; 2. <I>As to 
        state:</I> firstly kamma-process becoming in brief is both volition also 
        and the states of covetousness, etc., associated with the volition and 
        reckoned as kamma too according as it is said 'Herein, what is 
        kamma-process becoming? The formation of merit, the formation of 
        demerit, the formation of the imperturbable, either with a small 
        (limited) plane or with a large (exalted) plane: that is called 
        kamma-process becoming. Also all kamma that leads to becoming is called 
        'kamma-process becoming' (Vbh.137).<BR>252. &nbsp; Here the formation of 
        merit is, in terms of states, the thirteen kinds of volition ((1)-(13)), 
        the formation of demerit is the twelve kinds ((22)-(33)) and the 
        formation of the imperturbable is the four kinds ((14)-(17)). So with 
        the words <I>either with a small (limited) plane or with a large 
        (exalted) plane</I> the insignificance or magnitude of these same 
        volitions' result is expressed here. But with the words <I>also all 
        kamma that leads to becoming</I> the covetousness, etc., associated with 
        volition are expressed.<BR>253. &nbsp; Rebirth-process becoming briefly 
        is aggregages generated by kamma. It is of nine kinds, according as it 
        is said 'Herein, what is rebirth-process becoming? Sense-desire 
        becoming, fine-material becoming, immaterial becoming, percipient 
        becoming, non-percipient becoming, neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient 
        becoming, one-constituent becoming, [572] four-constituent becoming, 
        five-constituent becoming: This is called rebirth process becoming' 
        (Vbh.17).<BR>254. &nbsp; Herein, the kind of becoming called 'having 
        sense desire' is <I>sense-desire becoming.</I> Similarly with the 
        <I>fine-material</I> and <I>immaterial</I> kinds of becoming. It is the 
        becoming of those possessed of perception, or, there is perception here 
        in becoming, thus it is <I>percipient becoming.</I> The opposite kind is 
        <I>non-percipient becoming.</I> Owing to the absence of gross perception 
        and to the presence of subtle perception there is neither perception nor 
        non-perception in that kind of becoming thus it is 
        <I>neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient becoming.</I> It is becoming 
        constituted out of the materiality aggregate only, thus it is 
        <I>one-constituent becoming,</I> or, that kind of becoming has only one 
        constituent, [the materiality aggregate, or dimension,] thus it is 
        one-constituent becoming. And similarly the <I>four-constituent</I> [has 
        the four mental aggregates, or dimensions,] and the 
        <I>five-constituent</I> [has the material and the four mental 
        aggregates, or dimensions].<BR>255. &nbsp; Herein, sense-desire becoming 
        is five aggregates acquired through kamma (clung to). Likewise the 
        fine-material becoming. Immaterial becoming is four. Percipient becoming 
        is four and five. Non-percipient becoming is one aggregate that is 
        acquired through kamma (clung to). Neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient 
        becoming is four. One-constituent becoming, etc., are respectively one, 
        four, and five, aggregates as aggregates that are acquired through kamma 
        (clung to).<BR>&nbsp; This is how the exposition should be know here 'as 
        to state'.<BR>256. &nbsp; 3. <I>As to purpose:</I> although formations 
        of merit, etc., are of course dealt with in the same way in the 
        description of becoming and in the description of formations (see 
        Vbh.135 and 137), nevertheless the repetition has a purpose. For in the 
        former case it was because it was a condition, as past kamma, for 
        rebirth-linking here [in this becoming], while in the latter case it is 
        because it is a condition, as present kamma, for rebirth-linking in the 
        future [becoming]. Or alternatively, in the former instance, in the 
        passage beginning 'Herein, what is the formation of merit? It is 
        profitable volition of the sense sphere' (Vbh.135), it was only 
        volitions that were called formations'; but here, with the words 'All 
        kamma that leads to becoming' (Vbh.137), the states associated with the 
        volition are also included. And in the former instance it was only such 
        kamma as is a condition for consciousness that was called 'formations'; 
        but now also that which generates non-percipi-<BR>257. ent becoming is 
        included. But why so many words? In the clause 'With ignorance as 
        condition there are formations' only profitable and unprofitable states 
        are expressed as the formation of merit, etc.; but in the clause 'With 
        clinging as condition, becoming' profitable and unprofitable and also 
        functional states are expressed because of the inclusion of 
        rebirth-process becoming. So this repetition has a purpose in each case. 
        This is how the exposition should be known 'as to purpose here'.<BR>258. 
        &nbsp; 4. <I>As to analysis, synthesis</I> means as to both the analysis 
        and the synthesis of becoming that has clinging as its 
        condition.<BR>&nbsp; The kamma with sense-desire clinging as its 
        condition that is performed and generates sense-desire becoming is 
        'kamma-process becoming'. The aggregates generated by that are 
        'rebirth-process becoming'. The aggregates generated by that are 
        'rebirth-process becoming', similarly in the case of fine-material and 
        immaterial becoming. So [573] there are two kinds of sense-desire 
        becoming with sense-desire clinging as condition, included in which are 
        percipient becoming and five-constituent becoming. And there are two 
        kinds of fine-material becoming, included in which are percipient, 
        non-percipient, one-constituent, and five-constituent, becoming. And 
        there are two kinds of immaterial becoming, included in which are 
        percipient becoming, neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient becoming, and 
        four-constituent becoming. So, together with what is included by them, 
        there are six kinds of becoming with sense-desire clinging as condition. 
        Similarly too with the [three] remaining kinds of clinging as condition. 
        So, as to analysis, there are, together with what is included by them, 
        twenty-four kinds of becoming with clinging as condition.<BR>259. &nbsp; 
        5. <I>As to synthesis,</I> however, by uniting kamma-process becoming 
        and rebirth-process becoming there is together with what is included by 
        it, one kind of sense-desire becoming with sense-desire clinging as its 
        condition. Similarly with fine-material and immaterial becoming. So 
        there are three kinds of becoming. And similarly with the remaining 
        [three] kinds of clinging as condition. So by synthesis, there are, 
        together with what is included by them, twelve kinds of becoming with 
        clinging as condition.<BR>260. &nbsp; Furthermore, without distinction 
        the kamma with clinging as its condition that attains sense-desire 
        becoming is kamma-process becoming. The aggregates generated by that are 
        rebirth-process becoming. So, together with what is included by them, 
        there are two kinds of sense-desire becoming, two kinds of fine-material 
        becoming, and two kinds of immaterial becoming. So, by synthesis, there 
        are six kinds of becoming by this other method. Or again, without making 
        the division into kamma-process becoming and rebirth-process becoming 
        there are, together with what is included by them, three kinds of 
        becoming as sense-desire becoming, and so on. Or again, without making 
        the division into sense-desire becoming, etc., there are together with 
        what is included by them two kinds of becoming, as kamma-process 
        becoming and rebirth-process becoming. And also without making the 
        division into kamma process and rebirth process there is, according to 
        the words 'With clinging as condition becoming', only one kind of 
        becoming.<BR>&nbsp; This is how the exposition of becoming with clinging 
        as condition should be known here 'as to analysis and 
        synthesis'.<BR>261. &nbsp; 6. <I>Which for which becomes condition</I> 
        means that here the exposition should be known according to what kind of 
        clinging is a condition for what [kind of becoming]. But what is 
        condition for what here? Any kind is a condition for any kind. For the 
        ordinary man is like a madman, and without any considering 'Is this 
        right or not?', and aspiring by means of any of the kinds of clinging to 
        any of the kinds of becoming he performs any of the kinds of kamma. 
        Therefore when some say that the fine-material and immaterial kinds of 
        becoming do not come about through rite-and-ritual clinging, that should 
        not be accepted: what should be accepted is that all kinds come about 
        through all kinds.<BR>262. &nbsp; For example someone thinks in 
        accordance with hearsay or [false] view that sense desires come to be 
        fulfilled in the human world among the great warrior <I>(khattiya)</I> 
        families, etc., and in the six divine worlds of the sense sphere. [574] 
        Misled by listening to wrong doctrine, etc., and imagining that 'by this 
        kamma sense desires will come to be fulfilled', he performs for the 
        purpose of attaining them acts of bodily misconduct, etc., through 
        sense-desire clinging. By fulfilling such misconduct he is reborn in the 
        states of loss. Or he performs acts of bodily misconduct, etc., aspiring 
        to sense desires visible here and now and protecting those he has 
        already acquired. By fulfilling such misconduct he is reborn in the 
        states of loss. The kamma that is the cause of rebirth there is 
        kamma-process becoming. The aggregates generated by the kamma are 
        rebirth-process becoming. But percipient becoming and five-constituent 
        becoming are included in that, too.<BR>263. &nbsp; Another, however, 
        whose knowledge has been intensified by listening to good Dhamma and so 
        on, imagines that 'By this kind of kamma sense desires will come to be 
        fulfilled'. He performs acts of bodily good conduct, etc., through 
        sense-desire clinging. By fulfilling such bodily good conduct he is 
        reborn among deities or human beings. The kamma that is the cause of his 
        rebirth there is kamma-process becoming. The aggregates generated by the 
        kamma are rebirth-process becoming. But percipient becoming and 
        five-constituent becoming are included in that, too.<BR>&nbsp; So 
        sense-desire clinging is a condition for sense-desire becoming with its 
        analysis and its synthesis.<BR>264. &nbsp; Another hears or conjectures 
        that sense desires come to still greater perfection in the fine-material 
        and immaterial kinds of becoming, and through sense-desire clinging he 
        produces the fine-material and immaterial attainments, and in virture of 
        his attainments he is reborn in the fine-material or immaterial Brahma 
        World. The kamma that is the cause of his rebirth there is kamma-process 
        becoming. The aggregates generated by the kamma are rebirth-process 
        becoming. But percipient, non-percipient, 
        neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient, one-constituent, 
        four-constituent, and five-constituent, kinds of becoming are included 
        in that, too. Thus sense-desire clinging is a condition for 
        fine-material and immaterial becoming with its analysis and its 
        sythesis.<BR>265. &nbsp; Another clings to the annihilation view thus 
        'This self comes to be entirely cut off when it is cut off in the 
        fortunate states of the sense sphere, or in the fine-material or 
        immaterial kinds of becoming', and he performs kamma to achieve that. 
        His kamma is kamma-process becoming. The aggregates generated by the 
        kamma are rebirth-process becoming. But the percipient, etc., kinds of 
        becoming are included in that too. So [false-]view clinging is a 
        condition for all three, namely, for the sense-desire, fine-material, 
        and immaterial, kinds of becoming with their analysis and their 
        synthesis.<BR>266. &nbsp; Another through self-theory clinging thinks 
        'This self comes to be blissful, or comes to be free from fever, in the 
        becoming in the fortunate states in the sense sphere or in one or other 
        of the fine-material and immaterial kinds of becoming', and he performs 
        kamma to achieve that. That kamma of his is kamma-process becoming. The 
        aggregates generated by the kamma are [575] rebirth-process becoming. 
        But the percipient, etc., kinds of becoming are included in that, too. 
        Thus this self-theory clinging is a condition for all the three, namely, 
        becoming with their analysis and their synthesis.<BR>267. &nbsp; Another 
        [thinks] through rite-and-ritual clinging 'This rite and ritual leads 
        him who perfects it to perfect bliss in becoming in the fortunate states 
        of the sense sphere or in the fine-material or immaterial kinds of 
        becoming', and he performs kamma to achieve that. That kamma of his is 
        kamma-process becoming. The aggregates generated by the kamma are 
        rebirth-process becoming. But the percipient, etc., kinds of becoming 
        are included in that, too. So rite-and-ritual clinging is a condition 
        for all threee, namely, the sense-desire, fine material, and immaterial, 
        kinds of becoming with their analysis and their synthesis.<BR>&nbsp; 
        This is how the exposition should be known here according to 'which is 
        condition for which.'<BR><BR></FONT>

        And so on for the sense-desire kind.<BR>269. &nbsp; This clinging, 
        though fourfold, is a condition in only one way as decisive-support 
        condition <I>for becoming both fine-material and immaterial</I> [that 
        is,] for the profitable kamma in the kamma-process becoming that takes 
        place in sense-desire becoming and for the rebirth-process becoming. It 
        is a condition, <I>as conascence and so on,</I> that is, as conascence, 
        mutuality, support, association, presence, non-disappearance, 
        root-cause, conditions, for the unprofitable kamma-process becoming 
        associated with [the fourfold clinging] itself in the sense-desire 
        becoming. But it is a condition, as decisive-support only, for that 
        which is dissociated.<BR>&nbsp; This is the detailed explanation of the 
        clause 'With clinging as condition, becoming.'<BR><BR></FONT>

        name=Birth></A>[(xi)-(xii) Birth, etc.]<BR><BR></FONT></DIV><FONT 
        size=+1>270. &nbsp; As regards the clause 'With becoming as condition, 
        birth', etc., the definition of birth, should be understood in the way 
        given in the Description of the Truths (Ch.XVI,&sect;31ff.).<BR>&nbsp; Only 
        kamma-process becoming is intended here as 'becoming'; for it is that, 
        not rebirth-process becoming that is intended here as 'becoming'; for it 
        is that, not rebirth-process becoming, which is a condition for birth. 
        But it is a condition in two ways, as kamma condition and as 
        decisive-support condition.<BR>271. &nbsp; Here it may be asked: but how 
        is it to be known that becoming is a condition for birth? - Because of 
        the observable difference of inferiority and superiority. For in spite 
        of equality of external circumstances, such as father, mother, seed, 
        blood, nutriment, etc., the difference of inferiority and superiority of 
        beings is observable even in the case of twins. And that fact is not 
        causeless, since it is not present always and in all: [576] nor has it 
        any cause other than kamma-process becoming since there is no other 
        reason in the internal continuity of beings generated by it. 
        Consequently it has only kamma-process becoming for its cause. And 
        because kamma is the cause of the difference of inferiority and 
        superiority among beings the Blessed One said 'It is kamma that 
        separates beings according to inferiority and superiority' (M.iii,203). 
        From that it can be known that becoming is a condition for 
        birth.<BR>272. &nbsp; And when there is no birth, neither ageing and 
        death nor the states beginning with sorrow come about; but when there is 
        birth, then ageing and death come about, and also the states beginning 
        with sorrow, which are either bound up with ageing and death in a fool 
        who is affected by the painful states called ageing and death, or which 
        are not so bound up in one who is affected by some painful state or 
        other; therefore this birth is a condition for ageing and death and also 
        for sorrow and so on. But it is a condition in one way, as 
        decisive-support type.<BR>&nbsp; This is the detailed explanation of the 
        clause 'With becoming as condition, birth'.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

        <I>"Though feeling is condition"</I> is said in order to prevent a 
        generalization from the preceding words "With feeling as condition" to 
        the effect that craving arises in the presence of every condition 
        accompanied by feeling. - But is it not impossible to prevent 
        over-generalization in the absence of any such statements as "Feeling 
        accompanied by inherent tendency is a condition for craving"? - No; for 
        we are dealing with an exposition of the round of rebirths. Since there 
        is no round of rebirths without inherent tendencies, so far as the 
        meaning is concerned it may be taken for granted that the condition is 
        accompanied by inherent tendency. Or alternatively it may be recognized 
        that this condition is accompanied by inherent tendency because it 
        follows upon the words "With ignorance as condition". And with the words 
        "With feeling as condition, craving" the ruling needed is this, "There 
        is craving only with feeling as condition," and not "with feeling as 
        condition there is only craving"' (Pm.). For inherent tendencies see 
        Ch.XXII &sect;45, 60; M.Sutta 64. The Arahant has none.<BR><BR><A
