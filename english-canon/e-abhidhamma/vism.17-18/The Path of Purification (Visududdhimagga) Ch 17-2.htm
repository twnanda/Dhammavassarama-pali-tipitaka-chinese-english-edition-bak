        Preamble]<BR><BR></FONT></DIV><FONT size=+1>25. &nbsp; Now in teaching 
        this dependent origination the Blessed One has set forth the text in the 
        way beginning 'With ignorance as condition there are formations' 
        (S.ii,20). Its meaning should be commented on by one who keeps within 
        the circle of the Vibhajjavadins, <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/5fn" name=5txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B1.html#5fn">{5}</A> who does not 
        misrepresent the teachers, who does not advertise his own standpoint, 
        who does not quarrel with the standpoint of others, who does not distort 
        suttas, who is in agreement with the Vinaya, who looks to the Principal 
        Authorities (<I>Mahapadesa</I> - D.ii,123ff.), who illustrates the law 
        <I>(dhamma),</I> who takes up the meaning <I>(attha),</I> repeatedly 
        reverting to that same meaning, describing it in various ways. <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/6fn" name=6txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B1.html#6fn">{6}</A> &nbsp; And it 
        is inherently difficult to comment on the dependent origination, as the 
        Ancients said:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The truth, a 
        being, a rebirth-linking,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And 
        the structure of conditions,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        'Are four things very hard to see<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And likewise difficult to teach'.<BR>Therefore, 
        considering that to comment on the dependent origination is impossible 
        except for those who are expert in the texts,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst I would now begin the 
        comment<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the structure of 
        conditions,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find no footing 
        for support<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And seem to founder 
        in a sea. [523]<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However many 
        mode of teaching<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Graces the 
        Dispensation here,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And still 
        the former Teachers' way<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is 
        handed down unbrokenly,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Therefore on both of these relying<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For my support, I now begin<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its meaning to elucidate:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listen therefore attentively;<BR>26. &nbsp; For this 
        has been said by the former teachers:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp; 'Whoever learns alertly this 
        [discourse]<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will go from 
        excellence to excellence,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And 
        when perfected, he will then escape<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond the vision of the King of 
        Death'.<BR><BR></FONT>

        Brief Exposition]<BR><BR></FONT></DIV><FONT size=+1>27. &nbsp; So as 
        regards the passages that begin: 'With ignorance as condition there are 
        formations' (S.ii,20), to start with,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) As different ways of teaching, (2) 
        meaning,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Character, (4) 
        singlefold and so on,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) As to 
        defining of the factors,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        exposition should be known.<BR>28. &nbsp; 1. Herein, <I>as different 
        ways of teaching:</I> the Blessed One's teaching of the dependent 
        origination is fourfold, namely, (i) from the beginning, (ii) from the 
        middle, up to the end; and (iii) from the end, or (iv) from the middle, 
        down to the beginning. It is like four creeper-gatherers' ways of 
        seizing a creeper.<BR>29. &nbsp; For just as one of four men gathering 
        creepers sees only the root of the creeper first, and after cutting it 
        at the root, he pulls it all out and takes it away and uses it, so the 
        Blessed One teaches the dependent origination from the beginning up to 
        the end thus 'So, bhikkhus, with ignorance as condition there are 
        formations; ... with birth as condition ageing and death' 
        (M.i.261).<BR>30. &nbsp; (ii) Just as another of the four men sees the 
        middle of the creeper first, and after cutting it in the middle, he 
        pulls out only the upper part and takes it away and uses it, so the 
        Blessed One teaches it from the middle up to the end thus 'When he is 
        delighted with, welcomes, remains committed to, that feeling, then 
        delight arises in him. Delight in feelings is clinging. With his 
        clinging as condition there is becoming; with becoming as condition, 
        birth' (M.i,266).<BR>31. &nbsp; (iii) Just as another of the four men 
        sees the tip of the creeper first, and seizing the tip, he follows it 
        down to the root and takes all of it away and uses it, so the Blessed 
        One teaches it from the end down to the beginning thus '"With birth as 
        condition, ageing-and-death", so it was said. But is there 
        ageing-and-death with birth as condition, or not, or how is it here? - 
        There is ageing-and-death with birth as condition, so we think, 
        venerable sir. [524] "With becoming as condition, birth", so it was said 
        ... With ignorance as condition there are formations", so it was said. 
        But are there formations with ignorance as condition, or not, or how is 
        it here? - There are formations with ignorance as condition, so we 
        think, venerable sir' (M.i,261).<BR>32. &nbsp; (iv) Just as one of the 
        four men sees only the middle of the creeper first, and after cutting it 
        in the middle and tracing it down as far as the root, he takes it away 
        and uses it, so the Blessed One teaches it from the middle down to the 
        beginning thus 'And these four nutriments, bhikkhus: what is their 
        source? What is their origin? From what are they born? By what are they 
        produced? These four nutriments have craving as their source, craving as 
        their origin, they are born from craving, produce by craving. Craving: 
        what is its source? ... Feeling: ... Contact: ... The sixfold base: ... 
        Mentality-materiality: ... Consciousness: ... Formations: what is their 
        source? ... By what are they produced? Formations have ignorance as 
        their source ... they are produced by ignorance' (S.ii,11f.).<BR>33. 
        &nbsp; Why does he teach it thus? Because the dependent origination is 
        wholly beneficial and because he has himself acquired elegance in 
        instructing. For the dependent origination is entirely beneficial: 
        starting from any one of the four starting points, it leads only to the 
        penetration of the proper way. And the Blessed One has acquired elegance 
        in instructing: it is because he has done so through possession of the 
        four kinds of perfect confidence and the four discriminations and by 
        achieving the fourfold profundity (&sect;304) that he teaches the Law by 
        various methods.<BR>34. &nbsp; But it should be recognized, in 
        particular, that (i) when he sees that people susceptible of teaching 
        are confused about the analysis of the causes of the process [of 
        becoming], he employs his teaching of it forwards starting from the 
        beginning in order to show that the process carries on according to its 
        own peculiar Laws and for the purpose of showing the order of arising. 
        (iii) And it should be recognized that when he surveys the world as 
        fallen upon trouble in the way stated thus 'This world has fallen upon 
        trouble; it is born, ages, dies, passes away and reappears (S.ii,10), he 
        employs his teaching of it backwards starting from the end in order to 
        show the [laws governing the] various kinds of suffering beginning with 
        ageing and death, which he discovered himself in the early stage of his 
        penetration. And (iv) it should be recognized that he employs his 
        teaching of it backwards from the middle down to the beginning in order 
        to show how the succession of cause and fruit extends back into the past 
        [existence], and again forwards from the past, in accordance with his 
        definition of nutriment as the source [of ignorance] (see M.i,47f.). And 
        (ii) it should be recognized that he employs his teaching of it forwards 
        from the middle up to the end in order to show how the future 
        [existence] follows on [through rebirth] from arousing in the present 
        causes for [rebirth] in the future.<BR>35. &nbsp; Of these methods of 
        presentation, that cited here should be understood to be that stated in 
        forward order starting from the beginning in order to show to people 
        susceptible of teaching who are confused about the laws of the process 
        [of becoming] that the process carries on according to its own peculiar 
        laws, [525] and for the purpose of showing the order of arising.<BR>36. 
        &nbsp; But why is ignorance stated as the beginning here? How then, is 
        ignorance the causeless root-cause of the world like the Primordial 
        Essence of those who assert the existence of a Primordial Essence? It is 
        not causeless. For a cause of ignorance is stated thus 'With the arising 
        of cankers there is the arising of ignorance' (M.i,54). But there is a 
        figurative way in which it can be treated as the root cause. What 
        way<BR>37. is that? When it is made to serve as a starting point in an 
        exposition of the round [of becoming]. For the Blessed One gives the 
        exposition of the round with one of two things as the starting point: 
        either ignorance, according as it was said 'No first beginning of 
        ignorance is made known, bhikkhus, before which there was no ignorance, 
        and after which there came to be ignorance. And while it is said thus, 
        bhikkhus, nevertheless it is made known that ignorance has its specific 
        condition' (A.v,113), or craving for becoming, according as it is said 
        'No first beginning of craving for becoming is made known bhikkhus, 
        before which there was no craving for becoming, and after which there 
        came to be craving for becoming. And while it is said thus, bhikkhus, 
        nevertheless it is made known that craving for becoming has its specific 
        condition' (A.v.116).<BR>38. &nbsp; But why does the Blessed One give 
        the exposition of the round with those two things as starting points? 
        Because they are the outstanding causes of kamma that leads to happy and 
        unhappy destinies.<BR>39. &nbsp; Ignorance is an outstanding cause of 
        kamma that leads to unhappy destinies. Why? Because, just as when a cow 
        to be slaughtered is in the grip of torment of burning with fire and 
        belabouring with cudgels, and, being crazed with torment, she drinks the 
        hot water although it gives no satisfaction and does her harm, so the 
        ordinary man who is in the grip of ignorance performs kamma of the 
        various kinds beginning with killing living things that leads to unhappy 
        destinies although it gives no satisfaction because of the burning of 
        defilements and does him harm because it casts him into an unhappy 
        destiny.<BR>40. &nbsp; But craving for becoming is an outstanding cause 
        of kamma that leads to happy destinies. Why? Because, just as that same 
        cow, through her craving for cold water, starts drinking cold water, 
        which gives satisfaction and allays her torment, so the ordinary man in 
        the grip of craving for becoming performs kamma of the various kinds 
        beginning with abstention from killing living things that leads to happy 
        destinies and gives satisfaction because it is free from the burning of 
        defilements and, by bringing him to a happy destiny, allays the torments 
        of suffering [experienced] in the unhappy destinies.<BR>41. &nbsp; Now 
        as regards these two states that are starting points in expositions of 
        the process [of becoming], in some instances the Blessed One teaches 
        Dhamma based on a single one of these states, for instance, [526] 
        'Accordingly, bhikkhus, formations have ignorance as their cause, 
        consciousness has formations as its cause' (S.ii,31), etc., likewise 
        'Bhikkhus craving increases in one who dwells seeing enjoyment in things 
        productive of clinging; with craving as condition there is clinging' 
        (S.ii,84) and so on. In some instances he does so based on both, for 
        instance, 'So, bhikkhus, for the fool who is hindered by ignorance and 
        tethered by craving there arises this body. Now this body [with its six 
        internal bases] and externally [the six bases due to] 
        mentality-materiality make a duality. Due to this duality there is 
        contact, as well as the six [pairs of] bases, touched through which the 
        fool feels pleasure and pain' (S.ii,23-4), and so on.<BR>42. &nbsp; Of 
        these ways of presentation, that cited here in the form 'With ignorance 
        as condition there are formations' should be understood as one based on 
        a single state. This firstly is how the exposition should be known 'as 
        to different ways of teaching.'<BR>43. &nbsp; 2. <I>As to meaning:</I> 
        as to the meaning of the words 'ignorance' and so on. Bodily misconduct, 
        etc., for example, 'ought not to be found <I>(a-vindiya),</I> in the 
        sense of being unfit to be carried out; the meaning is that it should 
        not be permitted. It finds <I>(vindati)</I> what ought not to be found 
        <I>(avindiya),</I> thus it is ignorance <I>(avijja).</I> Conversely, 
        good bodily conduct, etc., ... 'ought to be found <I>(vindiya),</I> thus 
        it is ignorance <I>(avijja).</I> Also it prevents knowing 
        <I>(avidita)</I> the meaning of collection in the aggregates, the 
        meaning of actuating in the bases, the meaning of voidness in the 
        elements, the meaning of predominance in the faculties, the meaning of 
        reality in the truths, thus it is ignorance <I>(avijja).</I> Also it 
        prevents knowing the meaning of suffering, etc., described in four ways 
        as 'oppression', etc. (Ch.XVI,&sect;15), thus it is ignorance. Through all 
        the kinds of generations, destinies, becoming, stations of 
        consciousness, and abodes of beings in the endless round of rebirths it 
        drives beings on <I>(Anta-Virahite samsare ... satte J Avapeti),</I> 
        thus it is ignorance <I>(avijja).</I> Amongst women, men, etc., which 
        are in the ultimate sense non-existent, it hurries on <I>(paramatthato 
        Avi Jjamanesu itthi-purisadisu J Avati)</I> , and amongst the 
        aggregates, etc., which are existent, it does not hurry on 
        <I>(vijjamanesu pi khandhadisu na javati),</I> thus it is ignorance 
        <I>(avijja).</I> Furthermore, it is ignorance because it conceals the 
        physical bases and objects of eye-consciousness, etc., and the dependent 
        origination and dependently-originated states.<BR>44. &nbsp; That due to 
        <I>(paticca)</I> which fruit comes <I>(eti)</I> is a condition 
        <I>(paccaya).</I> 'Due to <I>(paticca)</I>' = 'not without that'; the 
        meaning is, not dispensing with it. Comes <I>(eti)</I> means both 
        'arises' and 'occurs'. Furthermore the meaning of 'condition' is the 
        meaning of 'help'. It is ignorance and that is a condition, thus it is 
        'ignorance as condition', whence the phrase <I>'with ignorance as 
        condition'.</I><BR>&nbsp; 'They form the formed' (S.iii,87), thus they 
        are formations. Furthermore, formations are twofold, namely, (a) 
        formations with ignorance as condition, and (b) formations given in the 
        texts with the word 'formations <I>(sankhara)'.</I> Herein, (a) the 
        three, namely, formations of merit, of demerit, and of the 
        imperturbable, and the three, namely, the bodily, the verbal, and the 
        mental, formations, which make six, are 'formations with ignorance as 
        condition'. And all these are simply mun- <BR>45. dane profitable and 
        unprofitable volition. But (b) these four, namely, (i) the formation 
        consisting of the formed <I>(sankhata-sankhara)</I> [527], the formation 
        consisting of the kamma-formed <I>(abhisankhata-sankhara),</I> (iii) the 
        formation consisting in the act of kamma-forming (forming by kamma - 
        <I>abhisankharana-sankhara),</I> and (iv) the formation consisting in 
        momentum <I>(payogabhisankhara),</I> are the kinds of formations that 
        have come in the texts with the word 'formations'.<BR>46. &nbsp; Herein, 
        (i) all states are impermanent' (S.i,158; D.ii,157), are <I>formations 
        consisting of the formed.</I> (ii) In the Commentaries material and 
        immaterial states of the three planes generated by kamma are called 
        <I>formations consisting of the kamma-formed.</I> These are also 
        included in the passage 'Formations are impermanent'. But there is no 
        instance in the texts where they are found separately. (iii) Profitable 
        and unprofitable volition of the three planes is called <I>the formation 
        consisting in the act of kamma-forming.</I> It is found in the texts in 
        such passages as 'Bhikkhus, this man in his ignorance forms the 
        'formation of merit' (S.ii,82). (iv) But it is bodily and mental energy 
        that is called <I>the formation consisting in momentum.</I> This is 
        given in the texts in such passages as 'The wheel, having gone as far as 
        the impetus <I>(abhisankhara)</I> carried it, stood as though it were 
        fixed' (A.i,112).<BR>47. &nbsp; And not only these, but many other kinds 
        of formations are given in the texts with the word 'formation 
        <I>(sankhara)</I>' in the way beginning 'When a bhikkhu is attaining the 
        cessation of perception and feeling, friend Visakha, first his verbal 
        formation ceases, then his bodily formation, then his mental formation' 
        (M.i,302). But there is no formation among them not included by (i) 
        'formations consisting of the formed'.<BR>48. &nbsp; What is said next 
        after this in the [rest of the exposition] beginning 'With formation as 
        condition, consciousness' should be understood in the way already 
        stated.<BR>&nbsp; But as to those words not yet dealt with: it cognizes 
        <I>(vijanati),</I> thus it is consciousness <I>(vinnana</I> - see 
        M.i,292). It bends [towards an object] <I>(namati),</I> thus it is 
        mentality <I>(nama).</I> It is molested <I>(ruppati),</I> thus it is 
        materiality <I>(rupa</I> - see S.iii,87). It provides a range for the 
        origins <I>(aye tanoti)</I> and it leads on what is actuated <I>(ayatan 
        ca nayati)</I> thus it is a base <I>(ayatana</I> - see Ch.XV&sect;4). It

        <I>(vehayati),</I> thus it is feeling <I>(vedana</I> - see M.i,293). It

        <I>(tanha).</I> It clings <I>(upadiyati),</I> thus it is clinging

        <I>(bhavayati),</I> thus it is becoming <I>(bhava).</I> The act of being 
        born is birth. The act of growing old is ageing. By means of it they 
        die, thus it is death. The act of sorrowing is sorrow. The act of 
        lamenting is lamentation. It makes [beings] suffer <I>(dukkhayati),</I> 
        thus it is pain <I>(dukkha);</I> or it consumes in two ways <I>(Dvedha 
        Khanati</I> - see Ch.IV,&sect;100) by means of [the two moments 
        <I>(khana)]</I> arising and presence, thus it is pain <I>(dukkha).</I>

        <I>(upayasa). 'There is'</I> means is generated. And the words 'There 
        is' should be construed with all the terms, not only with those 
        beginning with sorrow; for otherwise, when 'With ignorance as condition, 
        formations' was said, it would not be evident what they did, but by 
        construing it with the words 'There is' (or 'there are'), since 
        'ignorance as condition' stands for 'it is ignorance and that is a 
        condition', consequently [528] the defining of the condition and the 
        conditionally-arisen state is effected by the words 'with ignorance as 
        condtition there are formations'. And so in each instance.<BR>50. &nbsp; 
        <I>Thus</I> signifies the process described. By that he shows that it is 
        with ignorance, etc., as the causes and not with creation by an 
        Overlord, and so on. <I>Of that:</I> of that aforesaid. <I>Whole:</I> 
        unmixed, entire. <I>Mass of suffering:</I> Totality of suffering; not a 
        living being, not pleasure, beauty, and so on. <I>Arising:</I> 
        generating. <I>There is:</I> is brought about. This is how the 
        exposition should be known here 'as to meaning'.<BR>51. &nbsp; <I>As to 
        character, etc.:</I> as to the characteristics of ignorance, etc., that 
        is to say, <I>ignorance</I> has the characteristic of unknowing. Its 
        function is to confuse. It is manifested as concealing. Its proximate 
        cause is cankers. <I>Formations</I> have the characteristic of forming. 
        Their function is to accumulate. <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/7fn" name=7txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B1.html#7fn">{7}</A> They are 
        manifested as volition. Their proximate causes is ignorance. 
        <I>Consciousness</I> has the characteristic of cognizing. Its function 
        is to go before (see Dh.1). It manifests itself as rebirth linking. Its 
        proximate cause is formations; or its proximate cause is the 
        physical-basis-cum-object. <I>Mentality (nama)</I> has the 
        characteristic of bending <I>(namana).</I> Its function is to associate. 
        It is manifested as inseparability of its components, [that is, the 
        three aggregates]. Its proximate cause is consciousness. <I>Materiality 
        (rupa)</I> has the characteristic of being molested <I>(ruppana).</I> 
        Its function is to be dispersed. It is manifested as [morally] 
        indeterminate. Its proximate cause is consciousness. The sixfold base 
        <I>(salayatana)</I> has the characteristic of actuating 
        <I>(ayatana).</I> Its function is to see, and so on. It is manifested as 
        the state of physical basis and door. Its proximate cause is 
        mentality-materiality. <I>Contact</I> has the characteristic of 
        touching. Its function is impingement. It manifests itself as 
        coincidence [of internal and external base and consciousness]. Its 
        proximate cause is the sixfold base. <I>Feeling</I> has the 
        characteristic of experiencing. It function is to exploit the stimulus 
        of the objective field. It is manifested as pleasure and pain. Its 
        proximate cause is contact. <I>Craving</I> has the characteristic of 
        being a cause [that is, suffering]. Its function is to delight. It is 
        manifested as insatiability. Its proximate cause is feeling. 
        <I>Clinging</I> has the characteristic of seizing. Its function is not 
        to release. It is manifested as a strong form of craving and as [false] 
        view. Its proximate cause is craving. <I>Becoming</I> has the 
        characteristic of being kamma and kamma-result. Its function is to make 
        become and to become. It is manifested as profitable, unprofitable, and 
        indeterminate. Its proximate cause is clinging. The characteristic of 
        <I>birth,</I> etc., should be understood as stated in the Description of 
        the Truths (Ch.XVI,&sect;32f.). This is how the exposition should be known 
        here 'as to character, etc.'<BR>52. &nbsp; <I>As to singlefold, and so 
        on:</I> here <I>ignorance</I> is singlefold as unknowing, unseeing, 
        delusion, and so on. It is twofold as 'no theory' and 'wrong theory' 
        (cf.&sect;303); <A href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/8fn" name=8txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B1.html#8fn">{8}</A> likewise as 
        prompted and unprompted. It is threefold as associated with the three 
        kinds of feeling. It is fourfold as non-penetration of the four truths. 
        It is fivefold as concealing the danger in the five kinds of destinies. 
        [529] It should, however, be understood that all the immaterial factors 
        [of the Dependent Origination] have a sixfold nature with respect to the 
        [six] doors and objects.<BR>53. &nbsp; <I>Formations</I> are singlefold 
        as states subject to cankers (Dhs.,p.3), states with the nature of 
        result (Dhs.,p.1), and so on (cf.Vbh.62). <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/9fn" name=9txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17B1.html#9fn">{9}</A> They are 
        twofold as profitable and unprofitable; likewise as limited and exalted, 
        inferior and medium, with certainty of wrongness and without certainty. 
        They are threefold as the formation of merit and the rest. They are 
        fourfold as leading to the four kinds of generation. They are fivefold 
        as leading to the five kinds of destiny.<BR>54. &nbsp; 
        <I>Consciousness</I> is singlefold as mundane (Dhs.,p.3), resultant 
        (Dhs.,p.1), and so on. It is twofold as with root-cause and without 
        root-cause and so on. It is threefold as included in the three kinds of 
        becoming; as associated with the three kinds of feeling; and as having 
        no root-cause, having two root-causes, and having three root-causes. It 
        is fourfold and fivefold [respectively] according to generation and 
        destiny.<BR>55. &nbsp; <I>Mentality-materiality</I> is singlefold as 
        dependent on consciousness, and as having kamma as its condition. It is 
        twofold as having an object [in the case of mentality], and having no 
        object [in the case of materiality]. It is threefold as past, and so on. 
        It is fourfold and fivefold respectively according to generation and 
        destiny.<BR>56. &nbsp; <I>The sixfold base</I> is singlefold as the 
        place of origin and meeting. It is twofold as sensitivity of primary 
        elements and as consciousness [of the sixth base], and so on. It is 
        threefold as having for its domain [objective fields that are] 
        contiguous, non-contiguous, and neither (see Ch.XIV,&sect;46). It is fourfold 
        and fivefold respectively as included in the kinds of generation and 
        destiny.<BR>&nbsp; The singlefoldness, etc., of <I>contact,</I> etc., 
        should be understood in this way too. &nbsp; This is how the exposition 
        should be known here 'as to singlefold and so on'.<BR>57. &nbsp; 5. 
        <I>As to defining of the factors:</I> sorrow, etc., are stated here for 
        the purpose of showing that the Wheel of Becoming never halts; for they 
        are produced in the fool who is afflicted by ageing and death, according 
        as it is said 'The untaught ordinary man, bhikkhus, on being touched by 
        painful bodily feeling, sorrows, grieves and laments, beating his 
        breast, he weeps and becomes distraught' (M.iii,285; S.iv,206). And as 
        long as these go on occurring so long does ignorance, and so the Wheel 
        of Becoming renews [its revolution]: 'With ignorance as condition there 
        are formations' and so on. That is why the factors of the dependent 
        origination should be understood as twelve by taking those [that is, 
        sorrow, etc.,] along with ageing-and-death as one summarization. This is 
        how the exposition should be known here 'as to defining of the factors'. 
        <BR>58. &nbsp; This, firstly, is the brief treatment. The following 
        method however, is in detail.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
