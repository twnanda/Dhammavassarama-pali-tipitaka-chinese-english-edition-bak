        Origination]</FONT><BR><BR></DIV><FONT size=+1>1. &nbsp; [517] The turn 
        has now come for the exposition of the Dependent Origination itself, and 
        the dependently-originated states comprised by the word 'etc.', since 
        these still remain out of the states called the 'soil <I>(bhumi)'</I>, 
        of which it was said above 'The states classed as aggregates, bases, 
        elements, faculties, truths, and dependent origination, etc., are the 
        "soil"' (Ch. XIV, &sect;32).<BR>2. &nbsp; Herein, firstly it is the states 
        beginning with ignorance that should be understood as <I>dependent 
        origination.</I> For this is said by the Blessed One: 'And what is the 
        dependent origination, bhikkhus? With ignorance as condition there are 
        [volitional] formations; with formations as condition, consciousness; 
        with consciousness as condition, mentality-materiality; with 
        mentality-materiality as condition, the sixfold base; with the sixfold 
        base as condition, contact; with contact as condition, feeling; with 
        feeling as condition, craving; with craving as condition, clinging; with 
        clinging as condition, becoming; with becoming as condition, birth; with 
        birth as condition there is ageing-and-death, and sorrow, lamentation, 
        pain, grief, and despair; thus there is the arising of this whole mass 
        of suffering. This is called the dependent origination, bhikkhus' 
        (S.ii,1).<BR>3. &nbsp; Secondly it is the states beginning with 
        ageing-and-death that should be understood as <I>dependently-originated 
        states.</I> For this is said by the Blessed One: 'And what are the 
        dependently-originated states, bhikkhus? Ageing-and-death is 
        impermanent, bhikkhus, formed, dependently-originated, subject to 
        destruction, subject to fall, subject to fading away, subject to 
        cessation. <A href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17A.html#1fn" 
        name=1txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17A.html#1fn">{1}</A> &nbsp;Birth is 
        impermanent, bhikkhus, ..., Becoming ..., Clinging ... Craving ... 
        Feeling ... Contact ... Formations ... Ignorance is impermanent, 
        bhikkhus, formed, dependently originated, subject to destruction, 
        subject to fall, subject to fading away, subject to cessation. These are 
        called the dependently-originated states, bhikkhus' (S.ii,26). 
        [518]<BR>4. &nbsp; Here is a brief explanation. The states that are 
        conditions should be understood as the <I>dependent origination.</I> The 
        states generated by such and such conditions are 
        <I>dependently-originated states.</I><BR>5. &nbsp; How is that to be 
        known? By the Blessed One's word. For it is precisely those states which 
        are conditions, that with the synonyms beginning with 'reality', have 
        been called 'dependent-origination' by the Blessed One when teaching the 
        dependent origination in the Sutta on the Teaching of the Dependent 
        Origination and Dependently-originated States 
        thus:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'And what is dependent 
        origination, bhikkhus?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'With 
        birth as condition, bhikkhus, there is ageing and death. Whether Perfect 
        Ones arise or do not arise, there yet remains that element, relatedness 
        of states, regularity of states, specific conditionality. The Perfect 
        One discovers it, penetrates to it. Having discovered it, penetrated to 
        it, he announces it, teaches it makes it known, establishes, exposes, 
        expounds and explains it: "See" he says; "with birth as condition there 
        is ageing and death".<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'With 
        becoming as condition, bhikkhus, there is birth 
        ...<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '...<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'With ignorance as condition, bhikkhus, there are 
        formations. Whether Perfect Ones arise or do not arise, there yet 
        remains that element, relatedness of states, regularity of states, 
        specific conditionality. The Perfect One discovers it, penetrates to it. 
        Having discovered it, penetrated to it, he announces it, teaches it, 
        makes it known, establishes, exposes, expounds and explains it: "See" he 
        says; "with ignorance as condition there are 
        formations".<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'So, bhikkhus, 
        that herein which is reality, not unreality, not otherness, specific 
        conditionality: that is called dependent origination' 
        (S.ii,25f.).<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently it should be understood 
        that dependent origination has the characteristic of being the 
        conditions for the states beginning with ageing-and-death. Its function 
        is to continue [the process of] suffering. It is manifested as the Wrong 
        Path.<BR>6. &nbsp;Because the particular states are produced by 
        particular conditions, neither less nor more, it is called 
        <I>'reality</I> (suchness)'. Because once the conditions have met in 
        combination there is no non-producing, even for an instant, of the 
        states they generate, it is called <I>'not unreality</I> (not 
        unsuchness)'. Because there is no arising of one state with another 
        state's conditions it is called <I>'not otherness'.</I> Because there is 
        a condition, or because there is a total of conditions, for these states 
        beginning with ageing-and-death as already stated it is called 
        <I>specific conditionality.</I><BR>7. &nbsp; Here is the word meaning: 
        <I>idappaccaya</I> (lit. that conditions) = <I>imesam paccaya</I> 
        (conditions for those); <I>idappaccaya</I> (that-conditions) = 
        <I>idappaccayata</I> (that-conditionality, conditionality for those, 
        specific conditionality). Or alternatively, <I>ida-ppaccaya-ta</I> 
        (that-conditionality) = <I>ida-ppaccayanam samuho</I> (the total of 
        that-conditions, total specific conditionality).<BR>8. &nbsp; The 
        characteristic must be sought from grammar. Some, in fact, [say that the 
        expression <I>paticcasamuppada</I> (dependent origination) is 
        characterized thus:] 'having depended <I>(paticca)</I> a right 
        <I>(samma)</I> arising <I>(uppada),</I> [depending on causes rightly by] 
        disregarding such causes conjectured by sectarians as the Primordial 
        Essence <I>(Prakrti),</I> World Soul <I>(Purusa),</I> and so on'. So 
        what they call dependent origination <I>(paticca-samuppada)</I> is a 
        simple arising <I>(uppada)</I> [for they equate the prefix <I>sam</I> 
        only with <I>samma</I> (rightly) and ignore <I>sam</I> (with, con-)]. 
        That is untenable. [519] Why? (1) there is no such sutta; (2) it 
        contradicts suttas; (3) it admits of no profound treatment; and (4) it 
        is ungrammatical.<BR>9. &nbsp; (1) No sutta describes the dependent 
        origination as simple arising.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (2) Anyone who 
        asserts that dependent origination is of that kind involves himself in 
        conflict with the Padesavihara Sutta. How? The Newly Enlightened One's 
        Abiding <I>(vihara)</I> is the bringing of the dependent origination to 
        mind, because of these words of the Blessed One's: 'Then in the first 
        watch of the night the Blessed One brought to mind the dependent 
        origination in direct and reverse order' [as origination and cessation] 
        (Vin.i,1; Ud.2). Now <I>'Padesa-vihara'</I> is the abiding 
        <I>(vihara)</I> in one part <I>(desa)</I> of that, according as it is 
        said, 'Bhikkhus, I abode in a part of the abiding in which I abode when 
        I was newly enlightened' (S.v,12; Ps.i,107) and there he abode in the 
        vision of structure of conditions, not in the vision of simple arising, 
        according as it is said, 'So I understood feeling with wrong view as its 
        condition, and feeling with right view as its condition, and feeling 
        with wrong thinking as its condition...' (S.v,12), all of which should 
        be quoted in full. So anyone who asserts that dependent origination is 
        simple arising involves himself in conflict with the Padesavihara 
        Sutta.<BR>10. &nbsp; There is likewise contradiction of the Kaccana 
        Sutta. For in the Kaccana Sutta it is said 'When a man sees correctly 
        with right understanding the origination of the world, Kaccana, he does 
        not say of the world that it is not' (S.ii,17). And there it is the 
        dependent origination in forward order, not simple arising, that, as the 
        origination of the world from its conditions, is set forth in order to 
        eliminate the annihilation view. For the annihhilation view is not 
        eliminated by seeing simple arising; but it is eliminated by seeing the 
        chain of conditions. So anyone who asserts that the dependent 
        origination is simple arising involves himself in contradiction of the 
        Kaccana Sutta.<BR>11. &nbsp; (3) <I>It admits of no profound 
        treatment:</I> this has been said by the Blessed One, 'This dependent 
        origination is profound, Ananda, and profound it appears' (D.ii,55; 
        S.ii,92). And the profundity is fourfold as we shall explain below 
        (Ch.XVII,&sect;309); but there is no [need of] any such tetrad of methods in 
        simple arising. So dependent origination is not simple arising, since 
        that admits of no profound treatment.<BR>12. &nbsp; (4) <I>It is 
        ungrammatical:</I> [520] this word <I>paticca</I> (lit. 'having 
        depended'; freely 'due to', 'dependent') [being a gerund of the verb 
        <I>pati + eti</I> to go back to,] establishes a meaning [in a formula of 
        establishment by verb] when it is construed as past with the same 
        subject [as that of the principal verb], as in the sentence 'Having 
        depended on <I>(paticca</I> ='due to') the eye and visible objects, eye 
        consciousness arises <I>(uppajjati)'</I> (S.ii,72). But if it is 
        construed here with the word <I>uppada</I> (arising), [which is a noun,] 
        in a formula of establishment by noun, there is a breach of grammar, 
        because there is no shared subject [as there is in the above-quoted 
        sentence], and so it does not establish any meaning at all. So the 
        dependent origination is not simple arising because that is 
        ungrammatical.<BR>13. &nbsp; Here it might be [argued]: 'We shall add 
        the words "comes to be <I>(hoti)"</I> thus: "Having depended, arising 
        comes to be <I>(paticca, samuppado hoti)"'.</I> That will not do. Why 
        not? Because there is no instance in which it has been added, and 
        because the fallacy of the arising of an arising follows. For in such 
        passages as <I>Paticcasamuppadam vo bhikkhave desissami. Katamo ca 
        bhikkhave paticcasamuppado ... Ayam vuccati bhikkhave 
        paticcasamuppado</I> (I shall teach you the dependent origination, 
        bhikkhus. And what is the dependent origination? ... This is called the 
        dependent origination, bhikkhus' (S.ii,1) the words 'comes to be 
        <I>(hoti)'</I> are not added in any single instance. And there is no 
        [such expression as] arising comes to be': if there were, it would be 
        tantamount to saying that arising itself had an arising too.<BR>14. 
        &nbsp; And those are wrong who imagine that specific conditionality 
        <I>(idappaccayata)</I> is the specific conditions' [abstract] essence - 
        what is called 'abstract essence' being a [particular] mode in 
        ignorance, etc., that acts as cause in the manifestation of formations, 
        etc. - and that the term 'dependent origination' is used for an 
        alteration in formations when there is that [particular mode in the way 
        of occurrence of ignorance]. Why are they wrong? Because it is 
        ignorance, etc., themselves that are called causes. For in the following 
        passage it is ignorance, etc., themselves, not their alteration, that 
        are called the causes [of these states]. 'Therefore, Ananda, just this 
        is the cause, this is the source, this is the origin, this is the 
        condition, for ageing-and-death, that is to say, birth ... for 
        formations, that is to say, (ignorance)' (D.ii,57-63 - the last clause 
        is not in the D. text). Therefore it is the actual states themselves as 
        conditions that should be understood as 'dependent origination'. So what 
        was said above (&sect;4) can be understood as rightly said.<BR>15. &nbsp; If 
        any notion arises in the guise of a literal interpretation of the term 
        'dependent origination <I>(paticcasamuppada)'</I> to the effect that it 
        is only arising that is stated, it should be got rid of by apprehending 
        the meaning of this expression in the following way. For 
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In double 
        form this term relates to a totality of states<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Produced from a 
        conditionality;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence the conditions for that sum through metaphor's 
        device have come<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To bear their fruit's name figuratively in the 
        Blessed One's exposition.<BR>16. &nbsp; This term 'dependent 
        origination', when applied to the total of states produced from the 
        [total] conditionality, must be taken in two ways. [521] For that 
        [total] ought to be arrived at <I>(paticco</I> - adj.), <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17A.html#2fn" name=2txt></A><A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17A.html#2fn">{2}</A> since when it 
        is arrived at <I>(patiyamana),</I> it leads to [supramundane] welfare 
        and bliss and so the wise [regard] it as worthy to be arrived at 
        <I>(paccetum);</I> and then, when it arises <I>(uppajjamano),</I> it 
        does so 'together with <I>(saha)'</I> and 'rightly <I>(samma),'</I> not 
        singly or causelessly, thus it is a co-arising <I>(samuppado).</I> 
        Consequently: it is to be arrived at <I>(paticco)</I> and it is a 
        co-arising <I>(samuppado),</I> thus it is dependent-origination 
        <I>(paticca-samuppada).</I> Again: it arises as a togetherness 
        <I>(saha),</I> thus it is a co-arising <I>(samuppada);</I> but it does 
        so having depended <I>(paticca</I> - ger.) in combination with 
        conditions, not regardless of them. Consequently: it, having depended 
        <I>(paticca),</I> is a co-arising <I>(samuppada),</I> thus in this way 
        also it is dependent origination <I>(paticcasamuppada).</I> And the 
        total of causes is a condition for that [total of states produced from 
        the conditionality] so, because it is a condition for that, this [total 
        of causes] is called, 'dependent origination', using for it the term 
        ordinarily used for its fruit just as in the world molasses, which is a 
        condition for phlegm, is spoken of thus 'Molasses is phlegm', or just as 
        in the Dispensation the arising of Buddhas, which is a condition for 
        bliss, is spoken of thus 'The arising of Buddhas is bliss' 
        (Dh.194).<BR>17. &nbsp; Or alternatively,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sum of causes too they call 
        'Facing its counterpart' so all<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is in that sense 'dependent', as they 
        tell;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This 
        sum of causes too, as stated, gives fruits that rise 
        associated,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        So 'co-arising' it is called as well.<BR>18. &nbsp; This total of causes 
        - indicated severally under the heading of each cause, beginning with 
        ignorance - for the manifestation of formations, etc., is called 
        'dependent <I>(paticco</I> - adj.)', taking it as 'facing, gone to, its 
        counterpart <I>(patimukham ito)'</I> owing to the mutual interdependence 
        of the factors in the combination, in the sense both that they produce 
        common fruit and that none can be dispensed with. And it is called a 
        'co-arising <I>(samuppado)'</I> since it causes the states that occur in 
        unresolved mutual interdependence to arise associatedly. Consequently: 
        It is dependent <I>(paticco)</I> and a co-arising <I>(samuppado),</I> 
        thus in this way also it is dependent origination 
        <I>(paticca-samuppada).</I><BR>19. &nbsp; Another 
        method:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This 
        total conditionality, acting interdependently,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arouses states together 
        equally;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So 
        this too is a reason here wherefor the Greatest Sage, the 
        Seer,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gave 
        to this term its form thus succinctly.<BR>20. &nbsp; Among the 
        conditions described under the headings of ignorance, etc., the 
        respective conditions that make the [conditionally-arisen] states 
        beginning with formations arise are incapable of making them arise when 
        not mutually dependent and when deficient. Therefore this conditionality 
        by depending <I>(paticca</I> - ger.) makes states arise 
        <I>(uppadeti)</I> equally and together <I>(samam saha ca),</I> not 
        piecemeal and successively - so it has been termed here thus by the Sage 
        who is skilled in phraseology that conforms to its meaning: it has been 
        accurately termed 'dependent origination <I>(paticcasamuppada)'</I> is 
        the meaning.<BR>21. &nbsp; And while so termed,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first component will deny the 
        false view of eternity<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so on, the second will 
        prevent<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
        nihilistic type of view and others like it, while the 
        two<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Together 
        show the true way that is meant.<BR>22. &nbsp; <I>The first:</I> the 
        word 'dependent <I>(paticca)'</I> indicates the combination of the 
        conditions, [522] since states in the process of occurring exist in 
        dependence on the combining of their conditions: and it shows that they 
        are not eternal, etc., thus denying the various doctrines of Eternalism, 
        No-cause, Fictitious-cause, and Power-wielder. <A 
        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17A.html#3fn" name=3txt></A><A

        and it shows how to prevent annihilationishm, etc., thus preventing the 
        various doctrines of Annihiliation [of a Soul], Nihilism, ['there is no 
        use in giving' etc.;] and Moral-inefficacy-of-action, ['there is no 
        other world', etc.;] for when states [are seen to] arise again and 
        again, each conditioned by its predecessor, how can the doctrines of 
        Annihilationishm, Nihilism, and Moral-inefficacy-of-action, be

        any given combination of conditions, the whole expression 'dependent

        which rejects the doctrines 'He who acts is he who reaps' and 'One acts 
        while another reaps' (S.ii,20), and which is the proper way described 
        thus 'Not insisting on local language 'and not overriding normal usage'

        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17A.html#3txt">{3}</A> The doctrine 
        of Eternalism is that beginning "The world is self and eternal" 
        (D.i,14). That of No-cause is that beginning "There is no cause, there 
        is no condition, for the defilement of beings" (D.i,53). That of 
        Fictitious-cause holds that the world's occcurrence is due to Primordial 
        Essence <I>(prakrti),</I> atoms <I>(anu),</I> time <I>(kala),</I> and so 
        on. That of a Power-wielder asserts the existence of an Overlord 
        <I>(issara),</I> or of a World-soul <I>(purusa),</I> or of Pajapati (The 
        Lord of the Race). Also the doctrines of Nature (<I> sabhava Skr. 
        svabhava</I> = Individual Essence). Fate <I>(niyati),</I> and Chance 
        <I>(yadiccha),</I> should be regarded as included here under the 
        doctrine of No-cause. Some, however, say that the doctrine of 
        Fictitious-cause is that beginning with "The eye is the cause of the 
        eye", and that the doctrine of the Power-wielder is that beginning 
        "Things occur owing to their own individual essence" (see Ch.XVI.note 
        23) (Pm.557).<BR><BR><A

        href="http://www.dhammastudy.com/Vsm17A.html#4txt">{4}</A> 'Such terms 
        as "woman", "man", etc., are <I>"local forms of speech 
        (janapada-nirutti)"</I> because even wise men, instead of saying "Fetch 
        the five aggregates", or "Let the mentality-materiality come," use the 
        current forms "woman" and "man". This is how, in those who have not 
        fully understood what a physical basis is, there comes to be the 
        insistence (misinterpretation) "This is really a woman, this is really a 
        man". But since this is a mere concept, which depends on states made to 
        occur in such and such wise, one who sees and knows the dependent 
        origination does not insist on (misinterpret) it as the ultimate 
        meaning. <I>"Current speech"</I> is speech current in the world. <I>"Not 
        overriding"</I> is not going beyond. For when "a being" is said, instead 
        of making an analysis like this "What is the [lasting] being here? Is it 
        materiality? or feeling?" and so on, one who does not override current 
        usage should express a wordly meaning in ordinary language as those in 
        the world do, employing usage current in the world' (Pm.557-8). The 
        explanation differs somewhat from the Majhima Sutta 
        (no.138).<BR><BR></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
