<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Chapter 11</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>(Tape 24 / Ps: 1-83)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Today we come to
chapter 11. In this chapter two kinds of meditation are treated. Iím afraid
that the first one may not be popular with people in the West. It is the
perception of repulsiveness in nutriment. We must understand that this
meditation is not for not eating, not for refraining from eating. It is for
eating without greed, for eating with non-attachment. Whether you are a lay
person or a monk you have to eat enough to keep you healthy, to keep you in
good shape. So this is for eating without attachment. In order to get rid of
attachment we have to get the perception of repulsiveness in food. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>This book is meant
for monks. So monks have to practice restraint in all areas. So with regard to
eating too there should be restraint. Especially in the teachings of Therav»da
Buddhism what we eat is not so important as how we eat. The way that we eat is
much more important than what we eat. When we eat we try to arouse this
perception of repulsiveness in food so that we do not get too much attached to
food.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Now comes the
description of the development of the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment.
Actually I think we should translate this word as food although the P»ƒi word
ë»h»raí can mean nutriment as well as food. According to Abhidhamma ë»h»raí
means nutriment. In popular usage the word ë»h»raí means food, so repulsiveness
in food.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìNow comes the
description of the development of the perception of repulsiveness in food,
which was listed as the ëOne Perceptioní next to Immaterial States.î Then the
author defines the P»ƒi word ë»h»raí. It nourishes, literally it brings on,
thus it is nutriment (food).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThat is of four
kinds as physical nutriment, nutriment consisting of contact, nutriment
consisting of mental volition and nutriment consisting of consciousness.î These
four things are called by the name of »h»ra in P»ƒi, by the name of nutriment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The first one is
physical nutriment. In fact it is not a direct translation of the P»ƒi word.
The P»ƒi word is ëkabali~k»raí. You will find the word in footnote 2. So it is
kabalali~k»ra »h»ra. In the word ëkabalali~k»raí there is the word ëkabalaí.
ëKabalaí means a handful. We do not say a mouthful, but we say a handful
because we eat with our hands. When we monks eat, we pick up the food with our
hands, make it into a ball and put it into the mouth. This handful is called a
ëkabalaí in P»ƒi. The word ëkabalali~k»raí came to mean food in general. It is
translated as physical nutriment here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>According to
Abhidhamma that which is »h»ra is not the whole food itself, but the oja
(nutritive essence) that is contained in the food. That is what is called
ë»h»raí in Abhidhamma. Although physical nutriment or the P»ƒi word
ëkabalali~k»r»h»raí is stated, we must understand that it means the nutritive
essence in the food. The first »h»ra is food.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Nutriment
consisting of contact - contact is also called food. Contact is a mental
factor. That is also called food.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The next is mental
volition. So volition is called food. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The last one is
consciousness. In one of the Suttas Buddha said there are four kinds of food
and these are mentioned. They are called food because they nourish something.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then the question
is: Which nourishes what? I think the first line in paragraph 2 should say like
that. ìBut which nourishes what?î, simply that. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìPhysical nutriment
(kabali~k»r»h»ra) nourishes (brings on) the materiality of the octad that has
nutritive essence as eighth.î You need some Abhidhamma to understand this.
There are material particles, or material qualities, or material properties.
There are said to be 28. These material properties arise in groups. Some groups
have eight material properties, some have nine, some have ten, some have eleven
and so on. The least number of material properties contained in a group is
eight. It is said according to Abhidhamma that we may find these eight<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>material properties anywhere, in living
beings or in outside things. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Here the eighth is
said to be ìmaterial of the octad that has nutritive essence as the eighth.î Do
you remember the eight material qualities? The four primaries, color, smell,
taste and this one »h»ra or oja. These are said to be found everywhere, where
there is matter or material properties. These eight are the result of or, or
are caused by sometimes kamma, sometimes citta (consciousness), sometimes utu
(temperature or climate), and sometimes »h»ra (nutriment). Here that caused by
nutriment is needed. The kabali~k»r»h»ra brings on or nourishes the eight
material properties which are cause by it (»h»ra). That is why it is called
nutritive essence or physical nutriment in P»ƒi language.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The second one,
contact as nutriment, nourishes the three kinds of feeling. When there is
contact, there is feeling. In the twelve links of Dependent Origination feeling
is conditioned by what? By contact. So contact is said to nourish or bring the
three kinds of feeling - pleasant feeling, unpleasant feeling and neutral
feeling. If there were no contact, there would be no feeling. So contact is
said to be the condition of feeling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìMental volition as
nutriment nourishes (brings on) rebirth-linking in the three kinds of
becoming.î ëMental volitioní means cetan». Actually ëmental volitioní means
kamma or sa~kh»ra in Dependent Origination, the second link (kamma formations).
Mental volition is kamma formations. What does it bring? It brings pa‘isandhi
(rebirth-linking) in the three kinds of becoming. (That is sensuous becoming,
fine material becoming and immaterial becoming.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìConsciousness as
nutriment nourishes (brings on) mentality-materiality at the moment of
rebirth-linking.î This also is to be understood with reference to Dependent
Origination. Consciousness conditions mentality-materiality or mind and matter.
At the moment of rebirth there is rebirth consciousness. Together with rebirth
consciousness there are mental factors and also there are material properties
caused by kamma in the past. What we call ërebirthí is rebirth consciousness,
its concomitants and kamma-born matter. Consciousness or here actually rebirth
consciousness nourishes or is the condition for mind and matter. ëMind and
matterí here means the mental factors and the material properties. So it is
called ë»h»raí or in English nutriment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìNow when there is
physical nutriment there is attachment, which brings peril.î That means the
danger in physical nutriment is attachment. We are attached to food. When we
eat food, we get attachment. So the danger in physical nutriment is attachment.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìWhen there is
nutriment as contact there is approaching (coming together) and that brings
peril (or that is the danger).î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìWhen there is
nutriment as mental volition there is reappearance which brings peril.î
ëReappearanceí means rebirth in different existences which brings peril.
Rebirth is the danger in mental volition because it brings about rebirth. And
when there is nutriment as consciousness there is rebirth-linking. That means
mental volition gives rebirth. It is something like throwing down something.
That is the function of mental volition. The rebirth consciousness itself is
the danger in consciousness. So rebirth-linking is the danger in consciousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAnd to show how
they bring fear thus, physical nutriment should be illustrated by the simile of
the childís flesh (S.2,98).î That is Kindred Sayings, Volume 2, page 68 and
following pages. In that Sutta the Buddha said that food should be regarded as
though one were eating the flesh of oneís own child. Contact should be regarded
as a hideless cow. Mental volition should regarded as a pit of live coals. And
consciousness should be regarded as a hundred spears. You have to read that
Sutta to understand this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The first one is
explained by a story, not an actual story, but a simile. Two people, a husband
and wife, with a child go on a journey. They were going through a desert and
lost everything. They were thirsty. They were hungry. So they decided to eat
the flesh of their child just to get out of that wilderness. If they eat the
flesh of the child, they will not feel happy. They may eat with tears and so
on. In the same way food should be eaten with that kind of perception, as
though you were eating the flesh of your own child. When you have to eat the
flesh of your own child, there will be no attachment to that food. It is
something like that. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Contact as
nutriment is shown by the simile of the hideless cow. A cow whose skin or hide
has been taken off will be bitten by flies, mosquitoes and so on where ever it
goes. Even if it goes into water there are those who will bite or sting it. In
the same way where there is contact, there is always feeling. Feeling always
accompanies contact. Feeling is compared to the biting of insects and so on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Unpleasant feeling?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Unpleasant feeling, thatís right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>And volition is
compared to the simile of the pit of live coals. Nobody wants to fall into the
pit of live coals. It brings suffering. In the same way mental volition throws
us into a new existence. When we are reborn in a new existence we suffer the
dukkha inherent in that life. So mental volition is to be regarded as a pit of
live coals. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The last one,
consciousness as nutriment, is compared to the simile of the hundred spears. A
thief is caught and sentenced to be executed. He is carried through the street
and given a hundred blows here and a hundred blows there and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Out of these four
kinds of nutriment or what is called ënutrimentí only one will be treated only
the first one is relevant in this chapter or for this meditation. In the
footnote the explanations are given and I hope that you have read it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>About the middle of footnote 4 ëapproachingí is explained as ìmeeting,
coinciding, <u>with unabandoned perversions </u>[of perception] due to an
object [being perceived as permanent, etc., when it is not].î I think that is a
little incorrect. What is meant is that the ëapproachingí is meeting,
coinciding or coming into contact, not with unabandoned perversions, but for
those whose perversions are as yet unabandoned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††
</span>He misunderstood the P»ƒi compound word here. It is very difficult to
decide what P»ƒi compounds mean. The same word may mean two different things.
Here what is really meant is ìfor those whose perversions as of yet are
unabounded meeting with an object.î That meeting with an object is perilous
since it is not free from the three kinds of suffering. When there is meeting
with the object, there is contact and feeling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ìBut of these four kinds of nutriment it is only physical nutriment,
classed as what is eaten, drunk, chewed and tasted that is intended here as
ënutrimentí in this sense.î So food is intended as nutriment or as »h»ra in
this chapter. ìThe perception arisen as the apprehension of the repulsive
aspect in that nutriment is ëperception of repulsiveness in nutriment.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ìOne who wants to develop that perception of repulsiveness in nutriment
should learn the meditation subjectî and all these things. We should develop or
arouse the perception of repulsiveness in ten ways. It is for monks. The ten
ways are going for food, seeking food, ëusingí which means eating food,
secretions, receptacle, what is undigested, what is digested, result or fruit,
outflow and smearing. All these are designed to help us get the sense of
repulsiveness towards food.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>Nowadays people say<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>ìPlease enjoy
food. Please enjoy food.î Here we donít enjoy. If we eat, we eat with this kind
of reflection, so that we donít get attached to food. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>The first one is going. A monk has to go out every day for alms in the
morning. So this passage is for monks. ìEven when a man has gone forth in so
mighty a dispensation, still after he has perhaps spent all night reciting the
Enlightened Oneís word or doing the asceticís work (That means meditation.),
after he has risen early to do the duties connected with the shrine terrace and
the Enlightenment Tree terrace, set out water for drinking and washing, to
sweep the grounds and to see to the needs of the body, after he has sat down on
his seat and given attention to his meditation subject twenty or thirty timesî
- twenty or thirty times is not so clear. I think also the Sub-Commentary did
not know exactly what is meant because you will see that in the footnote
different opinions are given.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ìHere some say that the definition of the number of times is according
to what is present-by-continuity.î That means one continuity after another.
When you enter a cell from light, at first you cannot see clearly because you
come from light into darkness. After some seconds or minutes you can see. This
is called ëone continuityí. If you go out from the dark into the light, the
same thing will happen. You will not see clearly as you go out. You have to
adapt to the difference of light. In this way the time should be taken as one
continuity after another. That is the opinion of some.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ìBut others say that it is by way of ëwarming the seatí. If you sit for
some time, the seat becomes warm. ìFor development that has not reached
suppression of the hindrances does not remove the bodily discomfort in the act
of sitting, because of the lack of pervading happiness.î Before you get good
concentration, you will still want to move or want to change your position
every now and then. One heating up of the position is what is meant by time
here. That is what the authors say.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>What about twenty or thirty? ìThen ëtwenty or thirtyí is taken as the
number already observed by the time of setting out on the alms round.î In fact
it means taken as a number by the formerly noted time of setting up. I will set
out for alms at such a time. That is decided beforehand. According modern times
let us say I will go out at 6:30am. Until 6:30am I will be practicing
meditation. It is something like that. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'>Student: Venerable Buddhaghosa
preferred the last one? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'>Teacher: No. Another one will
come.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ìOr alternatively from ëgoingí up to ësmearingí is one turn (one time).î
There are ten reflections to be made. From the first reflection to the tenth
reflection you get one round, one turn, one time. That means the monk
contemplating in these ten ways twenty or thirty times before he gets up and
goes for alms. Actually it is not clear which is meant. We can take the last
one. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'>Student: Perhaps one way to
understand it is that if the meditation subject is the breath, it is twenty or
thirty breaths?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'>Teacher: No. It could be that when
you take the breath as an object and say ìin one, out one, in two, out two, in
three, out threeî until ten and that would be one. Then again you say ìin one,
out one, in two, out twoî until ten and that would be two and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>In paragraph 7 line 3 what is a ëgeckoí?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'>Student: Geckos are little animals
that sometimes eat cockroaches and insects. They are like a lizard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'>Teacher: House lizards, right.
They are small house lizards. We donít see many of them in this country. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'>Student: Actually one time when we
had a community and we were discussing the problem of cockroaches. Someone
suggested that we obtain geckos. Thatís how I know what a gecko is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'>Teacher: paragraph 8 ìIn due
course, after standing in the debating lodgeî - I donít know whether it can be
called ëdebatingí because it is a place where a monk decides which way to go
for alms round. Footnote 11 ìin a lodge for thinking in the way beginning
ëWhere must I go for alms todayí?î Maybe there are two or three villages not
far from the monastery. He may go to one village on one day and another village
the next day. So he decides where to go or which village to go to standing in
that lodge, standing in that place. That is translated as debating lodge. He
may be debating internally which village he should go to. So he does all these
things. This is the repulsiveness of food with regard to going.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>The next one is seeking. After going to the village a monk must go from
one house to another. ìWhen he has endured the repulsiveness of going in this
way and has gone into the village, and is clothed in his cloak of patches, he
has to wander in the village streets from house to house like a beggar with a
dish in his handî and so on. It may not be so bad nowadays and also in Buddhist
countries. If not all of the people are Buddhist, some may just drive us away
if we go and stand in front of their houses. So you see in paragraph 12 ìOthers
treat him with harsh words such as ëGo away, you bald-headí.î When we were in
Sri Lanka, we did not know which houses were Buddhist and which were not. So
sometimes we stood in front of a house that was Christian or Muslim. When
Buddhists saw us, they would drag us to their house. They would say ìDonít
stand there.î They may not drag us away, but it must have happened in the olden
days when not all people were Buddhist. That is seeking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>The third is how as to using. ëHow as to usingí is how as to eating.
Sometimes to be literal may miss the real point. Here ëusing the foodí means
eating. In eating too there is repulsiveness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>India, Sri Lanka and Myanmar are troubled countries. When you have to go
from your monastery to the village on your alms rounds, you may be sweating. So
your hands may be smeared with sweat. That is why here it says ìAfter he has
sought the nutriment in this way and is sitting at ease in a comfortable place
outside the village, then so long as he has not dipped his hand into it he
would be able to invite a respected bhikkhu or a decent person, if he saw one,
[to share it;] but as soon as he has dipped his hand into it out of desire to
eat he would be ashamed to say ëTake someí.î That is because now the food is
smeared with his sweat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>This is eating. The food is put in the mouth. The jaws function as a
pestle. The teeth function as a mortar and so on. We have to contemplate on
this when we eat. I do not know whether it would be good to eat thinking of
this. You may even want to vomit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>In footnote 13 it says ìKumm»sa - jelly: usually rendered ëjunketí, but
the Vinaya Commentaries give it as made of <u>corn</u>.î Yava is not corn. It
is barley or wheat. I donít know what ëjunketí is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'>Student: Junket is a custard. So
it is a custard made out of barley or wheat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'>Teacher: Yes, barley or wheat. It
is something like rice, not necessarily jelly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>Then we have as to secretions. ìBuddhas and Pacceka Buddhas and
Wheel-turning Monarchs have <u>only</u> one of the four secretions consisting
of bile, phlegm, pus and blood.î I donít know whether that is true. ëOnlyí is
not needed here. Instead of ëonlyí I want to say ëanyí. I think we should say
ìEven Buddhas and Pacceka Buddhas and Wheel-turning Monarchs have any one of
the four secretions consisting of bile, [phlegm, pus and blood, but those with
weak merit have all four.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ìSo when [the food] has arrived at the stage of being eaten and] it
enters inside, then in one whose secretion of bile is in excess it becomes as
utterly nauseating as if smeared with thick madhuka oil.î ëMadhukaí is also
difficult to translate. It is a kind of seed which gives thick oil.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ìIn one whose secretion of phlegm is in excess it is as if smeared with
the juice of n»gabal» leaves.î Maybe you get a sticky substance from that kind
of leaf.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ìIn one whose secretion of pus is in excess it is as if smeared with
rancid buttermilk; and in one whose secretion of blood is in excess it is as
utterly nauseating as if smeared with dye. This is how repulsiveness should be
reviewed as to secretion.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>Then there is as to receptacle. ìWhen it has gone inside the belly and
is smeared with one of these secretions, then the receptacle it goes into is no
gold dish or crystal or silver dish and so on.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>Paragraph 19 as to what is undigested. ëUncookedí here means what is
undigested. We believe there is something like a fire in the stomach. That fire
or that heat digests the food.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>The next one is what is cooked, what has been digested. ìWhen it has
been completely cooked there by the bodily fires, it does not turn into gold,
silver, etc., as the ores of gold, silver, etc., do [through smelting].
Instead, giving off froth and<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>bubbles,
it turns into excrement and fills the receptacle for digested food, like brown
clay squeezed with a smoothing trowel and packed into a tube.î ëReceptacle for
digested foodí really means the later part of the intestines. ìAnd it turns
into urine and fills the bladder. This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed
as to what is cooked.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ìHow as to fruit?î That means ëHow as to resultí. ìWhen it has been
rightly cooked (That is well-digested.), it produces the various kinds of
ordure consisting of head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth and the rest. When
wrongly cooked (That means when it is not well-digested.), it produces the
hundred diseases beginning with itch, ringworm, smallpox, leprosy, plague,
consumption, coughs, flux, and so on. Such is its fruit. This is how
repulsiveness should be reviewed as to fruit.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>Then as to outflow. ìOn being swallowed, it enters by one door, after
which it flows out by several doors in the way beginning ëEye-dirt from the
eye, ear-dirt from the earí. And on being swallowed it is swallowed even in the
company of a large gathering. But on flowing out, now converted into excrement,
urine, etc., it is excreted only in solitude. That is repulsiveness as to
outflow.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>Then there is as to smearing. ìAt the time of using it he smears his
hands, lips, tongue and palate, and they become repulsive by being smeared with
it. And even when washed, they have to be washed again and again in order to
remove the smell.î That is very true. If you eat with your hands and the dishes
may be smelly, the smell will remain for a long time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ìAnd just as, when rice is being boiled, the husks, the red powder
covering the grain, etc., rise up and smear the mouth, rim and lid of the
cauldron so too, when eaten it rises up during the cooking and simmering by the
bodily fire that pervades the whole body, it turns into tartar, which smears
the teeth, and it turns into spittle, phlegm etc., which respectively smear the
tongue, palate etc., and so on.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>Towards the end of the paragraph it say ìAnd after one has washed a
certain one of these, the hand has to be washed again.î Then there is footnote
17. I think that number should be moved one line down. ìAnd after one has
washed a certain one of theseî - then the footnote should be there after the
second ëafter one has washed a certain one of theseí. Here the first ëone of
theseí refers to the urinal orifice. The second ëone of theseí means the anal
orifice. This is according to smearing. So we have ten ways of developing the
perception of repulsiveness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ìAs he reviews repulsiveness in this way in this way in ten aspects and
strikes at it with thought and applied thought, physical nutriment becomes
evident to him in its repulsive aspect. He cultivates that sign again and
again.î That sign - in other meditations how many signs do we have? For example
in kasi”a meditation? Do you remember the signs? Two signs. What is the first
sign? It is translated in this book as the learning sign. That means the
grasped sign actually. The other one is the counterpart sign. In P»ƒi the first
one is uggaha nimitta and the second one is pa‘ibh»ga nimitta.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>There are two kinds of sign. For example if you practice kasi”a disk
meditation, when you have memorized the disk and when with your eyes closed you
can see the disk, then you are said to have got the first sign, the learning
sign. Later on you concentrate on that sign again and again so that it becomes
very refined. At that time you are said to have got the second kind of sign,
the counterpart sign. So the counterpart sign is much more refined than the
learning sign. So there are two signs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>But here there is no such sign. ëSigní here simply means the object of
meditation. The footnote also explains this, but it is very difficult to
understand this in the footnote. It is a translation of the Sub-Commentary and
it is not so understandable. ëThe signí here just means the object of
meditation. The object of meditation here is nutriment. Although we call it
ëphysical nutrimentí, actually it is the nutritive essence in the food.
Nutritive essence in the food is paramattha, ultimate reality. It is one of the
28 material properties. But the aspect of repulsiveness is concept. Through
contemplating on the aspect of repulsiveness, you take the real thing as object.
That real thing is called ësabh»va dhammaí, dhamma that has individual essence.
Dhammas that have individual essence are by nature difficult to understand, by
nature profound. Since in this meditation the object is profound, there can be
no jh»na. Sam»dhi reaches only the access stage. So you cannot get jh»na by
practicing this kind of meditation. That is because the object belongs to the
dhammas which have individual essence, or in other words the object belongs to
paramattha, ultimate reality. So it is difficult to see. It is profound. The
meditation cannot reach absorption. It can only reach the level of access.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>That is what is meant in footnote 18. He did not translate the whole
passage. Here it is given as the translation of the whole passage, but some
lines are omitted here, so it doesn't really seem connected. Further down there
is an inaccuracy in the translation. The Sub-Commentary gives two reasons why
the meditation cannot reach absorption with this object of meditation. The
first is ìthe occurrence of development is contingent only an individual
essence.î That is because this meditation has to take a dhamma with individual
essence as an object. And the dhamma with individual essence is by nature
profound, is by nature difficult to see. That is why the sam»dhi cannot reach
to the jh»na stage in this meditation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>Generally we say that if you want to get jh»nas, you practice samatha
meditation or sometimes we say that the practice of samatha meditation leads to
the attainment of jh»nas. But not all kinds of samatha meditation lead to
jh»na. This is one kind of samatha meditation that does not lead to jh»na.
There are others that we have already studied that do not lead to jh»na like
recollection of the Buddha, recollection of the Dhamma and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ìWhen a bhikkhu devotes himself to this perception of repulsiveness in
nutriment, his mind retreats, retracts and recoils from craving for flavors. He
nourishes himself with nutriment without vanity and only for the purpose of
crossing over suffering, as one who seeks to cross over the desert eats his own
dead childís flesh. Then his greed for the five cords of sense-desire comes to
be fully understood without difficulty through the means of the full
understanding of the physical nutriment.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ëFull understandingí or ëfully understoodí really means surmounting the
desire. This word is used in the Suttas many times. The P»ƒi word is ëpari““aí.
We will find it in the second part of the book, maybe towards the end of the
book. There are three kinds of full understanding - clearly understanding,
deciding that things are impermanent and so on, and then the third one is
abandoning, getting rid of, or overcoming. In most cases that is what is meant
when the P»ƒi word ëpari““aí is used. So here ësense-desire comes to be fully
understoodí means sense-desire comes to be overcome or abandoned. When you
really understand food, you will not have attachment to food. You will be able
to get rid of attachment to food when you understand this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'>Student: The repulsiveness makes
you understand the error of desire, but it isnít repulsiveness itself that is
being sought, but repulsiveness as an antidote to desire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'>Teacher: Thatís right. If we do
not see repulsiveness, we will not be able to get rid of attachment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ìHe fully understands the materiality aggregate through the means of
full understanding of the five cords of sense-desire.î ëFull understandingí
should be understood in the sense of overcoming or abandoning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>The next one is defining of the elements or breaking down into elements,
four great elements here. ìHerein, ëdefining (vava‘‘h»na)í is determining by
characterizing individual essences [the compound] ëcatudh»tuvava‘‘h»na
(four-element defining) is [resolvable into] ëcatunna— dh»t|na— vava‘‘h»na—
(defining the four elements)í.î These are the grammatical explanations of the
formation of words. Although it is included in the translation, it is not so
important.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>This meditation is given in two ways, in brief and in detail. It is
given in brief in the Mah» Satipa‘‘h»na Sutta. That is Sutta #22 in The Long
Discourses. It is given in detail in the Mah» Hatthipad|pam» Sutta. It is the
simile of the elephantís footprint. That is in the Majjhima Nik»ya, Sutta #28.
It is also given in detail in the R»hulov»da Sutta. It is the advice of the
Buddha given to his own son R»hula. That is in the Majjhima Nik»ya, Sutta #62.
It is also given in detail in the Dh»tuvibha~ga Sutta. That is in Majjhima
Nik»ya, Sutta #140. In these Suttas the four elements are treated in more detail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>Now we come to the Text and Commentary in brief. This Text is from the
Mah» Satipa‘‘h»na, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness Sutta. ìBhikkhus, just
as though a skilled butcher or butcherís apprentice had killed a cow and were
seated at the cross-roads with it cut up into pieces, so too, bhikkhus, a
bhikkhu reviews this body however placed, however disposed, as consisting of
elements: In this body there are the earth element, the water element, the fire
element, and the air element.î This is what is taught in the Mah» Satipa‘‘h»na
Sutta. Then there are the word meanings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>Paragraph 30 gives us more understanding or explanation of this simile.
The simile in the Text is so short that without the help of this Commentary we
will not understand the meaning intended there. This explanation is very
important. Until the cow is cut up into pieces the person cannot get rid of the
notion that it is a cow. The cow is led to the slaughtering place and it is
slaughtered. Still a person has the notion of a being or a cow. He may think to
himself ìI am taking the cow to the slaughtering ground. I am slaughtering the
cowî and so on. As soon as the cow has been cut into pieces, his notion of a
cow disappears. Just the notion of pieces or just the notion of meat arises in him.
After he will think ì I am selling meatî or ìThey are carrying away meat.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>In the same way if we do not reduce ourselves to the four elements, then
we will still have the notion of being. When we have broken ourselves down into
four elements, then we lose the sense of being. This is the meaning intended in
this simile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ìIn the Mah» Hatthipad|pama Sutta, it is given in detail for one of not
over-quick understandingî, not so quick understanding, not so intelligent.
These people need a little explanation in detail. It is also given in the
R»hulov»da and Dh»tuvibha~ga Suttas. In these three Suttas the passages and
explanations are more or less the same.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ìWhat is the internal earth element, friends?î<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>There are two kinds of earth element,
internal and external. Only internal is shown here. ì Whatever there is
internally in oneself that is hard, harsh and clung to (<u>acquired through
kamma).î</u> Sometimes we want to make the meaning clear, so we put some words
that are not in the original. These very words if they are not correct lead us
to misunderstanding. This is the case here. The P»ƒi word is ëup»di””aí.
ëUp»di””aí means grasped or clung to. Here it is not clung to through kamma,
but clung to through attachment, by grasping. We should strike out ëacquired
through kammaí. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ìThat is hard, harsh and clung toî - and ëclung toí really means
existing in living beings, not existing in outside things such as rocks, trees
and so on. That is because here the internal earth element is explained.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'>Student: There is internally in
oneself something that is hard? Could you explain?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'>Teacher: Earth element is
something in us which is hard, something which has the characteristic of
hardness or softness. We will come to that later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>the 32 parts of the body are divided into earth elements and water
elements. We get the first 20 as earth elements. ìThat is to say, head hairs,
body hairsî and so on until what? ìDung or whatever else there is internally in
oneself that is hard, harsh and clung to - this is called the ëearth elementí.î
This is the definition of the earth element inside the living beings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ìAnd what is the internal water element, friends? Whatever there is
internally in oneself that is water, watery, and clung to, that is to say,
bile, phlegmî and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>The next is the fire element. There are four kinds of fire element.
ìWhatever there is internally in oneself that is fire, fiery, clung to, that is
to say, that whereby one is warmed, ages, and burns up, and whereby what is
eaten, drunk, chewed and tasted gets completely digested, or whatever else
there is internally in oneself that is fire, fiery, and clung to - this is
called the internal fire element.î Do you get four kinds of fire elements in
this passage? You will get it in paragraph 36.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ìhere is the commentary on the words that are not clear. Internally in
oneself (ajjhatta— paccatta—): both these words are terms for what is oneís own
(niyaka), since what is oneís own is what is produced in oneís own self (attani
j»ta—)î and so on. There is an example taken from world speech, that is from
the conversation of the people. ìJust as in the world speech among women is
called [speech] <u>belonging to</u> women (adhitthi)î - this is a kind of
compound. Actually here is not speech among women or belonging to women, but
speech about or concerning women. That is called ëadhitthií in P»ƒi. Here also
the P»ƒi word ëajjhattaí is divided into ëadhií and ëatt»í. ëAdhií and ëatt»í
becomes ajjhatta according to P»ƒi grammatical rules. The Commentary is
explaining this. The word ëajjhattaí simply means internal. If you understand
it to mean internal, that is enough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>At the end of paragraph 33 ìClung to: taken firmly [by <u>kamma</u>];
the meaning is , firmly taken, seized, adhered to, as ëIí, ëmineí.î We should
strike out ëkammaí and put some other words - by craving etc. ìClung to: taken
firmly [by craving etc.]; the meaning is, firmly taken, seized, adhered to, as
ëIí, ëmineí.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>With regard to this word ëup»di””aí it is important. Many people make
mistakes with this word ëup»di””aí. In Abhidhamma terms ëup»di””aí means the
result of kamma or caused by kamma. If a material property, let us say, is
called ëup»di””aí, it means that it is caused by kamma. There is ëup»di””a
r|paí and ëanup»di””a r|paí in Abhidhamma. The word ëup»di””aí normally means
that which is taken or grasped by kamma and so it simply means caused by kamma.
But here and in many other passages the word ëup»di””aí means residing in the
body. That means in living beings whether it is caused by kamma, or caused by consciousness,
or whatever, it is called ëup»di””aí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>In Vinaya this word is also used. For example monks are not supposed to
touch women. What about touching a statue of a woman? A statue of a woman is
not ëup»di””aí, while a living woman is ëup»di””aí. So monks are not to touch a
living women. If they touch with sensual thoughts, they incur some kind of
offense. What about touching a statue? Touching a statue with lustful thoughts
also incurs an offense, but not so grave as touching a real woman. This is
differentiated in Vinaya with the terms ëup»di””aí and ëanup»di””aí, real
living beings and non-living things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'>Student: Can you have internal
cetan»?:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'>Teacher: Actually cetan» is always
internal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'>Student: Craving is not cetan».
Craving is -</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'>Teacher: Craving is attachment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'>Student: Cetan» is -</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'>Teacher: Cetan» is kamma,
volition. Here kamma is not meant because the four elements are said to be
caused by all four causes. There are four causes of matter - kamma, citta
(consciousness), utu (climate or let us say temperature.), and »h»ra (food).
These are the four causes of matter taught in Abhidhamma. The four elements are
caused by all four causes, not by kamma only. Therefore here the P»ƒi word
ëup»di””aí cannot mean kamma because they are caused by all four causes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>At the end of paragraph 34 ìOr whatever else: the earth element included
in the remaining three portions.î ëIn the remaining three portionsí means the
water, fire and air elements, not the remaining parts of the body but the
remaining elements. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>In paragraph 35 there is the explanation of the word ë»poí. At the end
of the paragraph ìWhat is that? It is <u>what has</u> the water elements
characteristic of cohesion.î When we say for example ëthe earth elementí we do
not necessarily mean the earth. We mean the characteristic of earth. That means
we mean some quality inherent in earth which is hardness or softness. When we
say ëearth elementí, we mean hardness or softness. If we say ëwater elementí,
we mean cohesion or flowing. The characteristic is itself the element. That is
why<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>we do not need the word ëwhat hasí
here. ìWhat is that? It is the water elementís characteristic of cohesion.î
Cohesion is the water element. The characteristic and something which has that
characteristic are not differentiated in this case. The characteristic itself
is the element.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'>Student: Can we go back? Could we
say that the characteristic of the earth element is texture?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'>Teacher: Texture? I donít know.
Maybe not. Since we take the hardness or softness as the earth element, earth
element is existent in water also, in fire also. There is hardness or softness
in water. So hardness or softness does not reside in the earth only. In
everything there is this hardness or softness, cohesion, temperature and
distension. These four elements are found everywhere. ìWhat is that? It is the
water elementís characteristic of cohesion.î Or simply put it is cohesion.
Cohesion is water element. Water element is cohesion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ìFire (tejo) [is definable] as heating.. What is that? It is the characteristic
of heat.î Strike out the two words ëwhat hasí. ìWhereby: by means of which fire
element, when excitedî - ëexcitedí really means when it is disturbed when it
becomes abnormal - ìthis body is warmed, becomes heated by the state of one day
feverî and so on. You have fever lasting for one day and then disappearing and
then appearing the next day and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ìAges: whereby this body grows old, reaches the decline of faculties,
loss of strength, wrinkles, grayness, and so on. Burns up: when excited, it
causes this body to burn, and the person cries out ëI am burning, I am
burning!î That means when you have a high fever. When you have a high fever,
you think that you are burning inside. Such a person ìlongs for ghee a hundred
times washed and for gos sa sandalwood ointment, etc.î Sandalwood ointment is
said to be cold. That is why especially women use the sandalwood ointment on
their body. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ìAnd whereby what is eaten, drunk, chewed and tasted gets completely
digested: whereby the boiled rice, etc., that is eaten or the beverage, etc.,
that is drunk, or the hard food consisting of flour biscuits, etc., that is
chewed, the mango fruitî - it should be ripe mango fruit, not just mango fruit
- ìhoney, molasses, etc., that is tasted.î I think I have told you about this
word in P»ƒi. Actually it is not just tasting. Here ëtastingí means licking
with your tongue and enjoying the taste. When we eat honey or molasses, we put
it in our mouth on our tongue and let it dissolve slowly. That is how we eat
honey or molasses and maybe also ripe mango fruit. Ripe mango fruit is very
soft. So you put a piece of ripe mango fruit on your tongue and it will
dissolve by itself. So there are four kinds of food that we eat - that which is
eaten, that which is drunk (That means liquids.), what is chewed (hard food)
and what is tasted or what is licked. These are the four kinds of food.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ìGets its juice, etc., extracted, is the meaning.î Sometimes you need to
have a knowledge of Ayuveda to understand some of the explanations in the
Commentaries. In the Indian medicine books it is stated that if food is
properly digested, it becomes seven kinds of elements in the body. The P»ƒi
word ërasaí is one of the seven elements. Here that is translated as ëits
juice, gets its juice extractedí. Actually there are seven kinds of these in
our body - blood, flesh, fat, bone, bone marrow, semen and then the other one
is called ërasaí. It is chyle. Please look it up in the dictionary. The first
one, ërasaí, is translated as juice here. It is translated as chyle in one
Sanskrit-English dictionary. It is some kind of juice or liquid which is
produced in the body when food is well-digested. When the food is well-digested
by the body, the food we eat becomes the seven kinds of things in our body.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ìAnd here the first three kinds of fire element, [that is to say, ëis
warmedí, ëagesí, and ëburns upí,] are fourfold origin (That is caused by four
causes.), while the last is only kamma - originated.î The last one we call
ëdigestion fireí and it is said to be caused by kamma. Not everybody has the
same digestion. Some have good digestion and some have bad digestion. That is
caused by kamma. The others are caused by all four causes. The four kinds of
fire element are the element by which the body is warmed, by which the body
ages, by which the body burns up and by which what is eaten and so on gets
completely digested. There are four kinds of fire element.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>The air element - there are six kinds of air element. ìWhat is that? It
is what has the characteristic of distension.î There are six kinds of air
element - up-going winds, down-going winds (They are in the body.), winds in
the belly, winds in the bowels, winds that course through all the limbs and
then in-breath and out-breath. How many? There are seven, but in-breath and
out-breath are taken as one. So there are six kinds of wind element.</p>

</span>The method of development in brief that is the head hairs are the earth
element, the body hairs are the earth element and so on. You practice this
meditation along with the meditation on the 32 parts of the body.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ìSuppose two bhikkhus are reciting a Text with many elided repetitionsî
and so on - that is the explanation of how one method of development appears to
one monk as redundant and the same thing appears to the other as not enough.
When we recite Suttas, there are many repetitions. When we do not want to say
the repetitions, we use what is called ëpeyy»laí, elided repetitions. Suppose
we want to say ìItipi so Bhagav» araha— samm»sambuddho vijj»cara”asampannoî -
the last word is ëbhagav»í. If we have to say it again and again, we avoid
saying it again and again by just saying ìItipi so pe bhagav»î. The word put in
between is something like three dots in English. So in this example it is
ìItipi so pe bhagav»î.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'>Studentî: In The Heart Sutra we
say ëuntilí every morning instead of repeating the whole list.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'>Teacher: That is unusual in The
Heart Sutra. In P»ƒi Suttas we use the word ëpeí instead of ëuntilí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ìAfter which he goes on doing the recital with only the two end parts of
the elisions.î ëTwo end partsí means the beginning and the end. One end is the
beginning and the other end is the end. You just say the beginning and the end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>The others are not difficult to understand. With constituents in brief -
ìIn twenty of the parts what has the stiffened mode (That is hardness.) is the
earth element.î So with regard to head hairs we would say the hardness element
in head hairs<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>is the earth element. The
cohesiveness in head hairs is the water element and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>ìIn four parts what matures is the fire element.î ëIn four partsí means
the four kinds of fire element. ìIn what has the mode of distending is the air
element.î ëIn six partsí means the six kinds of wind element.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>With constituents by analysis - ìThe bhikkhu should carry out all the
directions given for the thirty-two-fold aspect in the Description of
Mindfulness Occupied with the Body as a meditation subject.î So he must practice
as described in that chapter and then at the end he must add something. ìThe
only difference is this: there after giving attention to the head hairs, etc.,
as to color, shape, direction, location and delimitation, the mind had to be
fixed by means of repulsiveness.î That means he must try to get the notion of
repulsiveness there and he stops there. The head hairs, body hairs are
repulsive by way of location, by way of shape and so on. Here in this
meditation you do not stop there, but at the end of each part after giving
attention to head hairs, etc., by way of beginning with color, etc., attention
should be given as follows. That means here that the head hairs grow on the
outer skin of the head. The skin doesnít know that the head hairs are growing
on me and the head hairs donít know that we are growing on the skin and so on.
You have to contemplate in that way. That is the defining of the four element
meditation. If you stop at just repulsiveness, then you are doing the
contemplation on the parts of the body. You do that and go on saying that they
donít know each other. You go through all the 32 parts that way. They are not
difficult to understand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:261.0pt'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††

In the first chapter of Abhidhamma the dhammas are classified as kusala,
akusala and neither kusala nor akusala. ëKusalaí means kusala cittas and their
concomitants. ëAkusalaí means akusala cittas and their concomitants. ëAby»kataí
which is neither kusala nor akusala covers all the remaining dhammas -
resultant cittas, functional cittas, r|pa and Nibb»na. When its says

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we begin in chapter 11 paragraph 84. We have not yet
come to contemplation on the four great elements or the four great essentials.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBut if his meditation is still not successful when he gives
his attention to it in this way, then he should develop it with characteristics
in brief. How? In the twenty componentsî - you must remember the 32 or 42
components. There are the 32 parts of the body, four elements of fire, sic
elements of air. Here the contemplation is to be done in brief. Among the 32
parts the first 20 are said to be characteristic of solidity. They have the
characteristic of stiffenedness or solidity. In this method the yogi takes
these 20 components as a whole. In these 20 components the characteristic of
stiffenedness is the earth element. The characteristic of cohesion is the water
element. The characteristic of maturing or ripening is the fire element. The
characteristic of distension is the air element. In this way we define the four
elements in these 20 components.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the remaining 12 components the characteristic of
cohesion is the water element. The characteristic of maturing is the fire
element. The characteristic of distension is the air element. And the
characteristic of stiffenedness is the earth element. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He defines all four elements in these components, but he
does not take the components one by one in this method. In the next method he
will take them one by one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the four components (That is of the fire element.) the
characteristic of maturing (ripening) should be defined as the fire element,
the characteristic of distension unresolvable (inseparable) from it is the air
element, the characteristic of stiffenedness is the earth element and the
characteristic of cohesion is the water element.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the six components (That is the six kinds of air
element.) the characteristic of distension should be defined as the air
element, the characteristic of stiffenedness there too is the earth element,
the characteristic of cohesion is the water element, and the characteristic of
maturing (ripening) is the fire element.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These elements are in everything, in living beings and
outside things. The meditator defines or tries to see these four elements in
everything, taking them as a whole. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAs he defines them in this way the elements become evident
to him. As he adverts to them and gives attention to them again and again
access concentration arises in him in the way already stated.î There is only
access concentration. There is no absorption.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next method is characteristics by analysis. That means
going into detail. ìAfter discerning head hairs, etc., in the way already
described the characteristic of stiffenedness in head hairs should be defined
as the earth element, the characteristic of cohesion there too is the water
element, the characteristic of maturing (ripening) is the fire element, and the
characteristic of distension is the air element.í Here the meditator takes the
components one by one and tries to define these four elements in each component
- head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAs he defines them in this way the elements become evident
to him. As he adverts and gives attention to them again and again access
concentration arises in him in the way already described.î There can only be
access concentration with this type of meditation, no jh»na or absorption
concentration. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we have additional ways of giving attention. ìIn
addition, attention should be given to the elements in the following ways: (1)
as to word meaning, (2) by groups, (3) by particles, (4) by characteristic,
etc., (5) as to how originated, (6) as to variety and unity, (7) as to
resolution (separability) and non-resolution (inseparability), (8) as to the
similar and the dissimilar, (9) as to distinction between internal and
external, (10) as to inclusion, (11) as to condition, (12) as to lack of
conscious reaction, (13) as to analysis of conditions.î In these 13 ways we
give attention to the four elements. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first is the meaning of the P»ƒi words. The P»ƒi words
are pa‘havi, »po, tejo, and v»yo. They are explained in paragraph 87. ìIt is
earth (pa‘havi) because it is spread out (pattha‘a).î The word ëpa‘havií is
defined as something spread out. ìIt flows (appoti) or it glides (»piyati) or
it satisfies (app»yati), thus it is water (»po); it heats (tejati), thus it is
fire (tejo); it blows (v»yati), thus it is air (v»yo).î They are just the word
explanations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBut without differentiation (That means in general.) they
are elements (dh»tu).î That means all of them are called dh»tus or elements.
Each one is called by its individual name (pa‘havi, »po, tejo, v»yo). Generally
or collectively they are called dh»tus or elements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The word ëdh»tuí is made to mean here because of bearing
their own characteristics, because of holding their own characteristics, and
because of grasping suffering, and because of sorting out suffering. Here we
are not sure about the correct reading of the text in the original book. The
first word you see is »d»na. Some teachers think that word is not necessary, or
not needed here, or that it may be a wrong reading. Some teachers say that the
correct reading is »dh»na. The Sub-Commentary comments about this, but it is
not quite clear. So the word ëdh»tuí is explained as something which bears its
own characteristic, or which grasps suffering, or which sorts out suffering.
ëSort out sufferingí here actually means to create suffering or to produce
suffering. I donít know what ësorting outí means. Can it mean ëto produceí or
ëto makeí?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: I think so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: So they are called elements. Actually there are
many other elements in Abhidhamma. Consciousness is also called an element.
There are other elements like dhammadh»tu. It is a famous name in this country.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBy groups: there is the earth element described under the
20 aspects (modes) beginning with head hairs, body hairs, and also the water
element described under the 12 aspects (modes) beginning with bile, phlegm. Now
as to these,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>Color, odor,
taste, and nutritive</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>Essence, and the
four elements -</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>From combination
of these eight</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>There comes the
common usage head hairs;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>And separately
from these eight</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>There is no
common usage head hairs.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These eight are the basic unit of matter. You may reduce
matter to the smallest particle. Let us say it is an atom. Even the atom
contains these or is a combination of these eight material particles. That is
what Abhidhamma teaches us. Everything which we call matter is composed of
these eight material properties - color, odor, taste, nutritive essence and
these four elements. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìConsequently head hairs are only a mere group of eight states.
Likewise body hairs and the rest.î When you define head hair, you define as
this head hair is nothing but the eight material properties and these eight are
color, odor and so on. They are inseparable material properties. You cannot
separate them. You can separate them only in your mind, only with your wisdom,
but they cannot be physically separated. If with your mind you separate these
eight elements one by one, you lose the usage head hair. There is no head hair.
It is like when you take the parts of a cow one by one. You lose the sense of a
cow. In the same way when you take these eight material properties apart, there
is no head hair, body hair, or whatever. ëBy groupí here means by the group of
material properties, here the group of eight material properties. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Footnote 29 ì ëBecause of bearing their own
characteristicsí: these are not like the Primordial Essence (pakati or in
Sanskrit prakrti) and the Self (att») imagined by the theorists, which are
non-existent as to individual essence.î Whenever they had an occasion they
rejected the idea of other sects, other teachers, other people. This was the
characteristic of books written when there was much debate among the different
sects. As Buddhists we do not accept the Primordial Essence (prakrti). That is
in the Samkhya system of Hindu philosophy and Self is also not accepted. They
always say this is just imagination in their mind. They do not have existence
or individual essence. However the four primary elements have individual
essence and they are real things unlike those which are not real. ìOn the
contrary these do bear their own characteristics, which is why they are
elements.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: I think this is where Mah»y»na and Therav»da
traditions differ. In the Prajnap»ramit» Sutra I think one of the points is
that even the elements do not have a self or are not real. So this is an
apparent contradiction. I can see it as a useful description but not that it
would be real itself from the Mah»y»na perspective. What about Therav»da?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: No. Therav»da accepts these elements as real. They
have their own essence or they have their own existence. ëExistenceí means
having the three phases of existence - arising, staying for some time, and
disappearing. Whatever has these three is supposed to be existent. Therav»da
Buddhism takes them as existent, takes them as real, as ultimate reality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Mah»y»na nothing has its own existence. Everything is
void, su““a. That is the difference.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Footnote 30 ì ëFrom resolution of these eightí: the eight
dhammas beginning with color, when resolved by means of understanding (wisdom),
are apprehendable in the ultimate sense through mutual negation.î That means
earth is not water, water is not earth. That is an example of mutual negation.
A is not B, B is not A.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBut head hairs are not apprehendable in the ultimate sense
through negation of color and so on.î You cannot say color is different from
hair and hair is different from color because hair has color inherent in it. So
you understand this by separating them in your mind one from the other, but not
one from color and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìConsequently the term of common usage ëhead hairsí is
applied to these dhammas in their co-arisen state.î When these eight properties
arise together, the designation for it is head hair, body hair and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe meaning is that it is a mere conventional term. ëOnly a
mere group of eight statesí is said, taking the color, etc., which are <u>real,
as a unity by means of the concept</u> ëa head hairí, not only because they are
merely the eight states.î There is something I want to correct. ëOnly a mere
group of eight statesí - this is mentioned in the Visuddhi Magga. It is said
there ìtaking the color, etc., which are the basis for the concept head hair as
one.î It is not ìreal, as a unity by means of conceptî. This is a wrong
understanding of the word there. What it really means is the eight states, the
eight material properties are a basis for head hairs, body hairs and so on.
Here the eight material properties are taken as one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So ìWhich are a basis for the concept head hairs, etc.,
which are taken as one, and not because (I have stricken out the word ëonlyí.)
they are <u>only</u> the eight states.î ëOnlyí should go there instead of
ëmerelyí. ëNot because they are only eight statesí means that you look at a
head hair and in the head hair there are thousands and thousands of particles
of matter. There are not just eight particles of matter, but there are
thousands and thousands of material properties. However there are just eight
kinds of material properties. A hair consists of thousands and thousands of
material properties, but if you divide them into kinds , you get only eight
kinds of material properties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìA component here that is kamma-originated is a group of ten
states, [that is to say, the former eight] together with the life faculty and
sex.î So it is kamma-originated. That means if it is in living beings, we may
add the life faculty and sex (male or female). In this way we get ten material
properties. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBut it is on account of respective prominence [of stiffenedness
or cohesion] that it comes to be styled ëearth elementí or ëwater elementí.î In
the hair all four elements are present, but when we divide them into elements,
we say that head hairs belong to earth element. It does not mean that there is
only earth element in the hair, but that that element is prominent in the hair.
That is why it is called earth element. In fact all four elements are present
everywhere. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next is by particles. ìIn this body the earth element
taken as reduced to fine dust and powdered to the size of the smallest atom
might amount to an average do”a measure full.î It is difficult to ascertain
this measure. Let us say a pound of dust. ìThat is held together by the water
element measuring half as much. Being maintained by the fire element (so that
it does not decay). And distended by the air element, it does not get scattered
or dissipated. Instead of getting scattered or dissipated, it arrives at the
alternative states of female and male sex, etc., and manifests smallness, bigness,
length, shortness, toughness, rigidity, and so on.î These particles are to be
contemplated on in this way. The earth element is taken or reduced to fine
dust.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe liquid water element that is the mode of cohesion,
being founded on earth, maintained by fire, and distended by air, does not
trickle or run away.î It is supported by the other three elements. That is why
they stay together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd here the fire element that cooks what is eaten, drunk,
etc., and is the mode of warming and has the characteristic of heat, being
established on earth, held together by water, and distended by air, maintains
this body and ensures its proper appearance. And this body, being maintained by
it, shows no putrefaction.î If we lose fire element all together, our body will
decompose. It is this fire element in the body that keeps it from putrefaction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe air element that courses through all the limbs and has
the characteristic of moving and distending, being founded upon earth, held
together by water, and maintained by fire, distends this body. And this body,
being distended by the latter kind of air, does not collapse, but stands
erect.î Everything that stands erect is supported by the air element. If we
take away air element all together, it would fall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBeing propelled by the other [motile] air, it shows
intimation and it flexes and extends and it wriggles the hands and feet, doing
so in the postures comprising walking, standing, sitting and lying down. So
this mechanism of elements carries on like a magic trick, deceiving foolish
people with the male and female sex and so on.î These deceive us into thinking
that this is a man, this is a woman, this is an animal, this is a human being
and so on. But if you can see through them, through the appearance of beings,
you will arrive at the four elements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As to characteristics - this passage is important. ìThe
earth element - what are its characteristic, function, manifestation? The earth
element has the characteristic of hardness.î In fact when we say hardness we
also mean softness. Softness is just a degree of hardness. Hardness is reduced
little by little and we get softness. Hardness and softness are pretty much the
same. The characteristic of earth element is hardness. ìIts function is to act
as foundation. It is manifested as receiving.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe water element has the characteristic of trickling. Its
function is to intensify. It is manifested as holding together. The fire
element has the characteristic of heat. Its function is to mature (maintain).
It is manifested as a continued supply of softness.î When there is heat, when
we put something on fire, it becomes soft. So it is the continued supply of
softness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe air element has the characteristic of distending. Its
function is to cause motion. (That means to push.) It is manifested as
conveying (taking something to some place). This is how they should be given
attention by characteristic, and so on.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These can be seen during meditation practice. Especially the
air element is evident when you practice walking meditation. You walk with full
awareness of the lifting, moving, putting and so on. In that case you see the
air element at work there. First you have the intention to lift your foot.
There is intention which is mental. This mental state causes some material
properties to arise in your foot. There are many moments of consciousness going
on when you have intention to move. Each moment of consciousness causes some
material properties to arise. What we call lifting is just the arising of
material properties at adjacent locations. According to Abhidhamma nothing
moves to another place. When I move my finger, I think that I move my finger,
but according to Abhidhamma there is nothing that moves. Caused by my mind this
movement occurs. ëMovementí really means arising of material properties at
different moments or at different locations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It may be like a picture in movie film. On one frame there
is one picture. On the next frame there is a picture with a very slight
difference. In the same way or similarly what happens when there is movement
really is arising of material properties at successive locations or at adjacent
locations. That is also explained somewhat in footnote 37 - desantaruppatti.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: So there is no continuity. There is closeness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: There is no one thing moving from one place to
another or from one moment to another. Whatever arises at this moment
disappears at this moment. It does not go to the next moment. At the next
moment another thing is created. Another thing arises. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Which is close -</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Which may be identical with the one that has just
disappeared. When you practice walking meditation, you may be able to see some
of these characteristics and functions. When you pay very close attention,
sometimes you feel that something is pushing you from behind or something is
pushing your foot from behind. That is the function of causing motion. The air
element is something that takes your foot from the position on the ground up or
to move forward. That is conveying. So these characteristics and others can be
seen through direct experience during intense practice of meditation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAs to how originated: among the 42 components beginning
with head hairs shown in the detailed treatment of the earth element, etc., the
four consisting of gorge, dung, pus, and urine, are temperature-originated
only.î Later on I think we will get the four causes of matter. In paragraph 111
the four causes of matter are given - kamma, consciousness, nutrition and
temperature. Now he is talking about that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe four consisting of gorge, dung, pus and urine are
temperature-originated only.î That means they are caused by temperature or
climate. ìthe four consisting of tears, sweat, spittle and snot are
temperature-originated and consciousness-originated only; the fire that cooks
what is eaten, etc., is kamma-originated only.î We call it stomach fire. That
element is said to be caused by kamma only. Those who have good kamma will have
good digestion. If you donít have good digestion, blame your kamma.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn-breath and out-breath are consciousness-originated only;
all the rest are of fourfold origination. (they are caused by all four causes.)
This how they should be given attention as to how originated.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As to variety and unity - that means as to difference and
similarity. ìThere is variety in the specific characteristics, etc.,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>of all the elements; for the characteristic,
function and manifestation of the earth element is one, and those of water
element, etc., are different.î According to characteristic they are different.
Earth element is different from water element. Water element is different from
fire element and so on. ìBut there is unity in them as materiality.î Although
they are different as earth, water, fire and air, they are all material
properties. In that way they are the same.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is unity in them as materiality, or they are called
great primaries, or they are called elements, or they are called states, and
all of them are described as impermanent and so on, ìnot withstanding the fact
that they are various according to [specific] characteristic, etc., and
according to origination by kamma and so on.î There is variety as well as unity
among these elements. ëVarietyí means one is different from the other. Unity is
that they are all r|pas, they are all great primaries, they are all elements
and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAll of these elements are ëinstances of materialityí
because they do not exceed the characteristic of ëbeing molestedí.î ëBeing
molestedí is the definition of the word ër|paí. Something which is molested by
heat, cold, etc., is called r|pa in P»ƒi. The word ër|paí is defined as
something which is molested by heat, cold, hunger, thirst and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They are called great primaries because they are the basis
for the other material properties depending upon them. ìThey are great
primaries (mah» bh|ta) by reason of great manifestation and so on. By reason of
great manifestation and so on, means that these elements are called great
primaries for the following reasons, namely, a. manifestation of greatness, b.
likeness to great creatures, c. great maintenance, d. great alteration, and e.
because they are great and because they are entities.î This may be useful for
Abhidhamma students. In the chapter on material properties there is the word</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†</span>ëmah» bh|taí. So you
may study this and understand the word. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first one is manifestation of greatness. They manifest
greatness, therefore they are called great primaries. ìThey are manifested as
great both in the continuity that is not clung to (<u>acquired through kamma</u>).î
Now we will have to strike out ëacquired through kammaí. Here ëcontinuity that
is not clung toí means in outside things, in inanimate things. ëContinuity that
is clung toí means living beings. ëAcquired through kammaí is not correct. I
have told you about this P»ƒi word ëup»di””aí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìFor their manifestation of greatness in a continuity that
is not clung to is given in the Description of the Recollection of the Buddha
in the way beginning:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>ëTwo times a
hundred thousand [leagues]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>And then four
nahutas as well;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>This earth, this
Bearer of all wealth,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>Has that much
thickness as they tellí.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the dimension of the earth. The earth is said to be
200,000 and four nahutas in depth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: How much is that?<br style='mso-special-character:
line-break'>
<![if !supportLineBreakNewLine]><br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>
<![endif]></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: So the earth is said to be 240,000 leagues deep.
ìAnd they are manifested on a great scale also in a continuity that is clung
to, for instance, in the bodies of fishes, turtles, deities, D»nava demons, and
so on. For this is said: ëBhikkhus, there are individual creatures of a hundred
leagues in the great ocean and so oní.î In the great ocean there are creatures
that have very big bodies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next is likeness to great creatures. Here great creatures
are those that are called great because they have magic power. So magicians are
called great creatures here. ìJust as a magician turns water that is not
crystal into crystal, and turns a clod that is not gold into gold, and shows
them, and being himself neither a spirit or a bird, shows himself as a spirit
or a bird so too, being themselves not blue-black, they turn themselves into
blue-black materiality and so on.î These elements are not blue, nor black, nor
red, but they make us<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>believe they are
blue, or black, or red and so on. They deceive us into believing what is not
real is real.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: It seems to me what you have just said is the
Mah»y»na point of view that the great primaries deceive us into thinking that
they are real. I donít see the difference.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: They themselves are not blue-black, but we take
them to have shape, to have form. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: To be real.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: To be real in the conventional sense. But according
to Abhidhamma what is real is just the elements and the particles of matter
mentioned in the books. So according to Abhidhamma a cup is not reality. Those
particles which are contained in the cup are real. They have their own
existence. A cup has no existence of its own because it is just a concept. So
here ëgreat creaturesí are magicians. They can make us believe that they can
turn things into other things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The word ëmah» bh|taí - there is something like word play in
footnote 38. The word ëabh|taí means not real. And ëabh|taí means something
wonderful or a miracle. The word ëmah» bh|taí is taken to have these two
meanings. So a magician is a man who has so many unreal things and he is a man
who has wonderful things. He is a man who create wonders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In about the middle of the footnote ìThe deception lies in
causing the apparent individual essences of blue-black, etc., though they
themselves<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>have no such individual
essences of blue-black, etc., and it lies in causing the appearance of what has
the aspect of woman and man, etc., though they themselves have no such
individual essences of woman, man and so on. Likewise their undemonstrability,
since they are not found inside or outside each other though they rely upon
each other for support. For if these elements were found inside each other,
they would not each perform their particular functions, owing to mutual
frustration. And if they were found outside each other, they would be already
resolved (separate), and that being so, any description of them as unresolved
(inseparable) would be meaningless. So although their standing place is
undemonstrable, still each one assists the other by its particular function,
the functions of establishing, etc., whereby each becomes a condition for the
others as conascence condition and so on.î<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>ëConascence conditioní means helping together while arising together.
These conditions are from the 24 causal conditions taught in the last book of
Abhidhamma.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In fact the sentences of the footnote beginning with
ìLikewise their undemonstrabilityî and so on pertain to the next paragraph,
paragraph 99. There in the Visuddhi Magga it says ìThey have no standing place
either inside him or outside him and yet they have no standing place either
inside him or outside him and yet they have no standing independently of him,
so too, these elements are not found to stand either inside or outside each
other yet they have no standing independently of one another.î These are really
separated. One does not stand or exist in the other, but they have no standing
independently of one another because they depend upon one another. So there is
dependence upon one another but they are not used so that there may be no
distinction of one from the other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThus they are also great primaries (mah» bh|ta) in being
equal to the great creatures (mah» bh|ta) such as the spirits because they have
no thinkable standing place [relative to each other].î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd just as the great creatures known as female spirits
(yakkhin ) conceal their own fearfulness with a pleasing color, shape, and
gesture to deceive beings, so too, these elements, conceal each their own
characteristic and function classed as hardness, etc., by means of a pleasing
skin color of womenís and menís bodies, etc., and pleasing shapes of limbs and
pleasing gestures of fingers, toes and eyebrows, and they deceive simple people
by concealing their own functions and characteristics beginning with hardness
and do not allow their individual essences to be seen.î If we do not
concentrate, if we do not really meditate on these elements, we will not know
or we will not see their true characteristics and so on. So long as we do not
see their characteristics we will always be deceived by them into believing
this is a man, this is a woman and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: What does it mean ëconceal their own fearfulnessí
(with regard to the yakkhin ) ?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: The female spirits or ghosts may assume another
form so that they do not look fearful. There are stories in the J»takas where
female spirits entice people and then eat them. Although the female spirits or
yakkhin  are supposed to be of very fearful appearance, they may change their
form. They may change to a beautiful girl in order to entice you and then they
will eat you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìGreat maintenance: this is because they have to be
sustained by Great Requisites. For these elements are great primaries (mah»
bh|ta) since they have become (bh|ta),<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>have occurred, through the means of the food, clothing, etc., which are
great (mahant) [in importance] because they have to be found every day. Or
alternatively, they are great primaries (mah» bh|ta) since they are primaries
whose maintenance is great.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ëGreat alterationí means great change. The sentence (in
paragraph 102) should read: ìWhether they are un-clung-to or clung-to they are
the Great Alterations.î That means whether they belong to outside things or
whether they belong to living beings, they are great alterations, they are
great changes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHerein, the great alteration of the unclung-to (That means
outside things.) evidences itself in the <u>emergence</u> of an eon.î This word
appears in another context also. He made the same translation. In chapter nine
paragraph 32 it says ìHe was sprinkled with medicinal charms resembling the
fire that ushers in the end of an eon.î Here also it should be the end of an
eon, not emergence. The P»ƒi word here is deceptive. At the time of the
destruction of the world you see this change very clearly. Everything is
destroyed.î<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>The great alteration of the
un-clung-to (lifeless things) evidences itself in the end of an eon and that of
the clung-to in the disturbances of the elements [in the body]. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We believe that these four elements should be well balanced.
If there is too much of the earth element, or water element and so on, you get
sick. In Myanmar there is a native medical practice which makes the elements
the basis of their practice. They always explain with reference to these
elements. If you eat food that is sticky, it will cause constipation for
example. They say this food has the earth element as its prominent property. If
you eat something which is bitter, you will get a lot of wind element. It
promotes wind element. So they base their medical practice on these four
elements. They divide food into those which have earth element as prominent
property or water element as prominent property. They treat patients by giving
them food appropriate for the disease. They always say food is medicine and
medicine is food.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The verses are the explanation of the destruction of the
world. We will come to that later too in the next chapter. Then there are four
verses that describe the alteration in living beings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>ìThe bite of
Wooden-mouths can make</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>The body stiff;
to all intent,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>When roused is
its earth element,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††††† </span>It might be
gripped by such a snake.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They believe that there are snakes whose bite can cause your
body to be stiffened. Also there are some kinds of snakes that can make your
body like water element and so on. So when you are bitten by such a snake there
is disturbance of the elements in your body. And so your body alters. They are
great primaries because they have become the basis of great alterations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 103 ìBecause they are great and because they are
entities: great (mahant) because they need great effort to discern them, and
entities (bh|ta) because they are existent; thus they are great primaries (mah»
bh|ta) because they are great (mah») and because they are entities (bh|ta).î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAgain, they are elements (dh»tu) because of <u>bearing</u>
(dh»ra”a) their own characteristics, because of grasping (»d»na) suffering and
because of sorting out (producing) (»dh»na) suffering and because none of them
are exempt from the characteristic of being elements. They are states (dhammas)
owing to <u>bearing</u> (dh»ra”a) their own characteristics and owing to their
so bearing (dh»ra”a) for the length of the moment appropriate to them.î The
Sub-Commentary explains the word ëdh»ra”aí as not bearing but just as
existence, so existing for the length of the moment appropriate to them. Citta
is called an element and r|pa is called an element. Citta exists for only one
moment. R|pa has 17 moments of life. That is why it says ìfor the length of the
moment appropriate to them.î If it is citta or cetasikas, it has only one
moment of life, one moment of existence. If it is r|pa, it has 17 moments of
life. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then we have as to resolution (separability) and
non-resolution (inseparability). ìThey are positionally unresolvable
(inseparable) since they always arise together in every single minimal material
group consisting of the bare octad and others.î ëBare octadí means those
mentioned in this chapter, paragraph 88, color, odor, taste, nutritive essence
and the four elements. They are called the bare octad. ìBut they are resolvable
(separable) by characteristic.î They are different according to characteristic.
ìThis is how they how they should be given attention ëas to resolution
(separability) and non-resolution (inseparability).î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAs to the similar and dissimilar: and although they are
unresolved (inseparable) in this way, yet the first two are similar for
heaviness, and so are the last two in lightness.î Earth and water are heavy and
fire and air are light. ìThe first two are dissimilar to the last two and the
last two to the first two. This is how they should be given attention ëas to
the similar and dissimilarí.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAs to distinction between internal and external: the
internal elements are the [material] support for the physical bases of consciousness
(That means eyes, ears and so on.), for the kinds of intimation and for the
material faculties. They are associated with postures, and they are of fourfold
origination (That means caused by four things.) The external elements are of
the opposite kind.î The external elements are not caused by all four causes but
just by one, temperature. They are not associated with posture. They are not
basis for consciousness and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAs to inclusion: kamma-originated earth element is included
together with the other kamma-originated elements because there is no
difference in their origination.î They are similar in being kamma-originated.
ìLikewise the consciousness-originated is included together with other
consciousness-originated elements.î They are grouped together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAs to condition: the earth element, which is held together
by water, maintained by fire and distended by air, is a condition for the other
three great primaries by acting as their foundationî and so on. So they help
each other and they do their own functions. So they are conditions for each
other. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As to lack of conscious reaction - that means that they have
no consciousness, no understanding of their own. ìHere too the earth element
does not know ëI am the earth elementí or ëI am a condition by acting as
foundation for the three great primariesí. And the other three do not know ëThe
earth element is a condition for us by acting as our foundationí. And similarly
in each instance. This is how they should be given attention ëas to lack of
conscious reactioní.î They are non-cognizing things. They do not have
consciousness. They do not have thinking. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAs to analysis of conditions: there are four conditions for
the elements.î This is important. There are four conditions or four causes for
the elements or the material properties. They are kamma, consciousness,
nutriment and temperature. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHerein kamma alone is a condition for what is
kamma-originated, not consciousness and the rest. And consciousness, etc.,
alone are the respective conditions for what is consciousness-originated, etc.,
not the others. And kamma is the producing condition for what is
kamma-originated; it is indirectly decisive support condition for the rest.î
You will have to use the knowledge of Pa‘‘h»na to understand this. In Pa‘‘h»na
there are 24 conditions mentioned. ëThe producing conditioní means that which
produces. There is no producing condition among the 24 conditions mentioned in
Pa‘‘h»na. In footnote 40 ìThe term ëproducing conditioní refers to causing
origination, though as a condition it is actually kamma condition.î Among the
24 conditions mentioned in Pa‘‘h»na it is kamma condition. Here it is said to
be producing condition. They are the same. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìFor this is said ëProfitable and unprofitable volition is a
condition, as kamma condition, for the resultant aggregates and for materiality
due to kamma performed.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is indirectly decisive support condition for the rest.
Decisive support condition has the widest application of the 24 conditions. If
you cannot explain a certain thing by the other conditions, you may point to
the decisive support condition. It is very wide, so you can include everything
in that. Strictly speaking decisive support only applies to those that are
mental, to cittas and cetasikas, not r|pa. So here we cannot have direct
decisive support. That is why it says indirect decisive support. That means
decisive support condition not mentioned in Pa‘‘h»na but decisive support that
is mentioned in some of the Suttas. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Sub-Commentary gives some of the passages from some of
the Suttas, but those Suttas cannot be traced. Thatís why there are blanks
between the parentheses. Until this time nobody has been able to trace those
quotations in the Sub-Commentary. ì ëWith a person as decisive supportí (<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>) and ëWith a grove as decisive supportí
(<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>) in the Suttas the decisive support
condition can be directly understood according to the Suttas in the sense of
ëabsence withoutí.î That means not arising without. Without it something does
not arise. That is the condition for that. If I cannot exist without you, you
are my decisive support condition. It is something like that, so not arising
without. The others are also explained in that way. The knowledge of Pa‘‘h»na
is needed. So I think I will skip this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd when these elements have been made to occur through the
influence of the conascence, etc., conditions,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>With three in
four ways to one due,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>And likewise with
one due to three;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>With two in six
ways due to two -</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>Thus their
occurrence comes to be.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Please have in mind the four elements - one, two, three,
four. What it is explaining here is that one is dependent upon the other three.
Let us say one is dependent upon two, three and four. Two is dependent upon
one, three and four. Three is dependent upon one, two and four. Four is
dependent upon one, two and three. It is like that. And then two, three and
four depend upon one. One, three and four depend upon two. One, two and four
depend upon three. One two and three depend upon four. There is mutual dependency.
That is explained here. Then you take one and two and they are dependent upon
three and four. Three and four are dependent upon one and two. So you get all
these things. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 115 ìAt the time of moving forward and moving
backward, the earth element among these is a condition for pressing (pushing).
That, seconded by the water element, is a condition for establishing on a
foundation. But the water element seconded by the earth element is a condition
for lowering down.î When you are lowering down, there is the prominence of
water element. ìThe fire element seconded by the air element is a condition for
lifting up.î When you lift your foot up, the fire element and air element are
prominent at that time. When the foot is going down, the heaviness or something
like that is prominent. When you lift your body or your foot up, there is
lightness. You see the prominence of a given element when you raise your foot
or when you put it down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAs he gives his attention to them ëas to word meaningí,
etc., in this way the elements become evident to him under each heading. As he
again and again adverts and gives attention to them access concentration arises
in the way already described.î Only access concentration, no absorption is
attained with this meditation subject. ìAnd this concentration too is called
ëdefinition of the four elementsí because it arises in one who defines the four
elements owing to the influence of his knowledge.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next are the benefits of this meditation. What are the
benefits you will get from the development of concentration - these benefits
are given in detail from paragraph 120 onwards. The first benefit is what? A
blissful abiding here and now. That is the first one. ìFor the development of
absorption concentration provides the benefit of a blissful abiding here and
now for the Arahants with cankers destroyed who develop concentration, thinking
ëWe shall attain and dwell with unified mind for a whole dayí.î The Arahants
and Noble Ones enter into jh»na to enjoy happiness. That happiness is called
ëhappiness here and nowí. The absorption concentration has this benefit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next one is what? ìWhen ordinary people and Trainers
develop it, thinking ëAfter emerging we shall exercise insight with
concentrated consciousnessí, the development of absorption provides them with
the benefit of insight.î They make the jh»na the basis of insight. So it gives
the benefit of insight or it has insight as benefit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìSo too does access concentration as a method of arriving at
wide open [conditions] in crowded [circumstances].î That means in this sa—s»ra
(Sa—s»ra is explained as being a very crowded place.) you get some wide place
when you get the access concentration. That means you get a little happiness,
some peacefulness when you get concentration. You get a good chance there. In
footnote 45 ìThe process of existence in the round of rebirths, which is a very
cramped place, is crowded by the defilements of craving and so on.î This is
what is meant here. You get some moments that are free from the mental defilements
such as craving and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next paragraph, paragraph 122, is a little complicated.
The development of concentration has direct knowledge as benefit. The
development of absorption concentration can give the benefits of direct
knowledge. When a person has attained all eight attainments (That means the
eight jh»nas.), he may want to get the direct knowledge. If he wants to get the
direct knowledge, what must he do? He enters into the eight attainments. Then
he makes one of them, actually the fourth jh»na, the basis of direct knowledge.
He enters into that jh»na and then emerges from that jh»na. After emerging from
that jh»na he wishes that he get some miracle power. Here it says ìHaving been
one, he becomes many.î That means I am one, but I want to be many. So he can
create many resemblances of himself like C|ƒa Panthaka did. The meditator may
wish for that kind of power. Then he practices meditation and then he gets the
direct knowledge. That is what is explained in this paragraph, but it is difficult
to understand. That is the meaning. After getting all eight attainments
(jh»nas) if he wants the direct knowledge, he enters into one jh»na as the
basis for direct knowledge. That jh»na is the fourth jh»na. Emerging from that
jh»na he makes a wish such as ìhaving been one, may I become many.î And as a
result of his meditation he will get the direct knowledge. ëDirect knowledgeí
means in this case the ability to make himself into many persons. The other
abhi““as may be attained depending upon his wish.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìWhen ordinary people have not lost their jh»na, and they
aspire to rebirth in the Brahm» World thus ëLet us be reborn in the Brahm»
Worldí, or even though they do not make the actual aspiration, then the
development of absorption concentration provides them with the benefits of an
improved form of existence since it ensures that for them.î That means
development of concentration can lead you to get a better existence, to be
reborn in a better existence as brahm»s and so on. So it has this benefit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The last one in paragraph 124 is that development of
concentration has the attainment of cessation as benefit. Those who have
attained to the third stage of enlightenment and Arahants can enter into the
attainment of cessation. During this attainment of cessation all mental
activities are suspended for as long as the person wishes. The maximum period
for human beings is seven days. For seven days or one day this meditator is
like a statue. There is no mental activity. That state of being without mental
activity is said to be very peaceful. It is the highest form of happiness in
this world. The development of concentration can give this benefit too. We come
to the end of this chapter.</p>

</span>Chapter 12</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chapter 12 deals with the supernormal powers, direct
knowledge. We have a glimpse of direct knowledge in the previous chapter. In
this chapter the different kinds of direct knowledge are explained. In this
chapter there are a lot of stories. What we should note is that there are five
kinds of direct knowledge. In paragraph 2 they are listed as 1. Performing some
kinds of miracles, 2. The knowledge of the Divine Ear (That means hearing
sounds far away, hearing sounds that cannot normally be heard.), 3. The
knowledge of Penetration of Minds (That means reading other peopleís minds.),
4. The knowledge of Recollection of Past<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>Lives, 5. The knowledge of Passing<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>Away and Reappearance of Beings. These are called direct knowledge. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the meditator wants to achieve the supernormal powers, he
must achieve the eight attainments (the eight jh»nas) on each of the eight
kasi”as ending with the white kasi”a. That is the first eight kasi”as and the
last two are left out. What are the last two?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>Space and light. Space is left out because it cannot be the basis for
attaining immaterial jh»nas. The Sub-Commentary explains that the light kasi”a
is to be taken as the same as white kasi”a. In the Visuddhi Magga only eight
kasi”as are mentioned. The sub-Commentary says that we can also take the light
kasi”a, that it is included in the white kasi”a.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You have to make yourself very familiar with the kasi”as and
the jh»nas. There are 14 ways to make yourself familiar with these jh»nas. That
is in the order of the kasi”as, in the reverse order of the kasi”as and so on.
So you enter into jh»na on this kasi”a, and then the next jh»na on this kasi”a,
and the next jh»na on this kasi”a. Then again you enter into first jh»na on
this kasi”a and then first jh»na on another kasi”a and so on. It is in order to
make you very familiar with the jh»nas and the kasi”as that you have to go in
many different ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the end of paragraph 10 the Giribha”…avahana offering is
mentioned and there is a footnote. In P»ƒi the word for an island and a lamp is
the same. It is the word ëd paí. He took d pap|j» to mean island offering. It
is a light offering. During that festival lights are offered at different
places ìstarting with the Cetiyagiri and extending over the whole island and up
to a league in the sea.î That is light offering festival, not island offering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are many stories in this chapter. Some of the stories
have been given already in the chapters that we have read. Many may be new to
you. I want to give you the page numbers of some stories if you want to read in
more detail. At the end of paragraph 28 a reference is given for the Dhammapada
Commentary. If you have the book Buddhist Legends, you may read part 2, page
238. At the end of paragraph 29 no reference is given, but I have the
reference. Please read Buddhist Legends, part 3, page 179. Then at the end of
paragraph 32 you may read Middle Length Sayings, first volume, page 396. At the
end of paragraph 33 the reference may be found in Buddhist Legends, part 2,
page 246. For the next paragraph the reference can be found in Buddhist
Legends, part 3, page 103. For paragraph 35 the story may be found in Buddhist
Legends, part 1, page 286. Paragraph 41 the first reference can be found in
Buddhist Legends, part 3, page 319. The second reference is in Buddhist Legends,
part 3, page 327. The third reference in this paragraph may be found in
Buddhist Legends, part 1, page 256. The last reference in this paragraph may be
found in Buddhist legends, part 3, page 130. Then at the end of paragraph 42
you may find that reference in Buddhist legends, part 2, page 59. these are the
references.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the end of paragraph 41 it says ì<u>made of the seven
gems</u>.î Actually it is made of the seven precious things. The seven precious
things are gold, silver and other jewels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the part that we have covered the ten kinds of success
power (iddhi) are given. All of them are interesting. So if you have time
please study it again. There is one thing that is very interesting. In
paragraph 26 ìA distinction brought about by the influence of knowledge either
before the arising of the knowledge or after it or at that moment is called
success by intervention of knowledge.î If a person is going to become an
Arahant in that life, he will not die without becoming an Arahant. The<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>knowledge of Arahantship which he is going to
acquire in that life protects him from being killed even though an attempt is
made on his life. That is a very strange thing. If you are going to become an
Arahant, you will not die without becoming an Arahant. Nothing can cause you to
be killed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first story is of Venerable Bakkula. In this story he
was swallowed by a fish. His mother was bathing him in the river and he was
swallowed by a fish. The fish was caught by a fisherman and sold to a lady. The
lady wanted to cook the fish, so she cut it open and found the child still
alive there. So he did not die in the stomach of the fish because he was
destined to reach enlightenment in that life. Thatís why he was not killed.
Normally he would not survive being swallowed by a fish.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next story is about Venerable Sa~kicca. While he was in
the womb, his mother died. As was the custom in those days they tried to
cremate the body. When they cremate the body, they use sticks. One stick hit
the child. He made a noise. When they heard the noise, they cut open the belly
of the woman and got the child. He was named Sa~kicca because he was injured by
the stick which is called in P»ƒi sa~ku. That is why he was called Sa~kicca.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So many stories are given. There is also the story of
Bh|tap»la. Also those who are in attainment cannot be harmed. Such stories
begin in paragraph 30. Venerable S»riputta was in attainment and so no harm
could come to him. It is a similar case with Venerable Sa“j va and so on. I
think we had reference to the devotee Uttara some weeks back and also to
Samm»vati. They are to us miracles. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These miracles are caused by the intervention of
concentration or the intervention of knowledge and so on. These are interesting
stories. Some are not caused by any concentration or any meditation. The fact
that birds can fly is also called a success or miracle. They got that ability
just by birth, just by being born as a bird. So they can fly and we cannot. So
these ten kinds of success are mentioned in the first part of this chapter. OK.</p>
