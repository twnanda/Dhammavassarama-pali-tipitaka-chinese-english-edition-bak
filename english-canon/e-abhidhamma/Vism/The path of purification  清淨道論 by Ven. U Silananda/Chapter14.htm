<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Chapter 14</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we come to part 3 of the Path of Purification. The
author gives us information on three steps - s la, sam»dhi and pa““». Up
through chapter 13 the first two stages of s la and sam»dhi are explained. With
this chapter the explanation of understanding or pa““» begins the third stage
in spiritual development. ìDescription of the soil in which understanding
growsî - this is the soil of understanding or the soil of pa““». Chapter 14
deals with the aggregates. First there is discussion about pa““».</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìNow concentration was described under the heading of
consciousness in the stanza,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>ëWhen a wise
man, established well in Virtue,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††††† </span>Develops
Consciousness and Understandingí.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This stanza appeared at the beginning of the book. There we
find the word ëconsciousnessí. By consciousness is meant sam»dhi or
concentration. Concentration has been explained with different kinds of samatha
meditation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now it is time to talk about pa““». ìAnd that has developed
in all its aspects by the bhikkhu who is thus possessed of the more advanced
development of concentration that has acquired with direct knowledge the
benefits. But Understanding comes next. And that has still to be developed.î Up
to this point we have not yet developed understanding. We have developed
concentration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìNow that is not easy (the development of pa““»), firstly
even to know about, let alone to develop, when it is taught very briefly. In
order, therefore, to deal with the detailed method of its development there is
the following set of questions.î These questions will be answered one by one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìWhat is understanding? Understanding (pa““») is of many
sorts and has various aspects.î There are different kinds of pa““». ìAn answer
that attempted to explain it all would accomplish neither its intention nor its
purpose and would, besides lead to distraction; so we shall confine ourselves
to the kind intended here, which is understanding consisting in insight
knowledge associated with profitable consciousness.î Here ëunderstandingí means
kusala (wholesome or profitable) which accompanies the wholesome consciousness
and which consists in insight knowledge. The word ëvipassan»í in P»ƒi is in
fact a synonym for pa““». Vipassan» and pa““» are synonymously in many places.
By pa““» is meant vipassan», insight knowledge. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn what sense is it understanding?î It is the definition of
the word ëpa““»í. ìIt is understanding in the sense of act of understanding.î
These definitions are actually very difficult to translate into any language.
Understanding is pa““». Understanding is understanding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìWhat is this act of understanding? It is knowing in a
particular mode separate from the modes of perceiving and cognizing.î There are
three kinds of understanding or knowing. There is knowing of pa““». There is
knowing of sa““». And there is knowing of consciousness or vi““»”a. These three
are differentiated here. Pa““» is said to be called understanding or knowing
because it knows in a particular mode separate from (That means different from)
the modes of perceiving and cognizing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìFor though the state of knowing is equally present in
perception, in consciousness, and in understanding, nevertheless perception is
only the mere perceiving of an object as, say, ëblueí or ëyellowí.î Mere
perceiving of an object is called ëperception (sa““»)í. ìIt cannot bring about
the penetration of its characteristic as impermanent, painful and not-self.î
Maybe it is the first reaction to the object.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next one is consciousness. ìConsciousness knows the
object as blue or yellow, and it brings about the penetration of its
characteristics.î At the consciousness stage it knows the characteristics. ìBut
it cannot bring about, by endeavoring, the manifestation of the [supramundane]
Path. Understanding knows the objects in the way already stated - (That means
by both mere perception and penetration of characteristics.) it brings about,
by endeavoring, the manifestation of the path.î Pa““» is said to be the best of
the three. Only through pa““» can there be penetration into the nature of
things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then a simile is given. Suppose there were three people, a
child, a villager, and a money-changer or someone who is familiar with coins
and money. The understanding of these three persons is different. A child knows
that the coin is a round thing. It may not know that is used in exchange for
other things. It will know that it is a round thing, that it is yellow or it is
white or something like that. But a villager an ordinary knows that it is a
round thing made of copper or silver, or gold. He also knows that it can be
used as money. The money-changer or the person who is familiar with money know
all of what the villager and child know. He also knows that it is a coin, when
it was struck, when it was made. He knows the value of the coin and so on. He
knows everything there is to know about the coin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the same way ìperception is like the child without
discretion seeing the coin, because it apprehends the mere mode of appearance
object.î Consciousness is like the villager seeing the coin. Understanding is
like the money-changer seeing the coin and then understanding everything about
the coin. This is the difference between kinds of knowing - knowing of sa““»,
knowing of consciousness, knowing of pa““».</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In these three words there is the root ë“aí. In sa““» there
is ë“aí. In vi““»”a there is ë“aí. And in pa““» there is ë“aí. The root ë“aí
means to know. All these three know the object, but their knowing is different.
The knowing of pa““» is the most penetrating.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThat is why this act of understanding should be understood
as ëknowing in a particular mode separate from the modes of perceiving and
cognizingí. For that is what the words ëit is understanding in the sense of act
of understandingí refer to.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHowever, it is not always to bee found where perception and
consciousness are.î There are 89 types of consciousness. Not all are
accompanied by pa““». Only some are accompanied by pa““». Unwholesome types of
consciousness are not accompanied by pa““». Then among the wholesome and functional
consciousness there are some which are not accompanied by pa““». ìHowever, it
is not always to be found where perception and consciousness are. But when it
is, it is not disconnected from those states.î So pa““» can be found with some
types of consciousness, but perception accompanies every type of consciousness.
Wherever there is perception and consciousness, there is not necessarily pa““».
Wherever there is pa““», there is also perception and consciousness. When it is
found with perception and consciousness, it is not disconnected from these
states. That means it arises with these states. It is not mixed up with
perception and consciousness - mixed up by way of characteristic and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd because it cannot be taken as disconnected thus ëThis
is perception, this is consciousness, this is understandingí, its difference is
consequently subtle and hard to see.î For ordinary people it is very difficult
to see, to differentiate, this is perception, this is consciousness, this is
understanding, this is contact and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here Venerable Nagasena said to King Milinda that the Buddha
has done a very difficult thing. What is that difficult thing? ìDefining of the
immaterial states of consciousness and its concomitants which occur with a
single object.î That means consciousness and mental concomitants arise at the
same time taking the same object. Although they take the same object, they are
by characteristic or by nature different.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe difficult thing, O King, done by the Blessed One was
the defining of the immaterial states of consciousness and its concomitants,
which occur with a single object, and which he declared thus: This is contact,
this is feeling, this is perception, this is volition, this is consciousness.î
It is very difficult for ordinary people to see these states clearly, to be
able to say this is contact, this is feeling and so on. Following the Buddhaís
teachings and through practicing vipassan» meditation many of these mental
states can be seen, or known, or experienced. Many meditators come to see these
mental states clearly through the practice of vipassan» meditation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then Venerable Nagasena gave a simile. You pick up a handful
of water from the ocean. It would be easier that this water is from one river
and that water is from another river and so on. It is much more difficult to
say that this is contact, this is feeling and so on when consciousness and its
concomitants arise taking the same object. Pa““» when it arises with
consciousness and perception is a different dhamma. It is not mixed with the
other concomitants. It is like people walking together. Each person is
different from the other one. They come together and they do some job together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìWhat are its characteristic, function, manifestation and
proximate cause?î We have to understand with regard to these four aspects
taught in Abhidhamma - characteristic, function, mode of manifestation and
proximate cause. You will find these a lot in this chapter and the next
chapter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìUnderstanding has the characteristic of penetrating the
individual essence of states.î That means penetrating the nature of things,
penetrating the individual nature or characteristic of things as well as
penetrating the common characteristic of things. Each state has its own
characteristic. If you watch closely, you will come to see the characteristic
of these states. Then there is the common characteristic of all states, of all
conditioned states. That is impermanence and so on. That you also see through
pa““» or understanding. The characteristic of pa““» is penetrating the
individual essence of states or the nature of states.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIts function is to abolish the darkness of delusion.î It is
like lightening. When lightening flashes, darkness is dispelled. The dispelling
of darkness or here darkness of delusion is its function. It is delusion which
conceals the individual essences of states. So delusion or ignorance is
compared to darkness. When there is darkness, we cannot see things in this
room. If this room is dark, we cannot see things in this room. If there is
light, we can see things. Just as darkness hides things from being seen, so
ignorance or delusion conceal the individual essences of states. We do not know
the individual essence of states because there is ignorance or delusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIt is manifested as non-delusion.î When you watch pa““»
itself, it will appear to your mind as non-delusion. ìBecause of the word ëOne
who is concentrated knows and sees correctlyí its proximate cause is
concentration.î The pa““» meant here, that is vipassan» pa““». Its proximate
cause is concentration. That is why I always say concentration is important.
When there is no concentration, no pa““» or penetration into the nature of
things can arise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are many kinds of pa““». Pa““» is one according to its
characteristic of penetrating the individual essence. It is two, paragraph 9
ìAs regards the twofold section, the mundane is that associated with the
mundane path.î ëMundane pathí means the factors of Path especially during
vipassan» meditation. During vipassan» meditation the factors of Path arise in
your mind - Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration and Right
Understanding. So mundane understanding is that associated with the mundane
path (That means vipassan» meditation.) ìAnd the supramundane is that associated
with the supramundane Path.î That is at the moment of enlightenment. At the
moment of enlightenment what is called ëPath consciousnessí arises. Pa““»
accompanying that consciousness is called supramundane pa““». So it is of two
kinds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the second dyad, that subject to cankers is that which
is the object of cankers.î Or we can just say mental defilements, which can be
the object of mental defilements. ìThat free from cankers is not their objectî,
so which cannot be the object of mental defilements. ìThis dyad is the same in
meaning as the mundane and supramundane.î ëSubject to cankersí means mundane.
ëFree from cankersí means the supramundane. ìThe same method applies to the
dyads, ësubject to cankers and free from cankersí, and so on.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the third dyad, when a man wants to begin insight, his
understanding of the defining of the four immaterial aggregates is
understanding as defining of mentality.î ëDefining of mentalityí, that means
clearly seeing or clearly understanding mentally. Clearly seeing or clearly
understanding materiality is defining of materiality. It is of two kinds. In
short it is understanding of mind and understanding of matter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the fourth dyad, understanding belonging to two of the
kinds of sense-sphere profitable consciousness, and belonging to sixteen of the
kinds of Path consciousnesses with four of the jh»nas in the fivefold method is
accompanied by joy.î Sense-sphere profitable consciousness that is k»m»vacara
kusala. Two of the kinds, two of them, belonging to 16 kinds of the Path
consciousness with four of the jh»nas in the fivefold method is accompanied by
joy. What is sixteen? The four Paths with the first jh»na and those with the
second, third and fourth out of the five. Now the Commentator is using the
fivefold method of jh»nas, not the fourfold method of jh»nas. The first,
second, third, and fourth jh»nas are accompanied by joy. The fifth is
accompanied by equanimity. ëAccompanied by joyí means jh»nas up to the fourth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìUnderstanding belonging to two of the kinds of sense-sphere
profitable consciousness, and belonging to (the remaining) four kinds of Path
consciousness with the fifth jh»na is accompanied by equanimity.î There is
pa““» accompanied by joy and there is pa““» accompanied by equanimity. In the
sense-sphere consciousness two are accompanied by joy and two are accompanied
by equanimity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the fifth dyad, understanding belonging to the first
Path is the plane of seeing.î ëSeeingí means seeing Nibb»na in the first place
or the initial seeing of Nibb»na. ëPlane of seeingí means that belonging to the
first Path. The first Path is called ëseeingí or ëdassanaí in P»ƒi because it
sees Nibb»na first. Understanding belonging to the remaining three Paths, that
is the second, third and fourth Paths, is the plane of development (bh»van»).î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAs regards the triads, understanding acquired without
hearing from another is that consisting in what is reasoned.î That means
understanding from oneís own thinking. It is understanding which arises from
oneís own thinking. It is not heard from others or not from having read books.
That is understanding from what is reasoned or from what is thought. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second one is understanding from what is heard. That
means understanding attained through listening to others or through reading
books. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The last one is understanding consisting in development.
Here ëdevelopmentí means the practice of meditation. So understanding obtained
through the practice of meditation is that which consists in development. There
are three kinds of pa““» mentioned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then there is a quotation about five lines down. ìThat
concerns ownership of deeds (kamma)î - that means understanding that beings
have kamma only as their own. ìOr is in conformity with truthî - that just
means vipassan» because vipassan» helps us to see the true nature of things. So
ëin conformity with truthí here just means vipassan». </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 15 ìThe understanding that occurs contingent upon
sense-sphere states has a limited object.î That means understanding that takes
sense-sphere states as object. That is called ëunderstanding which has a
limited objectí. Then there is understanding that takes the
fine-material-sphere states or immaterial sphere states as an object. It is
called an exalted object or pa““» having an exalted object. This is mundane insight.
ìThat which occurs contingent upon Nibb»na has a measureless object. That is
supramundane insight.î ëInsightí means vipassan» and vipassan» is mundane, not
supramundane. When you reach the enlightenment stage or the enlightenment
moment, it becomes supramundane. In fact there is no supramundane insight.
Insight is always mundane. Here by supramundane insight the author meant Path
understanding, understanding of Path, and not vipassan» understanding. So
understanding is of three kinds. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIt is increase that is called ëimprovementí. That is
twofold as the elimination of harm and the arousing of good. Skill in
improvement is skill in these, according as it is said.î This is skill in
improvement, skill in development. The next one is skill in detriment. That
means taking the diminution of good and the arousing of harm. Then the third
one in paragraph 18 ìBut in either of these cases any skill in means and causes
of productionî - ëmeans and ëcauses of production are the same here. ëMeansí
means just the cause of production. ìOf such and such things, which skill
occurs at that moment and is aroused on that occasion is what is called ëskill
in meansí.î I think you are familiar with the word ëup»yaí. It is used a lot by
people here. ëUp»yaí is translated here as means. So skill in means is up»ya
kosalla, skill in understanding how to do things in a given moment. ìAnd it is
aroused on that occasion.î That means it just pops up when there is some
occasion. It is not pre-meditated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the fourth triad, insight understanding initiated by
apprehending oneís own aggregates is interpreting the internal.î Here
ëinterpretingí means reflecting upon or paying attention to. That is internal.
External is taking other peopleís aggregates as object of meditation. That is
external. ëBothí is interpreting the internal and external. There is a footnote
for the word ëabhinivesaí in P»ƒi. The author said at the end it is
interpretation or misinterpretation and insistence. ëInterpretationí means
something like a view on a given object. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then we have tetrads. There are four kinds of knowledge or
four kinds of understanding - the understanding of suffering (the First Noble
Truth), the understanding of the origin of suffering (the Second Noble Truth),
the understanding of the cessation of suffering (the Third Noble Truth), and
understanding of the way leading to the cessation of suffering (the Fourth
Noble Truth).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the next tetrad is the four kinds of discrimination.
These four kinds of discrimination are mentioned in the Commentaries very
often. Sometimes when the enlightenment of a person is described the books,
they would say that he gained enlightenment along with the four
discriminations. That is a special knowledge. We do not have to practice in a
special way. We just practice vipassan» meditation. When you become
enlightened, then these four kinds of knowledge automatically come to you.
These are called ëthe four discriminationsí or ëpa‘isambhid»í. ìKnowledge about
meaning is the discrimination of meaning. Knowledge about law is the
discrimination of law. Knowledge about emancipation of language dealing with
meaning and law is the discrimination of language. Knowledge about kinds of
knowledge is discrimination of perspicuity.î There are four kinds of
discrimination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHerein, meaning (attha) is briefly a term for the fruit of
a cause.î The P»ƒi word is attha. ëAtthaí can mean result, or purpose, and also
fruit, and meaning. If we just translate it as ëmeaningí, it may create some
misunderstanding. It is difficult to translate this word into any language. As
we will see the word ëatthaí here means five things - (1) anything
conditionally produced, (2) Nibb»na, (3) the meaning of what is spoken (That
means the meaning of words.), (4) result of kamma, (5) functional consciousness.
These things should be understood as ëmeaning (attha)í. When we say ëknowledge
about meaningí or ëdiscrimination of meaningí, it means knowledge about these
five things. ìWhen any one reviews that meaning any knowledge of his, falling
within the category concerned with meaning, is the discrimination of meaning.î
So ëdiscrimination of meaningí means understanding of things conditionally
produced, understanding of Nibb»na, understanding the meaning of words,
understanding of result of kamma, and understanding of functional
consciousness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next one is law. ìLaw (dhamma) is briefly a term for
condition. For since a condition necessitates whatever it may be, makes it
occur or allows it to happen, it is therefore called ëlaw (dhamma)í.î
ëDiscrimination of lawí means understanding of the condition or understanding
of the cause. ìBut in particular the five things, namely, (1) any cause that
produces fruit, (2) the Noble Path (It is the cause of the Fruition.), (3) what
is spoken (That means words or language.), (4) what is profitable (kusala), (5)
what is unprofitable (akusala), should be understood as law.î By the word
ëdhammaí these five things are meant. ìWhen any<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>one reviews that law, any knowledge of his, falling within the category
concerned with law, is the discrimination of law.î Discrimination of condition
or discrimination of causes is law. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThis same meaning is shown in the Abhidhamma by following
the following analysis.î There is a quotation from the second book of
Abhidhamma.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let us go to paragraph 25. ìKnowledge about enunciation of
language dealing with meaning and law: there is language that is individual
essence.î The word ësabh»vaí is normally translated as individual essence. But
here the meaning of the word ësabh»vaí is explained in the Sub-Commentary as
correct or as that which does not change or which does bit deteriorate. That is
called ësabh»va niruttií in P»ƒi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe usage that has no exceptionsî - that means that is
definite, that is not ambiguous. ìAnd deals with that meaning and that law. And
knowledge falling within the category concerned with the enunciation of that,
with the speaking, with the utterance of that, concerned with the root-speech
of all beings, the Magadhan language that is individual essenceî - in Therav»da
Buddhism the Magadhan language is said to be the root speech of all beings, the
original language of all beings. So the belief of Therav»da Buddhists is that
the Magadhan language or the P»ƒi language as we know it now is the original
language of all beings. After many, many years different people developed
different dialects. Then they became different languages. This is the belief of
Ancient Teachers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: So the mother language is P»ƒi?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Yes, the mother language is taken to be P»ƒi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Is this true or is it legend?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: I think the present day P»ƒi is the closest to the
language used by the Buddha. It is difficult to say that it is the language of
the Buddha because we really donít know which language the Buddha used. But the
Buddha used the language that was current at his time and which was understood
by all people, not just by high-class people only. Once two Brahmans who became
monks asked him to turn his teachings into Vedic Sanskrit. The Buddha rejected
them. The Buddha said ìMy Dhamma is for all people, not for a select few.î So
he used the language which was understood by all people, the common language.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Now there are many languages in India. Buddha
traveled great distances in India. Could it be that there was a more common language
at that time?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: We donít really know. There may be different
languages in different parts or different dialects in different parts of the
country. The language he spoke may have been understood by all people where he
roamed. That language is said to be m|la bhassa (root-speech) of all beings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn other words, the language of law as soon as it hears it
spoken, pronounced, uttered, knows ëThis is the individual-essence language;
this is not the individual-essence languageí - [such knowledge] is
discrimination of language.î That means it is the correct language, this is not
the correct language, something like that. A person who has this kind of
discrimination knows that this is grammatically correct and this is not. Then
an example is given here. ìone who has reached the discrimination of language
knows, on hearing the words ëphasso, vedan»,í etc., that this is the
individual-essence language (That means this is the correct language.)<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>and on hearing ëphass», vedanoí, etc., he
knows that this is not the individual-essence language.î It is not the correct
word or correct language because the word phassa is masculine gender ands when
it is in the nominative case it is phasso. It can never be phass» in the
nominative case. When phass» is said, you know this is wrong. This is
grammatically wrong. The word ëvedan»í belongs to the feminine gender. It is
never in the masculine gender. So if you say ëvedanoí, then you put a feminine
word into masculine gender and so it is wrong. If you do not know P»ƒi and you
try to get enlightenment and get these four kinds of discrimination, then you
will automatically understand P»ƒi. That is what is meant here. So P»ƒi
language is said to be the root-speech of all beings, of the rest of the
languages. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The language that we will call P»ƒi is never mentioned as
P»ƒi in the Commentaries. In the Commentaries it is referred to as Magadhan
language or root language. The word ëP»ƒií means simply Text as opposed to
Commentaries and Sub-Commentaries. Later on since it was the language in which
the Texts were recorded, we call it P»ƒi language. The term ëP»ƒi languageí is
of recent origin. The term was not used by the Commentaries or the
Sub-Commentaries. What they used were the words ëm|la bhassaí, or ëMagadhaí, or
ëMagadhi bhassaí - the language of the Magadhan country. It was like a state in
this country. During the time of the Buddha there were what we call í16
countriesí. However they were not countries but states or districts. Magadha
was one of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìKnowledge about kinds of knowledgeî - that is know. This is
knowledge of perspicuity. These four kinds of discrimination - we can make them
clear, we can make them sharp. We can make ourselves adept in the four kinds of
discrimination by five means.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†</span>The five means are
given in paragraph 28. ìAnd though they come into the categories of the two
planes thus, they are nevertheless distinguishable in five aspects, that is to
say, as achievementî and so on. Actually they can be brought to perfection by
these five things - by achievement (That means by enlightenment.), by mastery
of scriptures, by hearing, by questioning, by prior effort.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAchievement is the reaching of Arahantship.î It is the best
mentioned here. Reaching of the other stages of enlightenment is also meant
here. ìëMastery of scripturesí is mastery of Buddhaís word. ëHearingí is
learning the Dhamma carefully and attentively. ëQuestioningí is discussion of
knotty passages and explanatory passages in the Texts, Commentaries and so on.
ëPrior effortí is devotion to insight in the dispensation of former Buddhas (So
it is like a p»ramit».), up to the vicinity of [the stages of] conformity and
change-of-lineage by one who has practiced [the duty of] going [with the
meditation subject on alms round] and coming back [with it].îMonks are
described as of different kinds. There are monks who take meditation even when
they go to the village for alms and also take back meditation to the monastery.
That means when they go to the village, they go with meditation and when they
come back from the village, they come back with meditation. There are such
persons. They have practiced meditation in this way. That is what is meant by
ëgoing with the meditation subject on alms round and coming back with ití. They
may have reached the stage of vipassan» just short of enlightenment. If they
are enlightened, they donít have to worry about practicing again to gain
enlightenment. So here ëup to the vicinity of the stages of conformity and
change-of-lineageí simply means just short of enlightenment. ëThose who have
practiced vipassan» in the dispensation of former Buddhasí (That means in their
former lives just short of enlightenment.) such endeavor is called ëprior
effortí. Such people may get enlightenment in this life and may get these four
kinds of discrimination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some others said in a different way, but they are more or
less the same. They are prior effort, great learning, knowledge of dialects,
knowledge of scriptures, questioning, and achievement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was believed that there were only 101 languages during
the time of the Buddha. ì ëDialectsí means skill in the 101 tongues,
particularly in that Magadha.î But even in one country there are more than 100
languages or 100 dialects. It is the stock phrase used in the Commentaries
whenever they want to refer to languages, they say 101 languages. It may be
something like saying 1001 things, an expression.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHerein, Buddhas and Undeclared Buddhas (That means Pacceka
Buddhas.) reach the discrimination through prior effort and through
achievement. Disciples do so through all these means. And there is no special
way of developing a meditation subject in order to attain discriminations. But
in trainers the attaining of the discriminations comes about next upon the
liberation consisting in trainerís Fruition, and in non-trainers (That means
Arahants.) it does so next upon the liberation consisting in non-trainerís
Fruition.î Those who have reached the first, second, and third stages of
enlightenment are called ëtrainersí. Those who have reached the fourth stage,
the Arahants, are called ënon-trainersí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHow is it developed? Now the things classed as aggregates,
bases, elements, faculties, truths, dependent origination, etc., are the soil
of this understanding ( or the field of this understanding), and the [first]
two purifications, namely, Purification of Virtue and Purification of
Consciousness, are its roots.î They are called ëroot purificationí. The other
five are called ëtrunk purificationí or ëbody purificationí. There are seven
kinds of purification with regard to the practice of vipassan» meditation. The
first one is called Purification of Virtue. Actually it is not yet vipassan»,
but preparing for vipassan». Then the second one is Purification of
Consciousness or Purification of Mind. That means concentration. Then there is
Purification of View. Next is Purification by Overcoming Doubt. Next is
Purification of Knowledge and Vision of What is the Path and What is not the
Path. Then there is Purification by Knowledge and Vision of the Way. And next there
is Purification by Knowledge and Vision. These are the seven stages of purity
with regard to the practice of vipassan» meditation. This book will describe
these purifications one by one beginning with chapter 18. That means
Purification of View because Purification of Virtue and Purification of
Consciousness are already described.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we come to the aggregates, the five aggregates. You are
all familiar with the five aggregates, the five khandhas. The first one is
r|pa,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>aggregate of corporeality<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>or aggregate of matter. The second one is
aggregate of feeling. The third is the aggregate of perception. The fourth is
the aggregate of mental formations. And the fifth is the aggregate of
consciousness. In this chapter they are not described in this order. First the
aggregate of r|pa is described and then the aggregate of consciousness. Then
the aggregate of feeling and so on are described.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first one is the aggregate of r|pa. R|pa is defined as,
in paragraph 34, ìthat have the characteristic of being molested by cold, etc.î
In Myanmar we understand this word as meaning to change. So anything that
changes because of cold, heat, hungry, thirst, bite of insects and so on is
called ër|paí. ëRuppanaí means to change When it is cold, you have one kind of
material properties. When it is hot, there is another kind of material property
and so on. ëChangeí here does not mean that something changes into some other
thing, but the arising of a different continuity of matter is called ëchangeí.
According to Abhidhamma materiality only lasts for a few moments, only 17
thought moments. After that they disappear. So ëchangeí here means the arising
of a different kind of material property due to heat, cold, etc. That is what
we call ëchangeí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And broadly there are two kinds of matter - primary entity
and derived material properties. ëDerivedí does not mean descended from, but it
means depending on. I prefer to use the word ëdependentí rather than ëderivedí.
There are the primary ones and the depending ones. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We need a house in which to live. The house is what we
depend upon. In the same way the 24 material properties to be mentioned later
depend upon the four primary elements for their arising and for their
existence. They are not derived from these four, but they depend upon these
four for their existence. For our survival we depend upon buildings, on houses.
We are not produced by houses, but we depend upon the houses to live in, to
have shelter and protection. In the same way the 24 material properties are not
derived from the four great elements, but they depend upon these four for their
existence, for their arising. That is why they are called ëup»d»yaí in P»ƒi.
That means depending ones.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìPrimary materiality is of four kinds as the earth element,
water element, fire element, and air element.î We have met with these four
elements in chapter 6 of The Manual of Abhidhamma.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìDepending materiality is of 24 kinds as eye, ear, nose,
tongue, body, visible datum, sound, odor, flavor, femininity faculty,
masculinity faculty, life faculty, heart-basis; bodily intimation, verbal
intimation; space element; lightness of matter, malleability of matter,
wieldiness of matter, growth of matter, continuity of matter, aging of matter,
death of matter, and physical nutriment.î There are 24. 24 plus 4, we get 28.
In Abhidhamma there are said to be 28 material properties. 4 are primary and 24
are those depending upon them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you look at the list closely, you will notice that there
is eye, ear, nose, tongue and body. And corresponding to them there should be
five, but there are only four here - visible datum for the eye, sound for the
ear, odor for the nose, flavor for the tongue. For the body nothing is
mentioned. That is because what we call tangible datum is just the group of
three primary elements (earth element, fire element and air element). The
combination of these three elements is what we call tangible datum. That is why
it is not mentioned here. If it is mentioned, then we would have 25 and there
would be confusion. We are not to understand that there is no such thing as
tangibility. Corresponding to the bodily sensitivity there must be tangible
objects. We have body sensitivity. For example I have body sensitivity in my
skin and when I touch something, I have the feeling of touch. I experience the
feeling of touch, that tangible object. There is tangible object, but it is not
different from the three primary elements mentioned above. That is why it is
not mentioned here. There are 24. These 24 are explained in detail . Their
characteristic, function, mode of manifestation and proximate cause are all
mentioned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 37 towards the end ìIts function is to <u>pick up</u>
[an object] among visible data.î Actually it is not picking up. The P»ƒi word
is ë»vi“chanaí. That means to pull, so to pull the mind to the object, to take
the mind to the object. It is not like picking up an object, but to pull or
maybe push the mind to the object. ìIt is manifested as the <u>footing</u> of
eye consciousness.î I think we should say ëthe basis of eye consciousnessí. That
is better. That means eye consciousness cannot arise if there is no eye or no
eye sensitivity in our bodies. So it is the basis for eye consciousness. ìIts
proximate cause is primary elements born of kamma sourcing from desire to see.î
We have some desire to see. That desire makes kamma and kamma causes the
elements. So the primary elements caused by kamma are its proximate cause.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then we have ear, nose, tongue. They can be understood
without much difficulty. Paragraph 42 ìSome, however, say that eye is
sensitivity of primary elements that have fire in excessî and so on. ì ëSomeí
are certain Mah»sa~ghikas.î Mah»sa~ghikas are those who divided themselves from
the original Sa~gha at the second Buddhist Council. Before the second Buddhist
Council there was a difference of opinion among monks about the practice of
certain Vinaya Rules. They could not come to agreement. So they divided
themselves away from the original Sa~gha and they are called ëMah»sa~ghikasí.
Mah»sa~ghikas have this view. One of them was Vasudhamma. Maybe, I donít know,
in Sanskrit or among the teachers of this sect there is a teacher called
Vasubhantu. It may be the same person. The name Vasudhamma was given in the
Sub-Commentary to the Visuddhi Magga. This is a difference of opinion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let us go to paragraph 46. Even among Therav»da Buddhists
there is a difference of opinion about whether sensitivities take the objects
when they come into contact with them or before the objects reach them.
Paragraph 46 explains this. ìNow among these [sensitivities thus] possessed of
difference due to difference of kamma, the eye and the ear apprehend
non-contiguous objective fields since consciousness is caused even if the
supporting [primaries] of the objective fields do not adhere to the [faculties]
own supporting primaries.î The meaning is this: Eye and ear take the object
which has not reached them. Before the objects reach them, they take the
object. That is what is meant here. It may or may not be correct, but the
opinion of Venerable Buddhaghosa and later teachers is that. The eyes and ears
take objects which have not reached them. Before the objects reach them, they
take the objects, before they come into physical contact with the
sensitivities. Eye takes the visible object. ëVisible objectí just means color.
Before it really touches the eye, it takes the object. That is because if you
say eye sensitivity only takes the object when it touches it, then the object
would have to come an would block the passage of light. The opinion of the
later Commentators including the Venerable Buddhaghosa was that these two
sensitivities take the objects before the objects reach them. But the other
three (nose, tongue and body) only take the object when it comes to them or
when the object adheres to the sensitivities. Let us take smell as an example.
Unless it adheres to the nose, we do not experience smell. If the smell is some
distance away from us and does not come into contact with our nose, then we do
not experience smell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: What is the difference between the eyes going out
to meet the object and the object coming to the eyes? How would you know which
is correct? What is the difference in understanding? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Thatís right. There are arguments on both sides.
Considering sound waves, we may not agree with what Venerable Buddhaghosa said
here. Because only when sound waves strike against the ear drum, do we hear
sound. Right? So sound must come into physical contact with the ear sensitivity
in order to hear. So we may side with later Teachers like Venerable Buddhaghosa
or with former Commentators. Venerable Buddhaghosa is said to be a later or new
Commentator. Before him there were older Commentators. Those Commentators took
it that the eye and ear took objects which came into contact with them. That is
the difference of opinion. If you have The Expositor, I will give you the page
number for reference. It is explained more fully there. It is in The Expositor,
page 410.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The eye sensitivity is described here. It says that it looks
like a blue lotus petal. During the time of the Commentators they thought that
the black part of the eye was a solid thing, not a window. The black part is
like a window, right? It can become small or big. What we gather from the
writings of the Commentators is that they take this to be a real thing. So eye
sensitivity is supposed to reside in that place - ìsurrounded by black
eyelashes and varied with dark and light circles. The eye [sensitivity as
meant] here is to be found in the place in the middle of the black circle
surrounded by the white circle in that [feature of the] eye with its
accessoriesî and so on. Eye sensitivity resides on a place that looks like a
blue lotus petal. The black part of the eye is compared to a blue lotus petal.
It is said that many particles of eye sensitivity pervade that place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then we have ear sensitivity. Ear sensitivity resides in a
place like a finger-stall. What is a ëfinger-stallí? Is it a ring? Please look
at paragraph 49. ìThe ear [sensitivity] is to be found inside the [feature of
the] ear hole with its accessories in the place that is shaped like a
finger-stall.î That means a ring. It is something like a ring in the inner ear.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the nose is like a goatís hoof. The tongue is like a
lotus petal tip. And the body is like liquid that soaks a layer of cotton. The
body sensitivity is found everywhere. The whole of the body is pervaded by the
body sensitivity except for the nails and the hair. ìIn this physical body
where there is matter that is <u>clung-to</u>î - I think the footnote is good.
ìIt is vaguely renderable by ëorganic or sentient or living matterí.î That is
right. ìTechnically it is matter of the four primaries that is ëclung-toí or
ëderivedí by kamma.î It is not necessarily born of kamma. Everything that is
connected with living beings is called ëup»di””aí in P»ƒi. Something like
organic or sentient is better.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then these are compared to snakes, crocodiles, birds, dogs
and jackals. The eyes are compared to snakes, the ears to crocodiles, the nose
to birds, the tongue to dogs, and the body to jackals. They gravitate to their
own respective resorts. Snakes live in ant-hills. Crocodiles live in water.
Birds live in air or space. Dogs live in villages. Jackals live in charnel
grounds. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Eye is said to be like a snake. A snake likes to be in a
place where there are many things. The eye also wants to see many things. If
the wall is plain the eye does not want to see. The eye wants to see different
things - intricate patterns, paintings, things like that. The eye is compared
to a snake. A snake does not want to be where there is nothing. It wants to be
where there is debris. So the sensitivities are compared to these animals. You
can read in more detail in The Expositor, page 411.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then we come to visible datum. That means the visible object
or color. Then there is sound, odor, flavor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next there is femininity faculty. ìThe femininity faculty
has the female sex as its characteristic. Its function is to show that ëthis is
a femaleí. It is manifested as the reason for the mark, sign, work, and ways,
of the female.î Please read The Expositor, page 419. Women have different
marks, different signs, different work, and different ways of doing things than
men. By looking at them, we know ëthis is a womaní and ëthis is a maní. That
peculiarity in a woman is called ëfemininityí and in a man it is called
ëmasculinityí. Sometimes we may see someone by a silhouette and we know that it
is a man or that it is a woman. Or sometimes we know that it is a man or that
it is a woman by how they walk. Sometimes we know when they are children by how
they play and so on. Boys would play fighting with each other. Girls would play
cooking or something like that. These two also extend throughout the whole
body, not just in some parts of the body. ìBut it does not follow that they
have to be called either ëlocated in the space where body sensitivity is
locatedí or ëlocated in the space where that is not locatedí.î Body sensitivity
pervades the whole body also. And masculinity and femininity pervade the whole
body. It does not follow that they have to be located where body sensitivity is
located. When there is body sensitivity, then we cannot say that at the same
place there is masculinity or femininity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: I heard once that the first thing we notice about
somebody is their sex, whether they are a man or a woman. Thatís the first
thing we notice. Thatís what you are saying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Yes. We may not see a person, but we hear them talk
and we know ëthis is a womaní or ëthis is a maní. There are marks or signs of
feminine sex or masculine sex. Femininity or masculinity reside in the whole of
the body. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next is the life faculty. This is j vita in P»ƒi. In this
paragraph instead of ëoccurí we should say ëexistí. ìIts function is to make
them <u>occur</u>.î It is not ëto make them occurí, but ëto make them to
continue to existí. They occur by some other causes. After they arise this life
faculty maintains them or protects them. Its characteristic is not to make them
occur, but to make them to continue to exist for a very short moment. So instead
of ëoccurí we should use ëexistí. About the middle of the paragraph ìAnd it <u>occurs</u>
itself only through its connection with the states that <u>occur</u>, like a
pilot.î Here also ìIt exists itself only through its connection with the states
that it maintains.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is said that life faculty maintains the conascent
material properties. J vita is the one that maintains them, that keeps them
from dissolving. If life faculty maintains others, then what maintains the life
faculty? That is the problem here. If you are the protector of others, who is
the protector of you? The answer is that it protects itself. In protecting
others it protects itself too. It is like a boatman. When a boatman takes you
to the other shore, he takes himself too. That is the point here, but it is not
so clear reading this sentence. The meaning is just this. If life faculty
protects others, what protects it? It protects itself. ëLike a pilotí means
like a man who rows the boat, a boatman. It is important to understand this
correctly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIt does not cause occurrence after dissolution, because of
its own absence and that of what has been made to occur. It does not prolong
presence at the moment of dissolution (There are three moments -arising,
presence and dissolution.) because it is itself dissolving, like the flame of a
lamp when the wick and the oil are getting used up. But it must not be regarded
as destitute of power, to maintain, make <u>occur</u> (We should say ëmake
existí.), and make present, because it does accomplish each of these functions
at the moments stated.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then we come to the heart-base. I have talked about
heart-base many times. So I think you understand about the heart-base. There is
a discussion of the heart-base in footnote 26. In brief the heart-base is not
mentioned in the first book of Abhidhamma. Even in the last book of Abhidhamma,
the Pa‘‘h»na, it is not mentioned by name. Buddha just said ìDepending upon a
certain material property mind element and mind element consciousness arise.î
That ëcertain material propertyí is interpreted to mean the heart-base. The
question is how that is to be known, how do you know that it is heart-base. Two
lines of argument are given. One is from the scriptures and one is from logical
reasoning. ëLogical reasoningí means by the method of elimination. Buddha said
that there is a certain material property which is the basis of mind element
and mind element consciousness. That basis cannot be the eye, cannot be the ear
and so on. Eliminating one after the other, there is something remaining and that
is the heart-base. So when the Commentators say that is the heart-base, it is
somewhat arbitrary. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These two arguments are given. There is this argument and
also one from the scriptures. From the scriptures also I said that no where in
the scriptures is the heart-base mentioned by name by the Buddha. They say that
the Buddha did not mention the hear‘-base in the first book of Abhidhamma
because Buddha had to conform to a certain way of preaching, a certain way of
teaching, for unity of his method of teaching. In order not to break the unity
of teaching he left the heart-base out when he described the material
properties. That is the argument in brief. The second one is arrived at by the
method of elimination. So the Commentators at last arrive at saying heart-base
is what is meant by the Buddha. Please read footnote 26. It may be a little
difficult to understand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>OK. Please read up to consciousness aggregate for next week,

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We havenít finished the first aggregate yet. We are in the
middle of the aggregate of matter. Paragraph 61 deals with bodily intimation
and paragraph 62 deals with verbal intimation. There is a long footnote which
is very difficult to understand. Part of the translation is incorrect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBodily intimation is the mode (conformation) and the
alteration (deformation) in the consciousness originated air element that
causes the occurrence of moving forward, etc., which mode and alteration are a
condition for the stiffening, upholding, and moving, of the conascent material
body.î What is bodily intimation? After reading this definition, you donít know
what it is. So I will tell you. We let other people know our intentions by
bodily gestures. That bodily gesture is what we call ëbodily intimationí in the
language of the books. Bodily intimation is one of the 28 material properties.
Bodily intimation is not air element. That is because if air element were
bodily intimation, then wherever there is air element there would be intimation
and there is not. So air element cannot be bodily intimation. Then is citta
born matter bodily intimation? There are other citta born material properties
too. They are not intimation. They do not help us to know the intention of
people. Therefore citta born matter is also not bodily intimation. Is movement
bodily intimation? If it were, there would be intimation in the movement of
trees, in the movement of inanimate things. There is no intimation from these
things. So bodily intimation is a particular mode of air element which is
caused by citta, citta which causes going forward, going back and so on. This
mode is the condition for there to be stiffening or upholding of the limbs of
the body and so on. That particular mode is what is meant by bodily intimation.
We cannot pick up bodily intimation and show you this is bodily intimation. It
is just a particular mode of the air element. Here the air element is predominate.
Where there is movement, there is this air element. Movement is caused by the
air element. This air element is caused by citta here. Bodily intimation means
just a particular mode of the air element which is caused by citta. That citta
can cause the arising of moving, of going forward, stretching, bending and
others. But there is not intimation in all movements, it is only in the
movements of beings, especially human beings. If we want to let someone know
that he should come, we use a kind of<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>gesture. In this country you use this gesture. If he sees this gesture,
then he knows that we want him to come. That particular mode in the movement of
the hand is what we mean by bodily intimation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Verbal intimation means a particular mode of earth element.
For bodily intimation it is air element, but here it is earth element, a
particular mode of earth element which is caused by citta which causes speech.
When we want to say something, then there is citta or the intention. That citta
cause the earth element in the place where voice is made in the vocal chords.
ëVocal chordsí is not the word used in the books, but let us say vocal chords.
In these vocal chords there is matter caused by kamma. There is kamma born
matter in the vocal chords along with other kinds of material properties. When
we want to say something, our mind produces the earth element, many particles
of earth element. These come together - the earth elements caused by citta and
the material properties in the vocal chords. There is something like friction.
That friction causes the voice to arise. So there is the voice. So verbal
intimation is not just the voice. It is not just the earth element. It is not
just kamma born matter, but it is a particular mode in the earth element which
causes voice or speech. Through speech we understand what the other person
intends or what the other person wants us to know. You hear my voice. It is not
just the voice. These are words. Through these words you understand the
meaning. For the sake of convenience we can say that the articulation of words
is what we call verbal intimation, but actually it is a particular mode of the
earth element caused by citta coming together with the kamma born matter in the
vocal chords. That is called verbal intimation. For convenience we can just say
speech is verbal intimation. Through speech, through word we make people
understand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to understand other peopleís intention or the
meaning of words we need two conditions. First we must hear the words. Second
we must have known the meaning of the words before. Only when these two
conditions are met, will there be understanding. That is why when you speak
quickly, I do not understand you. That is because I do not hear the words
distinctly. Sometimes you may use a word which I do not know the meaning. Then
I will not understand you. There are two conditions. The words or voice must
come into the avenue of the ear and you must hear clearly. The other condition
is that you must have known the meaning of the words before. Then you understand.
Otherwise you do not understand. If I say a word in P»ƒi, then you may not
understand although you hear the word distinctly. You may not know this word,
so you do not understand. So just by being present a sound or a voice cannot
make us understand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The verse in the second part in footnote 27 is not
translated correctly. The first two lines are correct.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>ìSounds that have
entered no objective field</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Do not awaken
any kind of meaning.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sounds which we do not hear will not make us understand any
meaning at all. The third and fourth lines are not correct. Venerable ©»”amoli
misunderstood one word in the P»ƒi original. That word is satt» with the second
ëAí as a long ëåí. The word ësattaí with a short ëAí means a being, like
Bodhisatta. ëSattaí means a being. ëSatt»í with the second ëåí long means the
state of being or the state of being present, being existent, being present.
That is the word used in this verse, not satta. That means ënot just by being
present will these sounds or words make us understandí. That means we may hear
the words, but if we have not learned the meaning of the words before, we will
not understand. This is verbal intimation. The others are not so difficult to
understand. These two (bodily intimation and verbal intimation) are said to be
caused by citta.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: so in the last two lines of the verses, it would be
ëwords merely recognizedí or something like that?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: ëIf their meaning is not known before-hand, by
their presence they cannot make us understandí. It should be something like
that. Let me see. ìThey will not show any meaning just by their presence.î That
is if their meaning is not known before-hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next material property is space element or just space.
In paragraph 63 ìThe space element has the characteristic of delimiting
matter.î ëDelimiting matterí really means delimiting a group of matter, not
just one material property, but a group of material properties. Material
properties arise in groups. There are eight material properties that arise
together, or nine, or ten and so on. This space element is said to be between
these groups. Between one group and another there is what we call space. That
is delimiting - this is one group, this is another group, this is still another
group. That is called space. So ëdelimiting matterí does not mean delimiting
one material property from another, but delimiting one grouping of materiality
from another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then come three - lightness of matter, malleability of
matter, and wieldiness of matter. These are actually some qualities of the
material properties - lightness, malleability and wieldiness. They are
explained in paragraph 65. ìLightness of matter is alteration of matter such as
any light state in material instances, as in one who is healthy.î So when you
are healthy, your body is something like light or agile. That is this lightness
of matter in the body. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Malleability of matter is compared to a well-pounded hide.
When you want to make leather, you soak the hide in salt water, and then you
pound it again and again so that it will become soft and malleable. Then you
can<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>do with it whatever you may want.
Something like that is called malleability of matter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The third one (wieldiness) is compared to well-refined gold.
People make some ornaments out of gold. First the gold is refined. When gold is
well-refined, that is when it is without any other impurity, it becomes easy to
make into anything you want. Something existing in the body or in matter is
called wieldiness of matter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These three always arise together. At the beginning of
paragraph 65 it says ìThese three, however, are not found apart from each
other.î When there is one, there are the other two. These three are actually
qualities of the material properties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next we have growth of matter and continuity of matter. You
are familiar with the three phases of existence. Right? Arising, continuation
and death or disappearing. The phase, arising, is described here in two parts,
as growth of matter and continuity of matter. It is called rebirth here. It is
just the arising of matter. This arising of matter is divided into two. One is
growth of matter. The other is continuity of matter. Growth of matter is first
arising. Continuity of matter as the word says is ëcontinuingí. ìContinuity of
matter has the characteristic of <u>occurrence</u>.î It is not occurrence. It
is continuing. Is there such a word as continuance? (Yes, there is.) Or we can
just say continuing. It has the characteristic of continuing, of continuing to
exist, not just occurrence. The P»ƒi word can mean to occur, as well as to
continue after arising. ìIts function is to anchor.î That means to join one
with the other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBoth of these are terms for matter at its birth.î The birth
or the arising of matter is called here both the growth of matter and the
continuity of matter. Just one birth or arising is described here with the two
names because it is owing to difference of mode. There is a little difference
between the growth of matter and the continuation of matter. This is also
ìaccording to [different personsí] susceptibility to instruction.î That means
there are some beings who will understand better when birth is described as
growth of matter and continuity of matter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It plays an important role at least in explaining why the
Buddha taught in this way or why the Buddha taught in that way. The Buddha
always had in mind the susceptibility of the minds of the listeners. That means
he thought ìIf I use this word will they understand?î If they were not going to
understand, he might use another word. Thatís why there are many kinds of
teachings in the teachings of the Buddha. Sometimes he taught by way of the
five aggregates. Sometimes he taught by way of twelve bases. Sometimes he
taught by way of eighteen elements. Actually they are all the same things. They
are different names given to one and the me thing. Sometimes we may be familiar
with one word but not the other. When a familiar word is spoken to us, we
readily understand. If we are not familiar with the word, then we donít
understand. If we do not understand, we cannot penetrate into the nature of
things. Buddha always exercised this -</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Buddha took into consideration if people were sharp
or fast learners.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Thatís right, and their likes and dislikes. This is
one ability that is not shared even by his disciples. Even Venerable S»riputta
did not have this ability to enter into the minds of listeners and find out
what would be suitable for them. Once Venerable S»riputta gave the wrong
meditation subject to his young student. Here Buddha wanted to teach so that
the teaching is susceptible to the listenerís ability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe teaching in the Summary (Uddesa)<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>in the Dhammasa”gan  is given as ëgrowth and
continuityí; but since there is here no difference in meaning (That means no
difference in reality.), consequently in the Description (That means a detailed
description.) of these words ëthe setting up of the sense-bases is the growth
of matterí and ëthe growth of matter is the continuity of matterí.î This is
said in the Dhammasa”gan .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd in the Commentary, after saying ëIt is genesis that is
called ìsetting upî, increase that is called ìgrowthî, occurrence that is
called ìcontinuityî.íî So here three terms are given - setting up, growth and
continuity. Then a simile is given here. ìGenesis as setting up is like the
time when water comes up in a hole dug in a river bank (So when water comes up
that is genesis.); increase as continuity is like the time when it fills [the
hole]; occurrence or continuity is like the time when it overflows.î These are
just similes to understand the two phases of one arising or one birth of
material property - growth of matter and continuity of matter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>According to this there will be four kinds of matter which
will be called characteristic matter. Actually they are different phases of
matter - the arising, the continuance and disappearing. These two (growth and
continuity) are called arising.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next we have aging in paragraph 68. ìAging has the
characteristic of maturing (ripening) material instances.î This is getting old.
This is the continuing phase of existence - arising, continuing and
disappearing. It corresponds to the second phase. ìThis is said with reference
to the kind of aging that is evident through seeing alteration in teeth, etc.,
as their brokeness, and so on.î Three kinds of aging are given - evident aging,
hidden aging, and incessant aging. Evident again is aging which is evident like
when we see someone with broken teeth or someone with eyeglasses maybe. Then we
know that person has aged. For the immaterial states there is no such evident
aging. We cannot see the brokeness of cittas and cetasikas. For them it is
called hidden aging, that is aging which cannot be seen by the eyes, but which
is seen through wisdom or the mind. ìAnd that in earth, water, rocks, the moon,
the sun, etc., is called incessant aging.î ëIncessant agingí is also a
hidden<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>aging. This book looks new for
one month, two months, or even for a year if you donít use it much. There is
aging going on, but we do not see it getting old or aged. So the aging in
earth, water and so on is also hidden aging, but here it is called incessant
aging. There is no visible difference between one stage and another. Here by
aging is meant the aging of material properties, not of immaterial states. The
last one is impermanence of matter. That means the death of matter, the
disappearance of matter. ìImpermanence of matter has the characteristic of
complete breaking up.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The last one is physical nutriment. ìPhysical nutriment has
the characteristic of nutritive essence.î And then ìIts proximate cause is a
physical basis that must be fed with physical food.î Here also the translation
is a little inaccurate. The P»ƒi word is kabil k»ra. ëKabalaí means a morsel.
ëKabil k»raí means making a morsel. That means before you eat you make a morsel
if you eat with your hands. You make a morsel and then put it in the mouth and
eat it. Food is called kabil k»ra in P»ƒi. Food which is eaten after making it
into a morsel is the meaning. ìIts proximate cause is a physical basisî - here
ëbasisí is not a good word. The P»ƒi word is vatthu. ëVatthuí can mean a base,
like eye-base, ear-base and so on. But ëvatthuí can also mean a thing, just
something. Here ëphysical basisí just means a material thing which must be
swallowed after being made a morsel. This is the word used in P»ƒi. It is
simply just what you eat, the food. The food itself is not the physical
nutriment that is meant. Physical nutriment is something in the food, something
which helps us destroy hunger and so on. That nutritive essence is what is
meant here as physical nutriment, not the food itself. The proximate cause is
the food we eat because we get that nutriment from the food that we eat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These are all together the 28 material properties. If you
count them, you will get 28. There are 4 primary elements and 24 dependent
ones, so all together 28. ìThese, firstly, are the material instances that have
been handed down in the Texts. But in the Commentary others have been added as
follows: matter as power, matter as procreation, matter as birth, matter as
sickness: and in the opinion of some, matter as torpor.î Sloth and torpor are
two mental factors included in the formation aggregate. But there were some
teachers who took it to be matter. So it is mentioned here. ìIn the first
place, matter as torpor is rejected as non-existent by the words:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>ëSurely thou art
a sage enlightened,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>There are no
hindrances in theeí.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The common opinion is that torpor is not matter. There were
some teachers belonging to another school within the Therav»da sect who took
torpor to be matter. That is rejected as non-existent. There is no torpor as
matter. The proof that they show is the Buddhaís words:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>ìSurely thou art
a sage enlightened,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>There are no
hindrances in thee.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These two lines state that there are no hindrances in the
mind of the Buddha. Torpor is included in the hindrances. In other places
especially in Abhidhamma it is said that material properties cannot be
abandoned or cannot be destroyed. Only the mental defilements can be destroyed.
When a person becomes enlightened, he eradicates mental defilements. Only the
mental defilements can be eradicated and not the material properties. Here it
says that the Buddha had no hindrances and torpor is included among the hindrances.
So torpor can be eradicated. If it can be eradicated, it is not r|pa. It is not
a material property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAs to the rest, matter as sickness is included by aging and
by impermanence; matter as birth by growth and continuity; matter as
procreation, by the water-element (because when there is water element
something grows); and mother as power by the air element. So taken separately
not even one of these exists: this was the agreement reached.î This was the
agreement of the majority of teachers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìSo this derived (dependent) matter of 24 parts and the
aforesaid matter of the primary elements which is of four sorts, together
amount to 28 sorts, neither more nor less.î These are the 28 material
properties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then they are described as of one kind, two kinds and so on.
ìAnd all that [matter of 28 sorts] is of one kind as ënot-root-cause,
root-cause-less, dissociated from root-cause, with conditions, mundane, subject
to cankers.î According to this there is only one kind of material property.
Although we are all different people, as human beings we are one. It is like
that. Although there are 28 material properties as having no root cause, or as
having conditions, or as being mundane, then there is only one r|pa, one
material property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then they can be two. ìIt is of two kinds as internal and
external, gross and subtle, far and near, produced (produced by four causes -
kamma, consciousness, temperature, nutriment) and unproduced, sensitive matter
and insensitive matter, faculty and non-faculty, clung-to and not-clung-to, and
so on.î ëClung-toí means caused by kamma. ëNot-clung-toí means not caused by
kamma. Then the detailed explanation of internal and external and so on is
given. They are not difficult if you have a list ready at hand. Read this
paragraph with that list and you will understand easily. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the end of paragraph 73 ìWhat we shall later describe as
ëkamma-borní is clung-to because that is ëclung-toí, [that is, <u>acquired</u>],
by kamma.î I think instead of saying ëacquiredí, we should say ëcaused by
kammaí. Literally it is clung-to by kamma. ëClung-to by kammaí or ëgrasped by
kammaí means taken by kamma and its object. That simply means caused by kamma.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAgain, all matter is of three kinds according to the
ëVisible (sanidassana)í triad, the kamma-born triad etc. Herein, as regards the
gross, a visible datum is visible with impact; the rest are invisible with
impact; all the subtle kinds are invisible without impact.î There are three
kinds of material properties - visible with impact, invisible with impact and
invisible without impact. Visible with is only one which is visible datum, that
is visible object. The rest are all invisible with impact. All the subtle kinds
are invisible without impact. ëGrossí and ësubtleí are explained in paragraph
73 above.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAccording to the ëkamma-borní triad, etc., however, that
born from kamma is kamma-born.î So this is not difficult to understand -
kamma-born, not kamma-born, neither-kamma-born-nor-not-kamma-born. The same is
true for consciousness, nutriment and temperature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 76 ìHerein, the visible-data base is seen because
it is the objective field of seeing.î It is the object of seeing. Visible-data
base is called seeing. ìThe sound base is heard because it is the objective
field of hearing. The three, that is to say, odors, flavors, and tangible data,
are sensed (literally contacted) because they are the objective fields of
faculties that take contiguous [objective fields]. The rest are cognized
because<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>they are the objective field of
consciousness only. So firstly it is of four kinds according to the ëseení,
etc., tetrad.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In footnote 32 there is a discussion of whether the water
element can be touched. ìIs not cold apprehended by touching?î Do you think so?
ìAnd is that the water element? Certainly it is apprehended, but it is not the
water element. What is it then? It is just the fire element (or temperature).
For there is the sensation of cold when heat is sluggish.î When there is little
temperature we say that it is cold. When the temperature rises, we say that it
is hot. Cold and hot are just variations in temperature. That is not the water
element.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThere is no quality that is called cold; there is only the
assumption of coldness due to the sluggishness of the state of the sensation of
cold, like ëí.î ë<u>Beyond and not beyondí</u> is not a correct rendering. It
should be ëthis bank and the other bankí. When we are on this bank, we call the
other, ëthe other bankí. When we cross over to the other bank, this bank
becomes ëthe other bankí and the other bank becomes ëthis bankí. When the
temperature is low, we call it cold. When the temperature has risen, we call it
hot. So hot and cold are relative terms. ìFor in hot weather while those who
stand in the sun and go into the shade have the sensation of cold, yet those who
go to the same place from an underground cave have the sensation of heat.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd if coldness were the water element it would be found in
a single group along with heat: but it is not so found.î If coldness is water
element then it must co-exist with heat. But heat and cold do not co-exist.
Cold is not water element because there are four elements everywhere. ìThat is
why it may be known (Actually we ought to say ëit should be knowní) that
coldness is not water element. And that is conclusive for those who agree in
the inseparable existence of the primary elements; and it is conclusive too
even for those who do not agree because it is disproved by associate existenceî
and so on. That is difficult to understand. ìIt is conclusive too for those who
say that coldness is the characteristic of the air element; for if coldness
were the air element, coldness would be found in a single group along with
heat, and it is not so found.î It is the same argument.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBut those who hold the opinion that fluidity is the water
element and that that is apprehended by touching should be told: That fluidity
touched is merely the venerable onesí assumption as is the case with shape.î We
think that we see the shape. We see something and we think that we see the
shape. What we see is the visible object there. Shape we do not see, but we
think that we see. In other words we see the shape in our minds and not with
our eyes. What we see is just visible data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††† </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThree elements
coexisting with fluidity</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>Together form
what constitutes a tangible;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>That I succeed in
touching this fluidity</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>Is a common
misconception in the world.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So you put your hand in the water and you say that it is
cold. Then you think that you can touch cold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAnd as a man who
touches elements,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††† </span>And apprehends a
shape then with his mind,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††† </span>Fancies ëI really
have been touching shapeí,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††† </span>So too fluidity is
to be understood.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So you pick up a pencil and you think that you touch the
shape of the pencil. What you touch is not the shape of the pencil, but the
material properties of the pencil. So water element cannot be touched. What we
touch and think of as water element is not actually water element, but is the
fire element (heat or cold).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 78, one word is missing in my book. ìHere,
however, what is called the materiality of the heart is physical basis, not
door.î Heart-base is basis but not door. ìThe two intimations are door, but not
physical basis.î The two intimations are said to be doors because they are
those through which we do kamma, kamma by body and kamma by speech. So bodily
intimation and verbal intimation are said to be doors of kamma. You may read
this in the fifth chapter of The Manual of Abhidhamma. They are doors, <u>but</u>
not physical basis, not vatthu. We should say that they are doors, <u>but</u>
not physical basis. ìSensitive matter is both physical basis and door (like eye
sensitivity, ear sensitivity and so on); the rest are neither physical basis
nor door.î So there are four kinds. Then there are five kinds, born of one,
born of two and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the beginning of paragraph 80 ìThat is all the rest
except ëmatter as characteristicí. But ëmatter as characteristicí is called not
born of anything.î ëMatter of characteristicí means the four mentioned in
paragraph 66 - growth of matter, continuity of matter, aging and impermanence
of matter. These four are said to be not born of anything, not caused by
anything. ìWhy? Because there is no arising of arising and the other two are
the mere maturing and breaking up of what has arisen.î That means they are just
the different phases of the material properties which have arisen. Actually
they are not separate material properties. So they are not said to be caused by
anything. ëAnythingí refers to kamma, consciousness, temperature and nutriment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThough in the passage ëThe visible data base, the sound
base, the odor base, the flavor base, the tangible data base, the space
element, the water element, lightness of matter, malleability of matter,
wieldiness of matter, continuity of matter, and physical food - these states
are consciousness originatedí.î This is from an Abhidhamma Text. In the
Abhidhamma it is said that the growth of matter and the continuity of matter
are caused by or are originated by consciousness. Likewise in other passages
where they are said to be caused by kamma and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So what about that? The answer is that they are not caused
by anything, but they are evident when the functions of kamma and so on are
said to still be existing. Suppose there is relinking or rebirth. At the first
sub-moment of rebirth there is kamma-born matter. Kamma is always concerned
about producing something. Only after it has produced something will it give up
this concern . It is concerned with producing results. At the very moment of
arising its concern has not yet disappeared. And birth or these two (growth of
matter and continuity of matter) are seen at that moment. That is why they are
said to be caused by kamma, citta and so on, although, in fact, they are not
caused by anything. They are said to be caused by kamma because the exercising
of the function of kamma is still there. Kammaís concern for producing material
property is still exercised at the moment of genesis or at the moment of
arising. That is why they are said to be caused by kamma. With regard to citta
it is the same thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then we come to consciousness aggregate (vi““»”a khandha).
ìAmong the remaining aggregates, however, whatever has the characteristic of <u>being
felt</u> should be understood all taken together, as the feeling aggregate.î It
is not ëbeing feltí, but ëfeelingí. He misunderstood the word. The P»ƒi word is
ëvedayitaí. It looks like a passive past participle here. It is something like
a verbal noun. It is not ëthat which is feltí, but ëthat which feelsí or just
ëfeelingí. Here the word ëvedayitaí means feeling. If you know a little P»ƒi,
you will understand that. The suffix ëTAí is added to mean the passive. So here
ëvedayitaí could mean which is felt, but here it is used in the sense of just
ëfeelingí, not ëbeing feltí. So it should be ìThe characteristic of feeling
should be understood, all taken together, as the feeling aggregate.î Because
feeling aggregate is that which has feeling as characteristic and not that
which is felt. If it is felt, there must be another feeling. Feeling is
explained here in the Sub-Commentary as experiencing the taste of objects. That
is what we call feeling. We can say enjoying the taste of objects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we have the aggregate of consciousness. The aggregate of
consciousness is described in this book in the order given in the original
Abhidhamma Texts. This order is different from the order we are familiar with
because we are familiar with the order given in The Manual of Abhidhamma. The
order in The Manual of Abhidhamma is different from the order given in the
original Abhidhamma Texts. The Visuddhi Magga follows the order given in the
original Abhidhamma Texts. That is why I have made these notes. This chart is
the same as the dots, but just the numbers are given so you can pinpoint it.
There is also a handout showing the number of the citta in The Path of
Purification and in The Manual of Abhidhamma.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Thank you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: The numbers given in the book are different from
the numbers given in The Manual of Abhidhamma. Let us read paragraph 83.
ìHerein, 1-8 that of the sense-sphere is eightfold, being classified according
to joy, equanimity, knowledge, and prompting; that is to say: (1)î - this # 1
given in this book is # 31 in this chart. Now you can identify it. Then # 2 in
The Path of Purification is # 32 in this chart. It can help you to identify the
cittas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The plan of the types of consciousness given in The Path of
Purification is done according to the pattern of the original Abhidhamma Texts.
They are classified in this way: First there is kusala. Second there is
akusala. Third there is aby»kata. There are these three major divisions -
kusala (wholesome), akusala (unwholesome), and aby»kata (indeterminate). Then
kusala is divided into k»m»vacara (belonging to sense-sphere), r|p»vacara (belonging
to form-sphere), ar|p»vacara (belonging to immaterial sphere), and lokuttara
(supramundane). Akusala is divided into three - lobham|la (That is cittas
accompanied by lobha or attachment), dosam|la (cittas accompanied by dosa or
having dosa as a root), and moham|la. You can find the English translation in
The Path of Purification. On the handout I gave the paragraph numbers, so you
can find them easily in the book. Aby»kata is the most comprehensive. Aby»kata
is divided into vip»ka (resultant) and kiriya (functional). Then vip»ka is
subdivided into k»m»vacara vip»ka, r|p»vacara vip»ka, ar|p»vacara vip»ka,
lokuttara vip»ka. K»m»vacara vip»ka is divided into kusala vip»ka and akusala
vip»ka. Then kusala vip»ka is divided into ahetuka (without root) and sahetuka
(with root). This is the plan. Then kiriya is divided into k»m»vacara,
r|p»vacara, ar|p»vacara. K»m»vacara kiriya is divided into ahetuka and
sahetuka. This is the order given in The Path of Purification.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are all together 89 types of consciousness explained
in this chapter, not 121. 89 and 121 are the same because the 8 types of
supramundane consciousness when we multiply by the 5 jh»nas, we get 40 for the
supramundane. Then the number of cittas becomes 121. If we take supramundane
consciousness as just 8, then we get 89 types of consciousness. These 89 types
of consciousness are described in this book.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In footnote 35 there is a discussion about the words n»ma,
vi““»”a, mano, citta and ceto. These are synonyms. ìWhile their etymology can
be looked up in the dictionary, one or two points need noting here. N»ma
(rendered by ëmentalityí when not used to refer to a name) is <u>almost</u>
confined in the sense considered to the expression n»ma-r|pa
(mentality-materiality) as the fourth member of the Dependent Origination,
where it comprises the three mental aggregates of feeling, perceptions, and
formations, but not that of consciousness (vi““»”a).î I cannot agree with the
word ëalmostí here. ëN»maí means the three mental aggregates, as it says here,
only when it is used in the Dependent Origination. If it is used as a link in
Dependent Origination, ën»maí means feeling, perception and mental formations.
In other places ën»maí means citta and cetasikas both, not cetasikas only. So I
do not like ëalmostí here. Maybe ëis sometimes confinedí is better, not
ëalmostí but ësometimesí. Only when given as a link of Dependent Origination
(is this true). If you go to Chapter 18 paragraph 8 it says ìthe immaterial
statesî. ëImmaterial statesí just means n»ma. It is described as: ìThat is to
say, the 81 kinds of mundane consciousness consisting of the two sets of five
consciousnessî and so on. ëN»maí means both consciousness and mental factors.
In another Abhidhamma Text it is said that ën»maí also means includes Nibb»na.
Nibb»na is also called ën»maí although it is not mental. Nibb»na is something
different than<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>mentality and
materiality. In P»ƒi it is called n»ma. If you do not want to get confused,
just leave it alone. Let us take it that ën»maí mostly means consciousness and
mental factors together, but in the Dependent Origination, as the fourth member
of Dependent Origination, there is the word ën»ma-r|paí. There ën»maí means
only the mental factors. Do you know why?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>Because there is consciousness above it. Depending on ignorance there
are mental formations. Depending on mental formations there is consciousness.
And depending on consciousness there is n»ma-r|pa. When we say n»ma depends on
consciousness, then n»ma cannot include consciousness. That is why n»ma is made
to mean only feeling, perception and mental formations in the Dependent
Origination. Outside Dependent Origination ën»maí always means citta and
cetasikas together. So n»ma, vi““»”a, mano, citta and ceto are all synonyms.
They just mean citta. Vi““»”a means citta. Mano means citta. Citta means citta.
And ceto sometimes also means citta.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In footnote 36 there is an explanation of k»m»vacara
(sense-sphere). Here there are two kinds of sense-desire. It is not that there
are two kinds of sense-desire. Let us say there are two kinds of k»ma. Please
not the P»ƒi word ëk»maí. There are two kinds of k»ma. Do you see the word
ëvatthu-k»maí there? One is vatthu-k»ma and the other is kilesa-k»ma.
ëVatthu-k»maí means objects of desire - sights, sounds, smells, taste and
touch. Those are called vatthu-k»ma. ëVatthuí here means the thing which is
desired. When it means these five things, then the word ëk»maí is to be known,
in the passive sense, as desired. Something which is desired is called ëk»maí.
When we mean k»ma to mean kilesa-k»ma - ëkilesaí means mental defilement - that
k»ma is used in the active sense. It is something that desires. So sense-desire
is defilement (kilesa-k»ma). There are two kinds of k»ma. Whenever we use the
word ëk»maí, we must be sure that we mean vatthu-k»ma or kilesa-k»ma. So
whenever we find the word ëk»maí, we cannot always translate it as
sense-desire. Sometimes I prefer the word ësense-objectsí, the objects of the
senses, the objects of desire actually. So there are two kinds of k»ma - vatthu-k»ma
and kilesa-k»ma. ìOf these, sense-desire as [objective] basis (That means just
the objects.) particularized as the five cords of sense-<u>desire</u>.î They
are called five cords of sense- objects. They are simply sight, sound, smell,
taste and touch. ìSense-desire is defilement, which is craving, desire.î Here
it is the active meaning. ìThe sense-sphere is where these two operate
together.î ëSense-sphereí means the world of human beings, the four woeful
states, and the worlds of lower celestial beings. Those planes of existence are
the sense-sphere. Both vatthu-k»ma and kilesa-k»ma operate here. ìBut what is
that? It is the elevenfold sense-desire becoming i.e., hell, Asura demons,
ghosts, animals, human beings, and six sensual-sphere [heavens]. So too with
the fine material sphere and the immaterial sphere, taking ëfine materialí as
craving for the fine material sphereî and so on. These are the explanations of
r|p»vacara and ar|p»vacara. Lokuttara is explained as something that crosses
over from the world. So it is called ëlokuttaraí (supramundane). When we find
the word ëk»maí, we must be careful not to always translate it as sense-desire.
Sometimes it means sense-desire. Sometimes it means sense-objects or objects of
desire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 85 there is an explanation of the word
ësa~kh»raí. ìFor in this sense ëpromptingí is a term for a prior effort exerted
by himself, or others.î When we describe consciousness, we use the word
ësa~kh»raí. It is with sa~kh»ra or it is without sa~kh»ra. The word ësa~kh»raí
here means effort, a prior effort before doing something. So it has a special
sense here. I think you are familiar with the word ësa~kh»raí. ëSa~kh»raí means
those that are conditioned and also those that condition. But in this
particular context ësa~kh»raí means just prior effort. So with effort and
without effort - that means with prompting and without prompting. This is the
definition of the word ësa~kh»raí. We should note this for explanation when we
teach Abhidhamma. ìIn this sense ëpromptingí is a term for a prior effort
exerted by himself or others.î Then examples of the different kinds of
consciousness are given. They are not difficult to understand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the end of paragraph 86 ìThe fifth is associated with
equanimity.î ëEquanimityí here means neutral feeling. You know there are
pleasant feeling, unpleasant feeling and neither pleasant nor unpleasant
feeling. The third one is called ëneutral feelingí (upekkh»). The word
ëupekkh»í can mean neutral feeling or equanimity. Here ëupekkh»í means neutral
feeling, neither somanassa nor domanassa. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The numbers are given here. When you see the numbers, you
can check with the handouts. You may go to that sheet if you are already
familiar with the dots. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 91 ìWhen a man is happy and content <u>in</u>
placing wrong view foremost of the sort beginning ëThere is no danger in
sense-desireíî and so on. I want to strike out the word ëiní. He is not happy
in placing wrong view foremost. He is happy and he is content, and he places
wrong view foremost in his mind. That means with wrong view he does something.
It should be ìWhen a man is happy and content, and placing wrong view foremostî
and so on. The word ëiní is not needed here. Towards the bottom of the
paragraph ìBut when the consciousnesses are devoid of joy in these four
instances through encountering no excellence in the sense-<u>desires</u>î -
here it should be sense-objects, not sense-desires. It should be sense-objects
or objects of sense-desire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 96 ìHerein, eye-consciousness has the
characteristic of being supported by the eye and cognizing visible data.
ìHerein, eye consciousness has the characteristic of being supported by the eye
and cognizing visible data. Its function is to have only visible data as its
object.î That means eye consciousness just sees the visible object. When it
sees, it just sees it. It does not see it as blue or that it is red or
whatever. The eye consciousness sees the object just as a visible object. We
know that it is blue, that it is green, by manodv»ra (by mind -door), by mind-door
thought process, not by eye-door thought process. Thatís why it is said that it
sees only visible data and not shape and so on. ìIt is manifested as <u>occupation</u>
with visible data.î Let us go to paragraph 107 ìIt is manifested as
confrontation of visible data.î The same words are used. Here it does not say
ëoccupationí. It is being faced with visible data or confronted with visible
data, not occupation with visible data. ìIts proximate cause is the departure
of (That means the disappearance of.) the functional mind-element that has
visible data as object.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to understand these passages you have to understand
at least the thought process. During the Abhidhamma class I talked about the
thought processes. If you have notes from that class, please look at the first
thought process. Then read these passages. Because here the eye consciousness
its proximate cause is the departure of the functional mind-element that has
visible data as its object. That means that immediately before consciousness is
pa“cadv»r»vajjana. The disappearance of that functional mind-element or that
five-door-adverting is the proximate cause for eye consciousness. If the
functional mind-element does not disappear, then the eye consciousness cannot
arise. Functional mind-element disappears so that eye consciousness can arise.
Functional mind-element disappears so that eye consciousness can arise.
Therefore the disappearance of functional mind-element is the proximate cause
for eye consciousness. It is something like you being in a line. The
disappearance of the man before is the proximate cause for your being there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then there is the mind-element as receiving or accepting and
so on. And then beginning in paragraph 110 the 14 modes or the 14 kinds of
functions are explained. These 89 types of consciousness have different
functions. Some kinds of consciousness have one function only, but others may
have two functions, five functions and so on. These 14 functions performed by
different types of consciousness are explained beginning with paragraph 110. To
understand these functions also you need to have a diagram of the thought
process. Looking at that diagram of the thought process, you may read these
passages and you will understand them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 111 about seven lines down ìentering upon the
state of eunuchsî - that means being reborn as eunuchs. ëEntering upon the
state ofí means being reborn as.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then in footnote 42 the third line ì ëSign of kammaí is the
gift to be given that was the condition for the volitionî and so on. After ëgivení
please add ëetc.í. ìThe gift to be given, etc., that was a condition for the
volition.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Footnote 44 ì ëWith that same objectí: if kamma is the <u>life-continuumís</u>î
- it is a mistake. It should be relinkingís, not life-continuumís. It is
relinking or rebirth. ìIf kamma is the relinkingís object, then it is that
kammaî and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These 14 modes or 14 functions are explained one by on. In
paragraph 123 there is a saying ìFor the last life-continuum consciousness of
all in one becoming is called ëdeath (cuti)í because of falling from that
[becoming].î In one given life relinking, life-continuum and death are all the
same type of consciousness. Actually relinking consciousness is a resultant
consciousness. This consciousness repeats itself all through the life. After
the first moment of arising as relinking, it is called ëlife-continuumí. At the
end of life also that type of consciousness arises. We call that ëdeath
consciousnessí or ëcutií. In one given life the relinking, life-continuum and
death consciousness are all the same types of consciousness. That is why it is
said here ìFor the last life-continuum consciousness of all in one becoming is
called ëdeathí.î The last life-continuum is what we call ëdeathí. These three
kinds of consciousness are just one and the same kinds of consciousness. </p>

Today we are doing in one hour. Next week we will go to about paragraph 185. Do
you have the notes from the Abhidhamma class. Next week we will have the

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Last week we finished consciousness aggregate. Today we
begin with feeling aggregate. Paragraph 125 ìNow it was said above, ëWhatever
has the characteristic of <u>being felt</u> (Here also ëbeing feltí should be
corrected to feeling.) should be understood, all taken together, as the feeling
aggregateí.î I told you last week that Venerable ©»”amoli misunderstood the
word ëvedayitaí. He took it as a passive past participle, but it is not a
passive past participle. It is a verbal noun here. The word ëvedayitaí simply
means feeling. Whenever you see the words ëbeing feltí or ëfeltí change to
feeling. ìAnd here, too, what is said to have the characteristic of feeling
(not ëbeing feltí) is feeling itself, according as it is said ëIt feelsí (not
ëis feltí), friend, that is why it is called ëfeelingí.î We have to take the
active voice. In the next paragraph also ìBut though it is singlefold according
to its individual essence as the characteristic of feeling, it is nevertheless
threefold as to kindî and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They are profitable, unprofitable and indeterminate. This is
the division found in the first book of Abhidhamma. The Commentator, the
Venerable Buddhaghosa, is following that division. Since consciousness is
divided into profitable, unprofitable, and indeterminate, feeling too is so
divided. ìHerein, it should be understood that when associated with the
profitable consciousness described in way beginning ëThat of the sense-sphere
is eightfold, being classified according to joy, equanimity, knowledge and
prompting is profitable.î Then we find a footnote. ìThis should be regarded as
a secondary characteristic of profitable feeling.î Here also there is a
misunderstanding of the word ëupalakkha”aí. ëLakkha”aí means characteristic and
ëupaí can mean secondary or subordinate. But here ëupalakkha”aí means something
like stating of the fact. The statement that ëwhen it is associated with
profitable consciousness, it is called profitableí is just a statement of fact;
it is not giving a reason for it being profitable. It is described in the
Sub-Commentary by the word ëupalakkha”aí. Sometimes ëupalakkha”aí means
something like saying - you say only one thing but other things are meant. We
may say that the president visited San Francisco. The president does not come
alone. He comes with other people too, but we just say that the president
visited the city. It is something like that. It is called ëupalakkha”aí. It is
not a secondary characteristic. It is a kind of figure of speech often used
especially by Commentators. Here it is not an explanation of feelings being
profitable, but it is just stating the fact. As is stated in the footnote, its
being profitable or unprofitable is determined by right reflection or wrong
reflection. ìThat associated with unprofitable consciousness is unprofitable;
that associated with indeterminate consciousness is indeterminate.î Feeling
always accompanies consciousness. Every type of consciousness is accompanied by
feeling. Since consciousness is divided into three (profitable, unprofitable,
and indeterminate), feeling is also divided accordingly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIt is fivefold according to the analysis of its individual
essence into [bodily] pleasure, [bodily] pain, [mental] joy, [mental] grief,
and equanimity.î Here there are five kinds of feelings. The first one is sukha
(bodily pleasure). Bodily pain is dukkha. Mental joy is somanassa. Mental grief
is domanassa. And equanimity is upekkh». There are five kinds of feelings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHerein, pleasure is associated with profitable resultant
body consciousness and pain with unprofitable body consciousnessî and so on. If
you have the chart for consciousness from last week, you may look at that and
read it. The numbers given here are different than those on the chart for
cittas. You may look at the other handout and determine what they are. It will
take much time if we check every statement with these charts. So you have to do
it yourself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìJoy is associated with 62 kinds of consciousness.î That
means somanassa 62, in our chart the red dots. They are ìnamely as to
sense-sphere, with 4 kinds of profitable, with 4 resultant with root-cause,
with one resultant without root-cause, with 4 functional with root-cause, with
one functional without root-cause, and with 4 unprofitable; and as to fine
material sphere, with 4 kinds of profitable, 4 resultant, and 4 functional,
leaving out that of the fifth jh»na in each case.î The fifth jh»na is
accompanied by upekkh» (equanimity or indifferent) feeling. The fifth jh»na is
left out of these 62.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBut there is no supramundane without jh»na and consequently
the [eight] kinds of supramundane multiplied by the five jh»nas make forty.î
This is where the 40 types of supramundane consciousness are mentioned. In the
description of the consciousness aggregate the Commentator did not say that
there are 40 types of supramundane consciousness. The Commentator mentions 8 -
4 Path consciousness and 4 Fruit consciousness. Here he mentions 40 types of
supramundane consciousness. There are 8 supramundane consciousness and each one
is multiplied by the 5 jh»nas. So they become 40. Among the 40 the first,
second, third and fourth jh»na consciousness are accompanied by joy. The fifth
jh»na is accompanied by equanimity or indifferent feeling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Grief is associated with two kinds of unprofitable
consciousness. That the dosam|la, those accompanied by dosa among the akusala
cittas (the unwholesome consciousness).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Equanimity is associated with the remaining 55 types of
consciousness, that is the blue dots on the chart. If you have a chart with
color, then it is easy. Red dots represent somanassa. Blue dots represent
upekkh». The crosses - the red cross represents bodily pleasure and the blue
cross represents bodily pain. The green dots represent mental grief. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we come to the characteristic, etc., of these five kinds
of feeling paragraph 128. ìPleasure has the characteristic of experiencing a
desirable tangible datum (That is something that can be touched.).î Its
function is to intensify associated states. It is manifested as bodily
affliction. Its proximate cause is the body faculty.î ëBody facultyí
simply<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>means body sensitivity. From when
we studied the corporeality aggregate I think you remember there are five
sensitivities - eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body sensitivity. Body sensitivity
is here called ëbody facultyí. It is the same thing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìPain has the characteristic of experiencing an undesirable
tangible datum.î That is when you have pain in the body. When you hit yourself
with something or when someone hits you, there is pain in the body. ìIts
function is to intensify associated states.î When there is pain, your mind and
your mental states become withered. They are not happy. ìIt is manifested as
bodily affliction.î When you look at it through meditation, then you see it as
bodily affliction. Its proximate cause again is the body sensitivity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìJoy has the characteristic of experiencing a desirable
object.î This is somanassa. It is in the mind. It is mental joy. ìIts function
is to exploit in one way or another the desirable aspect.î I want to know
whether or not the word ëexploití has a bad meaning or does it also have a good
meaning?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Students: In modern times it mostly has a bad meaning. It
means that someone takes advantage unfairly. But it also can mean to make good
use of.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: It is used in the good sense here, not the bad
sense. So it fully enjoys. ìIt is manifested as mental affliction. Its
proximate cause is tranquillity.î Joy comes from tranquillity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìGrief has the characteristic of experiencing an undesirable
object. Its function is to exploit in one way or another the undesirable
aspect.î Undesirable aspect - we cannot use the word ëenjoyí here, right? It
experiences the undesirable aspect thoroughly. ìIt is manifested as mental
affliction. Its proximate cause is invariably the heart-basis.î These two types
of consciousness associated with domanassa only arise in beings of the sensual
sphere. So it always depends on the heart-base.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Equanimity - ëequanimityí, here means neutral feeling or
indifferent feeling. ìEquanimity has the characteristic of feeling
neutralî,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>not ëbeing felt as neutralí.
Not feeling pleasure, not feeling displeasure, feeling the middle feeling is
what is meant. ìIts function is not to intensify or wither associated states.
It is manifested as peacefulness. Its proximate cause is consciousness without
happiness.î That is because if there is happiness there can be no indifferent
feeling. Its proximate cause is consciousness that is not accompanied by
somanassa.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In footnote 56 it is explained why the dvipa“cavi““»”a other
than those associated with bodily feeling have only indifferent feeling
accompanying them and the others that are associated with bodily feeling are
accompanied by pleasure and displeasure. This is a good explanation when you
talk about the ahetuka (rootless) consciousness. ìJust as when a man places a
piece of cottonwool on an anvil and strikes it with an iron hammer, and his
hammer goes right through the cotton and hits the anvil, the violence<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>of the blow is great, so too because the
violence of the impactís blow is great, body consciousness is accompanied by
pleasure when the object is desirable or desirable-neutral one, and by pain
when the object is an undesirable or an undesirable-neutral one.î Here there is
an anvil, cottonwool and a hammer. So there are three things here. When someone
hits you, there are the great elements. What shall I say?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>There is body sensitivity and tangible data
or those that can be touched. Those that can be touched, what are they?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>The three great elements. The three great
elements are what we call ëtouchí. When these hit against the body sensitivity,
which is like the cottonwool here, because of the impact, the great elements
upon which the body sensitivity depends - there are great elements. On these
great elements body sensitivity depends. There are great elements, body
sensitivity and tangible data which is the combination of the three great
elements. When the tangible data strikes against body sensitivity, it goes
through bodily sensitivity and reaches the great elements beneath it. It is
like great elements hitting great elements. It is like the hammer hitting the
anvil. The impact is strong. And so when the object is pleasurable or
pleasurable-neutral, there is sukha. When the object is displeasurable or
displeasurable-neutral, there is dukkha. There can be no upekkh» here with
regard to bodily sensitivity. With regard to seeing consciousness and so on
there is only upekkh». You may remember that seeing consciousness and so on are
accompanied by indifferent feeling and not by pleasurable or displeasurable
feeling. That is at the very moment of seeing, hearing and so on. That is
because the visible object and so on are depending r|pa. Visible object is not
one of the great elements. So when visible object strikes against eye sensitivity
which is again a depending one, it is like a ball of cotton striking another
ball of cotton. The impact is not so great. It does not go through the cotton
ball to the anvil. So here it is a soft object striking a soft sensitivity. The
impact is not so great. Whether the object is desirable or undesirable the
feeling is always indifferent feeling. This explanation is given by the
Sub-Commentary here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next aggregate is the perception aggregate. There is
nothing difficult here about perception aggregate. We have talked about
perception. ìwhatever has the characteristic of perceiving should be
understood, all taken together, as the perception aggregateî and so on. It is
also divided into profitable, unprofitable and indeterminate. Perception accompanies
all types of consciousness. Wherever there is consciousness, there is
perception. Its characteristic, etc., are given. What is its characteristic?
Perceiving. ìIts function is to make a sign as a condition for perceiving again
that ëthis is the sameí, as carpenters, etc.í, do in the case of timber, and so
on. It is manifested as the action of interpreting by means of the sign as
apprehended.î That means it may be apprehended rightly or wrongly. If it is
apprehended wrongly, then that interpretation will depend upon that wrong
apprehension and so the conclusion will be wrong, like the blind men seeing the
elephant. ìIts proximate cause is an objective field in whatever way that
appears, like the perception that arises in fawns that see scarecrows as men.î
These animals think they are seeing men when in fact they are seeing
scarecrows. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then we come to the formation aggregate. The formation
aggregate is important and has many divisions. The P»ƒi word is sa~kh»ra
khandha (formation aggregate). ëSa~kh»raí here means just that which makes. Its
characteristic is forming that which has the characteristic of agglomerating.
It is just forming or putting together. ìWhat is that? It is formations
themselves, according as it is said ëThey form the formed, bhikkhu, that is why
they are called ëformationsí.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThey have the characteristic of forming. Their function is
to accumulate. They are manifested as <u>intervening</u>.î It may be better to
say ëactivenessí instead of ëinterveningí. You will see the P»ƒi word
ëvipph»raí in footnote 58. Vipph»ra is explained in the Sub-Commentary by
vy»p»ra. ëVy»p»raí means activeness, being active. ëInterveningí really means
being active. They are manifested as those that are active. ìTheir proximate
cause is the remaining three [immaterial] aggregates.î That is because they
arise with the other three immaterial aggregates (consciousness aggregate,
feeling aggregate, perception aggregate).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Please bear in mind that consciousness is always accompanied
by mental factors. These four immaterial aggregates always arise together, that
is consciousness aggregate, feeling aggregate, perception aggregate and some of
the formation aggregate. When one is taken as the principle thing, then the
others become its proximate cause. ëCauseí here means condition. They are
profitable, unprofitable and indeterminate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the 52 cetasikas are mentioned here following the order
given in the first book of Abhidhamma. In the Dhammasa~ga”  first consciousness
is mentioned. Buddha said that with this consciousness such mental factors
arise - contact arises, volition arises and so on. Following that, the
description is given in this book. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First we find kusala here, right? ìHerein, firstly, those
associated with the first sense-sphere profitable consciousness (That means the
first k»m»vacara kusala.) amount to 36, that is to say, the constant ones,
which are 27 given in the Texts as such, and the 4 ë<u>or</u>-whatever-statesí,
and also the 5 inconstant ones.î We have to understand these three - constant
ones, or-whatever-states, and inconstant ones. ëConstant onesí mean the ones
that always accompany the consciousness assigned to them. The most obvious one
is contact. When we say contact accompanies this type of consciousness, it
always accompanies that type of consciousness, invariably. Such mental states
are called ëconstantí. ëInconstantí means they may or may not associate or
arise with a certain consciousness. For example let us say compassion.
Compassion accompanies some kinds of consciousness, but only when you practice
compassion will compassion arise in your mind, not at other times. When you
arouse compassion, it will arise in your mind. If you do not arouse it, then it
will not arise. Such mental factors are called ëinconstantí. Although they are
said to accompany a certain type of consciousness, they do not accompany that
type of consciousness every time it arises, only sometimes. Envy (issa) is said
to be inconstant. Only when you envy other peopleís success is there envy in
you. Otherwise it will not accompany that type of consciousness. Such mental
factors are called ëinconstantí. Do you remember the words used in The Manual
of Abhidhamma?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>Fixed adjuncts and
unfixed adjuncts. In the manual you will find fixed adjuncts and unfixed
adjuncts. Here the words ëconstantí and ëinconstantí are used. They mean the
same thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other one, <u>or</u>-whatever-states, is important. When
the Buddha described the mental states accompanying a certain type of
consciousness, he did not give all the mental states. He gave most of the
mental stated, one by one, by name. Let us say the consciousness is accompanied
by 36 mental states. He would mention 32 mental states one by one, by name.
Then he would say there are some others also that accompanied that
consciousness. All those are called kusala or all those are called akusala and
so on. The words used in the Dhammasa~ga” <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>are in footnote 59. ìYe v» pana tasmim samaye a““e pi atthi
pa‘icca-samuppan» ar|pino dhamm»î and so on. Some of those mental states are
not mentioned by name, but they are mentioned by the words ëye v» panaí. They
are called ëyev»panakaí in P»ƒi. It is translated as ë<u>or</u>-whatever-statesí.
I donít like the word ëorí here. Although there is ëv»í in P»ƒi, it does not
mean ëorí here. It means ëalsoí. As I said, there are 36 mental states
accompanying the first k»m»vacara kusala citta. After describing 32 by name let
us say, the Buddha said that there are others also. So here the P»ƒi word ëv»í
means ëalsoí, not ëorí. Maybe ëalso other statesí is good. They may be given by
name in the list. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So í27 given as suchí means 27 are given in the Texts by
name. Then there are the 4 whatever-states and also the 5 inconstant ones. If
you look at the list, they are well divided. The 4 whatever-states are zeal or
desire, resolution, attention and specific neutrality. The 5 inconstant ones
are compassion, gladness, abstinences from bodily misconduct, abstinence from
verbal misconduct and abstinence from wrong livelihood. These five are called
ëinconstantí and the 4 above ëwhatever-statesí. The others are constant ones.
Then the author describes the characteristic, function, mode of manifestation
and proximate cause of each one of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first one is phassa (contact) in paragraph 134. It is
contact which is born of convergence of three, that is visible object, the eye
and seeing consciousness. When these three arise, contact also arises. In the
books it says because of the convergence of these three contact arises. Contact
is seen as something which comes out of the convergence of these three, the
coming together of these three. Its characteristic is touching. ëTouchingí
means mentally touching. ìIts function is the act of impingement. It is
manifested as concurrence. Its proximate cause is an objective field that has
come into focus.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAlthough this is an immaterial state, yet it occurs with
respect to an object as the act of touching <u>too</u>.î It is not ëtooí
here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>We can leave out ëtooí all
together or we may substitute ëonlyí. It is immaterial, so it does not really
touch anything. It really does not come into contact with anything. When it
arises, it arises as the act of touching. That is why it is called ëphassaí in
P»ƒi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In footnote 60 ìAs the act of touching (not ëtooí): by this
he shows that this is its individual essence even though it is immaterial.î The
examples given here are very good. We experience phassa more clearly when we
come across these instances - ìwatering of the mouth in one who sees another
tasting vinegar or a ripe mango.î When one sees another eating something sour,
water is produced in our mouth. ìThe bodily shuttering in a sympathetic person
who sees another being hurt, the trembling of the knees in a timid man standing
on the ground when he sees a man precariously balances on a high tree branchî -
if you watch the circus, you get that feeling when the performers are on the
high wire. ìThe loss of power of the legs in one who sees something terrifying
such as a pis»ca (goblin)î - so when you are afraid, you cannot run. Your feet
are like frozen. That happens to dogs when they have the smell of leopards or
when they see leopards. They cannot run away. They are too afraid. That is the
manifestation of phassa (contact).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd [as to its function] although it is not adherent on any
one side as eye-cum-visible-object and ear-cum-sound are, yet it is what makes
consciousness and the object impinge.î I do not understand this and it is not
quite what the original means. What it means here is: although it is not
adherent on any one side, it impinges on consciousness and object as does
visible object on the eye and sound on the ear. Remember the eye and the ear
are said to take objects before they reach them. Like them phassa is not stuck
to any object at all. It impinges on consciousness and the object, like visible
object and eye, and like sound on the ear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIt is said to be manifested as concurrence because it has
been described <u>as its own</u> <u>action</u>.î Here he also misunderstood one
word. ìBecause it has been described by way of its cause, namely, the
occurrence of the three.î You know sometimes there is a difference between a
short vowel and a long vowel. Then you get a different meaning. You just mispronounce
or you read a short vowel for a long vowel, or a long vowel for a short vowel,
then you get a different meaning. Here the P»ƒi word used is ëkaran»í. ëKaran»í
means a cause. When you read it as karana instead of karan», it means doing. So
here he translated it as ëits own actioní. ëKaranaí means doing or action. This
is not a correct reading. The correct reading is karan». </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ëThe concurrence of the threeí is actually the cause for
contact to arise. Concurrence itself is not contact. Contact arises through the
concurrence of these three, that is the eye, the visible object and eye
consciousness. Here it is said to be manifested as concurrence. Actually it
comes about with the concurrence of these three. When these three come
together, it arises also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd it is said to have as its proximate cause an objective
field that has come into focus because it arises <u>automatically</u> through
the appropriate [conscious] <u>reaction</u> and with a faculty when the
objective field is presented.î So here ëappropriate reactioní really means
appropriate adverting, turning towards the object. ëFacultyí here means the eye
faculty. So it arises on the object without obstruction prepared by, it is as
though the object is prepared by the adverting and eye faculty. When you see
something, there is the seeing thought process. Before seeing consciousness
there is five-sense-door adverting. The seeing consciousness takes the object
which is prepared by or which is made ready by the five-sense-door adverting.
That means the five-sense-door adverting turns the mind towards the object. So
it is said to prepare the object for the next moment of consciousness. So it is
prepared by appropriate adverting and faculty.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think I will have to get rid of the ëbutsí today. ìIt
should be regarded as like a hideless cow because it is the habitat of
feeling.î We do not need a ëbutí here in this statement. This simile is
described in the Sa—yutta Nik»ya. The Buddha said that phassa should be viewed
as a hideless cow. When the hide of the cow is removed, it is a place for
flies, or mosquitoes, or insects to come. In the same way when there is phassa
there is vedan» (feeling). It is the place for vedan» or feeling. That is why
it is regarded as like a hideless cow. If you want to read the Sutta, it is
Kindred Sayings, volume 2, page 69.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next one is cetan» (volition). Here also we need to get
rid of ëbutí. In the fifth line of paragraph 135 ìIt is evident when it occurs
in the marshaling (driving) of associated states in connection with urgent
work, remembering and so on.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìWhat should be said about applied thought, sustained
thought and happiness, has already been said in the commentary on the first
jh»na in the description of the earth kasi”a.î They are explained in chapter 4.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then we come to viriya (energy). ìIts characteristic is
marshaling (driving). Its function is to consolidate conascent states. It is
manifested as non-collapse. Because of the words ìBestirred, he strives
ëwiselyíî its proximate cause is a sense of urgency; or its proximate cause is
grounds for the initiation of energy.î I think we have not met with it before.
If you want to read about all these grounds, please read Dialogues of the
Buddha, part 3, page 239 for the grounds for the initiation of energy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I will tell you only two. There is something you have to do.
You have to do something. Before doing that, you say to yourself, when I am
doing that work, I will not get the opportunity to practice meditation. So I
must practice now before I get to that work. In this way you initiate energy.
You make effort and practice meditation. Then after the work you practice
meditation saying to yourself, I did not have the opportunity then to practice,
so now I will practice. This way you arouse energy in yourself. With regard to
work there are two. With regard to traveling there are two - before traveling
and after coming back from traveling. Then there is sickness. Before you get
sickness you practice meditation. And after sickness you practice meditation.
Then there is going for alms. Before going for alms and after going for alms
you practice meditation. Actually every time you have to arouse energy in order
to practice. These are called the grounds for the initiation of energy. ìWhen
rightly initiated, it should be regarded as the root of all attainments.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the next one is j vita. J vita is like j vita for
corporeality. Next is sam»dhi. ìIt puts consciousness evenly on the object, or
it puts it rightly on it.î In the word ësam»dhií there is the prefix ësamí.
That prefix, ësamí, can mean evenly (sama—) or rightly (samm»), so evenly or
rightly. ìOr it is just the mere collecting of the mind, thus it is concentration.
Its characteristic is non-wandering, or its characteristic is non-distraction.î
That is with regard to conascent states. It does not let the conascent states
be distracted and it itself is non-wandering. ìIts function is to conglomerate
conascent states as water does bath powder.î So it keeps them together. ìIt is
manifested as peace. Usually its proximate cause is bliss.î It is not always
the cause. Therefore it says ëusuallyí. Sam»dhi can be without sukha in the
fifth jh»na. ìIt should be regarded as steadiness of the mind, like the
steadiness of a lampís flame when there is no draught.î So steadiness of mind,
that is sam»dhi. Sam»dhi is a mental state which puts the mind on an object
evenly and rightly. ëEvenlyí means keeping the conascent states together.
ëRightlyí means not being itself distracted. That is what we call ësam»dhií. It
is on the object and it also keeps the other mental factors together, keeps
them from being scattered. That is what is called ësam»dhií. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next one is saddha (faith or confidence). With regard to
its function it ìis to enter into, like the setting out across a flood.î The
reference is given. I will give you another reference - The Expositor, page
158. That will give you the meaning of setting out across a flood. In brief a
brave man could take the people across a flood or across a river, crossing in a
boat or by themselves. In the same way saddha, when you have faith or
confidence, you can plunge into things and you can accomplish. So saddha is
compared to crossing the flood, or one who crosses the flood himself and who
takes others with him. That is what we call ësaddhaí. ìIt should be regarded as
a hand [because it takes hold of profitable things], as wealth, and as seed.î
For regarding faith as a hand please read Gradual Sayings, volume 3, page 245.
If you have a hand you can pick up things that are profitable for you, that are
good for you. In the same way if you have faith, if you have confidence, you
can get kusala. That is why it is compared to a hand. Sometimes it is compared
to wealth and sometimes to a seed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then we have sati (mindfulness). All of you about
mindfulness. ìIt has the characteristic of not wobbling.î That means not
floating on the surface. ìIts function is not to forget.î ëNot to forgetí means
not to lose the object. ìIt is manifested as guardingî and so on. ìIts
proximate cause is the foundations of mindfulness.î Here ëthe foundations of
mindfulnessí really means the objects of the foundations of mindfulness - the
body, feelings, consciousness and dhamma objects. ìIt should be regarded,
however, as like a pillar because it is firmly founded, or like a door-keeper
because it guards the eye door, and so on.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then there are two things, hiri and ottappa. Hiri is
translated as conscience and ottappa is translated as shame. I do not think
this is quite correct. Ottappa is fear or dread. Hiri is shame. I think we
should translate hiri as shame or conscience and ottappa as fear or dread.
ëFearí here means moral fear. We are ashamed to do what is morally wrong. That
is hiri or moral shame. We are afraid to do what is wrong because we do not
want to get the painful consequences of these actions. ìThis is a term for an
anxiety about evil. Herein, conscience (hiri) has the characteristic of disgust
at evil, while <u>shame</u> (ottappa) has the characteristic of dread of it.î
Right. So shame and dread or shame and fear are these two things. ìa man
rejects evil through conscience (hiri) out of respect for himself, as the
daughter of a good family does; he rejects evil through fear (not shame) out of
respect for another, as a courtesan does. These two states (We will strike out
the ëbutí.) should be regarded as the Guardians of the World.î They are
described as the guardians of the world will go on. When these two leave the
minds of beings, the world will become undifferentiated. Beings will not act
according to conscience. There will be no moral restrictions. Human beings will
become like animals. That is why they are called the Guardians of the World.
Moral shame and moral fear - that means shame to do immoral things and the fear
to do these things. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next ones are alobha (non-greed), adosa (non-hate) and
amoha (non-delusion). Amoha (non-delusion) means what? Pa““» (wisdom). Amoha
and pa““» are the same. About the middle of paragraph 143 ìIts function is not
to lay hold, like a liberated bhikkhu. It is manifested as a state of not
treating as a shelter like that of a man who has fallen into filth.î It means
not attached to or not adhering to, or something like that. When you fall into
filth, you are not attached to the filth. You want to get rid of it as soon as
possible. So it is not being attached. Two or three lines down ìIts (adosa)
function is to remove annoyance, or its function is to remove <u>fever</u> as
sandlewood does.î That means to remove heat, not necessarily fever. When people
are hot, people use sandlewood. They apply sandlewood paste to their bodies and
then they become cool. It is a very familiar thing in Myanmar. You may have
seen Burmese girls with something like a paste on their cheeks. It is only used
in Myanmar. It is like makeup, something you apply on your face. So when it is
not, they apply that kind of thing, especially sandlewood. They make sandlewood
into a paste. They apply it to the face or other parts of the body and it keeps
them cool. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìNon-delusion has the characteristic of penetrating [things]
according to their individual essencesî and so on. This is pa““». ìIt has the
characteristic of sure penetration.î So it will never miss. If it is real
pa““», it will never miss, ìlike the penetration of an arrow shot by a skillful
archer. Its function is to illuminate the objective field, like a lamp.î If
this room is dark, we cannot see things in this room. When there is light, we
see things clearly. In the same way when there is no pa““», we do not see
things as they are. When pa““» enters our mind, we see things as they are. So
it is like a lamp. ìIt is manifested as non-bewilderment, like a guide in the
forest.î You may be lost in the forest, but if you have a guide you will not
get lost. ìThe three should be regarded as the roots of all that is
profitable.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now there is tranquillity of body, tranquillity of
consciousness and so on. There are pairs. Here ëbodyí does not mean the
material body. Here ëbodyí means the three mental aggregates (feeling,
perception and mental formations). They are called here in P»ƒi ëk»yaí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next pair is lightness of the body and lightness of
consciousness. There are several material qualities among the mental properties.
The next pair is malleability of body and malleability of consciousness. The
next pair is wieldiness of body and wieldiness of consciousness. The next pair
is proficiency of body and proficiency of consciousness. And then there is
rectitude of body and rectitude of consciousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we come to zeal (chanda). Chanda is just the desire to
act, the mere will. ìSo that zeal has the characteristic of desire to act. Its
function is scanning for an object (searching for an object). It is manifested
as need for an object. That same [object] is its proximate cause. It should be
regarded as the extending of the mental hand in the apprehension of an object.î
That means if you want to pick up something, you put out your hand. It is not
attachment. It is just the mere will-to-do, the desire-to-do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next one is resolution. ìIt has the characteristic of
conviction. Its function is not to grope. It is manifested as decisiveness. Its
proximate cause is a thing to be convinced about. It should be regarded as like
a boundary-post (or it is a gate-post) owing to its immovableness with respect
to the object.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next one in P»ƒi is manasik»ra. ì It is the maker of
what is o be made, it is the maker in the mind.î This definition is difficult
to translate. The P»ƒi is manasi and k»ra. ëK»raí means doing, making. ëManasií
means mind. So ëmanasik»raí means doing in the mind or making the mind. That is
one meaning. That means paying attention. The other meaning is making the mind.
That means making the mind different. ìIt makes the mind different from the
previous [life-continuum] mind, thus it is attention.î After the word ëthusí we
should put the word ëalsoí. We need to put the word ëalsoí because it is a
different definition than the first one. The first one says it is making in the
mind. The second one says making the mind. Here ëmaking the mindí means making
the mind different. This definition refers to the second and third kind of
attention described later towards the end of the paragraph.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are three kinds of manasik»ra - controller of objects,
controller of cognitive series (That means controller of thought process.),
controller of impulsions. ëController of cognitive seriesí means controller of
five-door-adverting. Five-door-adverting is called of thought process because
the real thought process begins with that moment of consciousness. ëController
of impulsionsí means mind-door-adverting because after the mind-door-adverting
come impulsionss. But they are not meant here. What is meant is just attention
which is called ëcontroller of objectsí. So there are three kinds of manasik»ra
- controller of objects, controller of cognitive series and controller of
impulsions. The last two are not meant here. The first one, the controller of
objects is what is meant here. That means paying attention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next one is specific neutrality. It is often called
upekkh». The P»ƒi is tatramajjhattat», neutrality in regard thereto - that
means being in the middle, not falling into liking or disliking. ìIt has the
characteristic of conveying consciousness and consciousness concomitants
evenly. Its function is to prevent deficiency and excess, or its function is to
inhibit partiality. It is manifested as neutrality. It should be regarded as
like a conductor (driver) who looks with equanimity on thoroughbreds
progressing evenly.î I compare this to cruise control in a car. You put on the
cruise control and you donít have to worry about speed. When horses are drawing
the cart evenly, you donít have to worry about them. You just look on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The compassion (karun») and gladness (mudit») are described
in the section on divine abodes. The only difference is that there they belong
to jh»nas and here they belong to k»m»vacara. In paragraph 154 ìThat should not
be admitted for, as to meaningî - instead of ëas to meaningí we should say ëin
realityí. So ìthat should not be admitted for, in reality, non-hate itself is
loving-kindness, and specific neutrality itself is equanimity.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then we have the three abstinences. I think you understand
about them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the mental states that arise with the different kinds
of consciousness are described. It may be confusing for you if you do not have
the 89 types of consciousness and the 52 mental factors in mind. You may study
The Manual of Abhidhamma or during the Abhidhamma class here I distributed
handouts. You may look at those handouts and read these passages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then we come to the unprofitable (akusala) in paragraph 159.
There are, as regards the unprofitable, constants, inconstants and or-whatever
states. They are clearly mentioned here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Beginning in paragraph 160 we have consciencelessness and
shamelessness. Here we may say that the first one is shamelessness and the
second one is fearlessness. Ahirika is shamelessness and anottappa is
fearlessness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lobha and moha are described in paragraph 161 and 162. Greed
is compared to bird lime or monkey lime. The explanation or the description of
greed being like monkey lime can be read in Kindred Sayings, book 5, page 127.
When a monkey is stuck to that lime it cannot get itself free from that lime,
from that sticky substance. In the same way when you have greed, when you have
attachment, you cannot get away from it. You are stuck to the object.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 163 ìIt is manifested as the absence of right
theory.î What is theory? Is it understanding?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: It is an idea that has not been proven yet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: I see. The word used here is pa‘ipatti. It means
understanding or knowing. So here it is the absence of right understanding.
Then wrong view, agitation and so on are described. I think that they are not
difficult to understand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I brought these two sheets. The cetasikas are given in the
order as in The Manual of Abhidhamma. The Roman numerals are those given in
this book. If you look at the end of paragraph 166, you will find stiffness and
torpor given only one number, 43, the Roman numeral. For ekaggat» it gives two
numbers here in this book. Actually that should have only one number.
Steadiness of consciousness is the same as concentration which is #8. It should
not be given a separate number because it is the same mental factor as
concentration. Stiffness and torpor should each be given a number. So there may
be some corrections to be made. As it is you may look at this sheet and then
find out what is meant in The Manual of Abhidhamma. In<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>this book the mental states are not given in
the groups in which they belong. They are given as accompanying different types
of consciousness. For example contact is repeated in paragraphs 170, 176, 179
and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We find another theory in paragraph 179. ìIt should be
regarded as obstructive of <u>theory</u>.î Here again I think we should say ìIt
should be regarded as obstructive of understanding.î<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>In Myanmar we understand this as meaning
obstructive of practice. If you have doubt, then you do not practice. So it
obstructs your practice. You have doubt about the teaching. You have doubt
about the efficacy of this method. Then you will not practice. So it is
obstructive to practice. We interpret the word as practice in Myanmar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the book describes which mental factors accompany which
kinds of consciousness. As I said, it may be confusing if you do not have the
89 types of consciousness in mind. It is better to read The Manual of
Abhidhamma to find out which types of consciousness accompany which cetasikas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now there is one thing. At the beginning of paragraph 133 it
is said that the first type of consciousness is accompanied by 36 mental
factors. ìHerein, firstly, those associated with the first sense-sphere
profitable consciousness amount to 36.î Is that correct? Yes. Why 36 and not
38? Actually there must be 38. Why 36? I will give you a hint.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Feeling and perception are in other aggregates.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Thatís right. We are talking about formation
aggregate here. So vedan» and sa““» are not counted here. But in The Manual of
Abhidhamma vedan» and sa““» are counted because they are mental factors. In The
Manual of Abhidhamma you will find 38 mental factors accompanying this
consciousness. They are both correct. Here the author is describing the mental
formations aggregate. That is why the two are missing here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: I thought there were 52.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: There are 52 mental factors, but for sa~kh»ra
aggregate there are only 50, not 52. This chapter is like The Manual of
Abhidhamma. You are really studying Abhidhamma. With these I think you can find
out which is which. That is why there are no numbers for vedan» and sa““». The
asterisks are for or-whatever states and the plus signs are for inconstants.
ëInconstantí means these mental factors do not always accompany the
consciousness. They accompany that type of consciousness sometimes only. For
example #25 (thina) and #26 (middha) on this handout accompany the five kinds
of prompted consciousness, not every type. Suppose a person is stealing
something, actively stealing. His consciousness may not be accompanied by thina
and middha. Only when there is sleepiness or something similar is the
consciousness accompanied by thina and middha. Otherwise they do not arise. So
they are called inconstants, unfixed adjuncts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next week we will go up to the end of bases, up to chapter
15, paragraph 16. We have come to the end of the five aggregates. Next week
there will be some more to know about the five aggregates. The detailed
treatment of five aggregates is complete now. What are the five aggregates?
Aggregate of matter, aggregate of feeling, aggregate of perception, aggregate
of mental formations, aggregate of consciousness. Here the aggregate of
consciousness is given before the three other aggregates. The usual order given
in the Suttas is matter, feeling, perception, mental formations and
consciousness. These five can be reduced to two, n»ma and r|pa. Corporeality
aggregate is r|pa. The other four are n»ma. When we say n»ma and r|pa, we mean
these five aggregates. They mean the same thing actually.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are on page 535, paragraph 185, the classification of the
five aggregates under eleven heads. With the help of the handouts you can
locate the cittas and the cetasikas in the Path of Purification. The order in
The Path of Purification is different than that in The Manual of Abhidhamma. We
are primarily acquainted with the order in The Manual of Abhidhamma, so we
always go from that reference. Today is the classification of the five
aggregates. We have finished the five aggregates in detail. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe foregoing section, firstly, is that of the detailed
explanation of the aggregates according to the Abhidhamma Bh»janiya.î That is
one treatment of the aggregates in the second book of Abhidhamma. Vibha~ga is
the second book of Abhidhamma.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBut the aggregates have been given in detail by the Blessed
One [in the Suttanta Bh»janiya] in this way.î In the Vibha~ga when the Buddha
treated the aggregates and also other subjects, he treated first the Suttanta
exposition and then Abhidhamma exposition. Then there was an exposition of
questions and answers. In these expositions he treated the aggregates. Here the
author of The Path of Purification took the first method of exposition, that is
Suttanta Bh»janiya.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAny materiality whatever, whether past, future or present,
internal and external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near: all
that together in the mass and all that together in the gross is called the
materiality aggregateî and so on. This can be found in the other parts of the
canon, the Majjjhima Nik»ya, and in other Suttas also. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the author explains the words ëwhateverí and
ëmaterialityí. ìHerein, the word whatever includes without exception.î In P»ƒi
the word is ya— ki“ci. ëYa— ki“cií means whatever or it can mean all. The word
ëwhateverí or ëya— ki“cií includes everything. When we say, let us say ëall
materialityí, if we just say ëallí we have to take all materiality as well as
mentality. The word ëallí or ëwhateverí includes without exception everything.
But to limit its scope the word ëmaterialityí is put. So materiality prevents overgeneralization,
overextension. When we say ëallí, it covers both mind and matter. When you say
ëall matterí, then you take only matter, but not mind. So the word
ëmaterialityí prevents overextension of the word ëwhateverí or ëallí. With
these two words we just mean materiality, all kinds of materiality - past,
present, future and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The P»ƒi word here is patisanga for overgeneralization.
ëPasangaí actually means to<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>stick. So
when you say something, it extends to this thing, that thing and so on. In
order to restrict the extension of the word ëmaterialityí is put here. Here
ëall materialityí means all materiality and not mentality. ìThus materiality is
comprised without exception by the two expressions.î So all materiality is
included or taken by these two words. ìThen he undertakes its exposition as
past, future and present, etc.í</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here the Commentator explains past, future and present in
the fourfold way - according to extent, according to continuity, according to
period and according to moment. So he explains as extent past, continuity past,
period past, moment past, like that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHerein, firstly, according to extent: in the case of a
single becoming (That is one life.) of one [living being], previous to
rebirth-linking is past, subsequent to death is future, between these two is
present.î The present life is present. The life before it is past. The life
after it is future. That is according to extent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>According to continuity that means a series of matter or a
series of mind. ìThat [materiality] which has like or <u>single origination</u>
by temperature and <u>single origination</u> by nutriment, though it occurs
successively, is present.î Here it is not single origination but origination by
single temperature. So you can say ìThat [materiality] which has origination by
single temperature and origination by single nutriment.î ëSingle temperatureí
here means just one kind of temperature. For example you are in the sun. Then
there is hot temperature, heat. You go into the shade. Then the temperature
changes to cold. That one series of hot temperature is said to be present. Then
before that there was some dissimilar temperature and that is past. And another
dissimilar temperature after that is future. So here we have origination by
single temperature and originated by single nutriment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThat which, previous to that, was of unlike origination by
temperature and nutriment. That is origination by unlike temperature and unlike
nutriment is past. That which is subsequent is future. That which is born of
consciousness and has its origination in one cognitive series, in one
impulsion, in one attainment, is present.î This is with regard to materiality
born of consciousness. ëHas its origination in one cognitive seriesí that means
thought processes of five-door. ëIn one impulsioní really means mind-door
thought process. In the mind-door thought process there is only adverting and
impulsions or javanas. So it is just called ëjavanaí. So origination in one
impulsion means origination in one thought process belonging to mind-door. ëIn
one attainmentí - that is attainment of jh»na. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìPrevious to that is past. Subsequent to that is future.
There is no special classification into past continuity, etc., of that which
has its origination in kamma (That which is caused by kamma.).î So with regard
to materiality caused by kamma there is no classification into past continuity,
present continuity or future continuity. ìBut its pastness, etc., should be
understood according as it supports those which have their origination through
temperature, nutriment and consciousness.î Although kamma does not produce, it
supports the materiality caused by other causes (temperature, nutriment and
consciousness). So in reality there is no classification into past, present and
future continuity with regard to matter born of kamma. But they can be said to
be past, present and future because they support the materiality caused by
temperature, caused by nutriment and caused by consciousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Footnote 74 is in fact for this passage. Even in the
Sub-commentary it is a little confusing. The footnote is for this passage. It
looks like it is explaining the word ëcauseí and ëconditioní in paragraph 191.
The subsequent paragraph in the footnote that begins ìBecause there is
similarityî and so on refers to this sentence. ìThere is no special
classification into past continuity, etc., of thatî and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In footnote 74 about three lines down ìJust as the seedís
function is to arouse the sprout and that of the earth, etc., is to consolidate
it, and just as kamma function is to arouse result as matter that is due to
kamma performed,î - there are some words missing. ëAnd resultant consciousnessí
- we have to put these words after ëperformedí. That is because the result of
kamma is not only matter but also consciousness. You know at the moment of
relinking, there is relinking consciousness which is the result of kamma. Along
with this relinking consciousness there are material properties caused by kamma
that arise. Kamma produces not only kamma-born matter but also consciousness.
So here we should say ìto arouse result as matter that is due to kamma
performed and resultant consciousness.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd that of nutriment, etc., (Etcetera is missing there.),
is to consolidate itî and so on. There are two kinds of causes or whatever we
may call it - one that produces and the other that supports or that
consolidates. There are two kinds of conditions. With regard to a seed becoming
a tree or a plant, the seed is the producing cause of the tree. Earth, water
and temperature are the supporting conditions of the tree.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With regard to those that are born of kamma we cannot say
this belongs to the past, this belongs to the present, this belongs to the
future. ìBecause there is similarity or dissimilarity in temperature, etc., in
the way stated the pastness, etc., of material instances originated by it are
stated according to continuity. But there is no such similarity and
dissimilarity in the kamma that gives birth to a single becoming, so instead of
stating according to continuity the pastness, etc., of material instances
originated by that, it is stated according to what consolidates.î With regard
to what it consolidates the matter born of kamma is said to belong to past,
present or future.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the Sub-Commentator added his own observation with the
words beginning ìHowever when there comes to be reversal of sexî and so on. It
may not please the ladies. Especially in the Vinaya there are instances where
people have their sex change. It is changed by kamma, not by surgery. There are
instances of change of sex in the Vinaya Pitaka. You know men are supposed to
be superior to women. ìThe male sex disappears owing to powerful unprofitable
kamma (akusala).î As a result of akusala the male sex disappears. ìThe female
sex appears owing to weak profitable kamma.î It is due to kusala kamma, but it
is weak kusala kamma. If it is strong kusala kamma, then it will be male sex
and not female sex and so on. It is the addition of the Sub-commentator.
According to the Visuddhi Magga there can be no classification into past
continuity, etc., with regard to kamma-born matter. But here it is said there
can be past, present and future even with regard to kamma-born matter because
of sex change. Before the change it was past. The change is the present. Then
maybe in the future there is change to the previous sex. So there can be
classification into past, present and future even with regard to kamma-born
matter. This addition was made by the Sub-Commentator. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAccording to period: any period among those such as one
minute, morning, evening, day and night, etc., that occurs as a continuity, is
called present.î This minute is present. The past minute is past. The future
minute is future and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAccording to moment: what is included in the trio of
moments [that is to say, arising, presence, and dissolution, (the three
sub-moments),] beginning with arising is called present.î So this is the real
present. ìAt a time previous to that it is future. At a time subsequent to that
it is past.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìFurthermore, that whose functions of cause and condition
have elapsed is past.î Here ëcauseí means producing and ëconditioní means
supporting. ìThat whose function of cause is finished and whose function of
condition is unfinished is present.î That means something is caused by some
other thing. Something which is caused is in existence now. Its origination is
over, but its continuation or its being supported is still going on. Thatís why
it says ìwhose function of cause is finished, and whose function of condition
is unfinished is present.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThat which has not attained to either function is future.
Or alternatively, the moment of the function is present.î That means when a
certain matter or mind is doing its own function, then that is the present
moment. At the time previous to that it is the past and subsequent to that is
the future. That is division according to moment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next is the division into internal and external. ìThe
division into internal and external is as already stated. Besides, it is
internal in the sense of oneís own that should be understood here as internal
and that of another person as external.î In the footnote the four kinds of
internal are given. ìNiyak-ajjhatta - internally in the sense of oneís own:
four kinds of ajjhatta (internal, lit. ëbelonging to oneselfí) are mentioned in
the Commentaries and Sub-Commentaries.î The first one is gocarajjhatta.
Gocarajjhatta is internally as range or resort. Then ajjhattajjhatta is
internally as such. Niyakajjhatta is internal in the sense of oneís own. And
visayajjhatta is internally as objective field. Do you understand?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>The first one, gocarajjhatta, is simply any
internal object. Any internal object is called ëgocarajjhattaí. The next one,
ajjhattajjhatta, means very internal because the word ajjhatta is repeated,
ajjhattajjhatta (internal, internal). By that is meant the five senses - eye,
ear, nose, tongue and body sensitivity. They are called ajjhattajjhatta. In the
section on matter they are called internal, in P»ƒi ajjhattika. The third one
here is niyakajjhatta. That means anything which arises in oneís own
continuity. That is called niyakajjhatta. The last one, visayajjhatta, is
really the attainment of Fruition or sam»patti. It is not internally as
objective field. We can say ëinternally as scopeí. Because when the Buddha is
in the Phala attainment, he has mastery over it. So it is called visayajjhatta.
So there are four kinds of ajjhatta. Sometimes we are not sure which ajjhatta
is meant and so we have to find out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first division into internal and external is just as stated
in paragraph 73. Another way of explaining it is internal in the sense of one's
own. That means everything in me is internal and everything in you is external.
For you everything in you is internal and everything in others is external.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìGross and subtle are also as already stated.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìInferior and superior are twofold, namely, figurative
(relative) and absolutely literal. Herein, the materiality of the Sudassin
deities is inferior to the materiality of the Akani‘‘ha deities.î You may
remember the 31 planes of existence. He is referring to that. Akani‘‘ha is the
highest of the form-brahm»s. That is the most superior. Sudassin is one stage
below the Akani‘‘ha. ìThe same materiality [of the Sudassin deities] is
superior to the materiality of the Sudassa deities. Thus, firstly, should
inferiority and superiority be understood figuratively down as far as the
denizens of hell.î One is superior to the next below it and so on until you
reach hell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBut absolutely literally it is inferior where it arises as
unprofitable result, and it is superior where it arises as profitable result.î
Absolutely or in the ultimate sense inferior arises as the result of
unprofitable kamma (akusala kamma). That which arise as the result of kusala
kamma (profitable kamma is superior.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìFar and near, this is also as already described.î That
which is difficult to see is far. That which is not difficult to see or which
is easy to see is near. ìBesides, relative farness and nearness should be
understood here according to location.î According to location we may say this
is near and that is far.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAll that together in the mass and in the gross: by making
all that materiality separately described by the words ëpastí, etc., into a
collection by understanding its oneness, in other words, its characteristic of
being molested, it comes to be called materiality aggregate.î This shows why
they are called ëaggregatesí. ìMateriality, separately described by the words
ëpastí, etc.î - so it is described as past, present, future, internal,
external, gross, subtle, far, near and so on. That materiality described in
that way is made ìinto a collection by understanding in its oneness.î I think
the word ëiní is missing there. ëIn its onenessí, in other words , its
characteristic of being molested or its characteristic of change. The
characteristic of r|pa is change or being molested. With regard to this
characteristic all the matter described as past, present and future are
collected by understanding. That is why it is called an aggregate. ëBy understandingí
should go with ëmaking a collectioní. ëmaking a collectioní means you collect
them up in your mind with understanding. Past, present and future cannot exist
at the same time. We can only have the present matter here. The past is already
past and we cannot collect and we cannot take it and put it here. And we cannot
take the future and put it with the present physically. But in our minds we can
group them together.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>ëBy understandingí
means by our minds we group them together and we call it an ëaggregateí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ëAggregateí does not necessarily mean a group of different
material properties. There are 28 kinds of material properties. These 28 are
also called ëthe aggregate of matterí. Each one of the material properties can
be called an ëaggregate of matterí. This is true not only when they are taken
together. Let us say the eye sensitivity. Only one eye sensitivity is called an
ëaggregateí. That is because there is eye sensitivity which is past, which is
present, which is future, which is gross, which is subtle, which is inferior,
which is superior, which is far, which is near. We group these different kinds
of eye sensitivity together and call it a group or call it an aggregate.
Aggregate or group does not necessarily mean that there must be a real group of
matter. Even one material particle, one feeling, one perception is called an
ëaggregateí. This explains why they are called ëaggregatesí. ëBy understandingí
should go with ëmaking into a collectioní. So it is making into a collection in
the mind. In its oneness that is its characteristic. Here it is with regard to
matter being molested or changed. With regard to feeling it is with regard to
its characteristic of feeling. With regard to perception it is with regard to
its characteristic of perception. With regard to consciousness it is with
regard to its knowing the object and so on. This is the reason why even one
particle of matter or even one mental factor is called an ëaggregateí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBy this, too, it is shown that the materiality aggregate is
all materiality, which all comes into the collection with the characteristic of
being molested; for there is no materiality aggregate apart from materiality.î
Feeling and the others are the same. It is the classification of the first
aggregate, r|pa aggregate, into eleven headings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we have the feeling aggregate. ìIn the classification
into past, etc., the past, future and present state of feeling should be
understood according to continuity and according to moment and so on.î It is
the same as in the material aggregate. ëAccording to continuity - that included
in a single cognitive series<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>- that
means five-door thought process. ëA single impulsioní means mind-door thought
process. ìA single attainment, and that occurring in association with objective
field of one kind (one object) is present. Before that is past. Subsequent is
future.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAccording to moment, etc.; that feeling included in the
trio of moments (three moments), which is in between the past time and the
future time, and which is performing its own function (which is doing its own
function, so it is really present now), is present. Before that is past.
Subsequent is future. Then there is internal and external.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next there is gross and subtle. Gross and subtle should be
understood according to kind, according to individual essence, according to
person, and according to mundane and supramundane. ìAccording to kind: the
unprofitable feeling is a state of disquiet, because it is the cause of
reprehensible actions and because it produces <u>burning of</u> defilement.î
That means defilement that is burning, not the burning away of defilement.
ëBurning of defilementí means defilements that are called burning. So it is
gross. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd because it is accompanied by interestedness (That means
activeness.) and drive and result, and because of the burning of the
defilements (because they are burning), and because it is reprehensible, it is
gross compared with resultant indeterminateî and so on. So here one is
described as gross or subtle relative to other kinds of feeling. There is kusala
feeling, akusala feeling, indeterminate (aby»kata) feeling and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then we have according to individual essence. ìPainful
feeling, is gross compared with the others because it is without enjoyment, it
involves <u>intervention</u>.î ëInterventioní really means shakiness or
non-peacefulness. ìIt causes disturbance, creates anxiety, and is overpowering.
The other two are subtle compared with the painful because they are satisfying,
peaceful, and superior, and, respectively agreeable, and neutral.î This is the
reason for their being subtle and gross. Also their states of subtleness and
grossness are relative.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAccording to person: feeling in one who <u>has no</u>
attainmentî - I would say ëfeeling in one who is not in attainmentí. A person
may have attainment but if he is not in attainment at the moment his feeling
could be gross. So ìAccording to person: feeling in one who is not in
attainment, is gross compared with that in one (Say»daw corrected in the same
manner.) who is in attainment, because it is distracted by a multiple object.
In the opposite sense the other is subtle. This is how grossness and subtlety
should be understood according to person.î When a person is in attainment (in
attainment of jh»na or in attainment of phala). The feeling is said to be subtle.
If the person is not in attainment, the feeling is said to be gross.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAccording to the mundane and supramundane: feeling subject
to cankers is mundane (ëSubject to cankersí means object of cankers, which can
be the object of »savas or just mental defilements.), and that is gross
compared with that free from cankers, because and that is gross compared with
that free from cankers, because it is the cause for the arising of cankers, is
liable to floods, liable to the bonds, liable to the ties, liable to the
hindrances, liable to the clingings, defilable, and shared by ordinary men.î
These floods, bonds, ties, hindrances, clingings and the defilable can be
understood by referring to The Manual of Abhidhamma, chapter 7. In the fact the
mental defilements are given different names. The same mental defilements are
given different names. For example lobha is a mental defilement. Lobha is given
the name of canker, flood, bond, hindrance, clinging and so on. Buddha
described these in different ways to suit the susceptibility to understanding
of his listeners. They are taught in Abhidhamma as well as in the Suttas. To
understand them the best place to go is The Manual of Abhidhamma. In chapter 7
of The Manual of Abhidhamma they are described. Almost or towards the end of
the book<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>we will find them again when
how these defilements are eradicated by Path consciousness is described. The
first path consciousness eradicates two or three of the defilements. That comes
later almost at the end of the book. ëShared by ordinary mení means those that
arise in puthujjanas. ìThe latter, in the opposite sense, is subtle compared
with that subject to cankers.î Those that are not subject to cankers, those
that are not the object of cankers are subtle. ìThis is how grossness and subtlety
should be understood according to the mundane and supramundane.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then there is a warning. ìOne should beware of mixing upî -
because if you mix them up, you will be confused. Beware of - the P»ƒi word
actually means avoid. So one should avoid mixing up the classifications
according to kind and so on. So just do according to one, say according to kind
or to some other thing, but do not mix them together. If you mix them together,
then there will be contradiction. According to one it may be subtle and to
another it may be gross. That is what the Commentary gives here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIt is said ìIndeterminate feeling is subtle, painful
feeling is gross. The feeling in one with an attainment is subtle.î This is a
passage from the Viba~ga. ìAnd like painful feeling, so also pleasant, etc., is
gross according to kind and subtle according to individual essence.î Let us say
there is dukkha (pain). Pain is gross according to its individual essence
because it afflicts us. It is indeterminate, it is aby»kata in another sense.
It is neither kusala nor akusala. It is aby»kata. So it is subtle because
aby»kata is described as subtle. If we mix these two, we will get nowhere.
According to one it is subtle and according to another it is gross. Do not mix
them up. ìFor instance, [when it is said] ëThe indeterminate according to kind
is subtle compared with the profitable and the unprofitableí, the individual
essence class, etc., must not be insisted upon like this: ëWhich kind of
indeterminateí?î You donít ask the questions. ìIs it the painful? Is it the
pleasant? Is it that one with an attainment? Is it that one with no attainment?
Is it subject to cankers? Is it that free from cankers?í, and so in each
instance.î So you cannot ask these questions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìFurthermore, because of the words ëOr feeling should be
regarded as gross or subtle in comparison with this or that feelingí, among the
unprofitable, etc., feeling accompanied by hate, too, is gross compared with
that accompanied by greed because it burns up its own support, like a fire; and
that accompanied by greed is subtle. Also that accompanied by hate is gross
when the hate is constant, and subtle when it is inconstant.&quot; I wonder
whether you understand that. In order to correctly understand it, you have to
understand Abhidhamma. You have to go to the first book of Abhidhamma. The
words ëconstantí and ëinconstantí do not mean the same as what we had before.
Formerly ëconstantí and ëinconstantí referred to cetasikas. cetasikas that are
constant go along with a given citta all the time. Every time that citta
arises, that cetasika also arises. That is called ëconstantí. There are some
cetasikas that do not arise every time that a citta arises. These are called
ëinconstantí. So cetasikas may be constant or inconstant. But here although the
P»ƒi word is the same, the meaning is very different. You have to have a
knowledge of the first book of Abhidhamma to understand this. ëConstantí here
actually means fixed as to giving results in the next life. They are sure to
give results in the next life. Such kamma, or hate, or anger is called
ëconstantí. ëInconstantí means not fixed as to giving results in the next life.
Examples are killing oneís own mother, killing oneís own father and so on. When
you kill your own father or mother, there is dosa. That dosa is called ëfixedí
because it will invariably give results in the next life. That means you will
go to hell. There is no way of avoiding that. Now you may kill an animal. There
also you have dosa. That dosa will give you results in woeful states but not
necessarily in the next life. You may get the result of killing that animal in
other lives or you may get the result in the next life. So that is not fixed.
Killing oneís own mother, or killing oneís own father, killing an Arahant,
wounding the Buddha, causing schism in the Sa~gha are called ëgrievous sinsí in
Buddhism. If you do one of these, you will surely go to hell in the next life.
There is no way of avoiding that. Such kamma is called ëconstantí here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd subtle when it is inconstant. And the constant is gross
when giving result that lasts for the eon, while the other is subtle.î Among
the fixed as to giving results there are two subdivisions - those whose results
last for the eon and those whose results do not last for the eon. I will give an
example. You know Aj»tasattu and Devadatta. Aj»tasattu was the son of King
Bimbis»ra. Devadatta was Buddhaís cousin and brother-in-law. Aj»tasattu killed
his own father at the instigation of Devadatta. Devadatta wanted to become the
Buddha himself. So he thought ìNowadays people live long lives. We cannot wait
until they die. You kill your own father and be a king and I will kill my
brother-in-law and be a Buddha.î So he instigated Aj»tasattu to kill his own
father. Aj»tasattu did kill his own father. Among the five grievous sins
Devadatta did two. He wounded the Buddha. In fact he tried to kill the Buddha,
but he was not successful. So the Buddha was wounded when he pushed the rock
onto the Buddha as he was walking up and down. That was one. The other one was
causing division in the Sa~gha or schism in the Sa~gha. He did two of the
grievous sins. It is said that he is now in the lowest hell. He will be there
for the rest of this eon, for the rest of this world cycle. That is what is
meant here by ëthat which lasts for the eoní. Aj»tasattu also went to hell
immediately after his death. He will not suffer in hell for the rest of the
eon. That is the difference. The constant is gross when giving result that
lasts for the eon, and it is not gross, it is subtle, when the result lasts not
for the eon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd of those giving result lasting for the eon the
unprompted is gross, while the other is subtle.î This is their relative
subtlety and grossness. ìBut that accompanied by greed is gross when associated
with [false] view, while the other is subtleî and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Devadatta instigated all these things. Would he go
to hell on account of instigating the death of King Bimbis»ra?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: His instigation can be taken as killing a being.
But for Aj»tasattu that being was his father. Ah»tasattuís akusala was grosser
that that of Devadatta for this action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: So it only counts as this heavy kamma if one kills
or instigates someone to kill oneís own father.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Iím not recommending any of these.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: ìfurthermore, the profitable of the sense-sphere is
gross; that of the fine-material sphere is subtle.î They are just relative. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThen according to location, painful feelings in hell are
gross, while in the animal generation (kingdom) they are subtle.. Those among
the Paranimmitavasavatti deities (That is the highest of the lower celestial
realms.) are subtle only. And the pleasant should be construed throughout like
the painful where suitable.î By planes also there can be subtlety and
grossness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd according to physical basis, any feeling that has an
inferior physical basis is gross, while one with a superior physical basis is
subtle.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìWhat is gross should be regarded as inferior in the
inferior - superior classification, and what is subtle superior.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then we have far and near. ìThe unprofitable is far from the
profitable and indeterminate and the word near in the way beginning
ëUnprofitable feeling is near to unprofitable feelingí. Therefore unprofitable
feeling is far from profitable and the indeterminate because of dissimilarity,
unconnectedness, and non-resemblance. The profitable and the indeterminate are
likewise far from the unprofitable.î Kusala and aby»kata are far from akusala.
ìAnd so in all instances. But unprofitable feeling is near to unprofitable
feeling because of similarity and resemblance.î This is the detailed
explanation dealing with the past, etc. Perception, formations and
consciousness should be understood similarly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next is the classes of knowledge of the five aggregates.
That is the order of the five aggregates, then distinction and so on. There are
different kinds of order that we find in the Abhidhamma and in the Suttas. He
describes all the orders. The first is what? The order of arising. Sometimes
things are described in the order of arising. ìFirst there comes to be the
fetus in the first stage, then there comes to be the fetus in the second stageî
and so on. That is the order of arising. The first stage arises first, then the
second stage arises, and the third stage arises and so on. If it is described
in this way, then it is described in the order of arising. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThings to be abandoned by seeing, things to be abandoned by
development (This comes from Abhidhamma.) etc., is the order of abandoning.î
ëThings to be abandoned by seeingí means mental defilements abandoned by the
first Path (Sot»patti Magga). ëThings to be abandoned by developmentí means
those defilements by the upper three Maggas. So it is in the order of
abandoning. ìPurification of virtue: purification of consciousness, etc., is
order of practice.î You know there are seven purifications or seven stages of
purity in the practice of vipassan»<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>-
purity of morals (here virtue), purity of consciousness, purity of view, purity
of overcoming doubt, and so on. These are described in the order of practice.
With regard to these stages of purity you cannot skip. You cannot practice
purification of consciousness before you practice purification of virtue. You
practice one after the other in this order. It is the order of practice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes they are described in order of plane. That means
the sense-sphere, the fine-material sphere and so on (k»m»vacara, r|pavacara,
ar|p»vacara). This is in order of plane. Sometimes things are just given in the
order of teaching. That means in teaching the Buddha gave this first, the other
second, and the other third. There is no particular merit in putting this first
and the other second and so on. ìThe four foundations of mindfulness, the four
right efforts, etc., Dhamma talk on giving, Dhamma talk on virtue, etc., is
order of teaching.î There are four foundations of mindfulness. The first is
contemplation on the body, the second is feelings, the third is on
consciousness and the last is on dhamma objects. They are not to be practiced one
after the other. It is not meant that you must practice body contemplation
first and then go to feeling contemplation, and then go on to contemplation of
consciousness. It is not to be done in this way. The description here is not
according to the order of practice, but it is just the order of teaching. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: The practice of giving and virtue are the first two
of the p»ramit»s in Mah»y»na. Where does this come from? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Here it is a stock phrase that we often come across
in the Suttas. When the Buddhaís teaching is mentioned in summary, it is
mentioned in this way. Buddha would talk first about giving, then about virtue,
then about the celestial worlds, then about getting dispassioned about sensual
things and so on. It is Buddhaís way of teaching people was to first talk about
giving. Then he would talk about s la and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: The others donít follow?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: No, just the first two. You can find it in the
Majjhima Nik»ya, but such passages are scattered throughout the whole of the
P»ƒi Canon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìOf these, firstly, order of arising is not applicable
here.î Here we have first r|pa, then vedan» (feeling), sa““» (perception), then
sa~kh»ra (mental formations) and consciousness. This order is not in the order
of arising. We are not to understand that r|pa arises first, then feeling
arises, then perception arises and so on. This order of arising is not
applicable here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What about the order of abandoning? No because r|pa in fact
cannot be abandoned. Then is an order of practice? No. Is it an order of plane?
No. Only one remains, that is the order of teaching. Buddha happens to teach in
this way, in this order. The order of teaching is explained in paragraph 213.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ëAs to distinctioní - that means there are two kinds of
aggregates, just the aggregates and then aggregates as objects of clinging.
Buddha taught under two names. Sometimes he taught just as aggregates and
sometimes he taught as aggregates of clinging. What is the difference between
these two? When the Buddha said aggregates he meant all that there is: For
example the aggregate of feeling here means both mundane feeling and
supramundane feeling. When he says aggregate of clinging, he means only the
mundane, those that are the object of cankers. That is the difference.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Further down paragraph 214 you will see ìAny kind of
materiality whatever,..far or near, that is subject to cankers and liable to
the clingings: this is called the materiality aggregate [as object] of
clinging.î That is the explanation of why they are called ëthe aggregates of
clingingí. ëAggregates of clingingí means aggregates which are subject to
cankers which are liable to clinging. Briefly they are aggregates that are
objects of clinging, that are objects of mental defilements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the Buddha explained the First Noble Truth, at the end
of that explanation, he said that in brief the five aggregates of clinging are
dukkha. He used the words ëfive aggregates of clingingí. That means that he
meant the mundane cittas and cetasikas and r|pa. That is the difference.
ëAggregatesí means all. ëAggregates of clingingí means only those that are the
objects of clinging or that are the objects of cankers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 215 about the middle of the paragraph ìBut
feeling, etc., are <u>only</u> mentioned among the [simple] aggregates when
they are free from cankers.î What do you think about that? Can you agree with
that? There are simple aggregates and aggregates of clinging. ëAggregatesí
means all. ëAggregates of clingingí means only those that are the objects of
clinging. Now here ìFeeling, etc., are <u>only</u> mentioned among the
aggregates when they are free from cankers.î I think that is all right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Because when they are not free of cankers -</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: They are mentioned when they are free from cankers.
When they are not free from cankers, they are included in the aggregates of
clinging. I think that is correct. In P»ƒi the word ëonlyí is to be after
ësimple aggregatesí and not before ëmentionedí. ìBut feeling, etc., are
mentioned among the [simple] aggregates only when they are free from cankers.î
When they are not, they are included in the aggregates of clinging.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As to neither less nor more - why are there only five
aggregates, neither less nor more? ìBecause all formed things that resemble
each other fall into these groupsî and so on. This is the explanation of why
there are five and not four or six.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 220 ìAs to simile: the materiality aggregate [as
object] of clinging is like a sick-room because it is the dwelling-place, as
physical basis, door, and object, of the sick man, namely, the consciousness
aggregate as object of clinging. The feeling aggregate as object of clinging is
like the sickness because it afflicts.î Feeling is like sickness. Perception is
like what? ìThe <u>provocation</u> of the sickness.î That means actually the
cause of the sickness. The causes of sickness are said to be blood, or bile, or
wind, or phlegm. This is traditional Indian medicineís understanding of the
causes of diseases. It is accepted in the P»ƒi Commentaries too. The
ëprovocation of sicknessí really means the cause of sickness, the root cause of
sickness. The formation aggregate is like what? ìRecourse to what is
unsuitable.î That means doing things that are not suitable for your health,
like eating bad food. So eating bad food is like sa~kh»ra. The cause of the
disease, like blood or phlegm, is sa““». ìThe formations aggregate as object of
clinging is like having recourse to what is unsuitable.î So it is like eating
unsuitable food, staying in the cold for a long time. It is something like
that. ìBecause it is the source of feeling, which is sickness; for it is said
ëFeeling as feeling is the formed that they formí and likewise ëBecause of
unprofitable kamma having been performed and stored up, resultant body
consciousness has arisen accompanied by pain: the consciousness aggregate as
the object of clinging is like the sick man because it is never free from
feeling, which is the sickness.î So we have the sick dwelling-place, the
sickness, the cause of the sickness, then another cause of the sickness, and the
sick man. These five aggregates are compared to this. They are also compared to
a prison, punishment, the offense, the punisher, and the offender. They are
also compared to the dish, food, curry sauce poured over the food, the server
and the eater. These are all similes to be understood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Twice as to how to be seen - this is how we should view
them. ìThe exposition should be known twice as to how to be seen, namely, in
brief and in detail.î So they should be seen as ìan enemy with drawn sword, in
the snake simile, as a burden according to the Burden Sutta, as a devourer
according to the To-Be-Devoured Discourse, and as impermanent, painful,
not-self, formed, and murderous, according to the Yamaka Suttaî and so on.
According to these Suttas we should view them as being the enemy and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 225 ìAs to good for one seeing thus: good comes to
be accomplished in one who sees in the two ways thus in brief and in detail.
And the way of definition should be known according to that, that is to say,
firstly, one who sees the five aggregates as objects of clinging in the form of
an enemy with drawn sword, etc., is not worried by the aggregates, but one who
sees materiality, etc., in detail as a lump of froth, etc., is not one who sees
a core in the coreless.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd in particular one who sees internal materiality as foul
(ugly) fully understands nutriment.î ëFully understandsí really means not
having akusala with regard to that thing. So ëfully understands nutrimentí
means one does not get akusala with regard to nutriment, with regard to »h»ra
and so on. Whenever we find the word ëfully understandsí, we have to understand
in that way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHe abandons the perversion [of perceiving] beauty in the
foul (ugly), he crosses the flood of sense desire, he is loosed from the bond
of sense desire.î So floods, bonds, and all these come again. ìHe becomes
canker-free as regards the cankers of sense desire, he breaks the bodily tie of
covetousness. He does not cling with sense desire clingingî and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìOne who sees feeling as pain fully understands nutriment
consisting of contact.î You know that there are four kinds of nutriment. There
are real food, contact, volition and consciousness. The description is
according to that. So we come to the end of this chapter.</p>
