<p class=MsoNormal>Change-of-Lineage is actually next to the enlightenment,
next to the Path consciousness. Change-of-lineage comes next. Its position is
to advert to the Path, and so it belongs neither to Purification by Knowledge
and Vision of the Way nor to<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>Purification by Knowledge and Vision.î There are seven stages of purity
in vipassan» and they are given in this chart. So Knowledge of
Change-of-Lineage does not belong to any of these purifies; it is just in
between the one purity and the other. ìIts position is to advert to the Path,
and so it belongs neither to Purification by Knowledge ad Vision of the Way
(that is the previous one.) nor to Purification by Knowledge and Vision (the
succeeding one), but being intermediate, it is unassignable.î We cannot say
that it is included in the previous purity or the succeeding purity. So it is
free from both purities. ìStill it is reckoned as insight because it falls in
line with insight.î That is because it falls in the flow of insight vipassan»,
so it is called ëvipassan»í. But strictly speaking, it is not vipassan» because
it does not take formations as object; it takes Nibb»na as object. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìPurification of Knowledge and Vision (the last
purification), properly consists in knowledge of the four Paths, that is to
say, the Path of Stream Entry, the Path of Once-Return, the Path of Non-Return,
and the Path of Arahantship.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ì[Change-of-Lineage Knowledge and Knowledge of the First
Path]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Herein, nothing further needs to be done by one who wants to
achieve, firstly, the knowledge of the First Path.î Now he is very, very close
to the Path consciousness or enlightenment. So he doesnít have to do anything
more. ìFor what he needs to do has already been done by arousing the insight
that ends in conformity knowledge. As soon as conformity knowledge has arisen
in him in this way, and the thick murk that hides the truths has been dispelled
by the respective force peculiar to each of the three kinds of conformity, then
his consciousness no longer enters into, or settles down on, or resolves upon
any field of formations at all.î So his consciousness does not want to be on
the formations at all. That is because he has seen formations as impermanent,
as painful, and as not self. So his mind ìdoes not cling to anything, cleaves,
or clutches on it, but retreats, retracts and recoils as water does from a
lotus leaf, and every sign as object, every occurrence as object, appears as an
impediment.î At that moment he doesnít want to dwell on the formations, on mind
and matter which he has been observing all through vipassan» meditation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 5 ìThen while every sign and occurrence appears to
him as an impediment, when conformity knowledgeís repetition has ended,
change-of-lineage knowledge arises in him.î After the conformity knowledge, the
consciousness which is called ëconformity knowledgeí disappears. Then it is
followed by the consciousness called ëchange-of-lineageí. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìChange-of-lineage knowledge arises in him, which takes as
its object the signless, no-occurrence, no-formation, cessation, Nibb»na, (So
it takes Nibb»na as object.) - which knowledge passes out of the lineage, the
category, the plane, of the ordinary man and enters the lineage, the category,
the plane, of the Noble Ones.î Now there is the meaning of the P»ƒi word
ëgotrabhuí. In that word ëgotraí means lineage and ëbhuí has two meanings. One
meaning is ëto overpower or to go beyondí. The other meaning is ëto reach into,
or to go into, or to enterí. So the word ëgotrabhuí means going beyond the
lineage of the ordinary persons (puthijjana) or reaching into the lineage of
Noble Persons. So ëchange-of-lineageí really means overpowering one lineage and
then entering another lineage. So ëpasses out of the lineageí means to overcome
or to go beyond the lineage of ordinary persons and enter into the lineage of
Noble Persons because, after this, Path will arise. As son as Path arises, he
becomes a Noble Person; he is no longer an ordinary person. At this point he has
not yet changed, but he is prepared to change into another person. That is why
it is called ëchange-of-lineageí. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Does he know this is happening? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: After the enlightenment there will come the process
of reflection on the Path, Fruit and so on. At that time he knows. These
moments are very brief you know. Gotrabhu is just one moment of consciousness.
And then Path consciousness he has never experience this in his life before. So
it is like an overwhelming experience although it lasts for only one brief
thought moment. After this brief thought moment he is a changed person, changed
mentally. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBeing the first adverting, the first concern, the first
reaction, to Nibb»na as object, fulfills the state of a condition for the Path
in six ways.î So it is condition for the Path in six ways - as proximity,
contiguity, repetition, decisive support, absence, and disappearance
conditions. You have to go back to Pa‘‘h»na in order to understand these
conditions. Pa‘‘h»na conditions are described in the chapter on the Dependent
Origination. So it serves as conditions for the Path consciousness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHow is it that understanding of emergence and turning away
from the external is change-of-lineage knowledge?î and so on. These are
quotations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>In this quotation there is
footnote #1 ëaway from the externalí. He misunderstood the Sub-Commentary. ìIt
is the understanding of the turning away that is being effected, which turning
away is emergence from the field of formations; it is termed external because <u>the
unformed</u> <u>elementís existence is externalí</u>.î That is not correct. Now
here the formations are called ëexternalí. ëTurning away from the externalí
means turning away from the formations. Actually formations are not necessarily
external. If you are watching your own breath, or watching your own
consciousness, or watching your own feelings, how could they be external? They
are actually internal. But here they are called ëexternalí here. So ìIt is
termed (ëItí means the formations.) ëexternalí because it is external to the
unformed element.î That means they are not the unformed element. ëUnformed
elementí means what? Nibb»na. So they are other than Nibb»na. So they are
called ëexternalí. In fact they are not external; they are internal. You are
watching your own mind and matter. They are internal. But they are here called
ëexternalí because they are out of Nibb»na. It is something like that. So the
footnote should be: ìIt is termed external because it is external to the
unformed element.î Stop there. Then there is a note. ìThe unformed element (=
Nibb»na) is classed as ëexternalí under the ëInternal triad of the Abhidhamma
M»tik»î is not necessary. Although it is not wrong, it is not necessary here. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the first book of Abhidhamma Nibb»na is described as
ëexternalí. Although the yogis realize Nibb»na, it is external, not internal.
That is described in the first book of Abhidhamma. So Nibb»na is external
there, but here formations are called ëexternalí just because they are not
Nibb»na; they are out of Nibb»na.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 6 ìHere is a simile that illustrates how
conformity and change-of-lineage occur with different objects though occurring
in a single cognitive series with a single adverting.î As a rule, one thought
process must have only one object. If you look at the seeing thought process,
there are 17 moments of consciousness in that thought process. All 17 moments
of consciousness take the present visible object as object. There should be no
difference of object in one given thought process for different consciousnesses
in that one given thought process. But here it is different. Here some types of
consciousness take formations as object and some others take Nibb»na as object.
Although it is called one thought process, there is difference of object for
some types of consciousness in this thought process. This thought process
begins with mind-door adverting, and then there are three moments of impulsion.
After that there is change-of-lineage. So three moments plus change-of-lineage,
these four are javana (impulsion) moments. Now mind-door adverting and then the
three moments immediately following take formations as object. But
change-of-lineage takes Nibb»na as object. Then Path takes Nibb»na as object.
And then Fruition takes Nibb»na as object. In this particular thought process
there is difference of object. ìHere is a simile that illustrated how
conformity and change-of-lineage occur with different objects though occurring
in a single cognitive series (That means one thought process.) with a single
adverting.î Each thought process has one adverting at the beginning of it.
Sometimes if the object is through the five senses, then there is
five-sense-door adverting. If the object is through mid-door, then there is
mind-door adverting. So each thought process has one adverting. So this is said
here ëwith a single advertingí. With a single adverting, then ordinarily the
object must be the same. But in this particular thought process of
enlightenment, there is difference of object. Some moments take formations as
object and some others take Nibb»na as object.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this paragraph the author explains this: ìSuppose a man
wanted to leap across a broad stream and establish himself on the opposite
bank, he would run fast, and seizing a rope fastened to the branch of a tree on
the streamís near bank and hanging down, or a pole would leap with his body
tending, inclining, and leaning towards the opposite bank, and when he had
arrived above the opposite bank, he would let go, fall on to the opposite bank,
staggering first and then steady himself there; so too this meditator, who
wants to establish himself on Nibb»na, the bank opposite to the kinds of
becoming, generation, destiny, station, and abode, runs fast by means of the
contemplation of rise and fall, etc., (That is he is running fast at that
time.) and seizing with conformityís adverting to impermanence, pain, or not
self the rope of materiality fastened to the branch of his selfhood and hanging
down, or one among the poles beginning with feeling, he leaps with the first
conformity consciousness (So the first conformity consciousness is like
leaping.) without letting go and with the second he tends, inclines, and leans
towards Nibb»na, like the body that was tending, inclining, and leaning towards
the opposite bank; then, being with the third next to Nibb»na, which is now
attainable, like the otherís arriving above the opposite bank (Now he is on the
opposite bank.), he lets go that formation as object (He no longer takes
formations as object.) with the ceasing of that consciousness, and the
change-of-lineage consciousness he falls on to the unformed Nibb»na, the bank
opposite; but staggering, as the man did, for lack of previous repetition, he
is not yet properly steady on the single object. After that he is steadied by
path Knowledge.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He crosses over to the other bank and on the other bank he
lets go of the rope or lets go of the formations. Then he falls on the bank
which is Nibb»na. The first fall he was not yet steady and next moment when the
Path consciousness arises, he was steadily established on the other bank or on
Nibb»na.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 7 ìHerein, conformity is able to dispel the murk
of defilements that conceals the truths, but it is unable to make Nibb»na its
object.î It is the difference between conformity and change-of-lineage. So
conformity can dispel the defilements that conceal the truths, but it is unable
to make Nibb»na its object. Change-of-lineage is only able to make Nibb»na its
object, but it is unable to dispel the murk that conceals the truths. That is
because they have different functions. Then the smile follows. We will skip the
simile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 12 there is another simile. ìhere is a simile
for this. An archer, it seems, had a target set up at a distance of eight
usabhas (about 100 yards), and wrapping his face in a cloth and arming himself
with an arrow, he stood on a wheel contrivance (a revolving platform). Another
man turned the wheel contrivance, and when the target was opposite the archer,
he gave him a sign with a stick. Without pausing after the sign the archer shot
the arrow and hit the target.î Now in P»ƒi the word ëone hundredí was used so
it is not one target, but 100 targets put 100 or 200 yards away. And the man is
on a wheel contrivance or revolving platform. The other man turns the platform and
the archer was blindfolded. When he is face to face with one target, then the
man will give him a sign, maybe something like a bell. With that sign he shoots
the arrow and the arrow hits the target. There is not one target, but 100
targets. So the P»ƒi word used here is ëlakkha sata—í. It is not one but one
hundred. The reason why he took it to be one may be the use of the singular
number here. In P»ƒi the number one hundred is a singular number. So you say ëa
hundred maní when you use P»ƒi. You use the singular number, not the plural
number. You say a hundred men? I donít know if there is an equivalent in
English. The word used ëlakkha sata—í is singular in number. Although the
grammatical number is singular, the meaning is plural. It is many, one hundred.
In P»ƒi grammar such peculiarities abound and so you have to understand that
too. An archer had a hundred targets set up at a distance of eight usabhas and
so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Letís go to the First Fruition. ìImmediately next to that
knowledge, however, there arise either two or three Fruition consciousnesses,
which are its result. For it is owing to this very fact that supramundane
profitable [consciousness] results immediately that it is said: ëAnd which he
called the concentration with immediate resultí, and ëSluggishly he reaches
what has immediate result for the destruction of the cankersí and so on.î Now
the Path consciousness is immediately followed by how many Fruition
consciousnesses? Two or three. Path consciousness is the cause and Fruition
consciousness is the result. So here the result follows the cause immediately.
There is no interval between cause and effect in this particular case. In the
description of dhamma there is a word called ëak»likoí. And that word ëak»likoí
is misunderstood by many persons. ëAí means ënot, ëkalaí means ëtimeí and ëikaí
means ëhaving, so having no time. So that is translated as timeless. But the
real meaning or the real interpretation of the word is not that it is timeless,
but that it gives immediate results. That is the correct meaning. That means
there is no interval of time between cause and its result. Because of that it
is said in the Ratana Sutta ëthat which is called the concentration with
immediate resultí or something like that. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 16 ìSome, however, say there are one, two, three,
four, or five Fruition consciousnesses.î So there is difference of opinion
among Therav»da Buddhists also. The common opinion is that there are two
moments or three moments of Fruition consciousness. But there are some who say
that there are only one Fruition consciousness, or two, or three, or four, or
five Fruition consciousnesses. ìThat is inadmissible.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>For change-of-lineage knowledge arises at the
end of conformityís repetition, so at the minimum there must be two conformity
consciousnesses (In order for it to be repetition there must be at least two.
Right? Not one. If it is only one, we cannot call it repetition. So repetition
means at least two. There must be two moments of conformity.) since one alone
does not act a repetition condition. And a single series of impulsions has a
maximum of seven (impulsion) consciousnesses.î When javana arises, it arises
seven times. Right? Mostly seven times. But at the moment of death it arises
only five times or when someone has fainted only five times. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìConsequently, that series which has tow conformities and
change-of-lineage as third and Path consciousness as fourth has three Fruition
consciousnesses.î So three conformity moments plus one change-of-lineage, we
get four. Path consciousness is five, so how many remain? Two. In that case
there must be two Fruition consciousnesses. Sometimes there are only two
conformity consciousnesses instead of three. For those who have quick
intelligence there are only two conformity moments. When there are two
conformity moments, the third is change-of-lineage, the fourth is Magga, and so
there must be three Fruition consciousnesses. So there are either two or three
Fruition consciousnesses immediately following the Path consciousness. There
cannot be four Fruition consciousnesses, or five Fruition consciousnesses, or
one Fruition consciousness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 17 we have another difference of opinion. ìSome
say that that which has four conformities and change-of-lineage as fifth, and
Path consciousness as sixth has one Fruition consciousness. But that is refuted
because it is the fourth or the fifth [impulsion] that reaches [the Path], not
those after that, owing to their nearness to the life-continuum.î When you are
going towards a steep cliff, when you are close to this cliff, you cannot stop
there because you are going with force. You simply fall into the precipice. In
the same way, the thought moments are going very fast, so they cannot stop at
Magga in the sixth moment. That is why it is refuted that there is one Fruition
consciousness only. So it is inadmissible when you say that there is only one
Fruition consciousness because there cannot be one Fruition consciousness. That
is because the thought process comes too close to bhava~ga. When it comes too close
to bhava~ga, it cannot stand as Magga consciousness at the sixth moment.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>And if the Path is known at the sixth moment,
there can be no Fruition consciousness at the seventh moment. That cannot be
accepted as correct.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 18 ìAnd at this point this Stream Enterer is
called the Second Noble Person.î So he is called the Second Noble Person. Now
at the moment of the Path consciousness he is called the First Noble Person. At
the next moment he is called the Second Noble Person, just in one sitting, in a
very, very brief succession of thought moments. At the Path moment he is the
First Noble Person and at the Fruition moment he is the Second Noble Person.
That is why there are eight Noble Persons. I believe that we can only meet four
Noble Persons, those who have reached the Fruition stage. ìHowever negligent he
may be, he is bound to make an end of suffering when he has traveled and
traversed the round of rebirths among deities and human beings for the seventh
time.î This is because he has become a Sot»panna (a Stream Enterer or Stream
Winner). However negligent he may be - that means if he does not practice more
meditation; it does not mean that he may be breaking the five precepts. If he
gives up meditation and he does not meditate to reach the higher stages, then
he is bound to make an end of suffering when he has traveled and traversed the
round of rebirths among deities and human beings for the seventh time. So he
will be reborn only seven times, and at the seventh life he will surely become
an Arahant and then he makes an end of suffering. So a Sot»panna has seven more
rebirths. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 19 ìAt the end of the Fruition his consciousness
enters the life-continuum.î So after Fruition period there is life-continuum.
That means at the end of that thought process. ìAfter that, it arises as
mind-door adverting interrupting the life-continuum for the purpose of
reviewing the Path.î Now immediately after becoming a Noble Person, he reviews
the Path, the Fruition, Nibb»na, defilements abandoned and defilements
remaining. These five things a person who has reached enlightenment reviews or
reflects upon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: So enlightenment here is different from Nibb»na? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Yes. Enlightenment is the consciousness here and
Nibb»na is the object of that enlightenment moment. At the moment of
enlightenment the Path consciousness arises and the Path consciousness takes
Nibb»na as object. So Nibb»na is an external object. It is taken as an object
by the Path consciousness and also the Fruition consciousness. Immediately
after the enlightenment, a person reflects upon or reviews the five things.
What are the five? Path, Fruition, Nibb»na, defilements abandoned, and
defilements remaining. What defilements I have abandoned and what defilements
are remaining this also the meditator reflects upon. Then among these five ì
Trainers may or may not have the reviewing of the defilements abandoned and
those still remaining.î So the last two they may or may not review. Therefore,
the first three, they definitely review, that is the Path, Fruition and
Nibb»na. But defilements abandoned and defilements remaining they may or may
not review. ìIn fact it was owing to the absence of such reviewing that
Mah»n»ma asked the Blessed One ëWhat stage is there still unabandoned by me
internally owing to which at time states of greed invade my mind and remainí?î
Now Venerable Mah»n»ma was an enlightened person, but sometimes he had thoughts
of greed, thoughts of fear, thoughts of anger. He didnít review the defilements
when he became enlightened. So he did not know which defilements he had
abandoned or which remained to be abandoned. So he asked the Buddha about this.
The Buddha told him that because he did not review the defilements, therefore,
he did not know. ìAll of which should be quotedî - it is from the Majjhima
Nik»ya. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[Knowledge of the Second Path - Third Noble Person]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 22 ìHowever, after reviewing in this way, either
while sitting in the same session or on another occasion the Noble Disciple who
is a Stream Enterer makes it his task to reach the second plane by attenuating
both greed for sense desires and ill willî and so on. A person may proceed to
get the second stage in that one sitting or he may stop practicing after he
reaches the first stage. He may take a rest or he may not practice meditation
for any length of time. That is up to him. In the same session or on another
occasion he will continue his practice. Sometimes a person becomes a Sot»panna
and then he may remain a Sot»panna for maybe months or years. And then he practices
meditation and he reaches the second stage. Or some people reach the four
stages, or three stages, or two stages at one sitting. So it depends upon his
wish to reach the higher stages. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHe brings to bear the Faculties, the Powers, and the
Enlightenment Factors, and he works over and turns up that same filed of
formations, classed as materiality, feeling, perception, formations, and
consciousness, with the knowledge that they are impermanent, painful, not self,
and he embarks upon the progressive series of insight.î So after reaching the
first stage, if he wants to reach the second stage, he must practice vipassan»
meditation again. But at that time his vipassan» becomes swift, not like
vipassan» of ordinary persons. Still he must practice vipassan» again to reach
the second stage, and to reach the third stage, and to reach the fourth stage.
Before every stage he must practice vipassan». That is why we say that there
can be no enlightenment without vipassan». So vipassan» must precede all
enlightenment or all arising of Path consciousness. So we have the Second Path
and the Third Noble Person, the Second Fruition and the Fourth Noble Person and
so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[The Second Fruition - Fourth Noble Person]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 24 ìThe Fruition consciousness should be understood
to follow immediately upon this knowledge in the same way as before. And at
this point this Once-Returner is called the Fourth Noble Person (who has
reached the second stage).î So it is the Fourth Noble Person. ìHe is bound to
make an end of suffering after returning once to this world.î Now what is meant
by ëto this worldí? To this human world. After reaching the second stage, he
may be reborn as a celestial being, and from there he will be reborn as a human
being again. So he is the one who returns here once, thus a Once-Returner. So
ëto this worldí means ëto this human worldí. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Third Path is Non-Returner. Right? And then the Third
Path is immediately followed by Third Fruition. So after Third Fruition he is
called a Non-Returner. And so he is called the Sixth Noble Person. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 27 ì[After death,] he reappears apparitionally
[elsewhere] and attains complete extinction there without ever returning,
without ever coming to this world again through rebirth-linking.î There we find
the words ëto this worldí. Here ëto this worldí means ëto this sensuous worldí.
That means to the world of human beings and to the world of lower celestial
beings. There is a difference between the two. There ëto this worldí means ëto
this human worldí, but here ëto this worldí means ëto this human and lower
celestial worldsí. That is because after reaching the third stage of
enlightenment and after becoming a Non-Returner, he will be reborn in the
brahm» world, not in the world of human beings nor in the worlds of the lower
celestial beings. He will be reborn as a brahm» in what are called ëthe abodes
of pure personsí, the five realms up in the scale of the 31 planes of
existence. So he will be reborn in one of the pure abodes. So ëto this worldí
here means not only this human world but this k»m»vacara world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 28 ìNow after reviewing in this way, either while
sitting in the same session or on another occasion this Noble Discipleî and so
on, he becomes an Arahant. So the Fourth Magga and the Fourth Fruition arise.
After the Fruition he is called the Eighth Noble Person or an Arahant. We say
that there are eight Noble Persons, eight kinds of Noble Persons. But in actual
practice we can meet only four Noble Persons because the first, the third, the
fifth and the seventh persons exist only for one thought moment. So how can we
catch that one thought moment? So in practical terms there are four Noble
Persons, but we say that there are eight Noble Persons. That is because they
are different at the Path consciousness moment and at the Fruition
consciousness moments. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 32 ëStates associated with Pathí means states at
the moment of Path consciousness or states accompanying the enlightenment.
There are said to be 37 of these states. They are the four foundations of mindfulness,
the four right endeavors, the four roads to power, the five faculties, the
seven enlightenment factors, and the Noble Eightfold Path. If you add them all
up together, you get 37. In reality there are not 37 states. There are how
many? Do you Abhidhamma students remember? There are only 14 states actually.
That is because, for example, mindfulness (sati) is one mental factor, but here
it is described as four (the four foundations of mindfulness). And the
second<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>the four endeavors, is just viriya.
The one viriya is described here as four. So in reality there are only 14. I
think it is described somewhere. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 34 ìFoundation (pa‘‘h»na) is because of
establishment by going down intoî and so on. This is a description of the P»ƒi
words ëpa‘‘h»naí, ëupa‘‘h»naí, ësatií, and so on. ìMindfulness itself as
foundation is ëFoundation of Mindfulnessí.î<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>So ëFoundation of Mindfulnessí means firm establishment of mindfulness.
ìIt is of four kinds because it occurs with respect to the body, feeling, consciousness,
and dhamma objects, taking them as foul, painful, impermanent, and no self, and
because it accomplishes the function of abandoning perception of beauty,
pleasure, permanence, and self. That is why ëFour Foundations of Mindfulnessí
is said.î So one mindfulness is described here as four because it occurs with
respect to body, feeling, consciousness and dhamma objects, taking them as
foul, painful, impermanent, and not self, and at the same time abandoning the
perception of beauty, pleasure, permanence, and self. So these are the four
aspects. That is why there are four foundations of mindfulness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 35 The next one is the four endeavors. ìBy it they
endeavor, thus it is endeavorî and so on. These are word explanations. So one
viriya is described here as four because it has different functions. ìIt
accomplishes the functions of abandoning arisen unprofitable things, preventing
the arising of those not yet arisen, arousing unarisen profitable things, and
maintaining those already arisen.î With regard to akusala there are two aspects
and with regard to kusala there are two. There is endeavoring to get rid of
akusala which are past, endeavoring not to have akusala or not to have fresh
akusala arise, endeavoring to make kusala not yet arisen arise, endeavoring to
develop kusala which has arisen. So there are four aspects. That is why there
are four kinds of right endeavor or right effort. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 36 is about the iddhip»da. They are called in P»ƒi
ëiddhip»daí, ëthe Roads to Powerí or ëthe Basis for Successí. I think they are
mentioned somewhere else in chapter 12, paragraph 44. What are the four
iddhip»da? ìIt is fourfold as zeal (desire) and so on.î What are the other
three? Zeal, effort, consciousness and inquiry (That means pa““».) ëInquiryí really
means understanding correctly, not just inquiring, not just investigating. So
these are the Roads to Power. ìThese are supramundane only. But because of the
words ëIf a bhikkhu obtains concentration, obtains mental unification by making
zeal predominant, this is called concentration through zealí, etc., they are
also mundane as states acquired by predominance of zeal, etc., respectively.î
At the moment of enlightenment they are supramundane, but at the moment of
practice of vipassan» meditation they are mundane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 37 ì ëFacultyí is in the sense of predominance, in
other words, of overcoming, because [these states, as faculties,] respectively
overcome faithlessness, idleness, negligence, distraction and confusion.î So
there are five faculties. What are the five? Faith, effort, mindfulness,
concentration and wisdom. Their opposites are faithlessness, idleness,
negligence, distraction and confusion. ì ëPowerí is in the sense of
unwaveringness because these states, as power are incapable of being overcome
respectively by faithlessness, and so on.î They are strong factors. they cannot
be overcome by their opposites. That is why they are called powersí. ìBoth are
fivefold as consisting in faith, [energy, mindfulness, concentration, and
understanding.] That is why ëFive Facultiesí and ëFive Powersí is said.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 38 ìMindfulness, [investigation-of-states, energy,
happiness, tranquillity, concentration, and equanimity,] as factors in a being
who is becoming enlightened, are the ëSeven Enlightenment Factorsí.î They are
called ëSeven Factors of Enlightenmentí. And the seven are sati (mindfulness),
investigation of states (That means pa““» actually.), viriya (effort),
happiness (p ti), tranquillity (passaddhi), concentration (sam»dhi), and
equanimity (upekkh»). These are called ëSeven Factors of Enlightenmentí. And
Right View, right Thinking, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right
Effort, Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration are the eight factors of the
Noble Eightfold Path.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 39 ìso there are these 37 states partaking of
enlightenment. Now in the prior stage when mundane insight is occurring, they
are found in a plurality of consciousness as follows.î When you are practicing
vipassan» meditation, these factors or these states arrive in your mind, but
with different kinds of consciousness. At one time you may be dwelling on body
contemplation or mindfulness of the body. At another time the mind may be on
the feelings and so on. So there is plurality of consciousness which goes along
with them. But at the moment of Path consciousness it is said that they all
arise. They are found in a plurality of consciousness as follows and so on. ìAt
the time of arising [of any one] of these four kinds of [Path] knowledge, [all
these states] are found in a single consciousness.î All these states arise
together with that single Path consciousness. So that is the difference. When
they are mundane, they arise with different kinds of consciousness, but when
they are supramundane, they arise with one type of consciousness which is Path
consciousness. ìIn the moment of Fruition the 33 excepting the Four Right
Endeavors are found.î Actually the Four right Endeavors also accompany Fruition
consciousness, but their function is prominent at the moment of Path
consciousness. That is why they are excluded. In fact Path consciousness is
also accompanied by viriya. Viriya is a mental factor which accompanies many
types of consciousness. Fruition consciousness is also accompanied by viriya.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 40 ìWhen these are found in a single consciousness
in this way, it is the one kind of mindfulness whose object is Nibb»na that is
called ëthe Four Foundations of Mindfulnessíî and so on. So when they arise
with one consciousness at the moment of Path consciousness, then they do not
take different objects at that time because Path consciousness takes Nibb»na as
object. They also take Nibb»na as object. That is the difference. The we have
nine in one way, one in two ways, then in four ways, in five ways and so on. It
is making you more familiar with these states. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nine in one way - that means nine states have only one
function, one name. There are 37. So letís call them 37 names. So nine have
only one name. It is something like that. ìThese nine are zeal, consciousness,
happiness, tranquillity, equanimity, thinking, speech, action, and livelihood,
and they are found ëin one wayí as road to power consisting in zeal, etc. since
they do not belong to any other group.î So those have only one name. ì(2) One
in two ways: faith is found ëin two ways, as a faculty and as a power. (3) Then
in four ways and (4) in five ways: the meaning is that another one is found in
four ways and another in five. Herein, concentration is the ëone in four waysí
since it is a faculty, a power, an enlightenment factor, and a Path factor;
understanding is the ëone in five waysí since it is these four and also a road
to power.î These just make you more acquainted with these mental states. ì(5)
In eight ways, and (6) in nine ways, too: the meaning is that another is found
in eight ways and another in nine ways. Mindfulness is the one ëin eight
waysí.î That means mindfulness has eight names among these 37. That is there is
mindfulness as the four foundations of mindfulness, as a faculty, as a power, as
an enlightenment factor and as a Path factor. ìEnergy is the ëone in nine waysí
since it is four Right Endeavors, a road to power, a faculty, a power, an
enlightenment factor, and a Path factor.î So endeavor has the most or the
greatest causenumber of names or functions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 44 ì[(2) Emergence:] mundane insight induces no
emergence either from occurrence [of defilement internally], because it does
not cut off originating, which is the act of causing occurrence, or from the
sign [of formations externally], because it has the sign as object.î Now there
is emergence from occurrence and emergence from sign. Some emerge from
occurrence, some from sign, or some from both. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìChange-of-lineage does not induce emergence from occurrence
[internally] because it does not cut off originating.î At the moment of
change-of-lineage no mental defilement is eradicated, so it does not induce
emergence from occurrence. It<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>emerges
from occurrence of mental defilement. ìBut it dÁes induce emergence from the
sign.î That is because it does not take formations as object. ëSigní here means
sign of formations. It takes Nibb»na as object. So it emerges from the sign,
but not from the occurrence. ìHence it is said ëUnderstanding of emergence and
turning away from the external is knowledge of change-of-lineageî and so on.
ìThese four kinds of [Path] knowledge emerge from the sign be cut off because
they have the signless as their object and also from occurrence because they
cut off origination. So they emerge from both.î Now Path consciousness emerges
from both sign and occurrence. Since they do not take formations as object,
then they emerge from sign. Since at the moment of Path consciousness mental
defilements are eradicated, they emerge from the occurrence of mental
defilements. So the Path emerges from both sign and occurrence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 45 I want to point to one thing on page 797, about
9 lines down. You see there ìRight Thinking in the sense of directing emerges
from wrong thinking.î Sometimes we describe the Noble Eightfold Path as being
present during vipassan» meditation. We say when you practice vipassan»
meditation, all these factors are working harmoniously in your mind. How? Let
us say you try to concentrate on the breath. Now you need mental effort to keep
your mind on the object. So there is Right Effort. And then when you make
effort, your mind as it were hits the object or hits the target, something like
that. So that is Right Mindfulness that hits the object. And then your mind
sticks to the object for some time. That is Right Concentration. After Right
Concentration you see the true nature of things. You see that they are
impermanent, and you see their arising and disappearing. That is Right
Understanding. So how many do you get? Four. And the three, Right Speech, Right
Action and Right Livelihood, are already accomplished when you take precepts
before the practice of meditation. So they are also said to be accomplished.
Now we have seven. What about Right Thought? ëRight Thoughtí really means the
mental factor which is called ëvitakkaí or ëinitial application of mindí. So
right Thought does not mean thinking of Nibb»na or thinking of formations. It
is that mental factor which directs the mind to the object or that takes the
mind to the object.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: So it could be intention?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: No. Not intention. It is something that takes the
mind to the object. When you shoot an arrow, maybe the force of the bow, it is
something like that. Without vitakka mind will not take an object. So we need
vitakka (initial application) to take our mind to the object. so applying the
mind to the object is effected by Right Thought or the initial application. So
here we see that. ëRight Thinking in the sense of directingí means the mental
factor pushing the mind to the object, taking the mind to the object. If
initial application doesnít take the mind to the object, then mind cannot see
anything at all. That is why it is grouped with Right Understanding. So Right
Understanding and Right Thought belong to the group of understanding. Right
Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration belong to the group of
concentration. And the other three belong to the group of s la or moral purity.
So ëRight Thoughtí<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>really means that
mental factor or that mental state which takes the mind to the object or which
pushes the mind to the object. That is described here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 46 And then ëCoupling of Powersí, I think we will
have to do it next time. Oh, we may as well do it. ìAt the time of developing
the eight mundane attainments the serenity power is in excess.î When we
practice jh»nas, the ëeight mundane attainmentsí mean the eight jh»nas. When
you develop eight jh»nas, the serenity power is in excess. ìWhile at the time
of developing the contemplations of impermanence, etc., the insight power is in
excess.î So when you practice vipassan» meditation, vipassan» meditation is in
excess and when you practice samatha, samatha is in excess. ìBut at the Noble
Path moment they occur coupled together in the sense that neither one exceeds
the other.î At the moment of Path consciousness both are present, samatha and
vipassan». ìSo there is coupling of the powers in the case of each one of these
four kinds of knowledge, according as it is saidî and so on. So there is
serenity power and insight power. During the mundane stage one or the other is
in excess, but at the moment of Magga, they are equal, neither one exceeds the
other. ìSo serenity and insight have a single nature in the sense of emergence,
they are coupled together, and neither exceeds the other. Hence it was said: He
develops serenity and insight coupled together in the sense of emergence.
Emergence and coupling of the power should be understood here in this way.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 47 we have (4) the kinds of states that ought
to be abandoned, (5) also the act of their abandoning. They are important.
According to this explanation we know what kinds of mental defilements are
eradicated by which stages - first stage, second stage, third stage and fourth
stage. So after a person reaches to the first stage, he must have abandoned or
eradicated certain kinds of mental defilements. Then after the second stage, he
must have eradicated other kinds of mental defilements and so on. They are
described in the following paragraphs. We will do them next week.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 47 ì 4. The kinds of states that ought to be
abandoned, 5. also the act of their abandoningî - so which kinds of states
these four Paths abandon and the act of abandoning. ìNow which states are to be
abandoned by which kinds of knowledge among these four should be understood,
and also the act of abandoning them.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìFor they <u>each and severally</u> bring about the
abandoning of the states called fettersî and so on. ëEach and severallyí is not
a correct translation. The P»ƒi is yathayoga—. It means ëas is properí or ëas
the case may beí. That means each of them abandon defilements and others
differently. ìFor as is proper they bring about the abandoning of the states
called fetters, defilements, wrongnesses, worldly states, kinds of avarice,
perversions, ties, bad ways, cankers, floods, bonds, hindrances, adherences,
clingings, inherent tendencies, stains, unprofitable courses of action, and
unprofitable thought arisings.î The mental defilements are given different
names. All of them are mental defilements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first one is fetters. ìHerein, the fetters are the ten
states beginning with greed for the fine material, so called because they
fetter aggregates [in this life] to aggregates [of the next], (they fetter)
kamma to its fruit or (they fetter) beings to suffering.î That is why they are
called ëfettersí. They are like ropes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìFor as long as the ones exist there is no cessation of the
others.î As long as there are fetters, there is no cessation of aggregates, no
cessation of kamma, no cessation of fruit, and no cessation of beings and
suffering. They are called ëfettersí.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd of these fetters, greed for the fine material, greed
for the immaterial, conceit, agitation, and ignorance, are called the ëfive
higher fettersí because they fetter beings to aggregates, etc., produced in the
higher [forms of becoming], while false view of individuality, uncertainty,
adherence to rites and rituals, greed for sense desires, and resentment, are
called the ëfive lower fettersí because they fetter beings to aggregates, etc.,
produced in the lower states of existence. The other five fetter beings to the
higher forms of existence. There are higher and lower fetters. All together
there are ten. Which fetters are abandoned by which Path will be explained
later. Right now the author is giving the lists of these states. The first is
the ten fetters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second group is the ten defilements. ìThe defilements
are the ten states, namely, greed, hate, delusion, conceit, [false] view,
uncertainty, stiffness [of mind], agitation, consciencelessness,
shamelessness.î These ten are called ëdefilementsí. ìThey are so called because
they are themselves defiled and because they defile the states associated with
them.î They are themselves impurities and they make others also impure. So
they<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>are called ëdefilementsí. In P»ƒi
they are called ëkilesasí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe wrongnesses are the eight states, namely, wrong view,
wrong thinking, wrong speech, (They are the opposite of the Noble Eightfold
Path.) wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, wrong
concentration which with wrong knowledge and wrong deliverance come to ten.î
That means with wrong knowledge and wrong deliverance they are ten.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Footnote 14 ì ëWrong knowledgeí, which is wrong because it
does not occur rightly [i.e. in conformity with truth], and is wrong and
mistaken owing to misinterpretations, etc., is just delusion. ëWrong
deliveranceí is the wrong notion of liberation that assumes liberation to take
place in a ëWorld Apexí.î People think that when a being reaches the highest
existence, there will be liberation. That is called ëwrong liberationí. There
are eight wrongnesses or there can be ten wrongnesses. When we take them to be
ten, we add wrong knowledge and wrong deliverance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next one is the worldly states. They are the states
which people meet or experience in their worldly life. There are said to be
eight of these states, namely, gain, loss, fame, disgrace, pleasure, pain,
blame, and praise. The P»ƒi words used for gain and loss are l»bha and al»bha.
ëAl»bhaí means non-gain, not getting. For fame the word used is ëyasaí and for
disgrace the word used is ëayasaí. The word ëyasaí can mean two things. One is
fame and the other is followers. We interpret this here not as fame, but to
have followers or to have students or pupils. For disgrace we say to be alone,
not to be with followers or having few followers. We do not say ëfame and
disgraceí because they are the same as the last two, praise and blame. So our
interpretation is that instead of fame it is having friends, or followers, or
having students. Instead of disgrace we say not having many followers.
Pleasure, pain, blame, praise - these eight are to be met with in a life and
nobody can escape them. ìThey are so called because they continually succeed
each other as long as the world persists.î At times there is gain and at other
times there is loss and so on. Sometimes you get what you want and sometimes
you donít get what you want or you lose what you have. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBut when the worldly states are included, then by the
metaphorical use of the causeís name [for its fruit], the approval that has the
gain, etc., as its object and the resentment that has the loss, etc., as its
object should also be understood as included.î Here the translation is a little
different than the original. What is said in the original is that by the
metaphorical use of the causes named for its fruit the approval and the
resentment are to be understood as meant by worldly states. When we say
ëworldly statesí, we mean gain, loss and so on, but here we do not mean gain,
loss, etc., but approval or resentment or our reactions to these conditions.
These are the eight conditions of life. When we have gain, then we have
approval. That means we are attached to gain. When we have loss, we have
aversion. That approval and resentment or that attachment and aversion are what
are meant by these worldly states, not just the gain, loss, etc. The approval
or the resentment is taken to be meant by worldly states by the metaphorical
use of the causes named for its fruit. That means the name is really the causeís
name, but we must take the fruit of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is gain. Because there is gain there is approval. That
means there is attachment. Attachment is caused by gain. When we say ëgainí,
gain is the name of the cause. What we must really understand is the effect of
that cause. It is like saying sugar is diabetes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe kinds of avarice are the five, namely, avarice about
dwellings, families, gain, Dhamma, and praise, which occur as in ability to
bear sharing with others any of these things beginning with dwellings.î The
Pa4l0I word for the kinds of avarice is macchariya. Macchariya is one of the
mental factors. ëMacchariyaí really means inability to bear sharing with
others. I have this thing and I donít want to share it with other persons. If
other persons come and make use of it, I am angry. That is what is meant by
avarice here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>It is not just stinginess.
We have two mental factors issa and macchariya. Avarice here is not stinginess
because stinginess is lobha. It is attachment. This mental factor is
accompanied by dosa. It is intolerance of sharing things with others. There are
five, namely, dwellings, families, gain, Dhamma and praise. Sometimes we donít
want people to come to our place and live with us. That is avarice with regard
to dwelling. ëFamilyí has meaning for monks, not particularly for lay people.
Monks always depend upon lay people for their living. So we may have
attachment. Let us say that he is my supporter. So I do not want other monks to
be acquainted with my supporterís family. It is something like that. Gain is
what one gets. Dhamma - that means you practice meditation and you may have
some results and you donít want those results to happen to other persons. If
other persons get the same results, you are not happy. And then the last one is
called ëpraiseí. The P»ƒi word is ëva””aí. That is interpreted to mean two
things. One is appearance or you may say beauty, and the other is praise. Let
us say you have a beautiful face. Then you donít want other people to have a
beautiful face. It is something like that. So ëva””aí can mean both beauty or
appearance and praise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
ìThe perversions are the three, namely, perversion of perception, of
consciousness, and of view, which occur apprehending objects that are
impermanent, painful, not self, and foul, as permanent, pleasant, self, and
beautiful.î If we take things as permanent, as pleasant, as self, and as
beautiful, it is one of these kind of perversions. There are three - perversion
of perception, perversion of consciousness and perversion of view. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe ties are the four beginning with covetousness, so
called because they tie the mental body and the material body. They are
described as ëthe bodily tie of covetousnessí, ëthe bodily tie of ill willí,
ëthe bodily tie of adherence to rites and ritualsí, and ëthe bodily tie of
insisting or misinterpreting that ìthis [only] is the truthî.í This alone is
true and others are false. It is something like that. That is called ëtieí
here. There are four ties. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBad ways is a term for doing what ought not to be done and
not doing what ought to be done, out of <u>zeal</u> (desire), hate, delusion,
and fear.î The P»ƒi word is ëagatií. It is actually bias. So we should say out
of attachment or out of desire, not zeal. If I am attached to someone, then I
may have a favorable bias towards him. I am not just towards other people. That
is what is called here ëbad waysí. Sometimes we hate somebody and so we do not
act justly towards him. Sometimes we are afraid. If we do this, a person will
do something back to me. So we are afraid of him. So we may practice favoritism
towards him. Sometimes there is just delusion. Because I am ignorant I favor
one over the other. These are called ëbad waysí. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìCankers (»savas): as far as change of lineage [in the case
of states of consciousness] and as far as the acme of becoming [in the case of
the kinds of becoming (Here ëbecomingí means realms or existences.), that is to
say, the fourth immaterial state,] there are exudations owing to the [formed
nature of the] object.î The real meaning here is that these cankers exude or
drip like pus or something dripping from a sore. The P»ƒi word is ë»savaí. ëåí
means ëas far así and ësavaí means ëto dripí or ëexudeí. Here ëto dripí should
be understood as taking as an object. ëExudeí actually means these take something
as objects and they exude as far as change of lineage, as far as the highest
existence or highest realm. These cankers are what? Lobha, di‘‘hi (wrong view),
moha (ignorance). These can take objects up to change of lineage as objects and
they can take the highest realm as object. It is to be understood by way of
taking object. ëThey exudeí means they<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>take them as object.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a footnote. I donít think he really understood what
he was referring to here. ëAs far así - I donít know whether it can be
explained in English. The P»ƒi word ëåí, here translated as ëas far así, can
mean two things. Let us say one is as far as change of lineage. It may mean as
far as change of lineage, but excluding change of lineage. It just reaches up
to that dhamma. Sometimes it may mean ëincludingí. There are two meanings for
the P»ƒi word ëåí or ëas far así. That means for example the fields extend as
far as the mountain. They stop when there is a mountain. The fields do not
include the mountain. When we say the Buddhaís fame goes as far as the highest
realm, that is including the highest realm. Here inclusion is meant. So ëas far
as change of lineageí means up to change of lineage. ëAs far as the acme of
becomingí or ëas far as the highest realmí means including the highest realm. I
think you say ëthroughí or something like that. Right?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>So ëMonday through Fridayí means Monday and
the rest including Friday. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThis is a term for greed for sense desires, greed for
becoming, wrong view, and ignorance, because of the exuding [of these
defilements] from unguarded sense doors like water from cracks in a pot in the
sense of constant trickling, or because of their producing the suffering of the
round of rebirths.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next one is the floods. It is the same thing. They are called
ëfloodsí ìin the sense of sweeping away into the ocean of becoming, and in the
sense of being hard to cross.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe bonds are so called because they do not allow
disengagement from an object and disengagement from suffering. Both ëfloodsí
and ëbondsí are terms for the cankers already mentioned.î The same states are
sometimes called ëcankersí, sometimes ëfloodsí, sometimes called ëbondsí. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe hindrances are the five, namely, lust, [ill will,
stiffness and torpor, agitation and worry, and uncertainty,] in the sense of
obstructing and hindering and concealing [reality] from consciousness.î These
are the five hindrances that we often encounter during meditation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAdherence (misapprehension - par»m»sa) is a term for wrong
view, because it occurs in the aspect of missing the individual essence of a
given state (That means going beyond the individual essence of a given state.)
and apprehending elsewise an unactual individual essence.î That means taking
something wrongly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The clingings are the up»d»nas. ìThe clingings are the four

description of Dependent Origination.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe inherent tendencies are the seven, namely, greed for
sense desire, etc., in the sense of inveterateness, stated thus: the inherent
tendency to greed for sense desires, the inherent tendency to resentment,
conceit, [false] view, uncertainty, greed for becoming, and ignorance.î There
are seven all together. ìFor it is owing to their inveteracy that they are called
inherent tendencies since they inhere as cause for the arising of greed for
sense desires, etc., again and again.î ëInherent tendenciesí really means seven
of the defilements. However when they are called ëinherent tendenciesí, they
are not the real defilements, but they are those that can arise when there are
conditions for their arising. When they really arise we call them ëdefilementsí
or ëkilesasí. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am liable to get attached to things. But right now I am
teaching Dhamma and there is no attachment in my mind. I am free from
attachment now. But if I see something which I like and I am attached to it,
then attachment arises. There is a liability of attachment to arise in me. That
is what is called ëan inherent tendencyí. When attachment really arises, it is
defilement. Before reaching the stage of defilements, they are called ëlatent
tendenciesí or ëinherent tendenciesí. It is like being under the surface. When
it surfaces, it is called ëdefilementí. When it lies dormant underneath, it is
called ëanusaya (inherent tendencies)í. There are seven. We will talk more
about them later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe stains are the three, namely, greed, hate, and
delusion. They are so called because they are themselves dirty like oil, black,
and mud, and because they dirty other things.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe unprofitable courses of action are the ten, namely,
killing living things, taking<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>what is
not given, sexual misconduct; false speech, malicious speech, harsh speech,
gossip; covetousness, ill will, and wrong view. They are so called since they
are both unprofitable action [kamma] and courses that lead to unhappy destinies
(unhappy rebirths).î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe unprofitable thought arisings are the twelve consisting
of the eight rooted in greed, the two rooted in hate, and the two rooted in
delusion.î They are, the twelve unwholesome types of consciousness. The P»ƒi
word ëcittupp»daí is translated here as thought arisings. Actually they are
types of consciousness. They are the twelve types of unwholesome consciousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìSo these [four kinds of knowledge] each and severally (or
as is proper) abandon these states beginning with the fetters. How?î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe five states eliminated by the first knowledge in the
case of the fetters, firstly, are: false views of personality, doubt, adherence
to rites and rituals, and then greed for sense desires and resentment that are
[strong enough] to lead to states of loss.î With regard to defilements or these
unwholesome states they have two or three layers. There are some defilements
that are strong enough to lead to rebirth in woeful states. There are some
defilements that are not strong enough to lead to rebirth in woeful states, but
still they are defilements..</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first Knowledge or the first Path eliminates false views
of personality, doubt, adherence to rites and rituals, and then greed for sense
desires and resentment that are strong enough to lead to states of loss. The
first Path eradicates false view of personality, doubt, and adherence to rites
and rituals all together, once and for all. Greed for sense desires and resentment
it cannot eradicate all together, but it destroys the stronger forms of sense
desire and resentment which lead to states of loss. That means which lead to
the four woeful states. That means a being after becoming a Sot»panna may still
have lobha and dosa. A Sot»panna only eradicates di‘‘hi (wrong view) and
vicikicch» (doubt). There are other mental defilements remaining, but these
mental defilements are not strong enough to give rebirth in the four woeful
states. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe remaining gross greed for sense desires and resentment
are eliminated by the second Knowledge. Subtle greed for sense desires and
resentment are eliminated by the third Knowledge. The five beginning with greed
for the fine material are only [actually] eliminated by the fourth Knowledge.î
We have to understand the eradication of defilements in this manner. The first
Path eliminates the ability of some mental<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>defilements to lead us to the four woeful states.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then there is a note. ìIn what follows, we shall not in
every instance specify the fact with the expression ëonlyí, nevertheless
whatever we shall say is eliminated by one of the [three] higher Knowledges
should be understood as only the [residual] state eliminated by the higher
Knowledge; for that state will have already been rendered not conducive to
states of loss by the preceding Knowledge.î Do you understand this?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: No.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: ìIn what follows, we shall not in every instance
specify the fact with the expression ëonlyí.î You see the word ëonlyí in the
paragraph above. ìThe five beginning with greed for the fine material are ONLY
eliminated by the fourth Knowledge.î If the author says ëonlyí, we have to
understand in one way. If the author does not use the word ëonlyí, we have to
understand in another way. That is what is meant. The translation is not so
understandable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let us look at the next one. ìIn the case of the
defilements, [false] view and uncertainty are eliminated by the first
Knowledge.î They are eliminated totally. ìHate is eliminated by the third
Knowledge (totallˇ). Greed, delusion, conceit, mental stiffness, agitation,
consciencelessness, and shamelessness, are eliminated by the fourth Knowledge.î
Here it doesnít say ëfourth knowledge onlyí. Right? There is no ëonlyí here. We
have to understand that greed, delusion, conceit and others are eliminated by
the preceding Paths. The elimination of the preceding Paths is of the stronger
forms of greed, delusion and so on. What the fourth Knowledge eliminates is the
subtle forms of greed, delusion and so on. The grosser forms of greed, delusion
and so on are eradicated by the first Path, by the second Path and by the third
Path. There is no ëonlyí here. They are eliminated by the fourth Knowledge and
it does not say that they are only eliminated by the fourth Knowledge. We have
to understand in this way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the case of wrongness, wrong view, false speech, wrong
action, wrong livelihood are eliminated by the first Knowledge. Wrong thinking,
malicious speech, and harsh speech are eliminated by the third Knowledge.î The
third Knowledge is the An»g»m  (the Non-Returner). Right? The An»g»m  can
eradicate anger all together and the grosser forms of attachment. ìWrong
thinking, malicious speech, and harsh speech, are eliminated by the third
Knowledge. And here only volition is to be understood as speech.î Although the
word ëspeechí is used, we must understand it to mean volition. ìGossip, wrong
effort, wrong mindfulness, wrong concentration, wrong deliverance, and wrong
knowledge, are eliminated by the fourth Knowledge.î Here also since there is no
ëonlyí, we must understand that the stronger ones are destroyed by the previous
Knowledges or previous Paths.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the case of the worldly states, resentment is eliminated
by the third Knowledge, and approval is eliminated by the fourth Knowledge.
Some say that approval of fame and praise is eliminated by the fourth
Knowledge.î He didnít say whether it is to be accepted or not. Maybe the author
doesnít like it. Maybe he just gives it as information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe kinds of avarice are eliminated by the first Knowledge
only.î The five kinds of avarice are eliminated by the first Knowledge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the case of perversions, the perversion of perception,
consciousness and view, which find permanence in the impermanent and self in
the not-self, and the perversion of view finding pleasure in pain and beauty in
the foul, are eliminated by the first Knowledge. The perversions of perception
and consciousness finding beauty in the foul are eliminated by the third Path.
The perversions of perception and consciousness finding pleasure in the painful
are eliminated by the fourth Knowledge.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the case of ties, the bodily ties of adherence to rites
and rituals and of the insistence (misinterpretation) that ëThis is the truthí,
are eliminated by the first Knowledge (because they are all wrong views). The
bodily tie of ill will is eliminated by the third Knowledge. The remaining one
is eliminated by the fourth Path.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe bad ways are eliminated by the first knowledge only.î
When a person becomes a Sot»panna, he will not practice favoritism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the case of the cankers, the cankers of view is

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the case of the hindrances, the hindrances of
uncertainty is eliminated by the first Knowledge (because it is doubt). The

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAdherence is eliminated by the first Knowledge.î
ëAdherenceí just means wrong view. Wrong view is eliminated by the first
Knowledge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the case of the clingings (up»d»na), since according to
what is given in the Texts all worldly states are <u>sense desires</u>.î That
means objects of sense desires. I would like to put ìall worldly states are
objects of sense desiresî, not ë<u>sense desires as objectí</u>. ìAll worldly
states are objects of sense desires, and so greed both for the fine material
and the immaterial falls under sense desire clinging.î You remember the
clingings. Right? Sense desire clinging, wrong view clinging, and the others
are also wrong view. Although the word ësense desireí is used here in P»ƒi
k»mup»d»na, we must understand that sense desire for both the material and the
immaterial states are taken as sense desire here because they are lobha or
attachment. So here ësense desire clingingí just means attachment (lobha).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the case of the inherent tendencies, the inherent
tendencies to [false] view and to uncertainty are eliminated by the first

Knowledge.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the case of the unprofitable courses of action, killing
living things, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech, and

speech, harsh speech, and ill will, are eliminated by the third Knowledge.
Gossip and covetousness are eliminated by the fourth Knowledge.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the case of the unprofitable thought arisings, the four
associated with [false] view, and that associated with uncertainty, making

are eliminated by the third Knowledge. The rest are eliminated by the fourth
Knowledge.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do you find mention of the second Knowledge? No. Right? Why?
Did you ever wonder? The second Knowledge does not eliminate any mental
defilements all together. It makes the remaining mental defilements more
subtle. That is why it is not mentioned here. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For your knowledge or information the first Knowledge or
Path eliminates what? Wrong view and doubt. The second Knowledge eliminates
what? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: It just weakens the defilements</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: It does not eliminate mental defilements, but it
weakens the mental defilements. The third Knowledge eliminates what? Attachment
for sensual things, the k»m»vacara and aversion (dosa) or ill will. Then the
fourth Knowledge eradicates the remaining mental defilements. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we come to an interesting discussion. ìAnd what is
eliminated by any one of them is abandoned by it. That is why it was said above
ëSo these [four kinds of Knowledge] as is proper abandon these states beginning
with the fettersí.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe act of abandoning: but how then? Do these {Knowledges]
abandon these states when they are past, or when they are future, or when they
are present?î Itís very interesting. We say that Path Knowledge eradicates
mental defilements. The question here is do these Knowledges abandon these
states (ëThese statesí means the defilements.) when they are past, or when they
are future, or when they are present. In P»ƒi the sequence is past, future and
present. ìWhat is the position here? For firstly if [they are said to abandon]
when past or future, it follows that the effort is fruitless.î That is because
the past is already past and you donít have to do anything about it. It has
already gone. And the future has not come. So you cannot do anything about it
either. So there is no question about the Path Knowledges abandoning the past
defilements or the future defilements. But what about the present ones? Does
the Path eliminate the present mental defilements or the mental defilements
that are existent at the moment? No. That is because if they are present, there
can be no Path at all. Path and mental defilements do not arise together. Then
the Path eradicates nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThen if it is when they are present, it is likewise
fruitless because the things to be abandoned exist simultaneously with the
effort, and it follows that there is development of a Path that has defilement,
or it follows that defilements are dissociated [from consciousness] though
there is no such thing as a present defilement dissociated from consciousness.î
There are three things here. If you say that the defilements are abandoned when
they are present it is fruitless because the things to be abandoned exist
simultaneously with the effort. That means the things to be abandoned would
arise simultaneously with the effort. The ëeffortí here is Path consciousness.
ìIt follows that there is development of Path (That means arising of Path.)
that has defilement.î If you say that the present defilements are eliminated,
then that amounts to saying the Path and defilements arise together. No
defilements can arise with Path. Defilements are unwholesome mental states and
Path is a wholesome mental state. Unwholesome mental states and wholesome
mental states cannot arise at the same time. ìIt follows that defilements are
dissociated.î Then you may say at the moment of Path there are no defilements.
The Path eradicates the defilements. If you say this, then it amounts to saying
that defilements can arise without consciousness. That is not so. Defilements
are mental factors and as mental factors they can only arise when there is
consciousness. They are never dissociated from consciousness. But if you say at
the Path moment defilements are eliminated, then you are saying that they can
be dissociated from consciousness. Path consciousness does not eradicate the
past defilements, nor the future defilements, nor the present defilements. If
there are defilements in the mind, there can be no Path at all. It eradicates
nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThat is not an original argument.î Here ëoriginalí means
this argument or this discussion is not peculiar to this book only. This
discussion has appeared already in other books. ìFor in the Texts first the
question is put.î He quotes the Texts. The Texts are the same as what we have
said. Magga eradicates neither the past, nor the future, nor the present
defilements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then what does it eradicate? What does it abandon? Go to
paragraph 80. ìWhat does that show? It shows abandoning of defilements that
have soil [to grow in].î It is difficult here, the use of the P»ƒi word
ëbh|mi???í. ìBut are defilements that have soil [to grow in] past, future or
present?î Are those defilements that have soil to grow in past, future, or
present? The answer is: ìThey are simply those described as arisen by having
soil [to grow in].î They are just that. We cannot say that they are present, or
that they are future, or that they are past. They are just those that have
arisen by having soil to grow in. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìNow there are various meanings of ëarisení, that is to say,
(1) arisen as ëactually occurringíî, and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Is this close to saying they are empty?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: No. We will explain later. Then the Commentator
brings in four kinds of what are called ëarisení. The P»ƒi word is ëuppannaí.
On the handout I gave you the P»ƒi word also.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>There are four kinds of uppanna (that which has arisen). There are four
things which are called ëuppannaí in P»ƒi. The word ëuppannaí means that which
has arisen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first meaning is arisen as actually occurring. That
means all that is reckoned to possess the three moments of arising, aging and
dissolution. That means it is the real present things. Because when we say
something is present, we mean that it possesses the three stages of arising,
staying and disappearing, or arising, aging and dissolution. Thus it is the
real present. This real present is sometimes called ëuppanna (that which has
arisen)í. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next one is ëarisen as being and goneí. That means they
have arisen and now they are no more. They have arisen and gone. They are also
called ëarisení. There are two of them. Wholesome and unwholesome dhammas
(cittas and cetasikas) which have experienced the stimulus of an object (That
means which have tasted the object.) and disappeared. They are also called
ëarisen as been and goneí. Here ëbeení means ëexperiencedí. The second is
anything conditioned that has reached the three moments beginning with arising
and has ceased. Something conditioned which has come into being and then
disappeared is meant. That is also called ëarisení. It is having been and gone.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The third is arisen by opportunity made. Past kamma is
called ëarisen by opportunity madeí. It is really past. Although it is past, it
is called ëarisení. That means it is still with us or something like that.
Because it has stood (That is the direct translation), it has existed
inhibiting the result of other kamma and has made opportunity for its own
result to arise in the future. When there is kamma and then it disappears, it
leaves something like a potential in the continuity of beings to give results
in the future. When it makes opportunity for its results to arise in the
future, it inhibits the results of other kammas. The second is the future
result. The future result is also called ëuppannaí. Although it has not yet
arisen, it is called ëarisení. That is because when opportunity to arise is
made, it is sure to arise in the future. When kamma is accumulated, when kamma
is done, then the fruit is sure to arise. The future result can be called
ëarisení, although in fact it has not yet arisen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fourth one is arisen by having soil to grow in. We are
concerned with this. Arisen by having soil to grow in - that means unwholesome
kamma which has not been eradicated with respect to any given soil. What is
ësoilí here? ëSoilí here means the five aggregates in the three planes of
becoming, which are the object of vipassan», and ëwhat has soilí means mental
defilements which are capable of arising with respect to those aggregates. So
what the Path eliminates is this kind of defilement ëarisen by having soil to
grow iní. Here ësoilí means the five aggregates in the three planes of
becoming. They are the object of vipassan» meditation. ëWhat has soilí means
the mental defilements which are capable of arising with respect to those
aggregates.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Suppose I see an object, a desirable object. And I do not
practice vipassan» toward that object. So I take it to be beautiful. Although
at that moment I may have no attachment, since I have taken it to be beautiful,
I can have attachment with regard to that thing in the future. That kind of
attachment or mental defilement is what is called ëwhich is the soil to grow iní.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With regard to objects we have to practice vipassan»
meditation in order to see their true nature so that we see that they are
impermanent and so on. When we have seen that, when we have practiced vipassan»
towards them, then the defilements are not said to be inherent in these
objects. But with regard to objects with which we fail to observe by vipassan»,
there is always the possibility that the defilements will arise with regard to
those things. Defilements which can arise through not having observed objects
by vipassan» are called ëhaving soil to grow iní. Actually what the Path
eradicates is not the present mental defilements, not the past mental
defilements, not the future mental defilements, but it is something like
future. There is some liability in our continuity. When there are conditions,
defilements can arise. That liability is what is eradicated by the Path
consciousness. That liability is called here ëthose having soil to grow iní.
That means in my continuity of consciousness they can arise. They have my
continuity as a soil to grow in. Because I have taken that object to be
beautiful, to be permanent, to be pleasant, to be substantial or self, since I
have taken this thing to be permanent and so on, then at any time the
defilement can arise. Those defilements which can occur through not being
observed by vipassan» are what are called ëthose that have soil to grow iní. It
has obtained or it has got my continuity to grow in, to arise in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd that is not meant objectively.î That means having the
soil to grow in. ëHaving the soilí means having the soil not as an object, but
as a place to grow in, as a base. That is also important because if we say it
is by way of taking an object that it has got the soil, then it can mean, say,
there is an Arahant. He said to be beautiful. A man saw the Arahant and he had
sexual desires for that Arahant. He wanted that Arahant to be his wife or
something like that. And so even with regard to the body of an Arahant, mental
defilements can arise in other persons by taking the body of an Arahant as an
object. If we mean that ëhaving the soilí<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>means having the soil as an object, then it will mean that an Arahant
can eradicate the mental defilements of another person. Because that person has
taken the Arahant as an object and then he has attachment arise in his mind. So
ëhaving the soilí does not mean having soil taken as an object. ëHaving the
soilí means having got somewhere or some place to grow in or grow out of. ìLike
those that arose in the rich man Soreyya with respect to the aggregates in
Mah»-Kacc»naî - he had wrong desires for Venerable Mah»-Kacc»na. ìAnd in the
brahman student Nanda with respect to Uppalava””»î - Venerable Uppalava””» was
an Arahant, a nun. Nanda fell in love with her. One day when she came back from
the sun, he raped the nun. So ëhaving soilí does not mean having soil taken as
an object. It is by way of having a place or having a base. If we say the
defilement which has the soil to grow in by way of taking object, then we mean
the defilement in another person also. Nobody, even the Buddha, can eradicate
defilement in another person. I can eradicate defilements in my mind but not
the defilements in another personís mind. So it is to be understood as ëhaving
soilí means having soil not as an object, not as being taken as an object. It
is having it as its location or something like that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd if that were what is called ëarisen by having soil [to
grow in]í no one could abandon the root of becoming because it would be
unabandonable.î That means because it belongs to another person. ìBut ëarisen
by having soil [to grow in]í should be understood [subjectively] with respect
to the basis [for them in oneself].î That means they should be understood as
having the place to live or to exist. ìFor the defilements that are the root of
the round are inherent in [oneís own] aggregates not fully understood by
insight.î If we do not practice vipassan» towards things, then we do not fully
understand these objects. ëFully understandí means seeing their arising and
disappearing, their characteristics, and also being able to get rid of mental
defilements with regard to them. ìFor the defilements that are the root of the
round are inherent in [oneís own] aggregates not fully understood by insight
from the instant those aggregates arise. And that is what should be understood
as ëarisen by having soil [to grow in]í, in the sense of its being
unabandoned.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In brief what the Path abandons or eliminates is the mental
defilements which would arise when there are conditions, which would arise
because one has not seen them correctly, one has not fully understood them.
That liability is what the Path consciousness eradicates and not the real
mental defilements arising at the moment. That is because when there are mental
defilements, there can be no Path consciousness and when there is Path
consciousness, there can be no mental defilements. I think if you understand
this, the other passages are not difficult.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the author gives another set of four kinds of uppanna.
Paragraph 89 ìBesides these there are four other ways of classing ëarisení,
namely, (5) arisen as happening, (6) arisen with apprehension of an object, (7)
arisen through non-suppression, (8) arisen through non-abolition.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHerein, ëarisen as happeningí is the same as (1) ëarisen as
actually occurringí.î That means it is rightly in existence lasting for three
moments. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìWhen an object has at some previous time come into focus in
the eye, etc., and defilement did not arise then but arose in full force later
on simply because the object had been apprehended (That means taken firmly as
permanent and so on.), then that defilement is called ëarisen with apprehension
of an objectí. Like the defilement that arose in the Elder Mah»-Tissa after
seeing the form of a person of the opposite sex while wandering for alms in the
village of Kaly»ne.î (It is Kaly»ne, not <u>Kaly»na</u>.) Before there was no
defilement in the Elder Mah»-Tissa. Then he saw a person of the opposite sex
and then the defilements arose in his mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAs long as a defilement is not suppressed by either
serenity or insight, though it may not have actually entered the conscious
continuity, it is nevertheless called ëarisen through non-suppressioní.î That
means it has not really arisen, but it is called ëarisení because it has not
been suppressed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBecause there is no cause to prevent its arising [if
suitable conditions combine]. But even when they are suppressed by serenity or
insight, they are still called ëarisen through non-abolition because the
necessity for their arising has not been transcended unless they have been cut
off by the Path.î That is those that have not been cut off or abandoned by the
Path consciousness. They are called ëarisen through non-abolitioní. Abolition
and suppression are different here. ëSuppressioní means keeping them at bay for
some time. ëAbolitioní means eradicating all together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìLike the Elder who had obtained the eight attainments and
the defilements that arose in him while he was going through the air on his
hearing the sound of a woman singing with a sweet voice as she was gathering
flowers in a grove of blossoming trees.î He had obtained the eight attainments.
That means he had suppressed the mental defilements by the eight attainments.
The defilements arose in him while as he was going through the air. He was
going through the air and he heard a woman singing as she was plucking flowers.
Defilements arose in him. Such defilements are called ëthose arisen through
non-abolitioní. Because they are not abolished, because they are not eradicated,
they may arise when there are conditions. So there are these four kinds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd the three kinds, namely, (6) arisen with apprehension
of an object, (7) arisen through non-suppression, and (8) arisen through
non-abolition, should be understood as included by arisen by having soil [to
grow in].î The fourth of the first list corresponds to three of the second
list.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìSo as regards the kinds of ëarisení stated, the four kinds,
namely, (1) as actually occurring, (2) as been and gone, (3) by opportunity
made, and (5) as happening, cannot be abandoned by any [of these four kinds of]
knowledge because they cannot be eliminated by the Paths. But the four kinds of
ëarisení, namely, (4) by having soil [to grow in], (6) with apprehension of an
object, (7) through non-suppression, and (8) through non-abolition, can all be
abandoned because a given mundane or supramundane<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>knowledge, when it arises, nullifies a given
one of these modes of being arisen.î When we say that the Path abandons, then
we mean the second four. ëThe second fourí here means one of the first and
three of the second list - so ëby having soilí, ëwith apprehension of an object
through non-suppression and non-abolitioní.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>So what the Path eradicates is the inherent tendencies or the latent
tendencies, not the ones that have arisen in the consciousness. When they are
in the consciousness, we cannot eradicate them simply because they are there.
That is why in the Suttas, especially in the Commentaries, it is said ëanup»d»
nirodhaí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That means non-arising in the future. It is called
ëcessationí, so cessation of mental defilements, the non-arising of them in the
future. The mental defilements arise and disappear by themselves. We cannot do
anything about them. They arise and disappear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ëThe cessation of mental defilementsí really means not
letting them arise again. Non-arising in the future is what is called ëthe
cessation of mental defilementsí. Here also when there is Path, it has the
power to render them inactive or to render them unable to arise. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we have the four functions in a single moment. It is
said that the Path does the four functions simultaneously. What are the four?
ìNow at the time of penetrating to the Truths each one of the four [Path]
Knowledges is said to exercise four functions in a single moment. These are
full understanding (of the First Noble Truth), abandoning (the Second Noble
Truth), realizing (the Third Noble Truth), and developing (the Fourth Noble
Truth).î At one moment the Path consciousness or the Path Knowledge exercises
these four functions, not one by one, but simultaneously these four functions
are done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the simile of a lamp is given here. In paragraph 95
ìanother method: as the sun, when it rises, performs four functions
simultaneouslyî and so on is another simile. Then ìAnother method: as a boat
performs four functionsî is another simile. These similes are given to
illustrate the four functions done by Path consciousness simultaneously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 97 ìSo when his Knowledge occurs with the four
functions in a single moment at the time of penetrating the Four Truths, then
the Four Truths have a single penetration in the sense of trueness (reality) in
sixteen ways.î There are sixteen ways or sixteen meanings mentioned here, four
for each Truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHow is there single penetration of the Four Truths in the
sense of trueness? There is a single penetration of the Four Truths in the
sense of trueness in sixteen aspects: suffering has the meaning of oppressing,
meaning of being formed, meaning of burning (torment), meaning of change, as
its meaning of trueness.î These are the four meanings of the First Noble Truth.
Then the four meanings of the Second Noble Truth are: ìmeaning of accumulation,
meaning of source, meaning of bondage, meaning of impediment.î<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>The four meanings of the third are: ìmeaning
of escape, meaning of seclusion, meaning of not being formed, meaning of
deathless.î The meanings of the Fourth Noble Truth are ìmeaning of outlet,
meaning of cause, meaning of seeing, meaning of dominance.î These are called
ëthe sixteen ways of the Four Noble Truthsí. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 98 raises a question. ìHere it may be asked: since
there are other meanings of suffering, etc., too, such as a disease, a tumor,
etc., why then are only four mentioned for each?î Now if you go back to chapter
20, paragraph 18, you will find that there are forty ways of looking at things
as impermanent and so on. So the First Noble Truth has more than four meanings.
It has other meanings like a disease, a tumor and so on. So why are they not
taken and only these four are taken? ìWe answer that in this context it is
because of what is evident through seeing the other [three Truths in each
case].î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìFirstly in the passage beginning ëHerein, what is knowledge
of suffering? It is the understanding, the act of understanding..that arises
contingent upon suffering as its object [individually]. But in the passage
beginning ëBhikkhus, he who sees suffering sees also its originí it is
presented as accomplishing its function with respect to the other three Truths simultaneously
with its making one of them its object.î So sometimes it is described as seeing
one each, one at a time, but in other passages the seeing is presented as
occurring at the same time, seeing the four at the same time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAs regards these [two contexts], when, firstly, knowledge
makes each Truth its object singly, then (Here Say»daw purposefully omitted ë<u>when
suffering is made the objectí</u>.) suffering has the characteristic of
oppressing as its individual essenceî and so on. In these paragraphs we should
strike out those in square brackets. It is inserted by the translator and it is
not warranted by the Sub-Commentary. Paragraphs 99-102 after ëlikewiseí those
things in brackets should be removed. ë[When suffering is made the object]í
should be removed. If suffering is made the object, then the only thing it will
see is the first meaning of suffering and not the others. What the author is
explaining here is that when you see the Second Noble Truth, the Noble Truth of
origin, the sense of being formed of the First Noble Truth becomes evident.
When you see the Second Truth, then seeing the First Truth becomes evident.
When you see the Third Noble Truth, another meaning of the First Noble Truth
becomes evident. Wen you see the Fourth Noble Truth, yet another meaning of the
First Noble Truth becomes evident. That is why these four are mentioned here.
So when you see the First Noble Truth, the meaning of oppression is evident.
When you see the Second Noble Truth, the meaning of being formed of the First Noble
Truth becomes evident. When you see the Third Noble Truth, the meaning of
burning or torment of the First Noble Truth becomes evident. When you see the
Fourth Noble Truth, the meaning of the First Noble Truth, that is change,
becomes evident. That is why these four meanings are given. By seeing them
individually and also by seeing the other Truths, the meanings of the given
Truth becomes evident. These paragraphs explain this meaning. So we do not need
<u>ë[when Suffering is made the object]í, ë[when Origin is made the object]í,
ë[when Cessation is</u> <u>made the object]í, ë[when Path is made the object]</u>í.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then in paragraph 99 an example is given. ìAs the Beautyís
(Sundariís) ugliness did to the Venerable Nanda through seeing the celestial
nymphs.î Sundari was said to be very beautiful, maybe like a beauty queen. She
was very beautiful. And so Nanda was very much in love with her. But the Buddha
wanted to teach him a lesson. So Buddha took him to the celestial world and
showed him the celestial nymphs. After seeing the celestial nymphs, Nanda was
asked ìWho is more beautiful the celestial nymphs or Sundari?î Then Nanda said
ìSundari is like a she-monkey we saw on our way here.î After the sight of the
nymphs Sundari seemed to have become ugly. Sundari was a beautiful woman. Here
also ìthe cooling Path removes the burning of the defilements and so
Sufferingís sense of burning becomes evident through seeing the Path.î When you
see a cool one, then the burning becomes evident.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 47 ì 4. The kinds of states that ought to be
abandoned, 5. also the act of their abandoningî - so which kinds of states
these four Paths abandon and the act of abandoning. ìNow which states are to be
abandoned by which kinds of knowledge among these four should be understood,
and also the act of abandoning them.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìFor they <u>each and severally</u> bring about the
abandoning of the states called fettersî and so on. ëEach and severallyí is not
a correct translation. The P»ƒi is yathayoga—. It means ëas is properí or ëas
the case may beí. That means each of them abandon defilements and others differently.
ìFor as is proper they bring about the abandoning of the states called fetters,
defilements, wrongnesses, worldly states, kinds of avarice, perversions, ties,
bad ways, cankers, floods, bonds, hindrances, adherences, clingings, inherent
tendencies, stains, unprofitable courses of action, and unprofitable thought
arisings.î The mental defilements are given different names. All of them are
mental defilements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first one is fetters. ìHerein, the fetters are the ten
states beginning with greed for the fine material, so called because they
fetter aggregates [in this life] to aggregates [of the next], (they fetter)
kamma to its fruit or (they fetter) beings to suffering.î That is why they are
called ëfettersí. They are like ropes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìFor as long as the ones exist there is no cessation of the
others.î As long as there are fetters, there is no cessation of aggregates, no
cessation of kamma, no cessation of fruit, and no cessation of beings and
suffering. They are called ëfettersí.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd of these fetters, greed for the fine material, greed
for the immaterial, conceit, agitation, and ignorance, are called the ëfive
higher fettersí because they fetter beings to aggregates, etc., produced in the
higher [forms of becoming], while false view of individuality, uncertainty,
adherence to rites and rituals, greed for sense desires, and resentment, are
called the ëfive lower fettersí because they fetter beings to aggregates, etc.,
produced in the lower states of existence. The other five fetter beings to the
higher forms of existence. There are higher and lower fetters. All together
there are ten. Which fetters are abandoned by which Path will be explained
later. Right now the author is giving the lists of these states. The first is
the ten fetters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second group is the ten defilements. ìThe defilements
are the ten states, namely, greed, hate, delusion, conceit, [false] view,
uncertainty, stiffness [of mind], agitation, consciencelessness,
shamelessness.î These ten are called ëdefilementsí. ìThey are so called because
they are themselves defiled and because they defile the states associated with
them.î They are themselves impurities and they make others also impure. So
they<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>are called ëdefilementsí. In P»ƒi
they are called ëkilesasí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe wrongnesses are the eight states, namely, wrong view,
wrong thinking, wrong speech, (They are the opposite of the Noble Eightfold
Path.) wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, wrong
concentration which with wrong knowledge and wrong deliverance come to ten.î
That means with wrong knowledge and wrong deliverance they are ten.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Footnote 14 ì ëWrong knowledgeí, which is wrong because it
does not occur rightly [i.e. in conformity with truth], and is wrong and
mistaken owing to misinterpretations, etc., is just delusion. ëWrong
deliveranceí is the wrong notion of liberation that assumes liberation to take
place in a ëWorld Apexí.î People think that when a being reaches the highest
existence, there will be liberation. That is called ëwrong liberationí. There
are eight wrongnesses or there can be ten wrongnesses. When we take them to be
ten, we add wrong knowledge and wrong deliverance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next one is the worldly states. They are the states
which people meet or experience in their worldly life. There are said to be eight
of these states, namely, gain, loss, fame, disgrace, pleasure, pain, blame, and
praise. The P»ƒi words used for gain and loss are l»bha and al»bha. ëAl»bhaí
means non-gain, not getting. For fame the word used is ëyasaí and for disgrace
the word used is ëayasaí. The word ëyasaí can mean two things. One is fame and
the other is followers. We interpret this here not as fame, but to have
followers or to have students or pupils. For disgrace we say to be alone, not
to be with followers or having few followers. We do not say ëfame and disgraceí
because they are the same as the last two, praise and blame. So our
interpretation is that instead of fame it is having friends, or followers, or
having students. Instead of disgrace we say not having many followers. Pleasure,
pain, blame, praise - these eight are to be met with in a life and nobody can
escape them. ìThey are so called because they continually succeed each other as
long as the world persists.î At times there is gain and at other times there is
loss and so on. Sometimes you get what you want and sometimes you donít get
what you want or you lose what you have. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBut when the worldly states are included, then by the
metaphorical use of the causeís name [for its fruit], the approval that has the
gain, etc., as its object and the resentment that has the loss, etc., as its
object should also be understood as included.î Here the translation is a little
different than the original. What is said in the original is that by the
metaphorical use of the causes named for its fruit the approval and the
resentment are to be understood as meant by worldly states. When we say
ëworldly statesí, we mean gain, loss and so on, but here we do not mean gain,
loss, etc., but approval or resentment or our reactions to these conditions.
These are the eight conditions of life. When we have gain, then we have
approval. That means we are attached to gain. When we have loss, we have
aversion. That approval and resentment or that attachment and aversion are what
are meant by these worldly states, not just the gain, loss, etc. The approval
or the resentment is taken to be meant by worldly states by the metaphorical
use of the causes named for its fruit. That means the name is really the
causeís name, but we must take the fruit of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is gain. Because there is gain there is approval. That
means there is attachment. Attachment is caused by gain. When we say ëgainí,
gain is the name of the cause. What we must really understand is the effect of
that cause. It is like saying sugar is diabetes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe kinds of avarice are the five, namely, avarice about
dwellings, families, gain, Dhamma, and praise, which occur as in ability to
bear sharing with others any of these things beginning with dwellings.î The
Pa4l0I word for the kinds of avarice is macchariya. Macchariya is one of the
mental factors. ëMacchariyaí really means inability to bear sharing with
others. I have this thing and I donít want to share it with other persons. If
other persons come and make use of it, I am angry. That is what is meant by
avarice here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>It is not just stinginess.
We have two mental factors issa and macchariya. Avarice here is not stinginess
because stinginess is lobha. It is attachment. This mental factor is
accompanied by dosa. It is intolerance of sharing things with others. There are
five, namely, dwellings, families, gain, Dhamma and praise. Sometimes we donít
want people to come to our place and live with us. That is avarice with regard
to dwelling. ëFamilyí has meaning for monks, not particularly for lay people.
Monks always depend upon lay people for their living. So we may have
attachment. Let us say that he is my supporter. So I do not want other monks to
be acquainted with my supporterís family. It is something like that. Gain is
what one gets. Dhamma - that means you practice meditation and you may have
some results and you donít want those results to happen to other persons. If
other persons get the same results, you are not happy. And then the last one is
called ëpraiseí. The P»ƒi word is ëva””aí. That is interpreted to mean two
things. One is appearance or you may say beauty, and the other is praise. Let
us say you have a beautiful face. Then you donít want other people to have a
beautiful face. It is something like that. So ëva””aí can mean both beauty or
appearance and praise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
ìThe perversions are the three, namely, perversion of perception, of
consciousness, and of view, which occur apprehending objects that are
impermanent, painful, not self, and foul, as permanent, pleasant, self, and
beautiful.î If we take things as permanent, as pleasant, as self, and as
beautiful, it is one of these kind of perversions. There are three - perversion
of perception, perversion of consciousness and perversion of view. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe ties are the four beginning with covetousness, so
called because they tie the mental body and the material body. They are
described as ëthe bodily tie of covetousnessí, ëthe bodily tie of ill willí,
ëthe bodily tie of adherence to rites and ritualsí, and ëthe bodily tie of
insisting or misinterpreting that ìthis [only] is the truthî.í This alone is
true and others are false. It is something like that. That is called ëtieí
here. There are four ties. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBad ways is a term for doing what ought not to be done and
not doing what ought to be done, out of <u>zeal</u> (desire), hate, delusion,
and fear.î The P»ƒi word is ëagatií. It is actually bias. So we should say out
of attachment or out of desire, not zeal. If I am attached to someone, then I
may have a favorable bias towards him. I am not just towards other people. That
is what is called here ëbad waysí. Sometimes we hate somebody and so we do not
act justly towards him. Sometimes we are afraid. If we do this, a person will
do something back to me. So we are afraid of him. So we may practice favoritism
towards him. Sometimes there is just delusion. Because I am ignorant I favor
one over the other. These are called ëbad waysí. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìCankers (»savas): as far as change of lineage [in the case
of states of consciousness] and as far as the acme of becoming [in the case of
the kinds of becoming (Here ëbecomingí means realms or existences.), that is to
say, the fourth immaterial state,] there are exudations owing to the [formed
nature of the] object.î The real meaning here is that these cankers exude or
drip like pus or something dripping from a sore. The P»ƒi word is ë»savaí. ëåí
means ëas far así and ësavaí means ëto dripí or ëexudeí. Here ëto dripí should
be understood as taking as an object. ëExudeí actually means these take
something as objects and they exude as far as change of lineage, as far as the
highest existence or highest realm. These cankers are what? Lobha, di‘‘hi
(wrong view), moha (ignorance). These can take objects up to change of lineage
as objects and they can take the highest realm as object. It is to be
understood by way of taking object. ëThey exudeí means they<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>take them as object.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a footnote. I donít think he really understood what
he was referring to here. ëAs far así - I donít know whether it can be
explained in English. The P»ƒi word ëåí, here translated as ëas far así, can
mean two things. Let us say one is as far as change of lineage. It may mean as
far as change of lineage, but excluding change of lineage. It just reaches up
to that dhamma. Sometimes it may mean ëincludingí. There are two meanings for
the P»ƒi word ëåí or ëas far así. That means for example the fields extend as
far as the mountain. They stop when there is a mountain. The fields do not
include the mountain. When we say the Buddhaís fame goes as far as the highest
realm, that is including the highest realm. Here inclusion is meant. So ëas far
as change of lineageí means up to change of lineage. ëAs far as the acme of
becomingí or ëas far as the highest realmí means including the highest realm. I
think you say ëthroughí or something like that. Right?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>So ëMonday through Fridayí means Monday and
the rest including Friday. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThis is a term for greed for sense desires, greed for
becoming, wrong view, and ignorance, because of the exuding [of these
defilements] from unguarded sense doors like water from cracks in a pot in the
sense of constant trickling, or because of their producing the suffering of the
round of rebirths.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next one is the floods. It is the same thing. They are
called ëfloodsí ìin the sense of sweeping away into the ocean of becoming, and
in the sense of being hard to cross.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe bonds are so called because they do not allow
disengagement from an object and disengagement from suffering. Both ëfloodsí
and ëbondsí are terms for the cankers already mentioned.î The same states are
sometimes called ëcankersí, sometimes ëfloodsí, sometimes called ëbondsí. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe hindrances are the five, namely, lust, [ill will,
stiffness and torpor, agitation and worry, and uncertainty,] in the sense of
obstructing and hindering and concealing [reality] from consciousness.î These
are the five hindrances that we often encounter during meditation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAdherence (misapprehension - par»m»sa) is a term for wrong
view, because it occurs in the aspect of missing the individual essence of a
given state (That means going beyond the individual essence of a given state.)
and apprehending elsewise an unactual individual essence.î That means taking
something wrongly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The clingings are the up»d»nas. ìThe clingings are the four
beginning with the sense desire clinging described in all their aspects in the
description of Dependent Origination.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe inherent tendencies are the seven, namely, greed for
sense desire, etc., in the sense of inveterateness, stated thus: the inherent
tendency to greed for sense desires, the inherent tendency to resentment,
conceit, [false] view, uncertainty, greed for becoming, and ignorance.î There
are seven all together. ìFor it is owing to their inveteracy that they are
called inherent tendencies since they inhere as cause for the arising of greed
for sense desires, etc., again and again.î ëInherent tendenciesí really means
seven of the defilements. However when they are called ëinherent tendenciesí,
they are not the real defilements, but they are those that can arise when there
are conditions for their arising. When they really arise we call them
ëdefilementsí or ëkilesasí. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am liable to get attached to things. But right now I am
teaching Dhamma and there is no attachment in my mind. I am free from
attachment now. But if I see something which I like and I am attached to it,
then attachment arises. There is a liability of attachment to arise in me. That
is what is called ëan inherent tendencyí. When attachment really arises, it is
defilement. Before reaching the stage of defilements, they are called ëlatent
tendenciesí or ëinherent tendenciesí. It is like being under the surface. When
it surfaces, it is called ëdefilementí. When it lies dormant underneath, it is
called ëanusaya (inherent tendencies)í. There are seven. We will talk more
about them later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe stains are the three, namely, greed, hate, and
delusion. They are so called because they are themselves dirty like oil, black,
and mud, and because they dirty other things.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe unprofitable courses of action are the ten, namely,
killing living things, taking<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>what is
not given, sexual misconduct; false speech, malicious speech, harsh speech,
gossip; covetousness, ill will, and wrong view. They are so called since they
are both unprofitable action [kamma] and courses that lead to unhappy destinies
(unhappy rebirths).î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe unprofitable thought arisings are the twelve consisting
of the eight rooted in greed, the two rooted in hate, and the two rooted in
delusion.î They are, the twelve unwholesome types of consciousness. The P»ƒi
word ëcittupp»daí is translated here as thought arisings. Actually they are
types of consciousness. They are the twelve types of unwholesome consciousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìSo these [four kinds of knowledge] each and severally (or
as is proper) abandon these states beginning with the fetters. How?î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe five states eliminated by the first knowledge in the
case of the fetters, firstly, are: false views of personality, doubt, adherence
to rites and rituals, and then greed for sense desires and resentment that are
[strong enough] to lead to states of loss.î With regard to defilements or these
unwholesome states they have two or three layers. There are some defilements
that are strong enough to lead to rebirth in woeful states. There are some
defilements that are not strong enough to lead to rebirth in woeful states, but
still they are defilements..</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first Knowledge or the first Path eliminates false views
of personality, doubt, adherence to rites and rituals, and then greed for sense
desires and resentment that are strong enough to lead to states of loss. The
first Path eradicates false view of personality, doubt, and adherence to rites
and rituals all together, once and for all. Greed for sense desires and
resentment it cannot eradicate all together, but it destroys the stronger forms
of sense desire and resentment which lead to states of loss. That means which
lead to the four woeful states. That means a being after becoming a Sot»panna
may still have lobha and dosa. A Sot»panna only eradicates di‘‘hi (wrong view)
and vicikicch» (doubt). There are other mental defilements remaining, but these
mental defilements are not strong enough to give rebirth in the four woeful
states. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe remaining gross greed for sense desires and resentment
are eliminated by the second Knowledge. Subtle greed for sense desires and
resentment are eliminated by the third Knowledge. The five beginning with greed
for the fine material are only [actually] eliminated by the fourth Knowledge.î
We have to understand the eradication of defilements in this manner. The first
Path eliminates the ability of some mental<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>defilements to lead us to the four woeful states.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then there is a note. ìIn what follows, we shall not in
every instance specify the fact with the expression ëonlyí, nevertheless
whatever we shall say is eliminated by one of the [three] higher Knowledges
should be understood as only the [residual] state eliminated by the higher
Knowledge; for that state will have already been rendered not conducive to
states of loss by the preceding Knowledge.î Do you understand this?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: No.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: ìIn what follows, we shall not in every instance
specify the fact with the expression ëonlyí.î You see the word ëonlyí in the
paragraph above. ìThe five beginning with greed for the fine material are ONLY
eliminated by the fourth Knowledge.î If the author says ëonlyí, we have to
understand in one way. If the author does not use the word ëonlyí, we have to
understand in another way. That is what is meant. The translation is not so
understandable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let us look at the next one. ìIn the case of the
defilements, [false] view and uncertainty are eliminated by the first
Knowledge.î They are eliminated totally. ìHate is eliminated by the third
Knowledge (totallˇ). Greed, delusion, conceit, mental stiffness, agitation,
consciencelessness, and shamelessness, are eliminated by the fourth Knowledge.î
Here it doesnít say ëfourth knowledge onlyí. Right? There is no ëonlyí here. We
have to understand that greed, delusion, conceit and others are eliminated by
the preceding Paths. The elimination of the preceding Paths is of the stronger
forms of greed, delusion and so on. What the fourth Knowledge eliminates is the
subtle forms of greed, delusion and so on. The grosser forms of greed, delusion
and so on are eradicated by the first Path, by the second Path and by the third
Path. There is no ëonlyí here. They are eliminated by the fourth Knowledge and
it does not say that they are only eliminated by the fourth Knowledge. We have
to understand in this way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the case of wrongness, wrong view, false speech, wrong
action, wrong livelihood are eliminated by the first Knowledge. Wrong thinking,
malicious speech, and harsh speech are eliminated by the third Knowledge.î The
third Knowledge is the An»g»m  (the Non-Returner). Right? The An»g»m  can
eradicate anger all together and the grosser forms of attachment. ìWrong
thinking, malicious speech, and harsh speech, are eliminated by the third
Knowledge. And here only volition is to be understood as speech.î Although the
word ëspeechí is used, we must understand it to mean volition. ìGossip, wrong
effort, wrong mindfulness, wrong concentration, wrong deliverance, and wrong
knowledge, are eliminated by the fourth Knowledge.î Here also since there is no
ëonlyí, we must understand that the stronger ones are destroyed by the previous
Knowledges or previous Paths.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the case of the worldly states, resentment is eliminated
by the third Knowledge, and approval is eliminated by the fourth Knowledge.
Some say that approval of fame and praise is eliminated by the fourth
Knowledge.î He didnít say whether it is to be accepted or not. Maybe the author
doesnít like it. Maybe he just gives it as information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe kinds of avarice are eliminated by the first Knowledge
only.î The five kinds of avarice are eliminated by the first Knowledge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the case of perversions, the perversion of perception,
consciousness and view, which find permanence in the impermanent and self in
the not-self, and the perversion of view finding pleasure in pain and beauty in
the foul, are eliminated by the first Knowledge. The perversions of perception
and consciousness finding beauty in the foul are eliminated by the third Path.
The perversions of perception and consciousness finding pleasure in the painful
are eliminated by the fourth Knowledge.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the case of ties, the bodily ties of adherence to rites
and rituals and of the insistence (misinterpretation) that ëThis is the truthí,
are eliminated by the first Knowledge (because they are all wrong views). The
bodily tie of ill will is eliminated by the third Knowledge. The remaining one
is eliminated by the fourth Path.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe bad ways are eliminated by the first knowledge only.î
When a person becomes a Sot»panna, he will not practice favoritism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the case of the cankers, the cankers of view is
eliminated by the first Knowledge (because it is wrong view). The canker of
sense desire is eliminated by the third Knowledge. The other two are eliminated
by the fourth Knowledge.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe same thing applies in the case of the floods and the
bonds.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the case of the hindrances, the hindrances of
uncertainty is eliminated by the first Knowledge (because it is doubt). The
three, namely, lust, ill will and worry, are eliminated by the third
Knowledge.î ëLustí means desire for sensual things. ìStiffness and torpor and
agitation are eliminated by the fourth Knowledge.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAdherence is eliminated by the first Knowledge.î
ëAdherenceí just means wrong view. Wrong view is eliminated by the first
Knowledge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the case of the clingings (up»d»na), since according to
what is given in the Texts all worldly states are <u>sense desires</u>.î That
means objects of sense desires. I would like to put ìall worldly states are
objects of sense desiresî, not ë<u>sense desires as objectí</u>. ìAll worldly
states are objects of sense desires, and so greed both for the fine material
and the immaterial falls under sense desire clinging.î You remember the
clingings. Right? Sense desire clinging, wrong view clinging, and the others
are also wrong view. Although the word ësense desireí is used here in P»ƒi
k»mup»d»na, we must understand that sense desire for both the material and the
immaterial states are taken as sense desire here because they are lobha or
attachment. So here ësense desire clingingí just means attachment (lobha).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the case of the inherent tendencies, the inherent
tendencies to [false] view and to uncertainty are eliminated by the first
Knowledge. The inherent tendencies to greed for sense desire and to resentment
are eliminated by the third Knowledge. The inherent tendencies to conceit
(pride), to greed for becoming, and to ignorance are eliminated by the fourth
Knowledge.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the case of the stains, the stain of hate is eliminated
by the third Knowledge, the others are eliminated by the fourth Knowledge.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the case of the unprofitable courses of action, killing
living things, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech, and
wrong view, are eliminated by the first Knowledge. The three, namely, malicious
speech, harsh speech, and ill will, are eliminated by the third Knowledge.
Gossip and covetousness are eliminated by the fourth Knowledge.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn the case of the unprofitable thought arisings, the four
associated with [false] view, and that associated with uncertainty, making
five, are eliminated by the first Knowledge. The two associated with resentment
are eliminated by the third Knowledge. The rest are eliminated by the fourth
Knowledge.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do you find mention of the second Knowledge? No. Right? Why?
Did you ever wonder? The second Knowledge does not eliminate any mental
defilements all together. It makes the remaining mental defilements more
subtle. That is why it is not mentioned here. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For your knowledge or information the first Knowledge or
Path eliminates what? Wrong view and doubt. The second Knowledge eliminates
what? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: It just weakens the defilements</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: It does not eliminate mental defilements, but it
weakens the mental defilements. The third Knowledge eliminates what? Attachment
for sensual things, the k»m»vacara and aversion (dosa) or ill will. Then the
fourth Knowledge eradicates the remaining mental defilements. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we come to an interesting discussion. ìAnd what is
eliminated by any one of them is abandoned by it. That is why it was said above
ëSo these [four kinds of Knowledge] as is proper abandon these states beginning
with the fettersí.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe act of abandoning: but how then? Do these {Knowledges]
abandon these states when they are past, or when they are future, or when they
are present?î Itís very interesting. We say that Path Knowledge eradicates
mental defilements. The question here is do these Knowledges abandon these
states (ëThese statesí means the defilements.) when they are past, or when they
are future, or when they are present. In P»ƒi the sequence is past, future and
present. ìWhat is the position here? For firstly if [they are said to abandon]
when past or future, it follows that the effort is fruitless.î That is because
the past is already past and you donít have to do anything about it. It has
already gone. And the future has not come. So you cannot do anything about it
either. So there is no question about the Path Knowledges abandoning the past
defilements or the future defilements. But what about the present ones? Does
the Path eliminate the present mental defilements or the mental defilements
that are existent at the moment? No. That is because if they are present, there
can be no Path at all. Path and mental defilements do not arise together. Then
the Path eradicates nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThen if it is when they are present, it is likewise
fruitless because the things to be abandoned exist simultaneously with the
effort, and it follows that there is development of a Path that has defilement,
or it follows that defilements are dissociated [from consciousness] though
there is no such thing as a present defilement dissociated from consciousness.î
There are three things here. If you say that the defilements are abandoned when
they are present it is fruitless because the things to be abandoned exist
simultaneously with the effort. That means the things to be abandoned would
arise simultaneously with the effort. The ëeffortí here is Path consciousness.
ìIt follows that there is development of Path (That means arising of Path.)
that has defilement.î If you say that the present defilements are eliminated,
then that amounts to saying the Path and defilements arise together. No
defilements can arise with Path. Defilements are unwholesome mental states and
Path is a wholesome mental state. Unwholesome mental states and wholesome
mental states cannot arise at the same time. ìIt follows that defilements are
dissociated.î Then you may say at the moment of Path there are no defilements.
The Path eradicates the defilements. If you say this, then it amounts to saying
that defilements can arise without consciousness. That is not so. Defilements
are mental factors and as mental factors they can only arise when there is
consciousness. They are never dissociated from consciousness. But if you say at
the Path moment defilements are eliminated, then you are saying that they can
be dissociated from consciousness. Path consciousness does not eradicate the
past defilements, nor the future defilements, nor the present defilements. If
there are defilements in the mind, there can be no Path at all. It eradicates
nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThat is not an original argument.î Here ëoriginalí means
this argument or this discussion is not peculiar to this book only. This
discussion has appeared already in other books. ìFor in the Texts first the
question is put.î He quotes the Texts. The Texts are the same as what we have
said. Magga eradicates neither the past, nor the future, nor the present
defilements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then what does it eradicate? What does it abandon? Go to
paragraph 80. ìWhat does that show? It shows abandoning of defilements that
have soil [to grow in].î It is difficult here, the use of the P»ƒi word
ëbh|mi???í. ìBut are defilements that have soil [to grow in] past, future or
present?î Are those defilements that have soil to grow in past, future, or
present? The answer is: ìThey are simply those described as arisen by having
soil [to grow in].î They are just that. We cannot say that they are present, or
that they are future, or that they are past. They are just those that have
arisen by having soil to grow in. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìNow there are various meanings of ëarisení, that is to say,
(1) arisen as ëactually occurringíî, and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Is this close to saying they are empty?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: No. We will explain later. Then the Commentator
brings in four kinds of what are called ëarisení. The P»ƒi word is ëuppannaí.
On the handout I gave you the P»ƒi word also.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>There are four kinds of uppanna (that which has arisen). There are four
things which are called ëuppannaí in P»ƒi. The word ëuppannaí means that which
has arisen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first meaning is arisen as actually occurring. That
means all that is reckoned to possess the three moments of arising, aging and
dissolution. That means it is the real present things. Because when we say
something is present, we mean that it possesses the three stages of arising,
staying and disappearing, or arising, aging and dissolution. Thus it is the
real present. This real present is sometimes called ëuppanna (that which has
arisen)í. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next one is ëarisen as being and goneí. That means they
have arisen and now they are no more. They have arisen and gone. They are also
called ëarisení. There are two of them. Wholesome and unwholesome dhammas
(cittas and cetasikas) which have experienced the stimulus of an object (That
means which have tasted the object.) and disappeared. They are also called
ëarisen as been and goneí. Here ëbeení means ëexperiencedí. The second is
anything conditioned that has reached the three moments beginning with arising
and has ceased. Something conditioned which has come into being and then
disappeared is meant. That is also called ëarisení. It is having been and gone.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The third is arisen by opportunity made. Past kamma is
called ëarisen by opportunity madeí. It is really past. Although it is past, it
is called ëarisení. That means it is still with us or something like that.
Because it has stood (That is the direct translation), it has existed
inhibiting the result of other kamma and has made opportunity for its own
result to arise in the future. When there is kamma and then it disappears, it
leaves something like a potential in the continuity of beings to give results
in the future. When it makes opportunity for its results to arise in the
future, it inhibits the results of other kammas. The second is the future
result. The future result is also called ëuppannaí. Although it has not yet
arisen, it is called ëarisení. That is because when opportunity to arise is
made, it is sure to arise in the future. When kamma is accumulated, when kamma
is done, then the fruit is sure to arise. The future result can be called
ëarisení, although in fact it has not yet arisen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fourth one is arisen by having soil to grow in. We are
concerned with this. Arisen by having soil to grow in - that means unwholesome
kamma which has not been eradicated with respect to any given soil. What is
ësoilí here? ëSoilí here means the five aggregates in the three planes of
becoming, which are the object of vipassan», and ëwhat has soilí means mental
defilements which are capable of arising with respect to those aggregates. So
what the Path eliminates is this kind of defilement ëarisen by having soil to
grow iní. Here ësoilí means the five aggregates in the three planes of
becoming. They are the object of vipassan» meditation. ëWhat has soilí means
the mental defilements which are capable of arising with respect to those
aggregates.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Suppose I see an object, a desirable object. And I do not
practice vipassan» toward that object. So I take it to be beautiful. Although
at that moment I may have no attachment, since I have taken it to be beautiful,
I can have attachment with regard to that thing in the future. That kind of
attachment or mental defilement is what is called ëwhich is the soil to grow
iní. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With regard to objects we have to practice vipassan»
meditation in order to see their true nature so that we see that they are
impermanent and so on. When we have seen that, when we have practiced vipassan»
towards them, then the defilements are not said to be inherent in these
objects. But with regard to objects with which we fail to observe by vipassan»,
there is always the possibility that the defilements will arise with regard to
those things. Defilements which can arise through not having observed objects
by vipassan» are called ëhaving soil to grow iní. Actually what the Path
eradicates is not the present mental defilements, not the past mental
defilements, not the future mental defilements, but it is something like
future. There is some liability in our continuity. When there are conditions,
defilements can arise. That liability is what is eradicated by the Path
consciousness. That liability is called here ëthose having soil to grow iní.
That means in my continuity of consciousness they can arise. They have my
continuity as a soil to grow in. Because I have taken that object to be
beautiful, to be permanent, to be pleasant, to be substantial or self, since I
have taken this thing to be permanent and so on, then at any time the
defilement can arise. Those defilements which can occur through not being
observed by vipassan» are what are called ëthose that have soil to grow iní. It
has obtained or it has got my continuity to grow in, to arise in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd that is not meant objectively.î That means having the
soil to grow in. ëHaving the soilí means having the soil not as an object, but
as a place to grow in, as a base. That is also important because if we say it
is by way of taking an object that it has got the soil, then it can mean, say,
there is an Arahant. He said to be beautiful. A man saw the Arahant and he had
sexual desires for that Arahant. He wanted that Arahant to be his wife or
something like that. And so even with regard to the body of an Arahant, mental
defilements can arise in other persons by taking the body of an Arahant as an
object. If we mean that ëhaving the soilí<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>means having the soil as an object, then it will mean that an Arahant
can eradicate the mental defilements of another person. Because that person has
taken the Arahant as an object and then he has attachment arise in his mind. So
ëhaving the soilí does not mean having soil taken as an object. ëHaving the
soilí means having got somewhere or some place to grow in or grow out of. ìLike
those that arose in the rich man Soreyya with respect to the aggregates in
Mah»-Kacc»naî - he had wrong desires for Venerable Mah»-Kacc»na. ìAnd in the
brahman student Nanda with respect to Uppalava””»î - Venerable Uppalava””» was
an Arahant, a nun. Nanda fell in love with her. One day when she came back from
the sun, he raped the nun. So ëhaving soilí does not mean having soil taken as
an object. It is by way of having a place or having a base. If we say the
defilement which has the soil to grow in by way of taking object, then we mean
the defilement in another person also. Nobody, even the Buddha, can eradicate
defilement in another person. I can eradicate defilements in my mind but not
the defilements in another personís mind. So it is to be understood as ëhaving
soilí means having soil not as an object, not as being taken as an object. It is
having it as its location or something like that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd if that were what is called ëarisen by having soil [to
grow in]í no one could abandon the root of becoming because it would be
unabandonable.î That means because it belongs to another person. ìBut ëarisen
by having soil [to grow in]í should be understood [subjectively] with respect
to the basis [for them in oneself].î That means they should be understood as
having the place to live or to exist. ìFor the defilements that are the root of
the round are inherent in [oneís own] aggregates not fully understood by
insight.î If we do not practice vipassan» towards things, then we do not fully
understand these objects. ëFully understandí means seeing their arising and
disappearing, their characteristics, and also being able to get rid of mental
defilements with regard to them. ìFor the defilements that are the root of the
round are inherent in [oneís own] aggregates not fully understood by insight
from the instant those aggregates arise. And that is what should be understood
as ëarisen by having soil [to grow in]í, in the sense of its being
unabandoned.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In brief what the Path abandons or eliminates is the mental
defilements which would arise when there are conditions, which would arise
because one has not seen them correctly, one has not fully understood them.
That liability is what the Path consciousness eradicates and not the real
mental defilements arising at the moment. That is because when there are mental
defilements, there can be no Path consciousness and when there is Path
consciousness, there can be no mental defilements. I think if you understand
this, the other passages are not difficult.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the author gives another set of four kinds of uppanna.
Paragraph 89 ìBesides these there are four other ways of classing ëarisení,
namely, (5) arisen as happening, (6) arisen with apprehension of an object, (7)
arisen through non-suppression, (8) arisen through non-abolition.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHerein, ëarisen as happeningí is the same as (1) ëarisen as
actually occurringí.î That means it is rightly in existence lasting for three
moments. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìWhen an object has at some previous time come into focus in
the eye, etc., and defilement did not arise then but arose in full force later
on simply because the object had been apprehended (That means taken firmly as
permanent and so on.), then that defilement is called ëarisen with apprehension
of an objectí. Like the defilement that arose in the Elder Mah»-Tissa after
seeing the form of a person of the opposite sex while wandering for alms in the
village of Kaly»ne.î (It is Kaly»ne, not <u>Kaly»na</u>.) Before there was no
defilement in the Elder Mah»-Tissa. Then he saw a person of the opposite sex
and then the defilements arose in his mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAs long as a defilement is not suppressed by either serenity
or insight, though it may not have actually entered the conscious continuity,
it is nevertheless called ëarisen through non-suppressioní.î That means it has
not really arisen, but it is called ëarisení because it has not been
suppressed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBecause there is no cause to prevent its arising [if
suitable conditions combine]. But even when they are suppressed by serenity or
insight, they are still called ëarisen through non-abolition because the
necessity for their arising has not been transcended unless they have been cut
off by the Path.î That is those that have not been cut off or abandoned by the
Path consciousness. They are called ëarisen through non-abolitioní. Abolition
and suppression are different here. ëSuppressioní means keeping them at bay for
some time. ëAbolitioní means eradicating all together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìLike the Elder who had obtained the eight attainments and
the defilements that arose in him while he was going through the air on his
hearing the sound of a woman singing with a sweet voice as she was gathering
flowers in a grove of blossoming trees.î He had obtained the eight attainments.
That means he had suppressed the mental defilements by the eight attainments.
The defilements arose in him while as he was going through the air. He was
going through the air and he heard a woman singing as she was plucking flowers.
Defilements arose in him. Such defilements are called ëthose arisen through
non-abolitioní. Because they are not abolished, because they are not
eradicated, they may arise when there are conditions. So there are these four
kinds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd the three kinds, namely, (6) arisen with apprehension
of an object, (7) arisen through non-suppression, and (8) arisen through
non-abolition, should be understood as included by arisen by having soil [to
grow in].î The fourth of the first list corresponds to three of the second
list.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìSo as regards the kinds of ëarisení stated, the four kinds,
namely, (1) as actually occurring, (2) as been and gone, (3) by opportunity
made, and (5) as happening, cannot be abandoned by any [of these four kinds of]
knowledge because they cannot be eliminated by the Paths. But the four kinds of
ëarisení, namely, (4) by having soil [to grow in], (6) with apprehension of an
object, (7) through non-suppression, and (8) through non-abolition, can all be
abandoned because a given mundane or supramundane<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>knowledge, when it arises, nullifies a given
one of these modes of being arisen.î When we say that the Path abandons, then
we mean the second four. ëThe second fourí here means one of the first and
three of the second list - so ëby having soilí, ëwith apprehension of an object
through non-suppression and non-abolitioní.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>So what the Path eradicates is the inherent tendencies or the latent
tendencies, not the ones that have arisen in the consciousness. When they are
in the consciousness, we cannot eradicate them simply because they are there.
That is why in the Suttas, especially in the Commentaries, it is said ëanup»d»
nirodhaí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That means non-arising in the future. It is called ëcessationí,
so cessation of mental defilements, the non-arising of them in the future. The
mental defilements arise and disappear by themselves. We cannot do anything
about them. They arise and disappear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ëThe cessation of mental defilementsí really means not letting
them arise again. Non-arising in the future is what is called ëthe cessation of
mental defilementsí. Here also when there is Path, it has the power to render
them inactive or to render them unable to arise. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we have the four functions in a single moment. It is
said that the Path does the four functions simultaneously. What are the four?
ìNow at the time of penetrating to the Truths each one of the four [Path]
Knowledges is said to exercise four functions in a single moment. These are
full understanding (of the First Noble Truth), abandoning (the Second Noble
Truth), realizing (the Third Noble Truth), and developing (the Fourth Noble
Truth).î At one moment the Path consciousness or the Path Knowledge exercises
these four functions, not one by one, but simultaneously these four functions
are done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the simile of a lamp is given here. In paragraph 95
ìanother method: as the sun, when it rises, performs four functions
simultaneouslyî and so on is another simile. Then ìAnother method: as a boat
performs four functionsî is another simile. These similes are given to
illustrate the four functions done by Path consciousness simultaneously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 97 ìSo when his Knowledge occurs with the four
functions in a single moment at the time of penetrating the Four Truths, then
the Four Truths have a single penetration in the sense of trueness (reality) in
sixteen ways.î There are sixteen ways or sixteen meanings mentioned here, four
for each Truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHow is there single penetration of the Four Truths in the sense
of trueness? There is a single penetration of the Four Truths in the sense of
trueness in sixteen aspects: suffering has the meaning of oppressing, meaning
of being formed, meaning of burning (torment), meaning of change, as its
meaning of trueness.î These are the four meanings of the First Noble Truth.
Then the four meanings of the Second Noble Truth are: ìmeaning of accumulation,
meaning of source, meaning of bondage, meaning of impediment.î<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>The four meanings of the third are: ìmeaning
of escape, meaning of seclusion, meaning of not being formed, meaning of
deathless.î The meanings of the Fourth Noble Truth are ìmeaning of outlet,
meaning of cause, meaning of seeing, meaning of dominance.î These are called
ëthe sixteen ways of the Four Noble Truthsí. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 98 raises a question. ìHere it may be asked: since
there are other meanings of suffering, etc., too, such as a disease, a tumor,
etc., why then are only four mentioned for each?î Now if you go back to chapter
20, paragraph 18, you will find that there are forty ways of looking at things
as impermanent and so on. So the First Noble Truth has more than four meanings.
It has other meanings like a disease, a tumor and so on. So why are they not
taken and only these four are taken? ìWe answer that in this context it is
because of what is evident through seeing the other [three Truths in each
case].î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìFirstly in the passage beginning ëHerein, what is knowledge
of suffering? It is the understanding, the act of understanding..that arises
contingent upon suffering as its object [individually]. But in the passage
beginning ëBhikkhus, he who sees suffering sees also its originí it is
presented as accomplishing its function with respect to the other three Truths
simultaneously with its making one of them its object.î So sometimes it is
described as seeing one each, one at a time, but in other passages the seeing
is presented as occurring at the same time, seeing the four at the same time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAs regards these [two contexts], when, firstly, knowledge
makes each Truth its object singly, then (Here Say»daw purposefully omitted ë<u>when
suffering is made the objectí</u>.) suffering has the characteristic of
oppressing as its individual essenceî and so on. In these paragraphs we should
strike out those in square brackets. It is inserted by the translator and it is
not warranted by the Sub-Commentary. Paragraphs 99-102 after ëlikewiseí those
things in brackets should be removed. ë[When suffering is made the object]í
should be removed. If suffering is made the object, then the only thing it will
see is the first meaning of suffering and not the others. What the author is
explaining here is that when you see the Second Noble Truth, the Noble Truth of
origin, the sense of being formed of the First Noble Truth becomes evident. When
you see the Second Truth, then seeing the First Truth becomes evident. When you
see the Third Noble Truth, another meaning of the First Noble Truth becomes
evident. Wen you see the Fourth Noble Truth, yet another meaning of the First
Noble Truth becomes evident. That is why these four are mentioned here. So when
you see the First Noble Truth, the meaning of oppression is evident. When you
see the Second Noble Truth, the meaning of being formed of the First Noble
Truth becomes evident. When you see the Third Noble Truth, the meaning of
burning or torment of the First Noble Truth becomes evident. When you see the
Fourth Noble Truth, the meaning of the First Noble Truth, that is change,
becomes evident. That is why these four meanings are given. By seeing them
individually and also by seeing the other Truths, the meanings of the given
Truth becomes evident. These paragraphs explain this meaning. So we do not need
<u>ë[when Suffering is made the object]í, ë[when Origin is made the object]í,
ë[when Cessation is</u> <u>made the object]í, ë[when Path is made the object]</u>í.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then in paragraph 99 an example is given. ìAs the Beautyís
(Sundariís) ugliness did to the Venerable Nanda through seeing the celestial
nymphs.î Sundari was said to be very beautiful, maybe like a beauty queen. She
was very beautiful. And so Nanda was very much in love with her. But the Buddha
wanted to teach him a lesson. So Buddha took him to the celestial world and
showed him the celestial nymphs. After seeing the celestial nymphs, Nanda was
asked ìWho is more beautiful the celestial nymphs or Sundari?î Then Nanda said
ìSundari is like a she-monkey we saw on our way here.î After the sight of the
nymphs Sundari seemed to have become ugly. Sundari was a beautiful woman. Here
also ìthe cooling Path removes the burning of the defilements and so
Sufferingís sense of burning becomes evident through seeing the Path.î When you
see a cool one, then the burning becomes evident.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>OK. That should be the end of it.</p>
