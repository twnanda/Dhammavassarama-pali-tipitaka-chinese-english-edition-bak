<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Chapter 10</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>(Tape 23 / Ps: 1-64)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Todayís chapter is
on the immaterial states, that is on the formless jh»nas. We are still in the
realm of concentration. This book was written on the three broad subjects of
s la (morality), sam»dhi (concentration), and pa““» (wisdom). We are still in
concentration. This chapter deals with four jh»nas, the absorptions of
immaterial or formless states.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>A person who wants
to attain these immaterial states or brahm» vih»ras must have already attained
the four or five form jh»nas or material jh»nas. Without getting those jh»nas
one will not be able to attain the immaterial states. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìOne who wants
firstly to develop the base consisting of boundless space sees in gross
physical matter danger through the wielding of sticks, etc., because of the
words.î In order to go to the immaterial states or in order to attain the
formless jh»nas one needs to find fault with matter. So here he sees danger in
gross physical matter. That means he sees danger in the physical body.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then he sees danger
in it through the thousand afflictions beginning with eye disease and so on.
When we have this physical body we may quarrel with some other person. We may
come to blows and take up knives. Also this physical body is the place of many
diseases beginning with eye disease, ear disease and so on. So thus he finds
fault with the physical body.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In order to
surmount that he enters upon the fourth form (r|p»vacara) jh»na with any of the
nine kasi”as beginning with the earth kasi”a and omitting the limited space
kasi”a. You know there are nine kasi”as. If you want to go on to the
ar|p»vacara jh»nas, you cannot practice limited space kasi”a because that
kasi”a is already space and space cannot be removed. So only nine kasi”as are
mentioned here, the first nine kasi”as.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìNow although he
has already surmounted gross physical matter by means of the fourth jh»na of
the fine material sphere, nevertheless he still wants also to surmount the
kasi”a materiality since it is the counterpart of the former.î When he is in
the jh»nas, he is said to be out of physical matters, but still he wants to
surmount the kasi”a materiality. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Let us take the
fourth jh»na. If he practices with earth kasi”a meditation, then his fourth
jh»na takes earth kasi”a as object. So the fourth jh»na takes earth kasi”a or
the sign of earth kasi”a which is materiality as object. So when he, let us
say, hates matter, he hates any matter, whether it is the object of the jh»na
or any other matter. So he wants to surmount the kasi”a materiality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>It is like a person
who sees a snake or who is pursued by a snake and he is afraid.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>Even after that when he sees a rope or a
crack in the earth, he is afraid of that. In the same way since this meditator
hates matter, he hates the kasi”a materiality also. So he wants to surmount the
kasi”a matter too. The simile given is that it is like the man pursued by the
snake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The other similes
are the dog attacked by a boar and the pis»ca goblin and the timid man.
Actually it means a man afraid of pis»cas. It is not a goblin and a timid man,
but it is just a man who is afraid of ghosts. A man who is afraid of ghosts
sees something in the dark. Then he thinks it is a ghost. So he is afraid of
that too. It is something like that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Even those who have
never seen a ghost in their life are afraid of ghosts because they have heard
from other people about ghosts. A person who is afraid of ghosts may be afraid
of a tree stump or even his own shadow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìSo when he has
become disgusted with (dispassionate towards) the kasi”a materiality, the
object of the fourth jh»na, and wants to get away from it, he achieves mastery
in the five ways.î So he must achieve mastery in the five ways mentioned in the
earlier chapters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThen on emerging
from the now familiar fourth jh»na of the fine material sphereî - so he enters
into the fourth jh»na with which he is very, very familiar. He gets into the
jh»na and emerges from it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìHe sees the danger
in that jh»na in this way. ëThis makes its object the materiality with which I
have become disgustedí, and ëIt has joy as its near enemyí.î Now he finds fault
with the fourth r|p»vacara jh»na. He says with reference to this fourth
r|p»vacara jh»na, ìThis makes its object the materiality with which I have
become disgusted.î That means this is a friend of my enemy, so I hate him too.
It is something like that. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ì ëIt has joy as
its near enemyí and ëit is grosser than the peaceful liberationsí.î ëPeaceful
liberationsí means the immaterial jh»nas or the ar|p»vacara jh»nas. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThere is, however,
no [comparative] grossness of factors here [as in the case of the four fine
material jh»nas]; for the immaterial states have the same two factors as this
fine material [jh»na].î In the material jh»nas one material jh»na is different
from another material jh»na by the number of jh»na factors and also by the
grossness or subtleness of the jh»na factors. But here all four immaterial
jh»nas have the same number of jh»na factors. So there is no difference in the
number of factors in these four immaterial states. So there is no comparative
grossness of jh»na in the four immaterial jh»nas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìWhen he has seen
the danger in that in this way and has ended his attachment to it, he gives his
attention to the base consisting of boundless spaced as peacefulness. Then,
when he has spread out the kasi”a to the limit of the world sphereî - that
means he enters into the jh»na. His fourth material jh»na takes the kasi”a sign
as object. Then he expands this kasi”a sign in his mind. He expands the kasi”a
sign as much as he likes to the limit of the world sphere or as far as he
likes. Then he removes that sign because he does not like that sign. He doesnít
want to be attached to that sign. So he removes that sign by giving his
attention to the space touched by it or covered by it regarding that as or
saying to himself ìspace, space, spaceî or ìboundless space, boundless space,
boundless space.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìWhen he is
removing it, he neither folds it up like a mat nor withdraws it like a cake
from a tin.î Actually it is from a pan. ëA cakeí here means a flat cake or
pancake. You take a pancake from a pan with a spatula. It is not like that. He
does not pay attention to it. He does not review it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìIt is simply that
he does not advert or give attention to it or review it; it is when he neither
adverts to it nor gives attention to it nor reviews it, but gives attention
exclusively to the space touched by it [regarding that] as ëspace, spaceí, that
he is said to ëremove the kasi”aí.î When he wants to remove the kasi”a or the
sign of kasi”a, he just stops paying attention to that sign. When he does not
pay attention to that sign, that sign disappears. In its place there is void.
There is just space left. That space he takes as object for his immaterial
jh»na.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAnd when the kasi”a
is being removed, it does not roll up or roll away. It is simply that it is
called ëremovedí on account of his non-attention to it, his attention being
given to ëspace, spaceí. This is conceptualized as the mere space left by the
removal of the kasi”a.î This kind of space is called ëspace left by the removal
of the kasi”aí. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìWhether it is
called ëspace left by the removal of the kasi”aí or ëspace touched by the
kasi”aí or ëspace secluded from the kasi”aí, it is all the same.î You can call
it with any name you like, but it is the same whether it is called ëspace left
by the removal of the kasi”aí, or ëspace touched by the kasi”aí, or ëspace
secluded from the kasi”aí. So the kasi”a sign disappears. In its place there is
space. There is void. The meditator takes that space (It is conceptualized
space.) as his object of meditation. He dwells upon it again and again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìHe adverts again
and again to the sign of the space left by the removal of the kasi”a as ëspace,
spaceí, and he strikes at it with thought and applied thought.î That means he
pays attention to it again and again and again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAs he adverts to
it again and again and strikes at it with thought and applied thought the
hindrances are suppressed, mindfulness is established and his mind concentrated
in access. He cultivates that sign again and again, develops and repeatedly
practices it.î Then he attains the first ar|p»vacara jh»na.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>When he attains the
ar|p»vacara jh»na there is a thought process. That thought process is mentioned
briefly here in paragraph 10, the second half of the paragraph. ìAnd here too
in the prior stage there are either three or four sensual sphere impulsions
associated with equanimous feeling.î That means there are three or four moments
of javana, or impulsions, or sense-sphere consciousness. They are parikamma,
upac»ra, anuloma, and gotrabh| (preliminary, access, adaptation, and change of
lineage). These four moments precede the ar|p»vacara jh»na consciousness. Next
comes the immaterial or ar|p»vacara consciousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThe rest is the
same as in the case of the earth kasi”a. There is however, this difference.
When the immaterial sphere consciousness has arisen in this way, the bhikkhu,
who has been formerly looking at the kasi”a disk with the jh»na eye, finds
himself looking at only space (because the kasi”a has disappeared) after that
sign has been abruptly removed by the attention given in the preliminary work
thus ëspace, spaceí. He is like a man who has plugged an opening in a [covered]
vehicle, a sack or a pot with a piece of blue rag or with a piece of rag of
some such color as yellow, red or white and is looking at that, and then when
the rag is removed by the force of the wind or by some other agency, he finds
himself looking at space.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The first
ar|p»vacara consciousness takes space as an object. It is not ordinary space or
general space, but it is the space obtained or left after the removal of the
kasi”a sign.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Now comes the text.
ìWith the complete surmounting of perceptions of matter, with the disappearance
of perceptions of resistance, with non-attention to perceptions of variety,
[aware of] ëunbounded spaceí, he enters upon and dwells in the base consisting
of boundless space.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>I have not talked
about ëbase consisting of boundless spaceí because it is not accurate. How many
perceptions do we have here? There are 1. ëcomplete surmounting of perceptions
of matterí, 2. ëthe disappearance of the perceptions of resistanceí, 3.
ënon-attention to perceptions of varietyí. The first kind of perception is
called ër|pa sa““»í in the P»ƒi Texts. ëR|pa sa““»í really means the five
material jh»nas and their objects. It is a little complicated. The word ësa““»í
(perception) is used quite often in the Suttas to represent not only sa““» but
all mental states. The word used is ësa““»í, but what we must understand is
that it means all mental states. So here ër|pa sa““»í really means five
material jh»nas and their objects. The material jh»nas take kasi”as as their
objects. Kasi”as are matter. So ëperception of matterí here means the five or
four material jh»nas and also by play of the word ësa““»í their objects. That
is explained here. First complete surmounting of perceptions of matter is
explained. Perceptions of matter is explained in two ways here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Bhante, I have a question. I thought there were
only four or five jh»nas including the ar|p»vacara jh»nas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: There are eight or nine. If you take r|p»vacara
jh»nas to be four, there are eight, four r|p»vacara jh»nas and four ar|p»vacara
jh»nas. If you take r|p»vacara jh»nas to be five, there are nine jh»nas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>When it means fine
material jh»nas, then it is defined as sa““» (perception) of matter.
ëPerception of matterí means perception taking matter as object and here it
means jh»nas. So ëperceptioní here means not only sa““» but the whole jh»na.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Why does this word
also signify their objects? Here the word is explained in another way. The word
ësa““»í is taken to mean a name or in this book it is translated as a label.
ëSa““»í can also mean name. The word ër|pa sa““»í is explained to mean
something that has the name ër|paí. So they come to be the objects of jh»na.
The objects of jh»nas are kasi”as - earth kasi”a, water kasi”a and so on. They
are also called ër|pa sa““»í because they are of matter and so they have the
name ëmatterí. They all have the name ëmatterí so they are called ër|pa sa““»í.
The word ër|pa sa““»í or ëperception of matterí is explained in two ways in the
Visuddhi Magga. The first one is sa““» of r|pa. The second one is something
which has the name ër|paí. That is why in the footnote the author says ìThis
explanation depends on a play on the word ësa““»í<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>as the (subjective) perception and as the
(objective) sign, signal or label perceived.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Surmounting both
the fine material jh»nas and their objects - that means he no longer pays
attention to the objects of the five jh»nas. If he is still paying attention to
them, he will not be able to surmount them. Now he wants to surmount the five
or four material jh»nas. So he has to forsake all of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The next is what?
ìWith the disappearance of perceptions or resistanceî - ëperceptions of
resistanceí means perception of something where there is something like
friction. When you see an object, there is said to be friction of the visible
object and your eye. These two come together. When the visible object comes
into the avenue of your eye, it is said to strike your eye. So it is called
ëfrictioní but in the translation it is called ëresistanceí. The P»ƒi word is
ëpa‘igha sa““»í. There is resistance or friction. Where can there be friction?
There is friction between visible object and the eye, audible object and the
ear, the smell and the nose, taste and tongue, tactile object and the body. So
there are five kinds of pa‘igha sa““». They are r|pa sa““» (ëR|paí means
visible object.), sadda sa““» (sound), gandha sa““» (smell), rasa sa““»
(taste), pho‘‘abba sa““» (touch). So it is sa““» associated with two seeing
consciousnesses, two hearing consciousnesses. Actually there are ten kinds of
sa““».</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Among the eighteen
types of rootless consciousness there are ten (five pairs of two each) - seeing
consciousness, hearing consciousness, smelling consciousness, tasting
consciousness, and touching consciousness. These are called here ëpa‘igha
sa““»í. ëDisappearance of the perceptions of resistanceí or ëdisappearance of
the perceptions of frictioní means disappearance of these types of
consciousness - seeing consciousness and so on. When<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>you have entered into the jh»na, only jh»na
consciousness arises again and again for<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>a long period - one hour, two hours, three hours or one day, two days
and so on. At that time no seeing consciousness, no hearing consciousness and
so on arise. So they are said to have disappeared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>(Say»daw refers to
a citta chart.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>These two are
seeing consciousness. One is the result of bad kamma and one is the result of
good kamma. If you see an ugly thing, then you see with this type of
consciousness (cakkhuvi““»”a that is vip»ka of akusala). When you see a
beautiful thing, a desirable object, then you see with this consciousness
(cakkhuvi““»”a that is vip»ka of kusala). There are two seeing consciousnesses,
two hearing, two smelling, two tasting, and two touching. They are called
ëpa‘igha sa““»í. They do not arise when you are in jh»na. That is paragraph 16.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Letís go back a
little to paragraph 14<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>with the
surmounting, with the fading away, and with the cessation. ìBoth because of the
fading away and because of the cessation, either in all aspects or without
exception, of these perceptions of matter, reckoned as jh»na, which number
fifteen with the [five each of the] profitable, resultant and functional.î
These fifteen are the five r|p»vacara kusala, the five r|p»vacara vip»ka and
the five r|p»vacara kiriya.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In the footnote the
numbers of the types of consciousness are given. Those numbers are according to
table two at the end of the book. The sequence is not the same as this chart.
In the footnote they are 9-13, 57-61, and 81-85.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Now we come to
paragraph 16. ìWith the disappearance of perception of resistanceî - that means
with the disappearance of sa““» accompanying the ten kinds of consciousness
just shown.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Now paragraph 17
ìOf course, these are not to be found in one who has entered upon the first
jh»na, etc., either.î They do not arise in one who has entered the first jh»na.
ìFor consciousness at that time does not occur by way of the five doors.î When
you are in jh»na, you donít see, you donít hear, you donít smell or whatever.
You are completely in the mental world or something like that.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>They donít arise even when you are in the
first jh»na. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìStill the mention
of them here should be understood as a recommendation of this jh»na for the
purpose of arousing interest in it.î That is are praising it: ëIt is good.
There are no perceptions of resistance in thisí. It is something like that. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìJust as in the
case of the fourth jh»na there is mention of the pleasure and pain already
abandoned elsewhere.î So pleasure and pain are abandoned in the previous jh»na,
but in the description of the fourth jh»na they are also mentioned. That is to
recommend the fourth jh»na, that it is good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAnd in the case of
the third Path there is mention of the [false] view of personality, etc.,
already abandoned earlier.î When describing the third enlightened person, the
Buddha said that with the extinction of the five lower fetters and three of
those five are abandoned at the first stage of enlightenment. So they are
mentioned again with the person who has reached the third stage of attainment,
just to recommend it or just to praise it. In the same way here although the
perceptions of resistance are not arising when one is even in the first jh»na,
yet they are mentioned here to praise this jh»na.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìOr alternatively,
though these are also not to be found in one who has attained the fine material
sphere, still their not being there is not due to their having been abandoned;
for development of the fine material sphere does not lead to fading of greed
for materiality, and the occurrence of these [fine material jh»nas] is actually
dependent on materiality.î That means that they are not there not because they
are abandoned all together, for only through enlightenment can these be
abandoned all together. So it is not that they are abandoned all together that
they do not arise here. They are something like pushed back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìBut this
development [of the immaterial] does lead to the fading of greed for
materiality. Therefore it is allowable to say that they are actually abandoned
here; and not only to say it, but to maintain it absolutely.î It is a way of
forcing you to accept.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìIn fact it is
because they have not been abandoned already before this that it was said by
the Blessed One that sound is a thorn to one who has the first jh»na.î If they
were really abandoned, sound could not be a thorn to the first jh»na.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAnd it is
precisely because they are abandoned here that the imperturbability of the
immaterial attainments and their state of peaceful liberation are mentioned,
and that ål»ra K»l»ma neither saw the five hundred carts that passed close by
him nor heard the sound of them while he was in an immaterial attainment.î Once
he was sitting in immaterial attainment (ar|p»vacara). Then 500 carts passed
close to him making noise, throwing up dust and so on. Later on his disciples
came to him and asked if he had heard the carts going by. He said ìNo, I did
not.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>When this was told
to the Buddha, Buddha said ìWhich is more difficult or which is more amazing, a
man who did not know that 500 carts passed by him or a man who did not know
while there was lightning and thunder and many people were killed by lightning,
and he did not know anything about that?î The man said that the latter was more
difficult, more wonderful. The Buddha said that once he was like that. He was
in an immaterial state and there was thunder and lightning and people died.
Later on a man came to him and said ìDonít you know anything about that?î The
Buddha replied that he did not. You may read this in Dialogues of the Buddha,
volume 2, page 141. In Thus Have I Heard, translated by Maurice Walsh it is on
page 258.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>When one is in the
immaterial state (ar|p»vacara jh»na) you will not know anything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: So at a retreat you wonít hear the bell?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: No.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Until you get out of it?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Yes. Before attaining it the meditator makes up his
mind ëI want to be or let me be in this state for one hour, two hoursî and so
on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Seven days is the maximum?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Yes, seven days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìWith non-attention
to perceptions of varietyî - ëperceptions of varietyí means perceptions that
take a variety of objects or perceptions that are themselves varied. So it is
explained in or perceptions that are themselves varied. So it is explained in
two ways: either to perceptions occurring with variety - that means as their <u>domain.</u>
Sometimes the word ëdomainí is not a good word for the P»ƒi word ëgocaraí. It
is simply as their object. They take many, many different objects so they are
called ëperceptions of varietyí. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìOr to perceptions
themselves variousî - that means one perception is different from another
perception. Although we are all human beings, one is still different from the
other. We are all individually different. So in the same way although sa““» is
one, there are different sa““»s - sa““»s taking visible objects, sa““»s
taking<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>sounds and so on. Sa““»s
themselves are varied and take varied objects. That is why in P»ƒi they are
called ën»natta sa““» (perceptions of variety)í. In paragraph 20 you see the
word ëdomainí. When you see the word ëdomainí, please take it to mean object.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In about the middle
of the paragraph you can see that 44 kinds of perception are given. ìAnd
secondly, because 44 kinds of perception - that is to say, eight kinds of
sense-sphere profitable perception and so on - themselves have variety, have
various individual essences, and are dissimilar from each other. With the
complete non-attention to, non-adverting to, non-reaction to (That means not
paying attention to.), non-reviewing of, these perceptions of variety; what is
meant is that because he does not advert to them, give them attention or review
them, therefore and so on.î The 44 perceptions are given in detail here. But
the author does not give the numbers of the types of consciousness at the end of
the book. Do you want to write them down? The eight kinds of sense-sphere
profitable perception are 1-8. The twelve kinds of unprofitable perception are
22-33. The eleven kinds of sense-sphere profitable resultant perception are
39-41 and then 42-49. The two kinds of unprofitable resultant perception are 55
and 56. The eleven kinds of sense-sphere functional perception are 70-72 and
73-80. Eight kinds of sense-sphere profitable perception - ësense-sphere
profitableí means wholesome. ëThe twelve kinds of unprofitable perceptioní
means unwholesome. The eleven kinds of sense-sphere profitable resultant
perception are the eight k»m»vacara sobhana vip»ka and the two sant ra”as which
are wholesome resultants. The two kinds of unprofitable resultant perception
are the sampa‘icchana and the sant rana which are unwholesome resultants. The
eleven kinds of sense-sphere functional perception are pa“cadv»r»vajjana,
manodv»r»vajjana, hasitupp»da and the eight k»m»vacara kiriya. (Say»daw was
actually pointing at citta chart during this explanation.) Actually these are
the 54 sense-sphere consciousnesses minus the dvipa“cavi““»”a. ëN»natta sa““»í
or ëperception of varietyí means sa““» accompanying these 44 types of
consciousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAnd [two things]
should be understood: firstly, that their absence is stated here in two ways as
ësurmountingí and ëdisappearanceí because the earlier perceptions of matter and
perceptions of resistance do not exist even in the kind of existence produced
by this jh»na on rebirth, let alone when this jh»na is entered upon and dwelt
in that existence.î That means the earlier two kinds of perception, perceptions
of matter and perceptions of resistance, do not exist in the kind of existence
produced by this jh»na. That means that they do not exist in the r|p»vacara
world in the r|p»vacara brahm»s. So in that realm they do not exist. They also
do not exist when the jh»nas are entered upon and dwelt in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAnd secondly, in
the case of perceptions of variety (the third one), ënon-attentioní to them is
said because 27 kinds of perception still exist in the kind of existence
produced by this jh»na.î The 27 kinds of perception are existent in the
ar|p»vacara realm. Thatís why here he does not say ësurmountingí, but he just
says ënon-attentioní. There it says ësurmountingí because they are
non-existent, but here they have to be given no attention, non-attention
because they are there but they are not paid attention to. That is the
difference. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The 27 kinds of
perception are the eight kinds of sense-sphere profitable perception (1-8), the
nine kinds of functional perception (72 and 73-80), and the ten kinds of
unprofitable perception (22-29, 32 and 33). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìFor when he enters
upon and dwells in this jh»na, there too, he does so by non-attention to them
also, but he has not attained when he does give attention to them.î So here it
is just not paying attention to them. It is not surmounting them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In paragraph 22 we
have a very brief account of the meaning of the words. ëWith the surmounting of
perception of matterí, what does it mean? Abandoning of all fine material is
signified. By the words ëwith the surmounting of perceptions of matterí is
meant the surmounting of the fine material jh»nas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>By the words ëwith
the disappearance of perceptions of resistanceí and so on, what is meant?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>Non-attention to all sense-sphere
consciousness, to all k»m»vacara consciousness. So in fact when a person enters
into the ar|p»vacara consciousness, there are no r|p»vacara consciousnesses and
no k»m»vacara consciousnesses. Surmounting some and not paying attention to
some he enters into the immaterial jh»na.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>When the meditator is in the immaterial jh»na, there are no r|p»vacara
jh»nas and no k»m»vacara consciousnesses. Actually when one gets the
ar|p»vacara jh»na the r|p»vacara jh»nas disappear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Unbounded space is
not difficult to understand. It is ëunboundedí because it has neither and end
as to its arising nor to its end, as to its disappearing - no arising, no
disappearing. Therefore it is called ëboundlessí. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Paragraph 24 ìHe
enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of boundless space.î Now we must
examine this because ëbase consisting of boundless spaceí is not an accurate
translation. What do you understand by ëbase consisting of boundless spaceí? It
really means the first ar|p»vacara jh»na and its concomitants. The first
ar|p»vacara jh»na is called ë»k»s»na“c»yatanaí. It is a long name. The word is
composed of two parts, »k»s»na“ca and »yatana. åk»s»na“ca is derived from
»k»s»nanta. This is P»ƒi grammar. åk»s»na“ca and »k»s»nanta have the same
meaning, namely, boundless space.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Now the word
ë»yatanaí means base in the sense of habitat here. So jh»na citta and its
concomitants are called ë»k»s»na“c»yatanaí because they have boundless space as
their habitat. That means as their object. It is not the base, but something
that has the base; that is what is meant by the word ë»k»s»na“c»yatanaí. The
translation of ëbase consisting of boundless spaceí is not accurate. Actually
it is something which has boundless space as a base. ëBaseí here means object.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: So this is similar to the two senses where you
talked about sa““» being both -</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Right. Because the word ë»k»s»na“c»yatanaí belongs
to a kind of compound where the compound word signifies something other than
those denoted by the individual words, not qualified by them, thereby denoting
possession, habitation and so on. This is P»ƒi grammar. The individual words
mean something and the compound word means another thing connected with them
but not them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Twenty Nine Palms
is a good example. There is a community called ëTwenty Nine Palmsí in Southern
California. Why is that city called ëTwenty Nine Palmsí? Because there are 29
palms there. Maybe there are more than 29 palms now, but that is another thing.
A city called ëTwenty Nine Palmsí means a city where there are 29 palms. So the
word ëTwenty Nine Palmsí does not mean 29 palms. It means a city where there
are 29 palms. So 29 is 29 and palms are palms. But when these words are used as
a compound, they do not mean 29 palms, but a place which has or where there are
29 palms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In the same way
»k»s»na“ca and »yatana here - ë»k»s»na“caí means boundless space and ë»yatanaí
means base. But when they are compounded and when they become a compound noun,
they do not mean ëboundless space as a baseí but they mean ësomething which has
boundless space as a baseí and ëbaseí here means object. So it is not a base,
but something which has that base. That is important. So we will have to
understand this whenever we see ëbase consisting of boundless spaceí. The other
three jh»nas are also the same. It is not ëbaseí but ësomething that has the
baseí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Sometimes the word
ë»yatanaí means<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>habitat, where something
is born, where something is found or originated like the ëbase for the
deitiesí. Do you know the ëbase for the deitiesí? Whatís that? Actually in our
countries we offer something to the deities or the spirits. We build houses for
them. That is called ëdev»yatanaí. A shrine for the deities is called
ëdev»yatanaí in P»ƒi. åyatana is that. ëHabitatí just means a place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: It can also be a tree. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Oh, yes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In paragraph 24
ìThat ëboundless spaceí is a base in the sense of habitat for the jh»na <u>whose
nature it is to be associated with it.î </u>That is not accurate. We should
strike out the words ëwhose nature it is to be associated with ití and replace
that as ëwith its associated statesí. So the sentence should read ìin the sense
of habitat for the jh»na with its associated states.î You will find these words
in paragraph 49 of this chapter. Please go to paragraph 49 and you will see
them there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: At the beginning of the paragraph?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Yes. The P»ƒi word is the same. He misunderstood
the P»ƒi word ëdhammaí. Iíve told you that the word ëdhammaí is very difficult
to translate. You cannot translate that word with one word every time that you
meet it. ëDhammaí here means just the dhamma, the states, mental states and
sometimes physical states, but here mental states. He took dhamma to mean
nature. It doesnít mean nature here. Sometimes it does mean nature as in the
words ëvaya dhamma sa~kh»raí. That means the formations have the nature of
disintegrating or the nature of disappearing. In that context the word ëdhammaí
means nature. But here sampayutta dhamma - if you are familiar with Abhidhamma,
reading P»ƒi books, you will be familiar with this word. ëSampayutta dhammaí
means associated states. So the jh»na with its associated states is called
ë»k»s»na“c»yatanaí. So not only the jh»na but the associated states as well are
called ë»k»s»na“c»yatanaí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Now we have the
second one, the base consisting of boundless consciousness. We will have to
modify that too. When you want to get the second ar|p»vacara jh»na, you find
fault with the first ar|p»vacara jh»na and so on. You practice meditation again
and again and get the second ar|p»vacara jh»na.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In paragraph 27,
the Text, ìBy completely, surmounting the base consisting of boundless space
(That means by completely surmounting the first ar|p»vacara jh»na.), then you
practice ëunbounded consciousness, unbounded consciousnessí,î he enters upon
and dwells in the base consisting of boundless consciousness.î That is a
description of the second ar|p»vacara jh»na. The second ar|p»vacara jh»na takes
the first ar|p»vacara citta as object. That is why we have here ëunbounded
consciousness, unbounded consciousnessí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>You want to
surmount the first ar|p»vacara jh»na, but you dwell upon it. You pay attention
to it and say ëunbounded consciousness, unbounded consciousnessí. Then you
surmount it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Here the word is
vi““»”a“c»yatana. So there is vi““»”a“ca and »yatana. So vi“”»”a“c»yatana comes
from vi““»”a, ana“ca and »yatana. Vi““»”a“ca is also a compound of vi““»”a and
ana“ca. ëAna“caí means boundless and ëvi““»”aí means consciousness. So we have
boundless consciousness. Here ëboundless consciousnessí means the consciousness
of the first ar|p»vacara jh»na. ëåyatanaí means a base in the sense of habitat.
Here jh»na citta and its concomitants are called ëvi““»”a“c»yatanaí because
they have boundless first ar|p»vacara citta as their habitat or as their
object. So it is not the base, but the jh»na and its concomitants which are
called ëvi““»”a“c»yatanaí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Paragraph 30 ìFor
it is said in the Vibhanga: ëUnbounded consciousness: he gives attention to
that same space pervaded by consciousness, he pervades boundlessly, hence
unbounded consciousness is saidí. But in that passage (ta— yeva »k»sa—
vi““»”ena phuta—) the instrumental case ëby consciousnessí must be understood
in the sense of accusative.î Although the case is instrumental, the meaning is
not instrumental. The meaning is accusative. Actually what is meant here is
ënot space pervaded by consciousnessí, but ëconsciousness pervading the spaceí.
That is the actual meaning that you have to take. Literally translated it means
space pervaded by consciousness. The actual meaning here however is
consciousness pervading the space. This second ar|p»vacara jh»na takes the
consciousness of the first ar|p»vacara jh»na as object, not space as object. So
here ëconsciousnessí must be understood in the accusative sense. That means he
gives attention to consciousness which pervades the space or pervading the
space. Vi““»”a“c»yatana is explained here, but should be understood according
to the explanation that I have given.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Now the third one,
nothingness. Now we come to nothingness. The third one takes the absence or the
nothingness of the first as an object. After getting the second ar|p»vacara
jh»na the meditator wants to go on to the third. In order to get the third
ar|p»vacara jh»na the meditator dwells on the absence of the first ar|p»vacara
jh»na. When he gets the second ar|p»vacara jh»na, the first ar|p»vacara is
gone. After getting the second ar|p»vacara jh»na, the first is said to be non-existent.
When he wants to get to the third ar|p»vacara jh»na, he takes that absence, the
nothingness of the first ar|p»vacara jh»na as object. That is conceptualized
nothingness. It is real nothingness. It is not like ëvoid of permanency,
happinessí and so on. In many cases when the word ëvoidí or ësu““aí in P»ƒi is
used, it means it is void of permanency and so on. But here the word is used as
void, or secluded and so on. What is meant here is that nothingness, that
non-existence, that absence of the first ar|p»vacara jh»na. So he dwells on the
absence of the first ar|p»vacara jh»na saying ëvoid, voidí or ësecluded,
secludedí. He dwells upon it again and again until he gets the third
ar|p»vacara jh»na.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>There is a simile
here ìSuppose a man sees a community of bhikkhusî and so on. Then there is the
Text and Commentary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìBy completely
surmounting the base consisting of boundless consciousness (That is the second
ar|p»vacara jh»na.), [aware that] ëThere is nothingí, he enters upon and dwells
in the ëbase consisting of nothingnessí.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìBy surmounting the
base consisting of boundless consciousness - here too the jh»na is called ëthe
base consisting of boundless consciousnessí - in the way already stated, and
its object is so-called too.î So here ëboundless consciousnessí means the jh»na
and the object of jh»na.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìIt is its ëbaseí
in the sense of locality of the species, as Kamboj» is the ëbaseí of horses.î
Kamboj» is a country maybe in the northwest of India. Good horses are said to
be raised there. You get good horses when you go to Kamboj». Nowadays what do
you say about horses? It is a place of well-bred or expensive horses? Kamboj»
is a country or a place where good horses are raised or where good horses come
from. In the same way ëbaseí or ë»yatanaí is used.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The third
ar|p»vacara jh»na and its concomitants are called ë»ki“ca““»yatanaí. There is
»ki“ca““a and »yatana. åki“ca““a comes from aki“cana. The word ëki“canaí is
translated as owning in this book (paragraph 39). Actually ëki“canaí is explained
here in the Sub-Commentary as just nothing. The word ëki“canaí has two
meanings. One meaning is concern, concern for something. That is called
ëki“canaí. One who has no concern for anything, who has no worry is called
ëaki“canaí An Arahant is described as aki“cana because he has no worry and
because he has nothing to be concerned about. That is one meaning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Here ëki“canaí, the
same word, means nothing whatsoever, not concerned, not owning. So here we say
ëaki“canaí and that means nothing, nothing, nothing. It means the state of
having nothing or simply nothingness, which here means nothingness or absence
of the first ar|p»vacara citta. ëåyatanaí means base, the same. Jh»na citta and
its concomitants are called ë»ki“ca““»yatanaí because they have nothingness or
absence of the first ar|p»vacara citta as their habitat or as their object. The
third ar|p»vacara takes the nothingness of or the absence of the first
ar|p»vacara citta as object. It is not just a base, but something that has
nothingness as a base, nothingness as an object. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>So these three
words are the same. The P»ƒi words for the first, second and third ar|p»vacara
jh»nas belong to the same kind of compound. So in the compound they mean
something other than that which is denoted by the individual words. The last
one is different.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The last one is
called ëneither perception nor non-perceptioní. It is a very strange
expression, neither perception nor non-perception. You find fault with the
third ar|p»vacara jh»na. Then you dwell upon the third ar|p»vacara jh»na saying
ëIt is good. It is peacefulí. So you take the third ar|p»vacara jh»na as object
and you say that it is good and that it is peaceful. Then you gain the fourth
ar|p»vacara jh»na.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The fourth
ar|p»vacara jh»na is called ënevasa““»n»sa““»yatanaí (neither perception nor
non-perception). That word is explained in two ways. Do you see the difference
between #1 and #2 on the sheet? The P»ƒi words are nevasa““», n»sa““a— plus
»yatana. Do they look the same to you? Do you see the difference? Where?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: the last ëAí. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: The last ëAí, right. In #1 the last ëAí is short
and in #2 the last ëåí is long. Very good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: And if you saw this, you would know that?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Yes. They can mean two quite different things, the
one with short ëAí and the one with long ëåí. Now #1 nevasa““»n»sa““a— -
ënevasa““»í means having no sa““» and ën»sa““aí means not having no sa““».<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>Now here jh»na citta and its concomitants are
called ënevasa““»n»sa““»í, not nevasa““an»sa““a. That is because they have no
gross sa““», but they are not completely without subtle sa““». ëSa““aí means
perception and ësa““»í means something that has perception. So here jh»na citta
and its concomitants are called ënevasa““»n»sa““a because they do not have
gross sa““». Yet they are not completely without subtle sa““». Here
ënevasa““»n»sa““aí means the jh»na and its concomitants. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>So in this compound
»yatana, a base, is the same as nevasa““»n»sa““a. One is the adjective of the
other. One qualifies the other. By »yatana or base are meant the jh»na citta
and its concomitants. They are called ëbaseí because they are respectively
included in the mana base and the dhamma base among the twelve bases. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>There are twelve
bases taught in Abhidhamma. Two of the bases are man»yatana (mind base) and
dhamm»yatana (dhamma base). ëMan»yatanaí just means types of consciousness.
ëDhamm»yatanaí means cetasikas and some kinds of r|pa and others. Nibb»na is
also included here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>So here nevasa““»
and n»sa““a and n»sa““a and »yatana both mean the same thing. ëN»sa““aí means
jh»na citta and its concomitants and ë»yatanaí also means jh»na citta and its
concomitants. So it is different. This compound is different. The jh»na citta
and its concomitants are called ënevasa““»n»sa““»yatanaí because they have no
gross sa““a nor do they not have subtle sa““» and at the same time they are
bases. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>This compound is
different from the other three compounds. ìUnlike the three previous words the
word ënevasa““»n»sa““»yatanaí is another kind of compound where the whole
compound means what is signified by the individual members, one qualifying the
other.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The second meaning
is ënevasa““» (neither sa““»), n»sa““» (nor non-sa““») »yatana (base). Here
ësa““»í is called ënevasa““»n»sa““»yatanaí. The whole word means sa““» here
because it is neither full sa““» nor non-sa““» and at the same time it is a
base. It cannot function as full sa““» but it is still sa““». So it is called
ënevasa““»n»sa““»í. It is sa““», but it does not function as a full-fledged
sa““». Although it does not function as full-fledged sa““», it is still sa““»,
a very subtle sa““». So it is called ënevasa““»n»sa““»yatanaí and ë»yatanaí
means the same thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìHere sa““» is
called ënevasa““»n»sa““»yatanaí because it is neither full sa““» nor non-sa““»
and at the same time it is a base or it is included in the dhamma base, or it
is dhamma base. But here the presentation is done in the terms of sa““», which
means sa““» here is representative of n»ma, and not sa““» only. Therefore we
are to understand that ënevasa““»n»sa““»yatanaí means jh»na citta and its
concomitants, not sa““» only.î So the explanations here are very complicated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The whole word
means sa““», but we must understand that it is not only sa““» that is meant.
Sa““» is meant along with the other mental states.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>In this fourth
ar|p»vacara jh»na sa““» becomes so subtle that it cannot function as full
sa““», but since there is still a form of subtle sa““», we cannot call it ëno
sa““» at allí. So it is neither sa““» nor no sa““». Then the similes are given.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: So the object is sa““»?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: No. The object of this jh»na is the third
ar|p»vacara jh»na. This fourth ar|p»vacara jh»na is called
ënevasa““»n»sa““»yatanaí. Although the word is sa““», we must understand that
it means not only sa““» but sa““» and other mental states.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The similes given
here are the smearing of oil on the bowl, and a teacher and his pupil going on
a journey and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Paragraph 52 ìBut
in this context what is perceptionís function?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>It is the perceiving of the object, and it is the production of
dispassion if [that attainment and its object are] made the objective field of
insight.î What does that mean? Now perception (sa““») - sa““»ís function is to
perceive the object. So its function here is perceiving the object. The other
function is to become the object of vipassan». That is what is meant here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìIt is the
production of dispassion if made the objective field of insight.î That means it
can produce dispassion if it is made the object of vipassan». When you practice
vipassan», you can watch sa““» itself. You see sa““» arising and disappearing,
so you become dispassioned towards sa““».</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>But it is not able
to make the function of perceiving decisive, as the heat element in tepid water
is not able to make the function of burning decisive; and it is not able to
produce dispassion by treatment of its objective field with insight in the way
that perception is in the case of other attainments.î In tepid water there is
heat element, but it is not able to burn or to heat. In the same way there is
sa““» here, but it cannot function in a decisive way or it cannot function
fully. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThere is in fact
no bhikkhu capable of reaching dispassion by comprehension of aggregates
connected with the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception
unless he has already done his interpreting with other aggregates.î There is
nobody, even if he is the Venerable S»riputta capable of reaching dispassion by
comprehension of aggregates. That means he must have practiced vipassan»
meditation and then contemplating on the impermanence, suffering and soulless
nature of things, of all phenomena group by group, one by one. Only after that
will he be capable of reaching dispassion, otherwise no. Even if he is
Venerable S»riputta, he will not be able to reach. Those words are missing
here. So we should insert the words ìThere is in fact no bhikkhu <u>even if he
is the Venerable S»riputta</u> capable of reaching dispassionî and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìAnd furthermore,
when the Venerable S»riputta, or someone very wise and naturally gifted with
insight as he was, is able to do so, even he has to do it by means of
comprehension by groups.î<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>Here also the
meaning is something like this. One who has practiced vipassan» in the usual
way (That means beginning with contemplating on the aggregates and so on.),
such a person who is a wise one, who is as wise as Venerable S»riputta, should
be able to do so only by comprehension of groups. So even if one has practiced vipassan»
meditation in the usual way beginning with the comprehension of impermanence
and so on of mind and matter, even such a person has to do it by means of
comprehension of groups, not comprehension of individual states. One must take
the whole group as an object of meditation and not the individual members. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ì ëSo it seems,
these states, not having been, come to be; having come to be, they vanishí and
not by means of [actual direct] insight into states one by one as they arise,
such is the subtlety that this attainment reaches.î Even if one is an
experienced practitioner of vipassan», one can do so only by groups, but one
cannot observe states one by one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>ìThis meaning
should be illustrated by the simile of the water on the road.î This simile is
similar to smearing the bowl with oil.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Now comes the
general explanation. First is what?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>The
first is that the ar|p»vacara jh»nas have to surmount the object rather than
the jh»na factors. That means ar|p»vacara jh»nas have different objects rather
than different jh»na factors. They have the same jh»na factors, two jh»na
factors (upekkh» and ekaggat»). All of them have two jh»na factors. So when you
want to reach the higher ar|p»vacara jh»na, you have to surmount the object and
not the factors. That means you cannot eliminate jh»na factors, but you must
surmount the object. That means you have to take another object. That is the
first one. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The second one is
in paragraph 59. It is just a simile of how one is more subtle than the other.
The example of a very fine piece of cloth weighing maybe one ounce, two ounces
and so on is given. This means that the second is more subtle than the first,
the third is more subtle than the second and so on. These are not difficult to
understand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>The next one is in
paragraph 64. The fourth ar|p»vacara jh»na takes the third ar|p»vacara jh»na as
object. When you want to obtain the fourth ar|p»vacara jh»na, you say ìOh this
third ar|p»vacara is good. It is peaceful. It is good.î You contemplate like
that. If you say that it is good and that it is peaceful, it would seem that
you are attached to it, that you like it. Right? But the answer here is ìnoî.
It is similar to you finding fault with the king. There is nothing to do. You
just follow him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>ìIt takes this
for the object since</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>There is no
other one as good,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>As men depend
upon a king,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>Whose fault they
see, for livelihood.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The person cannot get away from the king because his
livelihood depends upon the king. Although he does not like him, he has to be
with him. It is something like that. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Then the last one,
paragraph 66, gives how one has to hold on or take as object the third one. ìAs
one who mounts a lofty stair leans on its railing for a propî - so when you
climb stairs, you have to lean on the railing. ìAs one who climbs an airy peak
leans on the mountainís very topî - so when you go up a mountain, you have to
hold onto the top. ìAs one who stands on a cragís edge leans for support on his
own kneesî - sometimes you have to lean on your own knees. ìEach jh»na rests on
that below; for so it is with each of these.î One jh»na depends upon another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>So this is the end
of the fourth ar|p»vacara jh»na. I had to rush through. The explanations
sometimes are very involved. The word explanations also are complicated.
Sometimes there is some ambiguity in P»ƒi words. You can make a word mean
something other than what the word seems to mean. For example one may say this
is an adjectival compound, but I may say no that it is another kind of compound
and I can explain it. Therein lies the ambiguity of many words. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>You know we have
lost the accents in P»ƒi, but there were accents in the older Sanskrit, in
Vedic Sanskrit. In the older Sanskrit the accents differentiate words. One and
the same word can be an adjectival compound and another kind of compound. The
word is the same, but the accent may be on the first word or the second word in
the compound. By the accent they designate that this is the adjectival compound
and not any other thing. In later Sanskrit and in P»ƒi we have lost the
accents. When there is no accent, there is no way of asserting that this is
this only and not that. So there comes confusion about words. I can explain it
any way I like if I am familiar with these grammatical manipulations. Many
words are explained in that way in the Commentaries. So the word ër|pasa““»í is
made to mean the jh»nas and also the objects. So it is truly said here that it
is a play upon words. OK.</p>
