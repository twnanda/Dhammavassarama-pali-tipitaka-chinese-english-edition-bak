<body lang=EN-US style='tab-interval:.5in'>

<div class=Section1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Chapter 15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>(Tape 32 / Ps: 1-16)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We will have to go a little into chapter 15. Next we have
bases. There are twelve bases. The order given here is different from the order
given in The Manual of Abhidhamma. In the manual the six internal and the six
external are grouped together. Here they are described in pairs. Here we have
the eye base and visible data base, ear and sound, nose and odor, tongue and
flavor, body and tangible data, mind and dhamma. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then there is meaning. I want to ask you the meaning of this
expression in paragraph 3. ìIt relishes, thus it is an eye; the meaning is that
it enjoys a visible datum and <u>turns it to</u> <u>account</u>.î What is the
meaning of ëturns it to accountí? The P»ƒi word here is vibh»veti. It means to
make it clear or to show it clearly. ëEnjoys a visible datumí means make a
visible datum clearly seen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then with regard to sound: ìIt is emitted, thus it is sound;
the meaning is that it is uttered.î Herein the Visuddhi Magga the meaning is
that it is uttered. But if we take it just as it is, sadda (sound) will not
include sounds of others like sounds of trees, sounds of rivers. Because it is
said it is uttered. Sound that is uttered limits the sounds, but actually any
sound is meant here. So we have to understand in another way. That you can find
in the footnote. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next one is: ìIt smells, thus it is a nose. It is smelt;
thus it is odor.î The real meaning is that it betrays, therefore it is odor.
That is because you know where something is when you get the smell. It is like
betraying its place. You may hit something. Then somebody gets the smell and
somebody knows where it is. It is like betraying. ìIt betrays, thus it is odor.
The meaning is that it betrays its own physical basis.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These are all grammatical definitions of the words. Now the
next one. ìIt evokes life, thus it is a tongue (jivh»).î Footnote 1 ìThis is
the linguistic characteristic of the word ëjivh»í. Linguistic characteristic,
what does that mean? What the Sub-Commentary is saying - if you look at the
definition of the word jivh», you get j vita and v», not jivh». J vita is life
and v» means to call. It should be called j vita v», but it is contracted into
jivh». That is what is meant by the linguistic characteristic. It is a way of
explaining words. Instead of saying j vita v», people just say jivh».</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the bottom of paragraph 3 with regard to dhamma. ì<u>They
cause their own</u> <u>characteristic to be borne.î</u> That is incorrect.
ìThey bear their own characteristics, thus they are dhamma.î You see word
ëdh»rayantií. He took it in the causative sense, but it is not causative here
because the root here belongs to the seventh conjugation. It belongs to the
seventh conjugation. Therefore it is dh»rayati like corayati. It is not
causative. The meaning is: ìThat which bears its own characteristic is called
dhamma.î Dhamma has many meanings. I have told you this again and again. Dhamma
is here defined as that which bears its own characteristic. They bear their own
characteristics, thus they are dhammas. I donít want to say ëmental dataí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then there is the explanation of the word »yatana in P»ƒi.
The Commentators take much delight in explaining words in different ways as
much as they can. So the word ë»yatanaí can be divided into »ya and tanana and
into »yata and nayana. And so very fanciful explanations are given. That is
what he does in paragraph 4. Even if you donít understand this, I think it is
all right. They are the bases. If you know P»ƒi, itís good to read this. If you
donít know P»ƒi, it is not so helpful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this section the translator uses eye-<u>cum</u>-visible
datum, door-<u>cum</u>-objects, and so on. What is ëcumí?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: It is Latin. It means with.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Oh, eye with visible datum. We can just say ëandí,
eye and visible datum.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The word »yatana can have many meanings. The Commentator
explains »yatana according to these many meanings. Whenever you find the word
mental data, you should change to dhamma because mental data may be misleading.
In paragraph 9 mental data appears. Please change to dhammas. In that paragraph
ìAs to just so muchî - that means there are only twelve bases. Why are there
only twelve? Here the Commentary explains ìWhat is meant is this: The eye,
etc., are dhammas too (not mental data).î He misunderstands the two words - the
word ëdhammaí by itself and the word ëdhamma with »yatanaí, so dhamma and
dhamm»yatana. The word ëdhammaí just means something which bears its own
characteristic. We can translate it as state. In dhamm»yatana it is
untranslatable. He mixed these two. So here it should be: ìThe eye, etc., are
dhamma too; that being so, why is ëtwelve basesí said instead of simply ëdhamma
baseí? That means everything is called ëdhammaí. The eye is called ëdhammaí.
The ear is called ëdhammaí. Why not call all of them dhamm»yatana instead of
saying there are twelve »yatanas? Why not have only one base, the base of
dhamma? The Commentary explains here. ìInstead of simply dhamma base, it is for
the sake of defining door and object for the arising of six consciousness
groups.î That means there are six doors and there are six objects. Therefore
according to the doors and objects we have six bases, not only one base.
Because there are six doors (eye door, ear door and so on) and six
corresponding objects, so there have to be twelve bases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 10 ìFor only the eye base is the door of arising,
and only the visible-data base is the object of the consciousness group
comprised in a cognitive series containing eye consciousness.î In the next
paragraph there is another ëmental dataí that needs to be changed to ëdhammaí.
So ìBut only one part of the mind base, in other words, the life continuum
mind, is the door of arising, and only the dhamma base not common to all is
object, of the sixth [consciousness group].î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 15 ìAs to how to be seen: here, however, all
formed bases should be regarded as <u>having no provenance and no destination</u>.î
What is that? The P»ƒi word is simply ënot coming from anything and not going
to anythingí. Not coming from anything and not going to anything, they just
arise. They do not come from anything and they will not go to anything. They
just arise and they disappear. That is what is meant here. What is provenance?
Coming?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: No. Could be lineage, sort of where it came from.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: What more? Let me see. How they should be viewed.
Paragraph 16 ìThe internal bases should be regarded as an empty village because
they are devoid of lastingness, pleasure, and self; and the external ones as
village - raiding robbers because they raid the internal ones. And this is
said: ëBhikkhus, the eye is harassed by agreeable and disagreeable visible
objectsíîand so on. That is from the Sa—yutta Nik»ya. If you want to read the
whole Sutta, it is in Kindred Sayings, volume 4, page 109.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìFurthermore, the internal ones should be regarded as like
the six creatures and the external ones as like their resorts.î That is also in
Sa—yutta Nik»ya, Kindred Sayings, volume 4, page 131. The six creatures are a
snake, a crocodile, a bird, a dog, a jackal, and a monkey. Suppose a man were
to tie these creatures tightly with a rope. Then the rope is tied in the
middle. So they are tied to one place. Then let them do what they like. The
snake wants to go into a pit or hole. The bird wants to fly. The crocodile
wants to go into the water and so on. They cannot go because they are tied to
one place. The strongest among them will take the others with him. It is
something like that. The six senses are something like that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>OK. We now come to the end of the »yatanas or bases. What is
meant by dhamma base? ëEye baseí means eye sensitivity. Ear base, nose base,
tongue base, body base and then visible data base, sound base, odor base and so
on. But what is dhamma base? Do you find that? We have twelve bases - eye
base-eye sensitivity, visible data base-visible object. Itís OK. Ear-sound,
nose-smell, tongue-taste, body-tangible data. Then mind and dhamma base. ëMind
baseí means all 89 cittas. What is dhamma base?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Students: 69 things. Chapter 7.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: You have it at the end of paragraph 14. ìThe dhamma
base is of many kinds when classified according to the several (different)
individual essences of feeling, perception, formations, subtle matter, and
Nibb»na.î<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>Dhamma base is vedan», sa““»,
sa~kh»ra, subtle matter and Nibb»na. You get the same thing in the seventh
chapter of The Manual of Abhidhamma. So dhamma base means one of these things,
feeling, perception, formations. Actually feeling, perception and formations
are the 52 cetasikas. So we have cetasikas, 16 subtle matter and Nibb»na. How
many? 69, good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next time we will study elements, faculties and maybe some
truths, about 20 pages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just two days after the earthquake we come to the
description of the elements. Here Venerable ©»”amoli made many mistakes. It is
impossible to follow them. The P»ƒi word for element is dh»tu. The word ëdh»tuí
is familiar to you. The meaning of the word ëdh»tuí is explained in nine ways.
One is a little different from the other. Venerable ©»”amoli misunderstood some
words so much that it is impossible to follow him. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first meaning is those which make or create (suffering
in sa—s»ra). He uses ësort outí. I donít know what the meaning of ësort outí.
Sort out means what?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>In paragraph 20
ìThe mundane sorts (elements), when defined according to their instrumentality,
sort out the suffering of the round of rebirthsî and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Students: To seek, to find, to separate, look for. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: I see. That is not the meaning of the P»ƒi word
here. The P»ƒi word here is to make or to create. They are called dh»tus
because they make or they create suffering in sa—s»ra.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The P»ƒi word ëdh»tuí is composed of the root ëdh»í and the
suffix ëtuí. ëDh»í has many meanings. In the first definition it has the
meaning of making or creating. That is the first meaning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second meaning is those which are borne by beings.
According to the second, the root ëdh»í means to hold or to bear. Here the
meaning is passive. So those which are borne by beings are called dh»tus (eye
element, ear element and so on). We carry them, something like that, so they
are called ëdh»tusí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The third meaning is that which are mere creating or making
the suffering of sa—s»ra. Here the verbal noun or the abstract noun is used to
describe it. Here ëdh»tuí means just creating or making. That means there is no
one who creates. There is just the act of creating, just the act of making.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fourth one is those by which suffering is made or
created by beings. Here they are taken as instruments. They are instrumental
making and creating suffering by beings. That means beings create suffering
with the help of these dh»tus. By the eye, by the ear, by the nose and so on we
create suffering. The fourth one has the meaning of instrument. The meaning of
dh» is making or creating. (The video man arrived.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we only have a few students because it is just two
days after the earthquake. Many places are not back to normal yet, so people
probably couldnít come. We will carry on with our class. Today we study the
description of the elements. The P»ƒi word for element is dh»tu. That word is
explained in The Path of Purification or Visuddhi Magga. Nine explanations of
the word ëdh»tuí are given in the Visuddhi Magga. The translation is so
incorrect in this place that is impossible to follow it. So we will explain
according to what I understand to be the real meaning in the Visuddhi Magga.
The word ëdh»tuí is explained in nine ways. Please look at the sheets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first is those which make or create (the suffering in
sa—s»ra). Those are called ëdh»tusí. Here the root ëdh»í has the meaning of
making or creating. It has the active sense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second explanation is those which are borne by beings,
those which are held by beings. Here the root ëdh»í has the meaning of bearing.
And it has the passive sense. Those which are borne by beings are called
ëdh»tusí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The third is those which are mere creating or making the
suffering of sa—s»ra. Here just the abstract noun or verbal noun is used.
Although dh»tu is explained is explained in active sense or passive sense, the
real explanation or the ultimate explanation is by abstract noun. The act of
making or the act of creating is what we call ëdh»tusí. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the fourth one is those by which suffering is made or
created by beings. Here dh»tus are taken as instruments. They are instrumental
in beings making or creating suffering. We create suffering, we make suffering
occur by the help of these dh»tus, by the eye, by the ear and so on. The sense
is instrumental. I will explain to you later about this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the next one is those where suffering is stored or
placed. Here the root ëdh»í means to place, to put, to store. The sense is a
place or location. Here dh»tus are those where suffering is stored or placed.
That means we create suffering with these eyes and so on. So suffering is said
to be stored in the eye, in the ear and so on. Sometimes the Buddha said the eye
is burning, the ear is burning and so on. That means through the eye we get
akusala, through the ear we get akusala and so on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the next one is those which bear their own individual
essence. Here the root ëdh»í means to bear; to bear, to hold their own
individual essence. This is also in the active sense but it is different than
the first meaning. In the first meaning the root ëdh»í has the meaning of
making or creating. Here the root ëdh»í has the meaning of bearing. The meaning
is different although the sense is active here. There those which make or
create are dh»tu. Here those which bear their own individual essence are called
ëdh»tuí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then those that resemble dh»tus (I donít know these.) such
as, malachite, cinnabar and so on. These are in the Path of Purification. These
are parts of rocks. (Minerals found in rocks) They are called dh»tus. Just as
malachite or cinnabar are the constituents or parts of rocks, these dh»tus are
parts of ourselves. So they are called ëdh»tusí. Here it is a figure of speech
that we call them dh»tus. It is like calling an Asian, an American. Maybe he
imitates everything American and somebody says that he is an American. But he
is not an American. He is like an American. In the same way they are dh»tus
because they are like those minerals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then #8 again there are those which resemble dh»tus, such
as, chyle, blood, etc. There are said to be seven dh»tus in our bodies. I think
that we met these dh»tus in one of the previous chapters, in the part defining
the four elements. They are also called ëdh»tusí in Ayuvedic medicine they say
there are seven kinds of dh»tu in the body - chyle, blood, bone, bone marrow,
flesh, bile and semen. Just as chyle, blood and so on are part of ourselves, of
our bodies, the dh»tus, the eye, the ear and so on, are part of ourselves. So
they are called dh»tus through resemblance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The last one, #9, here we are not to follow any etymology.
It is a non-etymological meaning. The word ëdh»tuí just means no-soul. You
donít have to worry about how this word is made or from what root it is
derived. It is a word that means no-soul. These nine meanings are given in the
Visuddhi Magga.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are words in both P»ƒi language and Sanskrit language
especially nouns that are formed from roots. Roots are suffixes are combined to
form words or nouns. When they are formed, the root has one meaning and the
suffix has another meaning. For example the word ëdh»tuí - the root ëdh»í has
one meaning. That is to hold, to create, or whatever. The suffix ëtuí has
another meaning, that is that can be an agent, the active one, or that which
can be done to it, passive one, or it can show us the instrument or sometimes
it is a person to whom something is given, or sometimes it is a place or person
from whom we depart. And also sometimes it means a place. These are called in
P»ƒi s»dhanas. I donít know how to translate it into English. It is a P»ƒi and
Sanskrit grammatical term. Different nouns denote different things. I mean
there may be only one word, but that one word can mean different things
according to the meaning denoted by the suffix. According to that grammatical
teaching the word ëdh»tuí is explained here. It is not so important that you
understand all of these. If you understand that the word ëdh»tuí is used to
mean eye, ear, nose and so on, I think that is enough. But if you take delight
in knowing the etymological meaning of the word, this might be interesting.
These nine meanings are mentioned in the Visuddhi Magga.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In The Path of Purification only A-E are given, but not the
other ones. Paragraph 21 ìFurthermore, while the self of the sectarians does
not exist with an individual essence, not so these.î That should be F. A couple
of lines down ìAnd just as in the worldî, that should be G. Three or four lines
down ìor just as the generalization elementsî, that should be H. In paragraph
22 ìFurthermore, ëelementí is a term for what is soullessî - that should be I.
Those correspond to the numbers on the sheet. You may compare them later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 21 he misunderstood the word ëdh»rentií. He
took its meaning to be in the causal sense but actually it is not a causal
verb. It looks like a causal verb, a causal form. It is not really a causal
verb. ëDh»rentií just means to bear or hold. It is not cause to bear or cause
to be borne. That is a misunderstanding of the word ëdh»rentií. Paragraph 23 is
not difficult to understand. Footnote 11 is hopeless. I donít know how he
misunderstood so much in this place. So the verb ëdharenti should not be taken
in the causative sense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 24 ìAs to order: here too, from among ëorder of
arisingí, etc. mentioned above, only ëorder of teachingí is appropriate.î These
twelve are given just in the order of teaching, not according to the order of
arising, or not according to other ordersí. ìIt is set forth according to
successive definitions of cause and fruit (or cause and effect). For the pair,
eye-element and visible-data-element, are the cause and
eye-consciousness-element is the fruit. So in each case.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you look at these elements on the handout,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>the three are given in a line: eye-element,
visible-data-element and eye-consciousness element. Eye-element and
visible-data-element are said to be cause here. Then eye-consciousness element
is the fruit or effect. Eye-element and visible-data-element are conditions for
eye consciousness to arise. Only when there is eye-element or just the eye and
the visible datum can the eye consciousness arise. So eye consciousness is said
to be the result of eye-element and visible datum. This is the order here
taken. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 25 a lot of elements are mentioned. It gives us
some knowledge about, some information about the word ëelementí. The word
ëelementí is used to mean almost anything here. That is why translating the
word ëdh»tuí to mean element always is not so helpful. One may translate it as
element, but people will not understand. You can see here ìthe illumination
element, beauty element, base-consisting-of-boundless-space element,
base-consisting-of-boundless-consciousness element, base-consisting-of-nothingness
element, base-consisting-of-perception-and-feeling element, sense-desire
element, ill will element, cruelty elementî and so on. The word ëdh»tuí is made
to mean many things in the Suttas and also in Abhidhamma. The author took all
these elements from the Suttas and then explained here that all of them are the
same as or are included in one of the elements mentioned here. Only 18 are
mentioned here. But there are other things described as elements such as
illumination element, beauty element<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>and
so on. But they are not separate elements actually. They can be the same as
ones mentioned here. They can be included in one or another of the elements.
Paragraphs 26 and 27 explain this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 26 ìThe visible-data element itself is the illumination
element.î So visible data and illumination are the same here. ìThe beauty
element is bound up with visible-data and so on.î Beauty element is also<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>visible data because it is just visible data.
ìWhy? Because it is the sign of the beautiful. The sign of the beautiful is the
beauty element and that does not exist apart from visible data and so on.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>About three lines down ìAs regards the
base-consisting-of-boundless-space element, etc. (Those are the formless jh»nas
or cittas.), the consciousness is mind-consciousness element only, while the
remaining [states] are the mental-data element.î ëMental-data elementí means in
P»ƒi dhamma dh»tu. Do you see that in the second column, the last line,
mental-data-element or dhamma-element? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìConsciousness is mind-consciousness-element only, while the
remaining [states] (That means cetasikas.) are the mental-data element but the
cessation-of-perception and feeling-element does not exist as an individual
essence.î ëCessation-of-perception and feeling-elementí means a kind of
attainment (s»mapatti). When a person gets into this s»mapatti, his mental
activity is suspended. There is no mental activity during that attainment. That
is called cessation of perception and feeling. Actually not only perception and
feeling but all mental activity ceases. That attainment can be entered<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>into only by An»g»mis (Non-Returners) and
Arahants. We will have this given in detail at the end of the book. That is
just the absence of mental activity. So the absence of mental activity has no
individual essence. It is a concept. ìFor that is merely the cessation of two
elements.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now this is important. ìThe sense-desire element is either
merely the mental-data element according as it is said ëHerein, what is the
sense-desire element? It is <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†</span>thought.
Applied thought..wrong thinking, that is associated with sense desiresí.î You
know applied thought (vitakka) or we call it initial application. When it means
initial application, then it is included in dhamma element (mental data
element). Dhamma element consists of cetasikas, some r|pas and Nibb»na. It is
given on the bottom line. Dhamma base = dhamma element = cetasikas, subtle
matter, Nibb»na. There are 16 subtle material properties. These cetasikas,
subtle matter and Nibb»na are called ëdhamma baseí or ëdhamma elementí. If it
is taken to be applied thought, it is dhamma element.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìOr it is the 18 elements, according as it is said ìmaking
the Avici hell the lower limit and making the Paranimmitavasavatti (This is the
highest of the 6 celestial worlds.) deities the upper limit, the aggregates
elements, bases, materiality, feeling, perception, formations and
consciousness, that are called the ësense-desire elementí.î In this sense the
ësense-desire elementí means just the sensual sphere. You remember the 31
planes of existence. There are 11 sensual sphere existences. The 11 sensual
spheres are called sense-desire element here. It is important because in some
places Venerable ©»”amoli understood the word wrongly. So sense-desire element
can mean the 11 sense-desire realms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then the renunciation element is also mind-data-element
because it is also vitakka. ëRenunciation elementí means thinking of getting
out of sense desires. It is vitakka, so it is mental-data element. ìAlso all
profitable states are the renunciation element.î According to this definition
it is the mind-consciousness element too. All profitable states (all kusalas) -
all kusala means all kusala consciousness and mental states. They belong to
mind-consciousness element also. That means through mental-data element as well
as mind-consciousness element. That means dhamma element (mind-data element)
and mind-consciousness element.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the elements of ill will, cruelty, non-ill will,
non-cruelty, bodily pleasure, bodily pain, joy, grief, equanimity, ignorance,
initiative, launching, persistence are mental-data element too. They belong to
dhamma element.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the inferior, medium and superior are not separate
elements. They are the 18 elements. ìFor inferior eyes, etc., are the inferior
element, and medium and superior eyes, etc., are the medium and superior
elements.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 30 ìThe earth, fire and air elements (These you
know.) are the tangible-data element; the water element and the space element
are mental-data element only.î Water element and space element are included in
subtle matter. So they belong to dhamma element. ì ëConsciousness elementí is a
term summarizing the seven consciousness elements beginning with eye
consciousness. They are eye consciousness, ear consciousness, nose
consciousness, tongue consciousness, body consciousness, mind-consciousness
element, and mind element.î 17 elements and one part of the mental-data element
are the formed element.î ëFormedí means conditioned and ëunformedí means
unconditioned. All of them are formed except for Nibb»na. Nibb»na is a part of
the dhamma element. 17 other elements and part of dhamma element are formed.
ìThe unformed element is one part of the mental-data element only.î Unformed
element is a part of the dhamma element which is Nibb»na here. ìThe world of
many elements, of various elements is merely what is divided up into the 18
elements.î So the world is divided into 18 elements. They are not different
from or separate from the elements mentioned above. We have to understand that
there are other things that are called ëdh»tusí in P»ƒi. Sometimes it is very
difficult to understand when we just use the word ëelementí when we translate
dh»tu. It is the translating, but it is not so understandable. For example when
you say the sense-desire element meaning the k»m»vacara realm (the sensual
desire realm), it is very difficult to understand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìFurthermore they are stated as 18 for the purpose of
eliminating the kind of perception to be found in those who perceive a soul in
consciousness, the individual essence of which is cognizingî and so on. That
means the Buddha wanted to do away with the idea of self, the idea of soul.
That is why the Buddha mentioned these 18 elements. That is why I always say
that Abhidhamma is just one doctrine, the doctrine of anatta. In Abhidhamma
things are described as 5 aggregates, 12 bases, 18 elements, 22 faculties. In
different ways the world is analyzed, but you do not find any soul or eternal
substance. So the whole of Abhidhamma is just the doctrine of anatta.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 34 ìAs to reckoning: the eye element firstly, is
reckoned as one thing according to kind, namely, eye sensitivity. Likewise the
ear, nose, tongue, body, visible data, sound, odor and flavor elements are
reckoned as ear sensitivity and so on.î But tangible data is just the
combination of earth, fire and air element. ìThe eye consciousness element is
reckoned as two things.î The eye consciousness element means the two eye
consciousnesses. The eye consciousness element means cittas #13 and #20. So
there are two, namely, profitable and unprofitable kamma-result. #13 is result
of unprofitable and #20 is the result of profitable. In the chart at the end of
the book the numbers will be different. There the numbers are 34 and 50. He
didnít give the numbers at the beginning of the passage. I think you should put
the numbers after profitable and unprofitable kamma results. Those are the
numbers given in table 3 at the end of the book.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd likewise the consciousness elements of the ear, nose, tongue
and body.î They are the same. ìThe mind element is reckoned as three things,
namely, five-door adverting (70), and profitable (39) and unprofitable (55)
resultant receiving.î You can locate them easily because there are numbers
here. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe mental-data element as 20 things, namely, three
immaterial aggregatesî - do you know the three mental aggregates? Feeling,
perception and formations - ì16 kinds of subtle matter, and the unformed
element (That means Nibb»na.).î So mental-data element or dhamma element means
20 things here - 3 mental aggregates, 16 subtle matter and Nibb»na. The 3
mental aggregates are simply the 52 cetasikas. 52 + 16 + 1 = 69. These 69 are
called ëdhamma elementí or ëmental-data elementí. You may refer to paragraph 14
and find that dhamma base is described similarly. Actually we have to take it
to mean the same thing. ìThe dhamma base is of many kinds when classified
according to the different essences of feeling, perception, formations (Those
are the 3 aggregates.), subtle matter and Nibb»na.î These two explanations mean
the same thing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>If you want to know what
mental element or mental-data base, you may read these paragraphs. They mean
the same thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìMind-consciousness element is reckoned as 76 things.î That
means cittas apart from these ten (dvipa“cavi““»”a) and then these three
(mandh»tu). In this chart the numbers are 13-17, 20-24, and then 18, 25 and 28.
They are called ëmind-consciousness elementí. Actually they are all cittas less
the ten seeing, hearing consciousness and so on and the mind element. The mind
element consists of 28, 18 and 25. They are called ëmind elementí. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 35 ìCondition: the eye element, firstly, is a
condition, in six ways, namely, dissociation, prenascence, presence,
non-disappearance, support and faculty for the eye consciousness element.î
Please read the end of paragraph 39. ìThis is in brief. But the kinds of
conditions will be explained in detail in the description of the Dependent
Origination. So if you donít understand the conditions here like dissociation,
prenascence, presence, and so on, please be patient. These 24 conditions will
be explained in detail in the chapter on Dependent Origination. ëDissociationí
means not arising together. ëPrenascenceí means something arises before another
thing arises and it is still existing when the other one arises. Let us say #1
arises before #2 arises. And when #2 arises, #1 is still in existence. That is
called ëprenascenceí. When we see something, there is seeing consciousness. The
seeing consciousness sees the visible datum. That visible datum arises before
that moment and is still existing until the 17<sup>th</sup> moment. That is why
it is called ëprenascenceí. There is also presence. Disappearance and presence
are the same actually. And then there is support, support for eye
consciousness. In this way eye sensitivity is the condition for eye
consciousness. You will understand after we finish the chapter on Dependent
Origination. If you donít understand now, donít be depressed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 40 ëto be seení means to be viewed, how you should
view them, how you should look at them. ìHow to be seen: the meaning is that
here too the exposition should be understood as to how they are to be regarded.
For all formed elements are to be regarded as secluded from the past and
future.î That means the past cannot be seen clearly and the future also cannot
be seen clearly. Here the Commentary is talking about the present dh»tus. They
have no past and no future. Just the present ones are the real ones. They are
ìsecluded from the past and future, as void of any lastingness, beauty,
pleasure, or self, and as existing in dependence on conditions.î So we are to
view them like this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then another kind of viewing is given in paragraph 41. I
think they are good examples. ìThe eye element should be regarded as the
surface of a drum, the visible-data element as the drum-stick, the eye
consciousness as the sound.î You strike a drum and the sound arises. Sound is
like eye consciousness. The stick is like visible datum. And the eye sensitivity
is like the drum. They are good examples of the elements. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 42 ìThe mind element, however, should be regarded
as the forerunner and follower of eye consciousness, etc., as that arises.î The
mind element consists of #18, #25 (the two sampa‘icchanas) and #28
(pa“cadv»ravajjana). In the seeing thought process immediately before #13 or
#20 (eye consciousnesses) there is #28 (pa“cadv»rajjana). You may look at the
diagram of the thought process. First there is #28 (adverting) and then there is
#13 or #20 (seeing). After seeing there is receiving. Receiving is #18 or #25.
This mind element which is #18, #25 and #28 comes before and after eye
consciousness (#13 or #20). That is what the Commentary is saying here. ìThe
mind element, however, should be regarded as the forerunner and follower of eye
consciousness.î If you look at the diagram, it is very easy to see. Eye
consciousness is here. Before eye consciousness is five-sense-door adverting
(28). After eye consciousness is #18 or #25 which is receiving. So the mind
element comes before and after eye consciousness, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 43 ìThe mind consciousness element should be
regarded as a forest monkey, because it does not stay still on its object; or
as a wild horse, because it is difficult to tame; or as a stick flung into the
air, because it falls anywhere.î It should be ëanywhereí not ëanyhowí because
it falls wherever it likes. That means anywhere. ìOr as a stage dancer because
it adopts the guise of the various defilements such as greed and hate.î </p>
