<p class=MsoNormal>The next chapter is about the Dependent Origination. First
the P»ƒi word for Dependent Origination, please look at these sheets and I will
explain to you. Then we will read the book. We cannot do away with the P»ƒi
words. The word is Pa‘iccasamupp»da. In this book Pa‘iccasamupp»da is said to
mean states that are conditions. That means causes. States that are conditions
which are, namely, ignorance and so on. Before we explain this I want you to be
familiar with the formula for Dependent Origination. Depending upon ignorance
there are formations. Depending upon formations there is consciousness and so
on. In the formula there are ignorance, formations, consciousness,
mentality-materiality, six bases, contact, feeling, craving, clinging,
becoming, birth, old age and death. This sequence you have to be familiar with.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What does the word ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí mean?
ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí means the states that are conditions. That is according to
this Commentary. Then there is another word, ëpa‘iccasamuppannaí.
ëPa‘iccasamuppannaí means states that are conditioned. So they are results or
fruits. Jar», mara”a are examples. In reality all dhammas mentioned in
Pa‘iccasamupp»da are included in both. They are both pa‘iccasamupp»da and
pa‘iccasamuppanna. Only the first indicates conditions and the second the
conditioned. All those mentioned in Pa‘iccasamupp»da are interdependent. First
you should understand this. Then you may read paragraph 4.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Please go to the bottom of the handout. In the word
ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí we have the word ëupp»daí. The word ëupp»daí has three
meanings. One is that which arises. The second meaning is that which causes
others to arise. This is the causative sense. And the third meaning is just
arising. Itís an action. We call it a verbal noun. So the word ëupp»daí has
three meanings. But with regard to the word ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí only the first
two meanings are accepted and the last meaning is rejected in the Visuddhi
Magga. That rejection you can read about in paragraphs 8-13.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then let us look at the meaning of Pa‘iccasamupp»da. There
are four meanings given for Pa‘iccasamupp»da. The first meaning is that which
is to be arrived at (or known). That is the meaning of pa‘icca here. And it is
that which arises together and rightly. I put the colors to correspond with the
meanings of ësamí and ëupp»daí. The word ësamupp»daí is composed of ësamí and
ëupp»daí. ëSamí is made to mean together and rightly here. ëUpp»daí is made to
mean that which arises. ëSamupp»daí means that which arises together and
rightly. ëTogetherí means not singly - not formations only, not consciousness
only, because when consciousness arises mental factors also arise. And at the
same time there arise material properties. ëTogetherí means not singly, not one
by one. ëRightlyí means not without cause. ëRightlyí means they arise with
their respective causes, not without causes. By this definition the conditioned
states are called ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí. By this definition the results are called
ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second meaning is that which depending upon the
convergence of conditions (That is the meaning of pa‘icca.) arises together.
Here ësamí has only one meaning, together, and ëupp»daí has the meaning of that
which arises. ëPa‘iccaí means having depended upon or depending upon. By this
definition too the conditioned states (the fruits) are meant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you look at the first line you see that
ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí means states that are conditions, but here according to the
first and second meanings, ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí means results and not causes. The
Commentator, Venerable Buddhaghosa, is very persistent in making us accept that
ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí means the conditions or causes and not the effects, not the
fruits. How does he explain that with these definitions given by himself? The
first and second definitions mean the results and not the causes. So he has to
conjure up something. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although by definitions #1 and #2 ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí means
conditioned states, we are here to understand it in a figurative sense, so that
it means states that are conditions. Actually we must take it that the
conditions are meant by Pa‘iccasamupp»da even though we follow these two
definitions. How? That is explained in paragraph 16. Sometimes even in the
Texts there are sayings which are to be taken figuratively. There is a
statement for example in the Dhammapada which says ìThe appearance of the
Buddhas is bliss.î The appearance of the Buddhas is not bliss actually. It is
the cause of bliss because when Buddhas appear, people become enlightened and
so there is bliss for them. So the appearance of the Buddha is not bliss, but
the cause of bliss. But it just says ìThe appearance of the Buddha is bliss.î
Or it is like saying diabetes is sugar. Diabetes is not sugar, but it is caused
by sugar. We might say diabetes is sugar. It is something like that. Although
the word ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí means conditioned things or results, we must
understand that it means the conditions or causes and not the results. That is
explained in paragraph 16.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now let us look at the third meaning. Pa‘iccasamupp»da is
that which is to be gone towards and which originates states together. Here the
word ëupp»daí means that which causes to arise, that which produces and ësamí
means together. So that which produces things together, things that arise
together. ëThat which is to be gone towardsí, that is the meaning of the word
ëpa‘iccaí. ëWhich is to be gone towardsí really means - in Buddhism the theory
of causation is: On account of many causes, there are many results. We will
come to that later, not today. There is not one cause and one effect. There is
not one cause and many effects, nor many causes and one effect, but there are
many causes and many effects. That is what is accepted by Buddhism. So here
ëwhich is to be gone towardsí means the conditions, two or three conditions
must meet together in order to produce a result. It is like three sticks put
together. They must come together and depend upon each other in order to
produce something. That is why they are called here ëwhich is to be gone
towardsí. When they produce states, they produce states together, not one state
only. The obvious example is relinking. When kamma produces its effects, there
is relinking. ëRelinkingí means what? At the same moment there is consciousness,
there are mental factors, and there are material properties born of kamma. They
arise together. So ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí means here that which is to be gone
towards and which originates states together. By this definition what is meant?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>Causes. That is because they originate or
produce other states.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the fourth meaning is that which depending upon one
another originates evenly and together. It is more or less the same as the
third meaning. Here ësamí is made to mean two things - evenly and together. In
the book it is translated as ëequallyí. ëEvenlyí means not piecemeal, not one
and then the next one, and then the next one, but two or three things together,
so not piecemeal. And ëtogetherí means not one after the other. Whether the
product or the result is consciousness or material properties, it arises with
other things too. When consciousness arises there are mental factors too. When
material properties are produced, they are produced in what are called
ëkalapasí or ëgroupsí. They arise in groups. So they are together. They are not
produced one at a time. If there are eight properties in a kalapa, they are
produced at the same moment. They are produced evenly and they are produced
together. By this definition too the conditions are meant. So definitions #3
and #4 tell us that ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí means conditions. Here we donít have to
use the recourse of figurative usage. Here directly the word ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí
means conditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In all these definitions you see the word ëthatí. ëThatí
means group of conditions or group of states that are conditioned. The singular
number is used here although actually it means a multiplicity of conditions and
a multiplicity of states that are conditioned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What about Pa‘iccasamupp»da as a doctrine? Here ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí
means not a doctrine but causes or effects, but we call this Pa‘iccasamupp»da a
doctrine. As a doctrine what should we call it in English? It is translated as
Dependent Origination, Dependent Arising, Dependent Co-Arising. Dependent
Co-Arising is the direct translation because there is ëtogetherí. But I have
one fear of using co-arising. Somebody might take it that cause and effect
arise together. It does not necessarily mean that the cause and effect arise
together. ëTogetherí just means the effects<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>arising together in a group, not cause and effect arising together.
There is cause and there is effect. Effect consists of more than one thing.
That is what is meant by ëtogetherí in these definitions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Doesnít using the term ëdependentí make it clear?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Dependent Co-Arising.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: We often say ëco-originationí. Is that any better?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: I donít think so, because you know two meanings are
given for the word ëupp»daí here. In English we cannot have one word which
means these two things. So we have to choose ëarisingí or ëoriginationí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Donít we say clinging arises from craving? Thatís
not a causal relationship? You are saying that is not a causal relationship?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: There is a causal relationship between these, but
sometimes - There are links - ignorance and formations, formations and
consciousness and so on. Some relations are as producer and produced. Most of
the relationships are like arising together and helping each other. So
ëco-arisingí can mean cause and effect arising together, but not always.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: You mean that sometimes they arise separately?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Thatís right. Yes. Letís say that we take the
relationship between mental formations and consciousness. ëMental formationsí
here means kamma. ëConsciousnessí means resultant consciousness. They belong to
different times. So they do not arise together. They are related as cause and
effect. Consciousness and n»ma-r|pa (mentality-materiality) arise together.
Consciousness and mentality-materiality arise together. Their relationship is
not one of producer and the produced. It is a relationship of helping each
other. That is why it is important to understand the Pa‘iccasamupp»da with
reference to the Pa‘‘h»na. That is why Pa‘‘h»na is given in this book. We will
come to this later. Only when you understand with reference to Pa‘‘h»na, do you
really understand Pa‘iccasamupp»da. Otherwise there may be something missing in
your knowledge or understanding of Pa‘iccasamupp»da.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We think when we say when there is ignorance, there are
formations; when there are formations there is<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>consciousness, we normally think that one is caused by the other, but it
is not the case with every link. Some links are related as cause and effect. Some
are not related as cause and effect, but just support each other. It is like a
group of people doing the same work. They help each other. They support each
other and do the work. Those relationships are to be understood with reference
to Pa‘‘h»na, the 24 causal relations given in this chapter. This is the
background understanding. Then we can go to the chapter itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraphs #16, #17, #18 and so on if it is difficult to
understand, come back here (to the handout). There are so many parentheses,
brackets, P»ƒi words that it is difficult to read. We will continue next week. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: The 24 conditions?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: We may not reach the 24 conditions next week. But
you can find them beginning with paragraph 66.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We will start from the beginning of this chapter again. I
will go over briefly the topics here. Paragraph 2 states what is meant by the
P»ƒi word ëPa‘iccasamupp»da (Dependent Origination)í. Here it says that the
word ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí means ignorance and so on, the causes or conditions.
Then paragraph 3 states that the P»ƒi word ëpa‘iccasamuppannaí means the
conditioned states or the results beginning with aging and death, and then
again ignorance and so on. Both just mean ignorance and the others mentioned in
the formula. The word ëDependent Originationí means the causes and the word
ëdependently originated statesí means the conditioned states. In paragraph 4 it
is re-stated that ëDependent Origination (Pa‘iccasamupp»da)í means the
conditions and that ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí means the conditioned states. And then
paragraph 5 gives the scriptural proof for taking Dependent Origination as
conditions and dependently originated states as the conditioned states. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Towards the end of paragraph 5 the second quotation ìSo,
bhikkhus, that herein which is reality, not unreality, not otherness, specific
conditionality: that is called ëDependent Originationí.î In describing
Dependent Origination Buddha used these words - reality, not unreality, not
otherness, specific conditionality. These words are explained in paragraph 6.
ìBecause particular states are produced by particular conditions, neither less
nor more, it is called ërealityí (suchness)î and so on, not unreality, not
otherness. The last one is specific conditionality. The word ëtotalí in this
paragraph means a group or a multitude of conditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 7 explains the word ëidappaccayat»í. It is very
difficult to understand if you donít know P»ƒi or if you donít read the
original P»ƒi passage. In the word ëidappaccayat»í there are two words - ëidaí
and ëpaccay»í. ëIdaí means this. ëPaccay»í means condition. ëIdaí here means of
these and ëpaccay»í means conditions. So we get<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>conditions of these or conditions for these. That is the literal meaning
of the word ëidappaccay»í, condition for those. Actually ëidaí means these, not
those. If you know P»ƒi, you will understand. Then there is ët»í at the end of
the word. That ët»í is first explained to have no specific meaning and second
to have the meaning of total or multitude. So idappaccay» and idappaccayat»
have the same meaning according to the first explanation. In the second
explanation ëidappaccay»í means conditions for those and ëidappaccayat»í means
a total of or a multitude of conditions for those. The suffix ët»í at the end
of the word has two meanings. One is no specific meaning. The other is a group,
or a total, or a multitude. The first sentence in paragraph 8 ìThe characteristic
must be sought from grammarî should be at the end of paragraph 7. Here
ëcharacteristicí just means the grammatical rule. The rule should be sought
from grammar because he was saying the suffix ët»í has no meaning or it has the
meaning of multitude. It needs to be explained with reference to grammar. So if
you want to understand clearly with reference to grammar, you go to grammar
books and find the characteristic, that is find that grammatical rule. So this
sentence should be at the end of the seventh paragraph, not at the beginning of
the eighth paragraph. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then in paragraph 8 ìSome, <u>in fact</u>, sayî and so on -
I think we should say ëhoweverí instead of ëin factí. ìSome, however, say.î In
this paragraph the author refutes the opinion of other teachers that the word
ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí means just arising, not conditions or conditioned things,
but just arising. Some teachers take this word to just mean arising. The author
takes it to mean the conditioning things. That is the difference. That opinion
is refuted. The author gives four reasons for refuting that opinion. The word
ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí does not mean just arising, but it also means some states
that arise and some states that cause to arise. Actually some states that cause
to arise is what is ultimately taken here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are four reasons given. ìThere is no such Sutta.î That
means it has no support in the Suttas. There is no Sutta to support the
statement that Pa‘iccasamupp»da is just arising. There is no Sutta to support
it. That is the first reason. The second is: ìIt contradicts Suttas.î Then the
details will come later. If one takes Pa‘iccasamupp»da to just mean arising,
there is contradiction with some Suttas. The third reason is: ìIt admits of no
profound treatment.î If one says that Pa‘iccasamupp»da is just arising, then it
would not be profound. The fourth is: ìIt is ungrammatical.î According to P»ƒi
grammar you cannot take it to mean just arising. These four reasons are given. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now the detailed explanation follows. ì(1) No Sutta
describes the Dependent Origination as simple arising. (2) Anyone who asserts
that Dependent Origination is of that kind involves himself in conflict with
the Padesavih»ra Sutta.î Actually in the Suttas we do not find the Padesavih»ra
Sutta. ìThen in the first watch of the night the Blessed One brought to mind
the Dependent Origination, in direct and reverse order.î Immediately after his
enlightenment the Buddha stayed under the Bodhi Tree. When staying under the
Bodhi Tree, he reflected upon Dependent Origination in direct order and reverse
order. ìNow ëPadesa-vih»raí is the abiding in one part of that, according as it
is said, ëBhikkhus, I abode in a part of the abiding in which I abode when I
was newly enlightenedí and there he abode in the vision of structure of conditions
( ëStructure of conditionsí means Pa‘iccasamupp»da.) not in the vision of
simple arising, according as it is said, ëSo O understood feeling with wrong
view as its condition, and feeling with right view as its condition, and
feeling with wrong thinking as its condition..í all of which should be quoted
in full.î It is, called ëpadesaí. ëPadesaí means ëin partí, not ëin fullí.
ëVih»raí means abiding. So we get abiding in part. It is called ëabiding in
partí because if you look at the quotation ìSo I understand feeling with wrong
viewî and so on, Buddha dwelt on feeling only here, not on the whole of
Pa‘iccasamupp»da. That is why it is called ëabiding in partí. It is reflection
in part, not reflection on the whole of Pa‘iccasamupp»da. He reflected on only
one part of Pa‘iccasamupp»da. That is why it is called P»ƒi ëpadesa-vih»raí. It
is said here that Buddha did not reflect upon just arising, but upon the things
that arise. That is why it contradicts the Sutta if we take ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí
to mean just mere arising.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThere is likewise contradiction of the Kacc»na Sutta.î This
Sutta is found in Sa—yutta Nik»ya. ìWhen a man sees correctly with right
understanding the origin (not <u>origination</u>) of the<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>world, Kacc»na, he does not say of the world
that it is not.î It is origin of the world, not origination, not arising. The
word used there is lokasamudaya. ëSamudayaí can mean origination as well as
something that originates. Here what is meant is something that originates. So
it is understanding of the origin of the world. If we take the translation
ëoriginationí as correct, then it accords with what other teachers say.
ëUnderstanding the origination of the worldí means understanding the arising of
the world. So here it should be understanding the origin of the world or that
which causes the world to arise. That is lobha. There would be contradiction
with this Sutta too, if we take ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí to just mean arising. ìAnd
there it is Dependent Origination in forward order, not simple arising, that,
as the origin (not <u>origination</u>) of the world and as the conditions of
the world (not <u>from its</u> conditions), is set forth in order to eliminate
the annihilation view.î This Sutta is set forth in order to eliminate the view
that everything is annihilated at death. ìFor the annihilation view is not
eliminated by seeing simple arising.î You cannot get rid of the annihilation
view just by seeing simple arising. ìBut it is eliminated by seeing the chain
of conditions (That means one condition after another arising and then the things
that are conditioned. ëChain of conditionsí really means uninteruptedness of
conditions) ìas a chain of fruits following on a chain of conditions. So anyone
who asserts that the Dependent Origination is simple arising involves himself
in contradiction of the Kacc»na Sutta.î You will contradict the Kacc»na Sutta
if you take it that ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí means just simple arising.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next one is: ì (3) It admits of no profound treatment.î
Just to see arising is not difficult, but to see that there are conditions and
that these conditions give rise to conditioned states, that is difficult. Just
to see the arising is not difficult and not profound. Buddha said to ånanda in
the Mah» Parinibb»na Sutta ìThis Dependent Origination is profound, ånanda, and
profound it appears.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd the profundity is fourfold as we shall explain below
(That is towards the end of the chapter.); but there is none of that in simple
arising. And this Dependent Origination is explained [by the teachers] as
adorned with the fourfold method; but there is no [need of] any such tetrad of
methods in simple arising. So Dependent Origination is not simple arising since
that admits of no profound treatment.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fourth reason is: ìIt is ungrammatical.î In order to
understand this you have to understand P»ƒi grammar. Pa‘icca is a gerund, so it
means having depended upon. Then ësamupp»daí means arising, or that which
arises, or that which causes to arise. When there is a gerund like pa‘icca,
having done something, then because a gerund is a verbal noun, there must be
two verbs in such a sentence. Here ëhaving depended uponí is one verb and there
must be another verb, the principal verb. So there are two verbs, the principal
verb and the secondary verb. These two verbs must have one and the same
subject. That is what the author is saying here. ìThis word ëpa‘icca (literally
ëhaving dependedí, freely ëdue toí, ëdependentí), [being a gerund] establishes
a meaning [<u>in a</u> <u>formula of establishment by verb</u>] when it is
construed as past with the same subject.î ëPastí means it shows the past time.
Let us say that you say ìHaving come here, I study.î Your coming is past. It
happens before your study takes place. The secondary verb signifies a time in
the past. The principal verb may signify any time. Sometimes it is past,
sometimes it is the present and so on. ìWhen it is construed as past with the
same subject [as that of the principal verb], as in the sentence ëHaving
depended on the eye and visible objects, eye consciousness arisesí.î Having
depended upon eye and visible objects, eye consciousness arises - here eye is
subject of both ëarisesí and ëhaving depended uponí. ìBut if it is construed
here with the word ëupp»daí (arising), [which is a noun], in a formula of
establishment by noun, there is a breach of grammar, because there is no shared
subject (or one and the sane subject) [as there is in the above quoted
sentence], and so it does not establish any meaning at all.î If you take
ëupp»daí to mean just arising, then ëhaving depended upon there is arisingí or
ëhaving depended upon arisingí - so there is the subject ëarisingí and the verb
ëhaving depended uponí, but no principal verb. So it is against the rules of
P»ƒi grammar<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>or Sanskrit grammar to say
just ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí. ëHaving depended upon arisingí makes no sense. That is
why it says that it does not establish any meaning at all. ìSo the Dependent
Origination is not simple arising because that is ungrammatical.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now there are some words in this paragraph to be discussed.
In brackets we have ìin a formula of establishment by verb.î Do you understand
that? ëIn a formula of establishment by verbí just means a verbal noun.
Samupp»da is a verbal noun. A verbal noun signifies the action rather than the
actor or agent. According to the view of the author samupp»da is that which
arises or which causes to arise, but the other teachers take it to mean just
arising, the action of arising. That is called in P»ƒi ëbh»vas»dhanaí (in a
formula of establishment by verb). I think it is just called a verbal noun or
gerund. It is words like going, coming, studying, writing. Letís call it a
verbal noun. The word ësamupp»daí, the other teachers take it to be a verbal
noun. So it means just arising according to them. But the author takes to be
not a verbal noun, but a noun denoting an agent, denoting something that arises
or something that causes to arise. That is the difference between the two
opinions. So it is ungrammatical. So ëPaticcasamupp»daí as having depended upon
arising makes no sense. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then in paragraph 13 the others said what if we were to add
the words ëcome to beí at the end, in P»ƒi ëpa‘icca, samupp»do hotií. ëHotií
means ëcomes to beí. Hoti is now the principal verb. Now there is hoti as the
principal verb. Upp»da is the common subject. ìNow it is all rightî they said.
The author said ìThat will not do. Why not? Because there is no instance in
which it has been added.î That means there is no instance where ëcome to be
(hoti)í is added. The author will give the quotation below. There is no
instance where it is added. So there is no possibility of adding that word.
ìFor in such passages as ëPa‘iccasamupp»da— vo bhikkhave desess»me. Katamo ca
bhikkhave pa‘iccasamupp»do..Aya— vuccati bhikkhave pa‘iccasamupp»do (I shall
teach you the Dependent Origination, bhikkhus. And what is the Dependent
Origination? ..This is called the Dependent Origination, bhikkhusí, the words
ëcome to be (hoti) are not added in a single instance.î So you cannot add the
expression ëhotií there. ìAnd there is no [such expression as] ëarising comes
to beí: if there were, it would be tantamount to saying that arising itself had
an arising too.î Arising arise. Arising comes to be. Arising arises. So that is
rejected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then there are other people. ìAnd those are wrong who
imagine that specific conditionality is the specific conditionsí [abstract]
essence.î You saw this word ëidappaccayat»í in paragraph #6 and especially
paragraph #7. There the author explains that the word ëidappaccayat»í means
conditions or group of conditions. But here the other teachers say what if we
take ëidappaccayat»í to mean the abstract essence of things, not group of
conditions, not just conditions, but their particular mode, their particular
mode in causing other states to arise. That is what the other people would say.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd those are wrong who imagine that specific
conditionality (idappaccayat») is the specific conditionsí [abstract] essence -
what is called ëabstract essenceí being a [particular] mode in ignorance, etc.,
that acts as cause in the manifestation of formations, etc. (or in making
formations, etc. appear) - and that the term ëDependent Originationí is used
for that particular mode in formations.î I want to say just that. ìThat the
term ëDependent Originationí is used for that particular mode in formations.î
It means just the mode and not the formations themselves. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the author says that they are wrong. ìWhy are they
wrong? Because it is ignorance, etc., themselves that are called causes. For in
the following passage it is ignorance, etc., themselves, not their alteration
(ëAlterationí means particular mode.) so their particular mode, that are called
the causes [of these states].î Then he gives a quotation. In this quotation
ignorance, etc., are called ëcausesí, not ëtheir particular modeí. So to say
that ëidappaccayat»í means particular mode also is not correct.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From paragraph 15 onwards we have the word meaning of
Pa‘iccasamupp»da. ìIf any notion arises in the guise of a literal
interpretationî - that means just taking the appearance of the word. The word
ësamupp»daí seems to mean just ëarisingí. If you take the appearance of that
word to be your interpretation, then it is wrong. ìIf any notion arises in the
guise of a literal interpretation of the term ëDependent Origination
(Pa‘iccasamupp»da)í to the effect that it is only arising that is stated, it
should be got rid of.î If you still have the opinion that ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí
just means arising, depending upon the appearance of the word ësamupp»daí
(because words such as samupp»da must mean actions rather than actors or rather
than agents). So if you cannot still get rid of that opinion that
ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí means arising, then read further, read on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Four meanings of the word ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí are given in
the coming paragraphs. I think that I have explained them to you following this
sheet. So I will not repeat them now. In paragraph 16 you find the first and
second meaning of Pa‘iccasamupp»da. Directly according to these two meanings
the conditioned states are meant as Pa‘iccasamupp»da, but we are to understand
that the conditioning states are meant here according to the figurative sense.
That means something like sugar has diabetes, salt is high blood pressure and
so on. Here although the direct meaning is the conditioned states, we are to understand
that they mean the conditioning states.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 18 we have the third meaning. According to that
the states that are conditions are meant. Then the fourth meaning is given in
paragraph 20. According to that too the conditions are meant, not the states
that are conditioned. So there are four meanings of Pa‘iccasamupp»da according
to Venerable Buddhaghosa. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then he explained that there are two parts - pa‘icca and
samupp»da (dependent upon and that which arises). By the word ëpa‘iccaí the
belief in eternalism and others are destroyed. By the word ësamupp»daí the
belief in annihilation and so on is destroyed. By the word ëpa‘iccaí belief in
eternalism is destroyed and by the word ësamupp»daí the belief in annihilation
is destroyed. By the whole word ëPa‘iccasamupp»daí the Middle Path is shown.
You may remember that in the first sermon the Buddha said: ìNot approaching to
either extreme I have discovered the Middle Path.î Here also Pa‘iccasamupp»da
is the Middle Path. The extremes are eternalism on the one hand and
annihilationism on the other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 25 we find the preamble. Here the author states
that Pa‘iccasamupp»da is difficult to understand, difficult to talk about or to
teach. ìIts meaning should be commented on by one who keeps within the circle
of the Vibhajjav»dins (That means Therav»da Buddhists.), who does not
misrepresent the teacher, who does not <u>advertise</u> <u>his own standpoint</u>.î
I do not think it is correct. ëWho does not overstep his own traditioní is
better, it is not ëadvertise his own standpointí. The P»ƒi word here is
avokamantena. That means not going out of oneís own tradition. ìWho does not
quarrel with the standpoint of others, who does not distort the Suttas, who is
in agreement with the Vinaya, who looks to the Principal Authorities
(Mah»padesa)î - they are very famous in the teachings of the Buddha. You find
these Mah»padesa in two places. One place is the D gha Nik»ya. That is the
Mah»parinibb»na Sutta. In the English translation the page number is 133, in
Dialogues of the Buddha, volume 2. There is another set of Mah»padesa in
Vinaya. If you are interested I can give you the reference, Book of Discipline,
part 4, page 347. These two sets are different. They are not the same ones.
They are different sets of Principal Authorities. ìWho illustrates the law, who
takes up the meaning, repeatedly reverting to that same meaning, describing it
in various different waysî and so on - then he quotes the ancient saying that
there are four things which are difficult to see and that are also difficult to
teach. They are the Four Noble Truths, about a being, about rebirth, and about
Pa‘iccasamupp»da (the structure of conditions).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìTherefore, considering that to comment on the Dependent
Origination is impossible except for those who are expert in the texts.î There
is something missing here. The P»ƒi word used here is »gamadhigamapatahi.
ëågamaí means learning and ëadhigamaí means enlightenment. So that is those who
have learning and also those who are enlightened. Only those can understand and
explain Pa‘iccasamupp»da fully. So we should add some words here. ìTherefore,
considering that to comment on the Dependent Origination is impossible except
for those who are expert in the Texts and who have gained enlightenment.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the author said he could not find a footing for support
in the <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>ocean</st1:PlaceType> of <st1:PlaceName>Pa‘iccasamupp»da</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>.
So he almost gave up actually. He almost gave up commenting on
Pa‘iccasamupp»da. Then he said:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>ìHowever, many
modes of teaching</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††††† </span>Grace the
Dispensation here,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††††† </span>And still the
former Teachersí way </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††††† </span>I handed down
unbrokenly,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††††† </span>Therefore on
both of these relying</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††††† </span>For my
support, I now begin</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††††† </span>Its meaning to
elucidate.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So I will comment upon this relying on the former Teachersí
way handed down unbrokenly and also relying on the teachings of the Buddha.
Then we come to the brief exposition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are different ways of teaching. Buddha taught
Pa‘iccasamupp»da in different ways. In what ways? Sometimes from the beginning.
The Buddha would teach ignorance and then go to formations, consciousness and
so on. Sometimes he taught from the middle up to the end. He would start in the
middle and go to the end. Sometimes he taught from the end back to the
beginning. And sometimes he taught from the middle down to the beginning. Letís
say ëupí to the beginning. Buddha taught in different ways this
Pa‘iccasamupp»da. Then the quotations are given how taught them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 29 ìSo, bhikkhus, with ignorance as condition
there are formations; .. with birth as condition aging and death.î That is the
normal sequence of teaching. Then the second one ìWhen he is delighted with,
welcomes remains committed to, that feeling, then delight arises in him.î He
picks up feeling here. ìDelight in feelings is clinging. With his clinging as
condition there is becoming; with becoming as condition, birth.î He picks up
feeling and then goes to the end. In the third ì ëWith birth as condition,
aging and deathíî, so it is said. But is there aging and death with birth as
condition, or not, or how is it here? - There is aging and death with birth, as
condition, so we think, venerable sir. ëWith becoming as condition, birthí, and
so on.î So he picks up something at the end and then goes back to the
beginning. The fourth is to pick up something up in the middle and going to the
end. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìCraving: what is its source? Feeling. What is its source?
Contact. What is its source? The sixfold basesî and so on. In different ways
the Buddha taught this Doctrine of Pa‘iccasamupp»da. If you read the Suttas,
you will find these.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìWhy does he teach it thus? Because the Dependent
Origination is wholly <u>beneficial</u> (I think the word is something like
gracious, not beneficial.) because it is gracious in all aspects and because
Buddha himself has acquired elegance in instruction or teaching.î These are the
two reasons that he taught in this way. ìFor the Dependent Origination is
entirely gracious (not beneficial); starting from any one of the four starting
points, it leads only to the penetration of the proper way.î That means it
really leads to the proper penetration of the way. ìAnd the Blessed One has
acquired elegance in instructing: it is because he has done so through
possession of the four kinds of perfect confidence and the four discriminations
and by achieving the fourfold profundity that he teaches the Law by various
methods.î He taught by various methods because he has elegance in instructing.
He was very expert in teaching. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBut it should be recognized, in particular, that when he
sees that people susceptible of teaching are confused about the analysis of the
causes of the process [of becoming], he employs his teaching of it forwards
starting from the beginningî and so on. This is the detailed explanation of the
elegance in teaching. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 36 ìBut why is ignorance stated as the beginning
here?î In the formula for Dependent Origination ignorance is the first one,
right? So why is ignorance stated at the beginning here? ì<u>How then</u> is it
the causeless root-cause of the world like the Primordial Essence of those who
assert the existence of a Primordial Essence?î I think the words ëhow thení are
not good here. I would say ìIs ignorance also the causeless root-cause of the
world like the Primordial Essenceî and so on. It is stated at the beginning of the
formula. So that means that ignorance is the first cause? The Primordial
Essence comes from the Samkhya philosophy of Hinduism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIt is not causeless. For a cause of ignorance is stated
thus ëWith the arising of cankers there is the arising of ignoranceí.î So
ignorance also has its cause. It is put at the beginning of Pa‘iccasamupp»da
because it is the outstanding cause of kamma. We will find that in paragraph
38. Although ignorance is put at the beginning of the formula, it is not a
first cause or is not without a cause.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBut why does the Blessed One give the exposition of the
round with those two things as starting points?î When Buddha taught
Pa‘iccasamupp»da, he took two things, two dhammas, as the outstanding causes of
kamma. One is ignorance (avijj») and the other is craving (ta”h»). ìBecause
they are the outstanding causes of kamma that leads to happy and unhappy
destinies.î Because of ignorance you do something wrong or you do something
good, and that leads to j»ti or rebirth. Also because of craving we want to be
reborn in a better world, thinking that a good destiny is a good place to go to
although according to the Buddha it is full of suffering. Because of the
craving for a better life we do something good. As a result of that we will be
reborn there. After rebirth there, there is aging, death, suffering and so on.
These are the two main or outstanding causes of kamma. So the Buddha gave the
exposition of the round of rebirth with these as the starting points. There are
times when he begins with ignorance and sometimes he begins with craving.
Sometimes the Buddha taught ignorance as the condition for the round of rebirth
and sometimes craving.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then in paragraph 43 we have as to meaning. Here comes some
strange explanations of the word. ìAs to the meaning of the words ëignoranceí
and so on. Bodily misconduct, etc., <u>for example</u>î - I think ëfor exampleí
is not good here. We may say ënamelyí. ìBodily misconduct, etc., are called
those that ëought not to be <u>found</u>í (or that ought not be acquired), in the
sense of being unfit to be <u>carried out</u> (unfit to practice); the meaning
is that it should not be <u>permitted</u> (It should not be acquired, it should
not be got.).î Here you see the P»ƒi word ëavindiyaí. ëVindiyaí means to
obtain, to acquire, to get. So ëavindiyaí means not to get, not to obtain, not
to acquire. He is explaining the word ëavijj»í in P»ƒi. ìIt finds (vindati)
what ought not to be found, thus it is ignorance. Conversely, good bodily
conduct, etc..are called that which ought to be found (that ought to be
acquired). It does not find what ought to be found, thus it is ignorance. I
think this is just a play on words. Avijj» is here derived from the root ëvidí.
ìConversely, good bodily conduct, etc., are called those that ëought to be
foundí. It does not find what ought to be found, thus it is ignorance. Also it
prevents knowing the meaning of collection in the aggregates, the meaning of
actuating in the bases, the meaning of voidness in the elements, the meaning of
predominance in the faculties, the meaning of reality in the truths, thus it is
ignorance.î Here the root is made to mean ëto knowí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†</span>ìAlso it prevents
knowing the meaning of suffering, etc., described in four ways as ëoppressioní,
etc., thus it is ignorance. Through all the kinds of generations, destinies,
becoming, stations of consciousness, and abodes of beings in the endless round
of rebirths it drives beings on (Anta VIrahite sa—s»re JAv»peti).î This is
something like an acronym. The word ëavijj»í is an acronym. We take the capitol
letters and get AVIJA. Sometimes the Commentators are very fond of explaining
words in this way. ìThus it is ignorance. Amongst women, men, etc., which are
in the ultimate sense non-existent, it hurries on (paramatthato AVIJjam»nesu
itthi-puris»disu JAvati), and amongst the aggregates, etc., which are existent,
it does not hurry on (VIjjam»nesu pi khandh»disu nA JAvati). I think ëVIí
should be in capitol letters, and in ënaí the letter ëAí should be a capitol
letter, and in ëjavatií ëJAí should be capitol letters. So here you have to
transpose. We have VI-A-JA. You put the ëAí at the beginning and there is
AVIJA. ìThus it is ignorance. Furthermore, it is ignorance because it conceals
the physical bases and objects of eye consciousness, etc., and the Dependent Origination
and dependently originated states.î The last one is just the meaning of the
word ëavijj»í, and I think that is quite enough. The others are just showing
off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we come to the word ëpaccayaí. ìThat due to which fruit
comes is a condition.î Paccaya is defined as that. ì ëDue to (pa‘icca)í = ënot
without thatí; the meaning is, not dispensing with it. ëComes (eti)í means both
ëarisesí and ëoccursí. What do you understand by ëarisesí and ëoccursí?
ëArisesí means arises and ëoccursí means continues to exist, not occurring
actually. ëComesí means both ëarisesí and ëcontinues to exist for some timeí.
That is what is meant by the P»ƒi word ëpavattaí. They seem to mean the same
thing here in English. It is ëarisesí and ëcontinues to existí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìFurthermore the meaning of ëconditioní is the meaning of
ëhelpí.î ëPaccayaí means help. ìIt is ignorance and that is a condition, thus
it is ëignorance as conditioní.î This is giving the meaning of the P»ƒi word
ëavijj»paccay»í. ëAvijj»paccay»í means ëwith ignorance as conditioní, whence
the phrase ëwith ignorance as conditioní. This is the explanation of the P»ƒi
word ëavijj»í. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next is the explanation of the word ësa~kh»raí. Here
sa~kh»ra is said to have divisions. The three divisions are formations of
merit, formations of demerit and formations of the imperturbable. This is one
set of three. Another set of three is the bodily formations, the verbal
formations and the mental formations. All together there are six. These six are
formations with ignorance as condition. When we see the word ësa~kh»raí, we
have to understand whether this is sa~kh»ra with ignorance as condition or
sa~kh»ra given in the Texts, formations with the word ësa~kh»raí.î All these
are simply mundane profitable and unprofitable volition. ìThese, all six, just
mean cetan» (volition), mundane kusala or akusala. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBut these four, namely, (1) the formation consisting of the
formed (sa~khata-sa~kh»ra), (2) the formation consisting of the kamma-formed
(abhisa~khata-sa~kh»ra), (3) the formation consisting in the act of
kamma-forming (ëKamma-formingí means formed by kamma or caused by kamma -
abhisa~khara”a-sa~kh»ra), and (4) the formation consisting in momentum (That
means ëconsisting in engagingí or ëconsisting in effortí - payog»bhisa~kh»ra)
are the kinds of formations that have come in the Texts with the word
ëformationsí.î There are different kinds of formations that are explained here.
Basically there are two kinds of sa~kh»ras. The first kind of sa~kh»ra you find
with the word ëavijj»paccay» sa~kh»r»í. Then the other kind of sa~kh»ra is
whenever else you find the word ësa~kh»raí. So you have to find out which
sa~kh»ra is meant. There are many kinds of sa~kh»ra - sa~khata-sa~kh»ra,
abhisa~khata-sa~kh»ra, abhisa~khara”a-sa~kh»ra, payog»bhisa~kh»ra.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ì(1) All states with conditions, given in such passages as
ëFormations are impermanentí, are formations consisting of the formed.î That
means all conditioned things, mental as well as physical. ì(2) In the
Commentaries material and immaterial<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>states of the three planes generated by kamma are called ëformations
consisting of the kamma-formedí.î That means those conditioned by kamma, those
caused by kamma, both material and immaterial states. They are called
ësa~kh»rasí in the Commentaries. ìThese are also included in the passage
ëFormations are impermanentí.î When the Buddha said that formations are
impermanent, these are also meant. ìBut there is no instance in the Texts where
they are found separately.î In the Texts or in the Suttas they are not
mentioned separately. That means there is no instance in the Texts of sa~kh»ra
meaning them only. When you find the word ësa”kh»raí it will means these things
as well as other conditioned states. ì(3) Profitable and unprofitable volition
of the three planes is called ëthe formation consisting in the act of
kamma-formingí.î That just means kamma, profitable and unprofitable cetan». ìIt
is found in the Texts in such passages as ëBhikkhus, this man in his ignorance
forms the ëformation of merití. (4) But it is <u>bodily</u> and mental energy
that is called ëthe formation consisting in momentum. This is given in the
Texts in such passages as ëThe wheel having gone as far as the impetus carried
it, stood as though it were fixedí.î Bodily and mental energy - the P»ƒi word
ëviriyaí always means mental energy. Viriya is one of the 52 cetasikas. But
here bodily and mental energy, bodily viriya and mental viriya - what is bodily
viriya? The Sub-Commentary explains that ëbodily viriya (bodily energy, bodily
effort)í means the mental effort which causes bodily effort. Sometimes mental
effort may not cause bodily effort. So here ëbodily effortí actually means
mental effort (viriya) which causes bodily actions to arise. So there are
different kinds of sa~kh»ras to be understood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd not only these, but many other kinds of formations are
given in the Textsî and so on. Whenever you find the word ësa~kh»raí, you have
to be very careful. In this quotation the words used are ëverbal formationí,
ëbodily formationí, and ëmental formationí. They are not the same as the
formations given in paragraph 45. They are different. These 6 formations given
in paragraph 44 and paragraph 45, the details about them we will find in
paragraph 61. So the verbal, bodily and mental formations in paragraph 47 are
different that those in paragraphs 44 and 45. Here in paragraph 47 ëverbal
formationí means vitakka and vic»ra. ëBodily formationí means breathing.
ëMental formationí means cetasikas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the other words are explained beginning with paragraph
48 - vi““»”a, n»ma, r|pa and so on. At the very end of paragraph 48 ìGreat
misery is despair.î Please note that there are two words in P»ƒi »y»sa and
up»y»sa. ëåy»saí means misery and ëup»y»saí means great misery. ëUpaí
intensifies or means great. Great misery is despair. Bhuso »y»so up»y»sa.
ëBhusoí means great or it intensifies. I tell you this because we will find a
reference to this later on. ì ëThere isí means ëis generatedí.î Beginning with
paragraph 51 the characteristic and others are given for each factor. ìIgnorance
has the characteristic of unknowing. Its function is to confuse. It is
manifested as concealing. Its proximate cause is cankersî and so on.
ìFormations have the characteristic of forming. Their function is to
accumulate. They are manifested as volition. Their proximate cause is
ignorance.î Then there is a footnote. I think the #7 should not be there.
ìConsciousness has the characteristic of cognizing. Its function is to go
before. It manifests itself as rebirth-linking. Its proximate cause is
formations; or its proximate cause is the physical-basis-cum-object. Mentality
has the characteristic of bending (towards the object). Its function is to
associate. It is manifested as inseparability of its components, (ëN»maí here
means vedan», sa““» and sa~kh»ra. They always arise together.). Its proximate
cause is consciousness. Materiality has the characteristic of being molested.
Its function is to be dispersed. It is manifested as [morally] indeterminate.î
The #7 should be there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now let us look at the footnote. The footnote is the
translation of the Æ k». He left out one important sentence. I donít know why.
He left out the last sentence. Here it is said that it is manifested as morally
indeterminate. Its manifestation is mostly indeterminate (aby»kata). In Abhidhamma
there are three terms - kusala, akusala, and aby»kata. ëKusalaí means kusala
consciousness and cetasikas. ëAkusalaí means akusala consciousness and
cetasikas. ëAby»kataí means those that remain including r|pa and Nibb»na. R|pa
(materiality) is one of the indeterminates. Here its manifestation is
ëindeterminatenessí. It is called ëindeterminateí to distinguish it from
mentality, which is profitable, etc., at different times.î N»ma is sometimes
kusala (profitable) and sometimes akusala (unprofitable). R|pa is always
aby»kata. It is never kusala or akusala. It is always aby»kata. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the Æ k» explains in a different way the word
ëindeterminateí here. ëIndeterminateí according to Æ k» means ënot cognizingí,
ënot taking an objectí. ëNot taking an objectí is one kind of indeterminateness
of r|pa. I tell you this because when you practice meditation and you
concentrate on some r|pa, then sometimes you may see that, oh, it does not
cognize. R|pa does not cognize. It has no faculty of cognition. When you see
that way, that means you are seeing r|pa with reference to its manifestation.
It is very common among yogis to see r|pa as that and not just as
indeterminate. That is because if you have no knowledge of Abhidhamma, you will
not know that r|pa is aby»kata. If you practice meditation, you will see that
r|pa or matter has no ability to cognize. If you see or understand in that way,
then you are said to be seeing the manifestation of r|pa or you are seeing r|pa
with reference to its manifestation. This is an important sentence in the Æ k».
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 52 second line ìIt is twofold as ëno theoryí and
ëwrong theoryí. ëNo theoryí means not understanding and ëwrong theoryí means
wrong understanding. Ignorance or avijj» has two meanings - not understanding
or wrongly understanding. If you do not understand at all, that is ignorance.
If you understand something in the wrong way, that is also avijj» (ignorance).
If you understand the impermanent as permanent, that is also avijj»
(ignorance). You have understanding but your understanding is clouded with
moha. That is also avijj». There are two kinds of avijj» - not knowing, not
understanding and understanding wrongly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let us look at paragraph 57, defining of the factors. How
many factors are there in Dependent Origination? 12. What about sorrow and so
on? They are also mentioned in the formula. They are not taken as separate
factors because they are not definite. That means they may or they may not
arise in a certain realm. For example in the realm of the Brahm»s there can be
no sorrow, lamentation and so on. So it is not an inevitable result of rebirth.
When there is rebirth as Brahm»s, there can be no sorrow and so on. Thatís why
they are not taken as separate factors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we come to the detailed exposition paragraph 58. So we
have avijj» (ignorance) according to Sutta and according to Abhidhamma.
According to the Sutta method it is unknowing about the four instances
beginning with suffering, that is ignorance of the Four Noble Truths. According
to Abhidhamma it is unknowing of the Four Noble Truths plus the past
aggregates, the future aggregates, both past and future aggregates and
Pa‘iccasamupp»da.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 60 ìFormations are the six mentioned in brief
above thus ëthe three, namely, formations of merit, etc., and the three,
namely, the bodily formation, etc.í; but in detail here the [first] three
formations are 29 volitions (You know the 29.) that is to say, the formation of
merit consisting of 13 volitions, counting the 8 sense-sphere profitable
volitions that occur in giving, in virtue, etc., and the 5 fine material
profitable volitions that occur in development [of meditation]: then the
formation of demerit consisting of the 12 unprofitable volitions that occur in
killing living things, etc.; then the formation of the imperturbable consisting
in the profitable volitions associated with the immaterial sphere, which occur
in development [of those meditations].î You know the kusala and akusala cittas.
There are 12 akusala, 8 k»m»vacara kusala, 5 r|p»vacara kusala and 4
ar|p»vacara kusala.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAs regards the other three, the bodily formation is bodily
volition, the verbal formation is verbal volition, and the mental formation is
mental volition.î So this is different. ìThis triad is mentioned in order to
show that at the moment<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>of the kamma the
formations of merit, etc., occur in these [three] doors of kamma (body, speech
and mind). For the 8 sense-sphere profitable and 12 unprofitable volitions,
making 20 are the bodily formation when they occur in the body door and produce
bodily intimation (kusala and akusala). The same volitions are called verbal
formation when they occur in the speech door (through speech) and produce
verbal intimation. But volition connected with direct-knowledge is not included
here.î ëDirect-knowledgeí means abhi““». Abhi““» volition does not give any
results, any results in the future. And also volition connected with agitation
(That means volition connected with uddhacca.), the last of the akusala cittas,
does not give any results. You may remember the fifth chapter of Abhidhamma.
There it is said that uddhacca volition does not give results at the moment of
rebirth. Direct-knowledge also cannot give results.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 62 ìHow can it be known that these formations have
ignorance as their condition?î The answer I think is not so convincing. ìBy the
fact that they exist when ignorance exists.î Why are they caused by ignorance?
Because when there is ignorance, there are these formations. And then the
explanation of these is not difficult to understand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ultimately we come to the 24 conditions, the 24 conditions
taught in the last book of Abhidhamma. They are important because we have to
understand the Dependent Origination with reference to these conditions. Only
then will we understand Dependent Origination fully. Otherwise our
understanding of Dependent Origination will not be complete. So we have to
understand Dependent Origination against the background of these 24 conditions.
This book explains these conditions together with the Dependent Origination.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>So it is very helpful. In the Manual of
Abhidhamma they are separated. Dependent Origination is not explained with
reference to Pa‘‘h»na. Maybe it is too complicated for beginners. In order to
really understand Pa‘iccasamupp»da you have to understand Pa‘‘h»na also. These
are the 24 conditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first one is root condition (hetu). There are 6 roots -
lobha, dosa, moha, and then alobha, adosa, amoha. These 6 roots are called
ëroot-cause conditioní. The word ëhetuí is explained in paragraph 67. ìHerein,
ëcause (hetu)í is a term for a part of a syllogism.î In an Indian syllogism
there are 5 parts. One part is called ëhetuí. It is like an example I gave
earlier. There is fire on the mountain. I am making an inference. We do not
really see the fire on the mountain. I see smoke on the mountain. So I say that
there is fire on the mountain. That is called ëpropositioní. Then I give you
the reason because there is smoke on the mountain. ëBecause there is smoke on
the mountainí is called ëhetuí in Indian syllogism. This is just the meanings
of the word ëhetuí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first meaning is a part of syllogism. The second meaning
is a reason. The third meaning is a root. Here ërootí is taken to mean hetu.
ëHetu conditioní means root condition or root-cause condition. And that really
means the 6 mental factors called ëroots (lobha, dosa, moha, alobha, adosa,
amoha)í.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the word ëpaccayaí is explained. In the explanation I
want you to pay attention to the words ëanother stateís presence or arisingí.
When a state is indispensable to another stateís presence or arising, the
former is a condition for the latter. But as to characteristic, a condition has
the characteristic of assisting; for any given state that assists the presence
or arising.î The P»ƒi word ëpaccayaí can mean producing cause as well as
supporting, so here presence or arising. ëPresenceí means supporting and
ëarisingí means producing. So the word ëpaccayaí can mean producing cause or
just supporting cause. Sometimes both can be taken for one condition. Sometimes
only one can be taken. Paragraph 69 is the intention of some teachers. We can
skip that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then there is object condition. Under object condition
everything is included. Everything is the object condition - cittas, cetasikas,
r|pa, Nibb»na, all. There is nothing which is not an object of the mind. So
everything comes under the heading of object condition. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next one is predominance condition. In paragraph 72
about a third of the way down ìIt is the four states called zeal, [<u>purity of</u>]
consciousness, energy and inquiry.î Abhidhamma students will remember that
there are four kinds of predominance) (adhipati). The first is zeal (chanda).
The second is consciousness (citta). The third is energy (viriya). The fourth
is inquiry. ëInquiryí really means pa““». I donít know where he got the words
ëpurity ofí in the brackets. Do you agree with that? What about akusala cittas?
There can be predominance of akusala citta. So they must go. It is just
consciousness, either pure or impure. Sometimes lobha can predominate, right?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 73 there are two conditions - proximity condition
and contiguity condition. They are the same. Just the words or letters are
different. The meaning is the same. This condition is like giving opportunity
to others. In order for you to sit on this chair I vacate this chair. It is
something like that. In order for the next consciousness to arise the previous
consciousness must disappear because there can only be one consciousness at a
time. Suppose there are a series of consciousness - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. At one
moment there is only one consciousness. When #1 disappears #2 arises. When #2
disappears #3 arises. When #3 disappears #4 arises and so on. #1 is said to be
the condition for the arising of #2. Actually the disappearance of #2 is said to
be the condition for the arising of #3 and so on. So this is not producing
condition but just supporting condition. In order for that citta to arise the
previous citta must disappear. It is like giving your seat to another person.
It is something like that. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some teachers try to find a difference between these two.
Paragraph 75 ìThe opinion of [certain] teachers is that proximity condition
refers to proximity of <u>aim (fruit</u>) and contiguity condition refers to
proximity of time.î ëAim (fruit)í is the wrong translation. The P»ƒi word is
ëatthaí ëAtthaí can mean a substance or a thing. Here it means a phenomenon or
in P»ƒi a dhamma. So proximity of phenomenon and contiguity of time - that
means no interval of dhammas and no interval of time. When there is no interval
of dhamma, it is proximity and when there is no interval of time it is
contiguity. That is what the other teachers say.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBut that is contradicted by such statements as ëThe
profitable [consciousness] belonging to the base consisting of neither perception
nor non-perception in one who emerges from cessation is a condition, as
contiguity condition, for Fruition attainment [consciousness]í.î So it
contradicts this passage from Pa‘‘h»na. You may not understand it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An An»g»mi and an Arahant can enter into what is called ëthe
attainment of cessationí. In this attainment there is the temporary suspension
of mental activity. When a person is in that sam»patti (attainment), there is
no activity of mind. There is only the physical body. As soon as the person
emerges from that attainment, Fruition<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>consciousness arises. If the person is a Non-Returner, Non-Returner
Fruition consciousness arises. If the person is an Arahant, Arahant Fruit
consciousness arises. It is said in this passage that the fourth ar|p»vacara
citta that arises before that attainment is a condition for that Fruition
consciousness by way of contiguity. But there may be 7 days interval between
these 2 because a person can be in that attainment up to 7 days intervening in
time. So it contradicts with that opinion. According to them there should be no
intervening of time between the conditioning and the conditioned. In this case
there can be a long, long time. If it is a brahm», it maybe years between the
fourth ar|p»vacara consciousness and the Fruition consciousness. This opinion
is untenable and contradicted. Then there are some more arguments. They are
also rejected. Please go over these at home. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 80 ìBut just as great misery is despair, so
great support is decisive support.î This you may not understand unless you have
the P»ƒi words in mind. ìJust as great misery is despair.î I just told you to
make a note of »y»sa and up»y»sa, right? Great »y»sa is up»y»sa. So here also
great support is great support or decisive support. The P»ƒi word for support
is nissaya. The P»ƒi word for decisive support is upanissaya. The word ëupaí is
there like in the word ëup»y»saí. åy»sa is intensified by the prefix ëupaí. The
word ënissayaí is also intensified by the prefix ëupaí. That is what he is saying
here. But if you do not have the P»ƒi words in mind, you may not really
understand what he is saying here. ìThis is a term for a cogent reason (a very
strong reason). Consequently a state that assists by being a cogent reason
should be understood as a decisive condition.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the varieties of decisive support are given - objective
decisive support, proximate decisive support and natural decisive support. We
have run out of time. Please bring these sheets next week or when you study
Pa‘iccasamupp»da keep them handy so you can look at them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Last week we finished the 24 conditions. So today we begin
with paragraph 101, how ignorance is a condition for formations. These
paragraphs describe in what way ignorance is related to different formations.
It is the application of the 24 conditions to the Doctrine of Dependent
Origination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think you remember that there are different kinds of
formations - formations of merit, formations of demerit and formations of the
imperturbable. At least these three you should remember. If you do not
remember, go back to paragraph 60. ëFormations of merití means cetan»
(volition) concomitant with kusala. ëFormations of demerití means cetan»
concomitant with akusala. ëFormations of the imperturbableí means cetan»
concomitant with the four formless jh»nas (ar|p»vacara).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So ignorance is a condition for formations of merit in how
many ways? Formations of demerit in how many ways? Formations of the
imperturbable in how many ways? ìHerein, for those of merit ignorance is a
condition in two ways: it is a condition in two ways, namely, as object
condition and as decisive support condition (not as <u>support</u><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span><u>condition</u>).î It is #9, not #8. ìFor
ignorance is a condition, as object condition, for formations of merit of the
sense-sphere at the time of<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>comprehending [by means of insight] ignorance as liable to destruction
and fall; and it is likewise for those of the fine material sphere
(ar|p»vacara) at the time of knowing a confused mind by means of
direct-knowledge consciousness (abhi““») [through penetrating othersí minds and
so on]. But it is a condition, as decisive support condition, in two cases,
that is to say, [for the sense-sphere formations] in one who, for the purpose
of surmounting ignorance, fulfills the various instances of sense-sphere merit
making consisting in giving, etc., and [for the fine material sphere formations]
in one who arouses the fine material jh»nas [for the same purpose]. Likewise in
one who effects the merit while aspiring to the delight if sense-sphere
becoming and fine material becoming because he is confused by ignorance.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ignorance is unwholesome (akusala). So how is it related to
kusala, formations of merit? They cannot arise at the same time. Ignorance is a
condition, as object condition, for the formations of merit. That means when
the kusala cittas arise, they take ignorance as an object. It is also a
decisive support condition of kusala cittas. The decisive support condition is
very wide. If you cannot think of any other condition, you can say that they
are related by decisive support condition. You will almost always be right.
Ignorance is related to formations of merit by two conditions, as an object and
as decisive support.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next paragraph concerns the condition for demerit
(akusala), how ignorance is related to akusala. Ignorance itself is akusala. So
there we have what conditions? Letís see. ìAs object condition at the time of
the arising of greed, etc., contingent upon ignoranceî - ignorance can be the
object of akusala consciousness. ìAs object predominance and object decisive
support respectively at the times of giving importance [to ignorance and
enjoying it]î - that means taking ignorance firmly and enjoying it. ìAs
decisive support in one who, being confused by ignorance and unaware of danger,
kills living things, etc.î And then what? ìAs proximity, contiguity, proximity
decisive support, repetition, absence and disappearance, for the second
impulsion and those that follow.î You know that there are seven javana moments
in a thought process. Ignorance concomitant with the first javana moment is a
condition for the second javana. Then that concomitant with the second javana
is a condition for the third and so on as proximity, contiguity, proximity
decisive support ( That is a variety of decisive support.), repetition, absence
and disappearance. One javana is related to another javana by proximity,
contiguity and so on, and also repetition because they belong to the same
genus, akusala here. ìAs root cause, conascence, mutuality, support,
association, presence, and non-disappearance, in one doing anything
unprofitableî - that means that they arise at the same time. Ignorance is
related to the cetan» arising together with it by way of conascence, arising
together-mutuality, support and so on. Ignorance is a condition for formations
of demerit in many ways. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this chart they are given. The first column is the
conditioning. The second column is the conditioned. The third column is the
conditions. If you look at it, you will understand easily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ignorance is a condition for formations of merit by #2
(»ramma”a) and #9 (upanissaya). You will have to refer to the other sheet to
find out what the numbers refer to. Then ignorance is a condition for
formations of demerit by #2 (»ramma”a), »ramma”adhipati (That is a variety of
#3, adhipati.), object decisive support (»ramma”a|panissaya which is a variety
#9 upanissaya), then #9 (upanissaya), #4 (anantara), #5 (samanantara)
anantara|panissaya (a variety of upanissaya), #12 (asevana), #22 (natthi), #23
(vigata). Ignorance is a condition for formations of the imperturbable by #9
(upanissaya) only. Ignorance is a condition for formations of demerit by #1
(hetu) also. The paragraphs in the Visuddhi Magga are given in brackets on the
handout. So you can easily go back to The Path of Purification. You read the
book. Then you read the chart and go back and forth. So for the imperturbable
there is only the decisive support condition. The conditioning factor is
ignorance and the conditioned states are the formless jh»na cittas or formless
jh»na cetan» (volition). It can only be through decisive support that ignorance
conditions the formless jh»nas because they do not arise together. There can be
no root cause, conascence, mutuality and others. This is how we apply the 24
conditions to Dependent Origination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Only when we apply the 24 conditions to Dependent Origination
do we really understand it. Otherwise our understanding is not complete. Here
we know how the conditioning factors and the conditioned factors are related by
way of any of these 24 conditions. When we see the conditions, we know whether
the conditioning and the conditioned factors arise at the same time or at
different times. If they arise at the same time, there can be conascence
condition, mutuality condition and so on. In the links of Dependent Origination
the relationship between them is not always one of cause and effect, producer
and produced. Sometimes it is a relationship of helping one another, supporting
one another at the same time. Sometimes the conditioning and conditioned
factors arise together and sometimes they do not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next paragraph 105 there is no single fruit from a single
cause. In the formula it is said depending on avijj» there are formations;
depending on formations there is consciousness. Only ignorance is mentioned at
the beginning. So the question is: Is ignorance the only condition for the
formations or are there other conditions? ìIf it is only one, there follows the
assertion of a single cause.î This is rejected in Buddhism. Buddhism accepts
multiple results from multiple causes. If one asserts that ignorance is the
only condition for formations, then one is asserting that there is only one
cause, a single cause. That is not accepted. ìIf there are others, the
description of it as a single cause..is incorrect.î If there are other causes,
why did the Buddha just say ëavijj»í? The answer it that it is not incorrect.
ìWhy not? Here is the reason.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHere there is no single or multiple fruit of any kind from
a single cause, nor a single fruit from multiple causes, but only multiple
fruit from multiple causes.î This is the Buddhist standpoint. From many causes
there are many fruits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìFrom multiple causes (I think we can leave out ë<u>so</u>í.),
in other words, from temperature, earth, seed, and moisture, is seen to arise a
multiple fruit, in other words, the shoot which has visible form, odor, taste
and so on.î This explains the previous sentence. So from multiple causes arise
multiple results.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBut one representative cause and fruit given in this way
ëWith ignorance as conditioning there are formations; with formations as
condition consciousnessí have a <u>meaning</u> and a <u>use</u>.î He always
translates ëatthaí as meaning. I think we should say here that they have a kind
of benefit and a purpose. Although there are many causes, the Buddha only
mentioned one cause. There is some purpose, some benefit to be had from
mentioning just one. ìFor the Blessed One employs one representative cause and
fruit when it is suitable for the sake of elegance in instruction and to suit
the idiosyncrasies of those susceptible of being taught.î These are the two
reasons we always have recourse to when we cannot give any other reason. Why
did Buddha say depending on avijj» there are sa~kh»ras and not depending on
avijj» and others there are sa~kh»ras? Then our answer is that is because of
the elegance of instruction, because the Buddha was Lord of the Dhamma and he
had many ways of teaching. And also it is to suit the likes and dislikes of the
listeners. These are the two reasons. Here the susceptibility of beings to be
taught is pointed to. Listeners are familiar with different terms and they have
different likes and dislikes. In order to suit them the Buddha sometimes only
taught one cause or two causes and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is important is the next sentence. ìAnd he does so in
some instances because it is a basic factor.î Sometimes he gave only one cause
although there are many causes because it is a basic factor, a basic cause.
ìAnd in some instances because it is the most obvious (cause), and in some
instances because it is not common to all. (It is peculiar to that only.)î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the next paragraph explains that in detail, pointing
out examples in the Texts, in the Suttas. ìIn the passage ëwith contact as
condition feelingí he mentions a single cause and fruit because they are basic
factors. For contact is the basic cause of feeling since the kinds of feeling
are defined according to the kinds of contact [as ëeye-contact-born feelingí
and so on] and feeling is contactís basic fruit since contact is defined
according to the kinds of feeling [that it produces].î That is one point.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHe mentions a single cause in the passage ëDisease due to
phlegmí because that is the most obvious.î There are other causes too like
kamma. ìFor here what is obvious is the phlegm, not the kamma, etc., [mentioned
later in the same Sutta].î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHe mentioned a single cause in the passage ëBhikkhus, any
states whatever that are unprofitable are all rooted in unwise attention
because it is not common to all.î Here unwise attention is given as a cause or
as the root of what is unprofitable (akusala). Unwise attention is given here
because it is not common to all. It is peculiar to akusala only. So the next
sentence does not give that meaning. ìFor unwise attention to unprofitable
things is not common to all [states] in the way that, say, physical basis and object
are common to all.î Actually what it means is that unwise attention is an
uncommon cause for unprofitable states or is a peculiar cause for unprofitable
states. When unprofitable states arise, they arise due to unwise attention.
They also arise depending upon the objects and depending upon the senses.
Objects and the senses are also conditions for akusala to arise. However they
are not peculiar to akusala only. You see something and you have eye
consciousness. That is not akusala. Even though you see something, later on at
the javana moments you may have kusala. So the objects and the senses are not
peculiar causes for the eye consciousness or consciousness to arise. They are
common, but unwise attention is the peculiar cause for akusala to arise. So if we
have unwise attention, we will have akusala javanas. If we have wise attention,
we will have kusala javanas. We see something and sometimes we have kusala or
akusala. That depends upon whether we have wise attention or unwise attention.
So here ìFor unwise attention is the uncommon cause for unprofitable states.î
We should say like that, not ë<u>unwise attention to unprofitable thingsí</u>.
Buddha said here that all unprofitable are rooted in unwise attention. They are
caused by unwise attention although they need<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††
</span>other conditions - physical basis and object. Physical basis and object
are common causes for both kusala and akusala. Unwise attention is the cause
for akusala only. ìConsequently although other causes of formations such as
physical basis and object, conascent states, etc., are actually existent, still
ignorance may be understood as the representative cause of formations [firstly]
because it is the basic factor.î This is the application to the present topic.
So ignorance is mentioned alone because ìit is the basic factor as the cause of
other causes of formations such as craving, etc., as it is said ëCraving
increases in one who dwells seeing enjoymentí and ëWith the arising of
ignorance there is the arising of cankersí, and again because it is the most
obvious, ëNot knowing, bhikkhus, in ignorance, he forms the formation of
merití, and lastly because it is not common to all. So the use of one
representative cause and fruit should in each instance be understood according
to this explanation of it.î Ignorance (avijj») is mentioned alone because it is
the representative cause of formations and because it is the most obvious, and
because it is uncommon. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You see in the footnote 18 this explanation of it. The P»ƒi
word is ëparih»raí. The translation of this word given is <u>explanation.</u>
Actually ëparih»raí means literally doing away with the question or avoidance
of the question. It is not running away from it, but doing away with it. When
you give answer, you are getting rid of the question. Simply it may mean a
reply or an answer, not explanation actually. In a debate when someone says
something, you have to avoid it or you have to get away from it by giving
answer or reply. So it is this answer or reply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHere it may be asked: We admit that (what was said above) -
But ignorance is reprehensible and has entirely undesirable fruit. How then can
it rightly be a condition for the formations of merit and of the imperturbable?
Sugar cane does not grow from [bitter] nimba seeds. Why should it not be
right?î Do you know what ënimbaí is? It is not an English word. It is a kind of
tree. I havenít seen that tree in this country. It grows in tropical countries.
It is small with long leaves. Their taste, the leaves as well as the fruit, is
bitter. Also the branches or wood is bitter. In the East monks use the branches
of that tree as a tooth brush or as a tooth stick. Have you seen the tooth
sticks that monks use? Mostly those are made of that tree. Since it is bitter
and a little hard, it may have some medicinal properties. People use it to
protect their teeth from decaying. In Hindi it is called ëneemí. The P»ƒi word
is ënimbaí and the Sanskrit word is ënimbaí, but in Hindi it is ëneemí which
comes from nimba. There is some kind of soap made from the essence of that tree.
Whenever something bitter is to be pointed out, the Commentators use nimba. So
sugar cane does not grow from nimba seeds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The answer is that the conditioning and conditioned or cause
and result are sometimes opposed to each other, or they may be unopposed, or
they may be like or unlike.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>ìBoth as opposed
and unopposed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>A stateís
conditions may be found,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>And both as like
and unlike too:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>That does not
make it their results.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Actually it should be ìThat does not make it their results only.î
That means those that are conditioned are not results only. In order to
understand you must understand the P»ƒi word used for results here. The P»ƒi
word is ëvip»kaí. ëVip»ka (result)í means the product of kamma in the form of
cittas and cetasikas, not r|pas, just cittas and cetasikas. You know the vip»ka
cittas (resultant consciousness). There are 37 or 52 resultant consciousness in
the 89 or 121 types of consciousness. They alone are called ëvip»kaí. So here
in the verse in paragraph 109 ìThat does not make it their results onlyî or
ìThey are not results only.î That means they are not vip»ka only. Some are
vip»ka and some are not vip»ka, but they are conditioned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIt is established in the world that when states have a
condition, it may be opposed or unopposed to them as to presence, individual
essence, function, and so on. For a preceding consciousness is a condition,
opposed as to presence, for the succeeding consciousness.î #1 consciousness is
a condition for #2 consciousness. It is opposed to #2 as to presence. That
means when #2 arises, #1 is no longer there. So one is absent and one is
present. So they are opposed as to presence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd the preceding training is a condition likewise for the
plying of crafts, etc., which take place subsequently.î You learn something now
and you get the results later. ìKamma is a condition, opposed as to individual
essence, for materiality.î There are some material properties caused by kamma.
They are cause and effect or condition and effect, but they are opposed as to
individual essence. That is because kamma is n»ma and materiality is r|pa.
Their individual essence is different. ìAnd so are milk, etc., for curds and so
on.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìLight is a condition, opposed as to function, for eye
consciousness.î Light is one condition for the arising of eye consciousness or
seeing consciousness. Without light you cannot see. So light is a condition,
but as to function light and eye consciousness are different. Light has the
function of dispelling darkness. Eye consciousness has the function of knowing
the object. Their functions are different.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBut eye-cum-visible-data, etc., are respectively a
condition unopposed as to presence, for eye consciousness and so on. And the
first impulsion (the first javana), and those that follow, are a condition,
unopposed as to individual essence and function, for the impulsions that follow
them.î There are conditions and those that are conditioned which are sometimes
opposed and sometimes not opposed and which are sometimes like and sometimes
unlike. They are not vip»kas always. Some are vip»kas and some are not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìMateriality - for example temperature and nutriment - is a
condition for materiality: the like for the like. And so are paddy seeds, etc.,
for the paddy crops, and so on. The material is a condition for the immaterial,
and so is the immaterial for the material: the unlike for the like.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd so are ox hair and ramís hair, horns, curd, and sesamum
flour, etc., respectively for dubba (It should be dubba, not <u>dabba</u>)
grass, <u>reeds</u>, bh|ti”aka grass and so on.î Then we have footnote 19. At
the end of the footnote Venerable ©»”amoli said: ìExcept for the last
mentioned, it seems problematical why these things, if rightly interpreted,
should be conditions for the things mentioned.î Maybe they believed that way
then. We donít really know. Here ox hair and ramís hair is one unit. Horns are
the second unit. Curd and sesamum flour is the third unit. They are connected
respectively with dubba grass and one grass is missing here. So we should say
ërespectively for dubba grass, arrow grass and bh|ti”aka grassí. We donít need
the word ëreedsí. We have to strike it out. So we should have<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>ërespectively for dubba grass, arrow grass
and bh|ti”akaí. Maybe where there is ox hair and ramís hair the dubba grass
grows abundantly. The second one is arrow grass. I donít know what ëarrow
grassí means. All these are difficult to understand. Bh|ti”aka grass is
translated into Burmese as fragrant grass. It is grass with some good smell.
Those are conditions for those kinds of grass. When there are horns, the arrow
grass grows. When there is sesamum flour, the bh|ti”aka grass and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd those states for which these are the opposed and
unopposed, like and unlike, conditions are not the results (not the vip»kas) of
these states as well.î They are not the vip»kas, but they are conditioned by
the others. ìSo although this ignorance has entirely undesirable fruit for its
result and is reprehensible in its individual essence, yet it should be
understood as a condition, opposed or unopposed and like or unlike as the case
may be, as to presence, function, and individual essence, for all these
formations of merit and so on.î Ignorance can be the condition for formations
of merit, formations of demerit, and for the formations of the imperturbable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then paragraph 112 ìMoreover there is this way of
explanation as well.î The explanation is that if you are ignorant or do not
know correctly about death and reappearance (That is pa‘isandhi.) or rebirth,
and the round of rebirth and Dependent Origination, then you do these
formations. Because of ignorance, because of ignorance of death, because of
ignorance of reappearance or rebirth, you do at times good formations and at
times you do some bad formations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìFirstly when he is confused about death, instead of taking
death thus, ëDeath in every case is break-up of aggregatesí, he figures that it
is a [lasting] being that dies, that it is a [lasting] beingís transmigration
to another incarnation, and so on. When he is confused about reappearance (pa‘isandhi),
instead of taking rebirth thus, ëBirth in every case is manifestation of
aggregates, he figures that it is a lasting beingís manifestation in a new
body.î If you have ignorance about death, reappearance, the round of rebirths,
the characteristics of formations, dependently arisen states, then you do
kusala and akusala formations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The verse given in paragraph 115 is often quoted when you
want to explain what sa—s»ra is. Sa—s»ra is:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>ìThe endless
chain of aggregates,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††††† </span>Of elements, of
bases too,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††††† </span>That carries
on unbrokenly,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††††† </span>Is what is
called the round of births.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the definition of sa—s»ra. Sa—s»ra is just the
endless chain of or the endless arising and disappearing of aggregates, bases,
elements and others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 116 ìWhen he is confused about the characteristic
of formations, instead of apprehending their specific and general
characteristics, he figures that formations are selfî and so on. There are two
kinds of characteristics, specific and general. An example of specific
characteristic would be that matter has the characteristic of being molested or
the characteristic of change. That is a specific characteristic. Feeling has
the characteristic of enjoying the object or experiencing the object fully. That
is its specific characteristic. What are their general characteristics?
Impermanence, suffering and no soul. ëGeneral characteristicí means
characteristic common to all phenomena. Specific characteristic is the
individual essence of each phenomenon. If you are ignorant about the
characteristic of formations, you take things to be self, to belong to a self,
to be lasting, to be pleasant, to be beautiful. ìWhen he is confused about
dependently arisen states (That is Dependent Origination.), instead of taking the
occurrence of formations to be due to ignorance, etc., he figures that it is a
self that knows or does not know, that acts and causes actionî and so on.
Blinded by ignorance we do different sorts of things, good formations and bad
formations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Due to formations there is consciousness. There are 32 kinds
of mundane resultant consciousness. In the chart please look at #2. Conditioned
by formations consciousness arises. ëConsciousnessí means the 32 lokiya vip»ka
cittas (32 mundane resultant consciousness). They are mentioned in paragraph
120. There are a lot of numbers here. The author says ìSee table 2 for
bracketed numbers that follow.î You may look at table 2 at the end of the book.
In brief they are just the resultant consciousness belonging to the mundane
sphere. You can look at the chart and figure out what types of consciousness
these are.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 121 ìHere it may be asked: But how is it to be
known that this consciousness of the kind stated actually has formations as its
condition?î The answer is: ìBecause there is no kamma-result when there is no
stored-up kamma.î It is not very convincing, but it is the way the Commentator
tried to explain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 122 ìBut which kind of consciousness has which
kind of formations as its condition?î There are formations and there are types
of consciousness. So which kind of formation causes which kind of
consciousness?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the resultant kinds of consciousness are given here.
ìThe following 16 kinds arise with the sense-sphere formations of merit as
conditionî - I think you can find them out on the chart. Paragraph 122 is for
k»m»vacara. Paragraph 123 is for r|p»vacara (fine material sphere). Paragraph
124 is for demerit (akusala). And then paragraph 125 is for four ar|p»vacara.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then we have the occurrence of resultant consciousness. ìNow
this resultant consciousness all occurs in two ways, namely, (a) in the course
of an individual existence (or continuity), and (b) at the rebirth-linking
[moment].î First is what? In the course of an individual existence or continuity
and then ëbí is at rebirth-linking. The very moment of rebirth-linking is taken
as rebirth-linking here. After that moment the whole life is called
ëcontinuityí. When kamma gives results, it gives results at the moment of
relinking and also during life. When we examine the results of kamma, we have
to understand what kind of result is given at relinking and what kind of result
is given during the course of life. There are two kinds of results.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do you know what ëAí and ëBí in this paragraph and later
ëDí-ëHí represent? Do you remember them? In paragraph 126 we have ëAí and ëBí
and in paragraph 127 we have ëDí-ëHí. And in paragraph 128 we have ëIí. In
paragraph 129 we have ëJí, ëBí, ëMí. What are they? Go back to chapter 14
paragraph 110. What do you find there? Names of functions corresponding to
those letters. He is referring to those. It is very helpful if you know what
they mean. It is difficult to know what type of consciousness is referred to.
When we study Abhidhamma, we study The Manual of Abhidhamma. So we are familiar
with terns given in that book. In the Commentary the names are different than
what we are familiar with. So sometimes we are at a loss to know what type of
consciousness is meant by these words. For example something like the profitable
resultant mind element may seem difficult. The numbers are given so you may go
easily to the chart and find out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 129 ìThen next to the profitable resultant mind
element, the root-cause-less mind consciousness element accompanied by joyî -
here root-cause-less is ahetuka, mind consciousness is manovi““»”a and element
is dh»tu. What does that mean? That means sant ra”a (investigation). In the
middle of the paragraph there is a saying. I think that I have not told you
about this even in my Abhidhamma classes. Registration (tad»ramma”a) arises how
many times? Two or never. They arise two times or they do not arise at
all.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>What do you find here? ìBy
occurring either once or twice as registration.î So according to some teachers
registration can arise once. The common opinion is that registration does not
arise once. When it arises, it arises twice. Here ëMajjhima Commentaryí does
not mean the Commentary we now have. It is an old Sinhalese Commentary, now
lost. ìBut in the Abhidhamma Commentary two turns of consciousness have been
handed down with respect to registration.î In the Abhidhamma Commentary it is
said that registration occurs or arises two times. ìThis consciousness has two
names, ëregistrationí (tad»ramma”a - literally having that object that the
preceding impulsions had) and ëaftermath life-continuumí (pi‘‘hi bhava~ga).î
ëPi‘‘hií means back, so back bhava~ga. The other paragraphs are like that
explaining the consciousness with reference to the functions, that is in the
course of an existence (pavatti).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we have at rebirth-linking. ìBut what was said above,
namely, ëas to the remaining 19, there is none that does not occur as a
rebirth-linking appropriate to ití.î There are 19 types of consciousness which
have the function of rebirth. ìIt is hard to understand since it is too brief.
Hence in order to show the details it may be askedî - there are given details
of so many things here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let me tell you one thing about this chart. The second link,
formations of merit, cetan» in k»m»vacara kusala 8 are the conditioning. The
conditioned is in k»masugati, the mah»vip»ka 8, the upekkh» sant ra”a. Then
there are the letters ëptí. I did not explain this on the sheet. ëPtí means at
rebirth, at relinking. The letters ëpví on the sheet mean during the course of
a life. that means after rebirth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just above paragraph 135 ì(4) Briefly rebirth-linking
[consciousness] has three kinds of objects, namely, ëpastí, ëpresentí, and
ënot-so-classifiableí.î What is that? That means concepts (pa““atti). Pa““atti
are said to be without time, out of time. So they cannot be classified as past,
or present, or future. ëNot-so-classifiableí means pa““atti. ìNon-percipient
rebirth-linking has no object.î ëNon-percipient rebirth-linkingí what does that
mean? Sa““in, those reborn without mind. You know there are beings who have
only physical bodies, no mind. They are brahm»s. They practiced jh»nas. They
are those who hate mind because they think that because there is mind, we
suffer. We know that this is suffering, this is pain. If there were no mind, we
would be very happy or very blissful. They practice jh»na and as a result of
their jh»nas they are reborn as brahm»s without mind or mental activity. They
are like statues. They stay like statues for say like 500 eons and then they
come back. For their relinking there is no object since there is no relinking
consciousness. At the moment of their arising there are only material
properties. Whenever you see ënot-so-classifiableí, take it to mean pa““atti. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 136 it says ëfor exampleí. I think ëfor
exampleí is not correct. ëFor exampleí means you only state a part, like part
of a list or something, not all. But here the P»ƒi word is ëseyyath da—í means
what are they or something like that. That means I am going to give you all the
details. So it should be something like ënamelyí or ëthat isí. These paragraphs
are to be read slowly, not going fast as we do now because they are a very
important part of Abhidhamma showing the process of death and rebirth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From happy to unhappy destiny - that means how a person is
reborn from a happy realm an unhappy realm. That means how a person dies as a
human being for example and is reborn in hell or is reborn as an animal and so
on. They are described here from happy to unhappy destiny. Next unhappy to
happy destiny is described. And then from happy destiny to happy destiny is
described. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 140 next to the 550 in brackets ìBut in the
case of one who has stored up kamma of the exalted spheres.î ëExalted spheresí
means mahaggata. ëmahaggataí means r|p»vacara and ar|p»vacara. ìThe sign of
kamma comes into focusî and so on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here the three kinds of objects for relinking (pa‘isandhi),
bhava~ga and cuti are given. A sign of a happy destiny, in other words, the
appearance of the motherís womb in the human worldî - so sometimes kamma
appears to the mind of the person that is about to die. Sometimes the sign of
kamma appears and sometimes the sign of destiny appears. The sign of destiny is
always taken as to be present. The sign of kamma may be present or past. Kamma
is always past.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHis rebirth-linking consciousness arises next to the death
consciousness in the order shown for the sign of an unhappy destiny.î That
refers to paragraph 137.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIn anotherís case, relatives present [objects to him] at
the five sense doors, such as a visible datum as object, perhaps flowers,
garlands, flags, banners, etc., saying ëThis is being offered to the Blessed
One for your sake, dear, set your mind at restí.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìHow kamma is a condition. Up to this point there has been
shown the occurrence of the nineteenfold consciousness as rebirth-linking. Also
all this [is further classified; for]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>While it occurs
in linking thus,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>It has a double
class beside</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Through kamma,
and as mixed and not,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>And is still
further classified.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 146 and 147 show how kamma is a condition. Then
paragraph 148 and the following show the classification of kamma. That is
double class, mixed and unmixed and other classifications. ìIt should be understood
that when it occurs thus, its double class, etc., is mixed and not, and it is
still further classified.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìFor example: though this [type of consciousness] occurs in
one way only as rebirth-linking, still it is twofold as divided into mixed and
unmixed with materiality.î Rebirth-linking consciousness arises not mixed with
materiality when it is an ar|p»vacara pa‘isandhi. ìIt is threefold as divided
according to sense-desire, fine material, and immaterial becoming; it is
fourfold as egg-born, womb-born, putrescence-(moisture) born, and of
apparitional <u>generation.î</u> You have to remember this because it will be
mentioned again and again. There are four kinds pa‘isandhi - egg-born,
womb-born, moisture-born, and apparitional generation. The word ëgenerationí is
used here. ëGenerationí here means birth. It is not like this generation, next
generation. ìIt is fivefold according to destiny.î There are five kinds of
destiny. They are to be found in Majjhima Nik»ya. ìIt is sevenfold according to
the stations of consciousness, and it is eightfold according to the abodes of
beings.î This is not concerning kamma, but it is about pa‘isandhi (relinking).
Relinking can be only one. It can be two, three, four, five, seven or eight. At
least the fivefold destiny you should understand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe mixed is double sexed and not.î ëDoubleí means sexed
and not sexed. Some are born with masculinity or femininity, but there are
other beings are born without masculinity or femininity. They are without sex,
something like a eunuch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: There are also things like amoebas that donít have
sex.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Yes. ìThe least decads the first has got,
respectively three or twoî - here the material properties arising with the
rebirth-linking are mentioned as to decads. You have to understand the sixth
chapter of The Manual of Abhidhamma.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 153 ìHerein, how the different kinds of generation
come about may be understood according to the kind of destiny. For as regards
these,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>No first three
generations are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>In hell, or with
the deities, also (We should insert ëalsoí)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>Save those of
earth; all four are found</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>In the three
other destinies.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once again we will need to insert ëalsoí. ìHerein, by the
words also, with deities also it should be understood.î The P»ƒi particle ëchaí
is used. Sometimes it means ësomething moreí. It is like the word ëalsoí in
English. ëDeities alsoí means deities and others. By the word ëalsoí we should
understand something else other than deities. ìHerein, by the words also with
deities also it should be understood that, as in hell and among deities -
excepting earth deities -, so also among the ghosts consumed with thirst.î We
should take it that ghosts consumed with thirst are represented by the word
ëalsoí. ìThe first three kinds of generation are not found; for they are
apparitional only. But in the remaining three kinds of destiny, in other words,
among animals, ghosts and human beings, and among the earth deities excepted
above there are all four kinds of generation.î There are five kinds of destiny.
How many do we find here? Hell is one destiny. Deities is another destiny.
Ghosts consumed with thirst is another destiny. What else? Human world is one
destiny. We have to differentiate two kinds of deities, earth deities and other
deities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>For hell there is only one
generation, I mean birth. That is apparitional birth. The first three kinds of
generation are not found in hell, for deities except earth deities, and for
ghosts consumed with thirst. But in the remaining three kinds of destiny, that is
with regard to other kinds of hungry ghosts, human beings, animals, and earth
deities excepted above, there are all four kinds of generation. There can be
egg-born, womb-born, moisture-born and apparitional birth. There can be all
four kinds of generation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next there is the explanation of how many kinds of material
properties arise in the fine material gods and so on. ìFirstly, among the fine
material brahm»s of apparitional generation there arise together with
rebirth-linking consciousness 30 and also 9 material instances with the 4
groups, namely, the decads of the eye, ear, and physical basis (That is the
heart base.), and the ennead of life.î ëEnneadí is a group of nine - the eight
inseparables and j vita. Further down ìNow the group of material states
comprising the ten material instances, namely, color, odor, flavor, nutritive
essence, and the four primary elements, with eye sensitivity and life is (not
ëareí) called the ëeye decadíî, ear decad and so on. A group of material states
is called the ëeye decadí. The components of that decad are color, odor,
flavor, nutritive essence, the four primaries, eye sensitivity and life. These
ten are the eye decad. ìThe remaining [groups of material states] should be
understood in the same way.î That is the ear decad, nose decad and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 158 the second line of the verse ìUnder
aggregates, object, <u>cause</u>î - we should correct it to ërootí. It is not
ëcauseí. You may say ëroot-causeí, not just ëcauseí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 161 - this is very good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>ìA mere state
that has got its conditions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>Ushers in the
ensuing existence;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>While it does
not migrate from the past, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††††† </span>With no cause
in the past it is not.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nothing from this life migrates to the other life, but it is
reborn there not without the cause here. This is how we understand rebirth.
Buddhists accept anatta. There is no att». There is no permanent entity. They
accept rebirth. Sometimes it seems incompatible. You do not believe in anything
which is permanent or in any soul or whatever. Then you are saying there is
rebirth in another state. The answer is: ìA mere state that has got its
conditions ushers in the ensuing existence.î It arises there conditioned by
something here, something in the past. ìWhile it does not migrate from the
pastî - it does not go from the past to the present or from the present to the
future. ìWith no cause in the past it is not.î That is the cause of it. ìSo it
is a mere material and immaterial state arising when it has obtained its
conditions, that is spoken of, saying that it comes into the next becoming; it
is not a lasting being, not a soul. And it has neither transmigrated from the
past becoming nor yet is it manifested here without cause from that.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìWe shall explain this by the normal process of human death
and rebirth-linking.î That means the obvious process of human death, relinking
and so on. On the next page illustrations are given such as the echo, a light
and so on. An echo, a light, a seal impression, a looking-glass image are given
to explain rebirth. ìAnd here let the illustration of this consciousness be
such things as an echo, a light, a seal impression, a looking-glass image, for
the fact of its not coming here from the previous becoming and for the fact
that it arises owing to causes that are included in past becomings. For just as
an echo, a light, a seal impression, and a shadow, have respectively sound
etc., as their cause and come into being without going elsewhere, so also this
consciousness.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAnd with a stream of continuity there is neither identity
nor otherness. For if there were absolute identity in a stream of continuity,
there would be no forming of curd from milk. And yet if there were absolute
otherness, the curd would not be derived from the milk. And so too with all
causally arisen things. And if that were so there would be an end to all wordly
usage, which is hardly desirable. So neither absolute identity nor absolute
otherness should be assumed here.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìIf no transmigration is manifested, then after the
cessation of the aggregates in this human person, that fruit could be another
personís or due to other [kamma], since the kamma that is the condition for the
fruit does not pass on there [to where the fruit is]? And whose is the fruit
since there is no experiencer? Therefore this formulation seems to be
unsatisfactory.î So it is like one person does the kamma and the other person
gets the result. The answer is that it is through continuity, like seeds and so
on. What we cal an ëexperiencerí is just the arising of results. Actually there
is no experiencer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 174 about the middle ìFor just as in the world
when someone becomes an <u>agent</u> with the aim of <u>completing some
business</u> or other, and he buys goods, say, or obtains a loan, it is simply
the fact of his performing the transaction that is the condition for completing
that business,î and so on. Now it is not simply an agent. It is someone who
promises to pay debt, something like a guarantor. You guarantee something. And
also ëcompleting some businessí is very vague. The P»ƒi word used here is
ëniyy»tanaí. Although P»ƒi language is a religious language, some words are
taken from Sanskrit which have to do with worldly things. So niyy»tana is a
business P»ƒi word. ëNiyy»tanaí means ëpaying backí, not transacting business.
So we get ëthe aim of paying back what has been promisedí or ëthe aim of
discharging the obligationí. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 175 and so on explain the relationship according
to Pa‘‘h»na. You have to read this with reference to the chart. With the chart
you understand easily. There is one thing worthy of note at the bottom of
paragraph 180. ìThen it is a condition for [brahm»s] seeing undesirable visible
data and hearing undesirable sounds that are in the sense-sphere: there are no
undesirable visible data, etc., in the Brahm» World itself.î In the Brahm»
Worlds there are no undesirable sights or sounds. But they can see undesirable
sights and hear undesirable sounds from the sense-sphere. When they look down
to the sense-sphere, they may see undesirable objects. In the Brahm» World
itself there are no undesirable visible sights nor undesirable sounds. ìAnd
likewise in the divine world of the sense-sphereî - in the Devaloka also there
are no undesirable objects (no ani‘‘j»ramma”a) because everything there is
beautiful. But when they look down at the human world, they may see a lot of
undesirable objects. OK.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think this is the end of the second link, the second link
between formations and consciousness. This is the longest explanation of links
given in the Visuddhi Magga.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>There is a
lot of information about pa‘sandhi, death and rebirth, and also kamma and its
results. So read it slowly. And maybe reading The Manual of Abhidhamma can help
you here. It goes both ways. Those who have studied Abhidhamma may note that
here are the explanations for The Manual of Abhidhamma.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: What chapter should we read?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: For kamma and results you need to read the fifth
chapter. Also death and rebirth are in the fifth chapter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is almost a month sine we had our last class. I think
that we are on paragraph 186. The word ën»maí generally means cittas, cetasikas
and sometimes also Nibb»na. But here in this formula depending upon
consciousness, n»ma-r|pa arises. ëN»maí means what? The three aggregates, that
is feeling, perception and formations aggregate. Here ën»maí means only the
cetasikas. Feeling is one cetasika. Perception is another cetasika. Formations
are the remaining 50 cetasikas. So all 52 cetasikas are covered by n»ma here.
They are called ën»maí because of their bending on to the object. The root is
ënamí. ë<st1:country-region><st1:place>Nam</st1:place></st1:country-region>í
means to incline towards or to bend towards. So that which inclines towards the
object is called ën»maí. These three are called ën»maí here. In other places,
mostly in the Suttas, when the Buddha said n»ma and r|pa, he meant citta and
cetasikas together. So here consciousness or citta is the conditioning factor
and n»ma and r|pa are the conditioned factors. Here ën»maí means only the three
aggregates, the three immaterial or mental aggregates (feeling, perception and
formations).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìMatter is the four great elements and the materiality <u>derived
[by clinging</u>] from the four great primaries.î It is not by clinging. There
is no occasion for clinging here. The P»ƒi word used is up»dayar|pa—. That
means ëdepending uponí. So it should be ìthe materiality dependent upon the
four great primariesî. There are 28 material properties. Four are called the
ëgreat primariesí and 24 are called the ëdependent onesí. That is because these
24 depend upon the four great primaries for their arising. The four great
primaries are the elements of earth, water, fire and air. Their analysis is
given in the Description of Aggregates in chapter 14. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìBy occurrence in becoming etc.: excepting one abode of
beings, [that is, the non-percipient], mentality occurs in all the kinds of
becoming, generation, destiny and station of consciousness, and in the remaining
abodes of beings.î You can find mind everywhere, except in the realm of
mindless beings. ëNon-percipientí means the realm of mindless beings. There is
one realm among the 31 planes of existence where there are beings without
minds. They are just like statues. Mind can be found in all realms except the
realm of mindless beings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìMateriality occurs in two kinds of becoming, four kinds of
generation, five destinies, the first four stations of consciousness, and the
first five abodes of beings.î So materiality can be found I think everywhere
except for the four ar|p»vacara realms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìNow when this mentality-materiality occurs thus, then in
the case of sexless embryos and the egg-born, at the moment of their
rebirth-linking there are manifested as materiality two organic continuities,
that is, the two decads of physical basis and body, and also the three
immaterial aggregates.î At the moment of rebirth-linking if a person is a
sexless person, then there arise at the moment of relinking two decads, the
decad of physical basis and the decad of body and the three immaterial
aggregates. That means the aggregates of feeling, perception, and mental
formations. Actually four immaterial aggregates arise there, but consciousness
is taken as the cause here. So only three mental aggregates are taken here. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìSo in their case there are in detail these 23 states,
namely, 20 states as concrete matter and three immaterial aggregates, which
should be understood as ëmentality-materiality with consciousness as
conditioní. But omitting repetitions, and so canceling nine material instances
from one of the organic continuities, 14 states remain.î Do you know what these
are?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>I will explain<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>only this passage. For the others I will
refer you to The Manual of Abhidhamma. The material properties are treated in
groups. There are different groups. Sometimes a group of eight material
properties, sometimes nine, sometimes ten and so on. There are eight material
properties which are inseparable. Wherever there is matter we find these eight.
There are four great primaries, color, smell, taste and nutrition. These eight
are called ëinseparablesí. They are the basis for the groups. If we add life
faculty to it, we get nine material properties. If we add eye sensitivity, we
get the eye decad. If instead of eye sensitivity we add ear sensitivity, we get
the ear decad and so on. Here two decads are mentioned. The ëheart base decadí
means the eight inseparables, life principle and heart base. There are ten. I
think if you write them down, you can see more clearly. They are the eight
inseparables, life faculty, and heart base. And then there is the body decad.
It is the same thing, eight inseparables, life faculty and body sensitivity.
And then we have three mental aggregates. How many do you get all together? Ten
plus ten plus three, so 23. Therefore it says ìThere are in detail these 23
states, namely 20 states as concrete matter (That means the two decads.) and
three immaterial aggregates, which should be understood as
ëmentality-materiality with consciousness as conditioní. But omitting
repetitionsî - that means taking only what has not been taken before. Then we
get how many? 14. That means from the second decad we have to omit the eight
inseparables and life faculty because they are repeated. So we get 14.
ìOmitting repetitions and so canceling nine material instances from one of the
organic continuities, 14 states remain.î </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The others are to be understood according to the forming of
decads. To understand the other paragraphs first you must read The Manual of
Abhidhamma on the groups of matter. At relinking if the being is a sexless
being there are these two decads. But if the being is with sex, we have to add
one more decad. So there are 33, but omitting repetitions there are 15.
Although one decad is added, we add only one more, masculine sex or feminine
sex.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìAt the moment of rebirth-linking of those Brahmaís Retinue
among apparitionally born beings (That means those who donít have to stay in
the womb of the mother.), four organic continuities are manifested as
materiality, that is, the decads of eye (10), ear (10), physical basis (10),
and the ennead of the life faculty (9 - 8 inseparables and life principle or
life faculty), and three immateriality aggregates. So in their case in detail
these 42 states, namely, 39 as concrete materiality and 3 immaterial
aggregates, should be understood as ëmentality-materiality with consciousness
as conditioní. But omitting repetitions and so canceling 27 instances of
materiality, [9 each], from 3 of the organic continuities, 15 states remain.î
This is how they arise in a certain realm or in a certain life. That is at
relinking. And also in the course of an existence (That means life after
relinking.) also mentality and materiality are manifested. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One thing to note is that rebirth-linking consciousness does
not originate materiality. There are 4 causes of matter - kamma, consciousness,
temperature and food. Generally speaking mind produces material properties. Not
every type of consciousness however can originate materiality. Here in
paragraph 193 ìRebirth-linking consciousness does not originate materiality.
For, just as a man who is falling into a chasm cannot support another, so it,
too, is unable to originate materiality because of its weakness, which is due to
the weakness of the physical basis.î It has just arisen in a new existence, so
it is still weak. At that time there is only the physical heart base and that
heart base is also very weak at that very moment. So the mind or that
consciousness which depends on that weak physical basis cannot produce matter.
Rebirth-linking consciousness does not originate materiality. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 197 ìBy inclusion: now there is the simple
mentality with consciousness as condition in both the course of an existence
and rebirth-linking in the immaterial sphere, and in the course of an existence
in the five-constituent becoming.î There are five-constituent becoming,
four-constituent becoming and one-constituent becoming. They will be explained
in this chapter in paragraph 254. Actually ëfive-constituent becomingí means a
realm where there are 5 khandhas.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>There
are 5 aggregate beings, 4 aggregate beings and 1 aggregate beings. Human beings
are 5 aggregate beings. Mindless beings are 1 aggregate beings. Formless sphere
beings are 4 aggregate beings because they have only 4 immaterial aggregates
(feeling, perception, formations and consciousness). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ìThe simple materiality with consciousness as condition in
both cases among the non-percipient (That means mindless beings.), and in the
course of an existence in the five-constituent becoming, and the [combined]
mentality-materiality with consciousness as condition in both cases in the
five-constituent becoming. All that mentality and materiality and
mentality-materiality should be understood as ëmentality-materiality with
consciousness as conditioní including them under mentality-materiality
according to the method that allows any one part to represent any remaining one
of its kind.î This is explaining the word ën»ma-r|paí to mean more than it
apparently stands for. ëN»ma-r|paí can mean just mentality-materiality. But
sometimes there is only n»ma or sometimes there is only r|pa. And sometimes
there is both n»ma and r|pa. So actually it is depending on consciousness n»ma
arises, r|pa arises, n»ma-r|pa arises. The Buddha just said that n»ma-r|pa
arises, but we must understand that the word ën»ma-r|paí stands for n»ma, r|pa
and n»ma-r|pa. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some of the words are elided or are not mentioned. It is
just like we say ëfathersí in P»ƒi. When we say ëfathersí, we mean parents, not
fathers only, but both fathers and mothers. In P»ƒi it is called ëekasesaí.
ëEkaí means one. ëSesaí means remaining. That means remaining one word
representing both the remaining word and other elided ones. Let us say instead
of saying fathers and mothers, we just say ëfathersí. That means we elide the
word ëmothersí. The word ëfathersí represents both fathers and mothers. That is
called ëekasesaí in P»ƒi. Footnote 38 the expression ëekadesasar|pekasesaí is a
grammatical term. ëEkadesaí means part, not whole, part. ëSar|paí means some
form. ëEkasesaí means one remaining. So n»ma-r|pa has the same form. The
remaining is just a part remaining, not a whole. The resemblance is just in
part, not in whole. One word<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>is n»ma,
the other word is r|pa, and the third is n»ma-r|pa. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the realms of ar|p»vacara there are only n»ma aggregates.
So in that case depending on consciousness, n»ma arises, no r|pa. At the
relinking moment of mindless beings, only r|pa arises, no n»ma. So in the case
we say depending on consciousness, r|pa arises. For 5 aggregate beings both
n»ma and r|pa arise at the moment of relinking. For them we say depending on
consciousness, n»ma and r|pa arise. We have to take it in that way. That is
what the Commentator is explaining here. In the formula depending on
consciousness as a condition, there is n»ma-r|pa. That means there is n»ma,
there is r|pa, there is n»ma-r|pa. If you look at the notes on page 2 in small
print you will see vi““»”a paccaya n»ma-r|pa. Conditioned by consciousness
n»ma, r|pa, and n»ma-r|pa arise. The P»ƒi word is only n»ma-r|pa, but we have
to take it to mean sometimes n»ma, sometimes r|pa and sometimes both n»ma and
r|pa. So as I said with regard to relinking in formless beings, there is only
n»ma. So depending on consciousness, n»ma arises. For mindless beings only r|pa
arises. For 5 aggregate beings both n»ma and r|pa arise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then paragraph 200 by manner of condition - that means how
they are related. Paragraph 201 ìRebirth-relinking or some other kind of
resultant consciousness is a condition in 9 ways, as conascence, mutuality,
support, association, kamma-result, nutriment, faculty, presence and
non-disappearance conditions, either at rebirth-linking or in the course of an
existence, for that mentality called resultant, whether mixed with materiality
or not.î Now the notes I think I have explained before. I followed the
explanations here and gave them in diagram form. The conditioning ones are
vip»ka consciousness. That means resultant consciousness. The conditioned are
vip»ka n»ma, resultant n»ma. That means the resultant mental aggregates. The
ëptí means at relinking and ëpví means during the course of life. That means
after relinking.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>The numbers 6, 7, 8 and
so on refer to this list of the 24 conditions. What is #6? Conascence. What is
#7? Mutuality. #8 is support. #14 is kamma-result. #15 is nutriment. #16 is
faculty. #19 is association. #21 is presence. #24 is non-disappearance. They
are related in this way. Vip»ka consciousness, this is citta and vip»ka n»ma,
this is cetasikas. Vip»ka consciousness and vip»ka n»ma arise together or at
the same time. They arise together at the same time and they support each other
actually. That is why we have #6, #7, #8 and so on. From this we understand
that not all the links are to be interpreted as cause and result. They are just
conditioning and conditioned. They arise together and they support each other.
Sometimes they belong to different times. Sometimes they arise at the same
time. We have to understand this according to the explanations given in the
Commentary. Here vip»ka consciousness (That means some kind of relinking
consciousness.) is related to vip»ka n»ma (That means cetasikas arising
together with it.). They are related by way of conascence and so on. They arise
together, they disappear together and so on. Then there is relation of vip»ka
consciousness to heart base. At the moment of relinking the heart base and
vip»ka consciousness arise together. They can be related by way of conascence, mutuality
and so on. The numbers of the conditions are given and the paragraph numbers in
the Visuddhi Magga are given in the square brackets. This is how Pa‘‘h»na is
applied to Pa‘icca Samupp»da. This is how we should understand Dependent
Origination with reference to the 24 modes of causality or causal
relationships. Only then do we really understand the relationship between the
different links. Ordinarily people may think these are very simple links, one
causing the other. Actually it is not that way. It would be very easy, but it
is not that way. We have to understand with reference to Pa‘‘h»na so that we
understand clearly and correctly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then sometimes the Commentary explains also why it is
said<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>that conditioned by consciousness
n»ma, r|pa and n»ma-r|pa arises. Some of them may not be very convincing. Still
this is the reason given by the Commentaries. How do we know that n»ma, r|pa,
and n»ma-r|pa are conditioned by consciousness. Then the answer given here is
according to the Sutta passages and also according to logic. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: What conditions consciousness?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Sa~kh»ra. There the relationship between formations
and consciousness is cause and effect. Most other links are not real cause and
effect. Supporting each other is also called condition, like here consciousness
and mental factors. They arise at the same time. So we cannot say that
consciousness causes the mental factors. They arise at the same time and they
support each other. One is called conditioning and the others are called conditioned.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next link is n»ma-r|pa to the six sense bases. Here
ën»maí means what? Cetasikas. ëR|paí means the four great primaries (here in
paragraph 204) six physical bases (That means eye sensitivity, ear sensitivity
and so on.) and mentality (That means the three aggregates beginning with
feeling.). Here ën»maí means the three mental aggregates and ër|paí means the
four primaries, six bases and one more j vita (life faculty). Here we also must
understand n»ma-r|pa as meaning n»ma, r|pa, and n»ma-r|pa. The same method is
used here. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The word ësal»yatanaí means six bases. Here we must
understand that sometimes it means sixth base and sometimes six bases. We have
only the word ësal»yatanaí, but we must understand that sometimes it means
sixth base, sometimes six bases or one of the six bases. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the notes n»ma is given as the 52 cetasikas. R|pa is
given as four primaries, six base matters (That means eye sensitivity and so
on.), j vita and »h»ra. The six bases are eye base, ear base, nose base, tongue
base, body base, and mind base. That means eye sensitivity, ear sensitivity and
so on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 207 how they are conditioned at relinking and
later during the course of life is given. ìHere at rebirth-linking mentality is
a condition in seven ways at the minimum, as conascence, mutuality, support,
association, kamma-result, presence and non-disappearance, conditions, for the
sixth base.î Sixth base - what is the sixth base? It is mind base. Here
ëmentalityí means the three mental aggregates (That means cetasikas.). So
cetasikas concomitant with first ar|p»vacara are a condition for the sixth base
which is mind by #6, #7, #8 and so on. Here also they arise together. The
relationship is cetasikas to citta here. In the third link above it is citta to
cetasikas. Here it is cetasikas to citta. ëN»maí here means cetasikas. Among
the six bases the sixth base is mind. You know there are six internal bases and
six external bases. All together there are 12 bases - visible object, audible
object, odorous object, sapid object, tangible object, and the other objects
(dhamma objects). Those are the external objects. They are called ëexternal
basesí. The internal bases are eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind. Here
ën»maí means cetasikas. So in the ar|p»vacara realms n»ma relates to sixth base
only because there is no other base in the immaterial or formless beings. They
have only mind and no physical body. For them the cetasikas concomitant with
ar|p»vacara relinking is the condition for the relinking consciousness itself, man»yatana,
the sixth base by way of conascence, mutuality, and so on. Here also we have to
take n»ma-r|pa to mean n»ma, r|pa, and n»ma-r|pa. And the six bases may mean
the sixth base only and sometimes six bases. Their relationship is given in
detail in the Visuddhi Magga.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are three kinds of conditions - mentality as
condition, materiality as condition, and mentality-materiality as condition and
then how they are related to the bases. You have to read the passages with the
help of these notes. The first relationship is easy, cetasikas to citta. The
second one vip»ka n»ma is the same relationship to man»yatana during the life.
ëPví means during the course of life. On the handout I said ësame as above allí
because they arise at the same time and support each other. The relationship
between n»ma-r|pa and the six bases is not as cause and result, or cause and
fruit, but just as supporting each other. We have to go quickly now. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then contact - depending on six bases, there is contact.
There are six kinds of contacts given as eye contact, ear contact and so on.
When you see something, there is seeing consciousness. With seeing
consciousness there is contact. That contact is called ëeye contactí.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Does that consciousness have mental factors with
it?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Yes. When you see something, there is seeing
consciousness. With seeing consciousness those mental factors there is what is
called ëcontactí. That contact when it is associated with seeing is called ëeye
contactí. If it is associated with hearing, it is called ëear contactí and so
on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Contact is not just the coming together of the object and
eye sensitivity. It is something which arises when the three conditions come
together. The three conditions are the visible object, the eye and eye consciousness.
That P»ƒi word is very much misunderstood because as it stands in the Sutta it
may be interpreted as the coming together of the three is contact. In the
Commentaries it is explained that we are not to<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>take it in that sense. We are to take it that because of the coming
together of the three is contact. Sometimes language is very misleading. With
the fluidity of language you can interpret this way or that way. In that
passage it means because of the coming together of the three there is contact.
Contact is not just the meeting together of the three, but because of the
coming together of the three there arises something and that is contact. It is
something like when you strike a match. Because of the stick and the match
coming together there is fire. It is something like that. There are six kinds
of contact - eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind contact. In detail there
are said to be 32. That means the 32 types of resultant consciousness. Contact
concomitant with these 32 is taken as 32 types of contact. In brief there are
six kinds of contact and in detail there are 32. Those 32 are those concomitant
with resultant consciousness. How many resultant consciousness are there
excluding the supramundane? 32.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let us see how they are related. Eye base, etc. (5) are
related to eye contact, etc. (5) by way of #8, #10 and so on. ëEye baseí means
eye sensitivity. ëEye contactí means contact concomitant with seeing
consciousness. They are related by way of #8, #10 and so on. What is 38?
Support. We do not get conascence here because they do not arise together
although they may arise at the same time. What we see has already arisen when
we see it actually. They are present at the moment, but they do not arise at
the same time or they do not arise together, but they exist at the same time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let us suppose that we see something. Before coming to the
moment of seeing, there are some moments past. Matter is said to have a life of
17 thought moments. When some visible object strikes at our mind, then the life
continuum (bhava~ga) is disturbed and it vibrates. One moment is past. Then the
bhava~ga vibrates for two moments. So there are three moments before we are
aware of seeing the visible object. The fourth moment is just the mind turning
to that object. The fifth moment is the moment that we see.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†† </span>So there are four moments past. So with
regard to seeing consciousness and visible object we cannot say that they arise
at the same time. So there are four moments<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†
</span>past. So with regard to seeing consciousness and visible object we
cannot say that they arise at the same time. We cannot say they arise together.
The visible object may be outside of ourselves. It may be our hands, our feet
or anything. So they do not arise at the same time and they do not arise
together. They are present at the moment that they are related to each other.
This is why we cannot have conascence, and when there is no conascence, there
can be no mutuality. There is support. What is #10? Prenascence. ëPrenascenceí
means the visible object arises just before the seeing consciousness arises.
When seeing consciousness arises, the object has already existed. Vip»ka
man»yatana (That means vip»ka consciousness.) relates to vip»ka mind contact
(That means contact.). They arise together. Therefore there can be conascence,
mutuality and so on. It is like that. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Letís go to the next one. That is feeling, right? There are
six kind of feeling. What are they? Feeling born of eye contact. That really
means feeling concomitant with eye contact. You see something and there is
seeing consciousness. Along with seeing consciousness there is feeling. That
feeling is called ëfeeling born of eye contactí. Then there is feeling born of
ear contact, born of nose contact and so on. There are six kinds of feeling
here. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph 230 in the verse it is said:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>ìBut from the
nine and eighty feelings</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>Thirty-two, no
more, appear</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>Associated with
result.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††††† </span>And only those
are mentioned here.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By feeling is meant here the mental factor feeling which is
concomitant with 32 types of resultant consciousness only. Feeling accompanies
every type of consciousness. There are 89 types of consciousness. So we can say
there are 89 feelings, but only those feelings concomitant with the 32
resultant consciousness are meant here. We have to take only those 32. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Please look at the handout. Conditioned by contact, feeling
arises. So feeling is feeling born of eye contact, etc. Feeling here is feeling
concomitant with 32 resultant consciousness. That is to be taken. Eye contact
is related to feeling (vedan») dependent on eye base by way of #6, #7, #8 and
so on. When you see something, there is seeing consciousness. With seeing
consciousness there is contact and there is feeling. They arise at the same
time. Therefore contact conditions feeling by way of conascence, mutuality and
so on. That is because they arise at the same time and they support each other.
This we have to understand. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mind contact relates to feeling concomitant with tad»ramma”a
k»m»vacara vip»ka. It is technical here. If you look at the list of conditions,
you see #6, #7 and so on. When you see #6, #7, you can safely say that they
arise at the same time. They are not real cause and effect. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next one is craving. How many kinds of craving are
there? First there are six kinds of craving - craving for visible objects, for
sound, for smell and so on. There are six kinds of craving. That is by way of
objects. The cravings are for visible data, for sound, for odor, for flavor,
for tangible data and for dhamma data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In paragraph 235 we have the explanation of three kinds of
craving - sense-desire craving, and then it is commonly translated as craving
for existence and craving for annihilation. We must understand according to
this explanation. It is very important because these three words appear in the
first sermon also. When Buddha defines the Second Noble Truth he said: It is
just this craving which causes rebirth and which takes delight in this life, in
that life and so on. The first one is in P»ƒi k»m»ta”h». It is craving for
sense desires. The second one is called ëvibhavata”h»í. It is craving for
becoming. In fact ëcraving for becomingí means craving that is concomitant with
the wrong view that things are eternal. That is craving for becoming. It is not
simply craving for becoming in reality. It is craving for becoming that is
accompanied by the view that things are eternal. The next one is craving for
annihilation. That means craving accompanies by the view that everything is
annihilated at death. There is no other being. There is no arising as rebirth.
This is another division of craving. The first is craving for six objects. Then
each of these six can be divided into three, craving for sense desire, craving
concomitant with eternalist view, craving concomitant with annihilationist
view. These are the three kinds of craving and these are mentioned in the first
sermon. Six multiplied by three is 18. Then these 18 can be multiplied by two,
internal and external. So we get 36. Then these 36 can belong to the past, to
the future, to the present. So 36 plus 36 plus 36, we get 108 kinds of craving.
You should be familiar with this because in some Suttas the 108 kinds of
craving are mentioned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How are feeling and craving related? ìIn one way: it is a
condition as decisive support condition only.î They are related by condition as
decisive support only. Decisive support condition is the widest of the 24
conditions. If you cannot explain by way of any other condition, you can say
they are related by way of decisive support condition. Feeling is a condition
for craving by way of decisive support. Decisive support means that they do not
arise at the same time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then there is another way of explaining. ìOr alternatively,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>A man in pain for
pleasure longs,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>†††† </span>And finding
pleasure, longs for more;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††† </span>The peace of
equanimity</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††† </span>Is counted
pleasure too; therefore</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††† </span>The Greatest Sage
announced the law</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††† </span>ëWith feeling as
condition, cravingí</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††† </span>Since all three
feelings thus can be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††† </span>Conditions for all
kinds of craving.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††† </span>Though feeling is
condition, still</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††† </span>Without
Inherent-tendency</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††† </span>No craving can
arise, and so</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>††† </span>From this the
perfect saint is free.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another way of explaining is that when you are in pain, you
long for pleasure. You long for pleasant feeling. So feeling can be a condition
for craving. You have pain here, and you are attached to pleasant feeling. So
pain can cause craving for pleasant feeling. A man finding pleasure, longs for
more. If you have a pleasant feeling, you want to keep it. You donít want it to
disappear. There also craving is conditioned by feeling. Then what about
neutral feeling? ìThe peace of equanimity is counted pleasure too.î So it is
included in pleasurable feeling if we divide feeling into pleasurable and
displeasurable. Since equanimity is included in pleasurable feeling, you may be
attached to it. So again feeling is a condition for craving. All these kinds of
feelings may be a condition for craving. This is another way of explaining. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here feeling is a condition for craving means when there is
inherent tendency. That means if you do not have inherent tendencies in your
mind, even though you have feeling, you do not have craving. For example in the
minds of Buddhas and Arahants there is feeling, but they do not have craving.
There are no anusaya (inherent tendencies). They have eradicated the liability
to get craving. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here we have to understand the meaning of this link, this
phrase. Depending on feeling, there is craving. It does not mean that there is
always craving when there is feeling. When there is feeling, there may or there
may not be craving. In footnote 40 ìOr alternatively, it may be recognized that
this condition is accompanied by inherent tendency because it follows upon the
words ëWith ignorance as conditioní. And with words ëWith feeling as condition,
cravingí, and not ëwith feeling as condition there is always (not ë<u>only</u>í)
cravingí.î We are not to understand that with feeling as condition, there is
always craving. There may not be craving.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What about us? We are not Arahants. With mindfulness
meditation we can avoid having craving for feelings. Even though we have
painful feeling or pleasant feeling, we are mindful of it, and so we do not
have craving. This is the only place where we can cut the round of Dependent
Origination. The other links we cannot do anything about them. When there is
ignorance, there will always be kamma formations. Where there are kamma
formations, there will always be consciousness and so on. Here although there
is feeling, we can avoid having craving. When this is broken, the other<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>links are also broken. When we practice
meditation, we are cutting this wheel of existence at this place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: So craving does not arise?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: Right. We are mindful. We are saying ìpain, pain,
painî or ìpleasant, pleasant, pleasantî. But we need strong mindfulness, not
just superficial awareness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next is clinging. There are four kinds of clinging - sense
desire clinging, false view clinging, rite and ritual clinging, and self
doctrine clinging. The first one is just sense desire. It is called clinging.
The second one is wrong view. The third one is also wrong view, taking rites
and rituals as leading to attainment of enlightenment. The self doctrine is the
view that there is a self that there is something which lasts forever. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With regard to rite and ritual clinging what is mentioned in
our books is in paragraph 241 ìfor ox asceticism, ox vows, etc., are themselves
kinds of clinging, too.î The P»ƒi word here is s labbata. It is translated as
rites and rituals. The real meaning in the Suttas and in the explanations given
in the Commentaries is not just rites and rituals, but it is called here ëox
asceticismí. That means behaving like an ox or it may be behaving like a dog.
By behaving like an ox, these people believed that they could get rid of
craving; they could get rid of attachment and so on. Or behaving like a dog
they could get rid of desires and wants. So they adopted such behavior. There
were two persons during the time of the Buddha who practiced like this. One was
a follower of ox asceticism. The other followed dog asceticism. They went to
the Buddha and asked whether their practice was right or wrong. Buddha said
ìDonít ask me.î They persisted. In the end the Buddha said that now that you
have asked me, so I have to answer. Those who follow dog asceticism will be
reborn as dogs. Taking just those as a means to emancipation is what is called
ërite and ritual clingingí. We can extend that to mean other things. We do
chanting, right? All Buddhists do chanting. If we take chanting to be the real
way to emancipation, it may be a rite and ritual wrong view. We do chanting.
That is for our calmness of mind. But we do not take it to be the only way for
emancipation. We bow down before the Buddha. We chant. We even keep precepts.
These are something like basic practices for emancipation. But they cannot
directly lead us to enlightenment. For enlightenment we have to practice
meditation. Satipa‘‘h»na meditation is said by the Buddha to be the only way to
enlightenment. If we take bowing down before the Buddha as the way to
enlightenment without practicing meditation, then we may be having this kind of
clinging to wrong view. Doing these rites and rituals if they are not carried
too far is all right because they make us calm. Our minds can be tranquil so
that we can practice meditation. But if we do not practice meditation and just
do chanting, and just keep s la and so on, then it may be a wrong view. There
are these four kinds of craving.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Student: Would you say this is some sort of critique of
Confucianism?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Teacher: I donít know what they practice. The correct view
according to the Buddha or the interpretation of the Commentators is that the
only way to Nibb»na is satipa‘‘h»na. It is expressly said at the beginning of the
Sutta that this is the only way for the purification of beings and so on. This
is the real, correct way to the attainment of enlightenment. If we take others
to be the way to the attainment of enlightenment, then we have that wrong view.
That is the view that they alone can lead us to enlightenment. For example if
we believe s la alone can lead us to enlightenment and we do not have to do any
meditation, that is a wrong view according to this interpretation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Letís go to becoming. There are two kinds of becoming to
understand here. In P»ƒi they are called kamma-becoming and bhava-becoming.
Paragraph 250 ìIt becomes, thus it is becoming. That is twofold as
kamma-process becoming and rebirth-process becoming.î In this phrase ëdepending
upon clinging, birth arisesí, here we must understand that becoming means two
things. One is kamma-process becoming and the other is rebirth-process
becoming. ëKamma-process becomingí simply means kamma. So it is the same as
sa~kh»ra (mental formations). ëRebirth-process becomingí means rebirth. Because
of clinging both can arise. It is explained in detail in this book. Because of
clinging sometimes we do good kamma, sometimes we do bad kamma. We want to be
reborn in a better world. We think that it is good to be reborn in a better
world. So we do meritorious deeds. Or sometimes we may be misdirected. We may
kill an animal as a t sacrifice with the belief that we will be reborn in a
better existence. Clinging can be a condition for our good or bad actions, our
good or bad deeds. That is kamma. As a result of clinging and also as a result
of kamma we will be reborn in a better existence or in a worse existence. That
is in another becoming. In this link between clinging and becoming we can take
it that both kinds of becoming are meant here. Because of clinging there is
kamma-becoming and there is also rebirth-becoming. Mental formations and
kamma-becoming are the same. They are mental volition (cetan»). But the mental
formations (sa~kh»ra) belong to the past time and here the kamma-process or
kamma-becoming belongs to the present time. The time is different. There is a
slight difference mentioned in the Visuddhi Magga too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are nine kamma becomings given in paragraph #253,
#254. In paragraph #261 there is a saying. ìFor the ordinary man is like a
madman.î That is a very famous phrase used in our country. ëOrdinary maní means
a puthujjana. A puthujjana is like a madman. This phrase is quoted by people
very often. If you want to say something about people doing some crazy things,
you say ìOh, a puthujjana is like a madman.î</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next is the link between becoming and rebirth. There
becoming means just what? Kamma-process becoming. We cannot take becoming to
mean rebirth there because it is a condition for rebirth. In the link between clinging
and becoming we must take becoming to mean both, kamma-becoming and
rebirth-becoming. In the link between becoming and rebirth, becoming is the
same as rebirth. That is the difference. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Depending upon rebirth, sorrow, lamentation and so on also arise.
They are not explained here because they have been explained in the chapter on
the Noble Truths. Next comes the wheel of becoming. So it is explained as a
wheel. Ignorance is put at the beginning of this teaching. It is not the
beginning of the round of rebirth. It is just the beginning of the teaching.
Old age and death are put at the end of this teaching. That does not mean that
it is the end of the round of rebirth. That is because when there is old age
and death and also sorrow and lamentation and so on, there is also ignorance.
If there is no ignorance, there can be no sorrow, lamentation and so on. When
we are sorry and we lament for something and are experiencing mental anguish,
there is also ignorance. And when there is ignorance, there are mental
formations and so on. This wheel of rebirth goes on and on like this. That is
why this teaching is called the wheel of rebirth, the wheel of becoming.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are some things to be understood with regard to this
teaching. They are given on another sheet. I donít know whether you brought
those sheets with you. With regard to these twelve links we have to understand
the three times or periods, the 12 factors, 20 modes, 3 connections, 4
divisions, 3 rounds, 2 roots. Some of the English words may be different from
The Path of Purification. Please write down the paragraphs. For 3 periods it is
paragraph #287, for 20 modes it is #293, for 3 connections it is #289, for 4
divisions it is #290, for 3 rounds #298, and for 2 roots it is #285. And then
there are four kinds of profundity and four methods with regard to which
Dependent Origination is to be understood. These four methods are more
important than the four profundities. The Dependent Origination is profound in
its meaning, in its teaching and so on. In the kinds of profundity in paragraph
#304 profundity of meaning is profundity as to fruit. ëMeaningí does not mean
the meaning of words, but here the fruit or the results. ëProfundity of lawí
means profundity of causes. Profundity of teaching and profundity of
penetration are the same. Pa‘icca Samupp»da is profound as to fruit, as to
causes, as to teaching, and also as to penetration. It is very important to
penetrate into the essence of each factor in this teaching.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are four methods of treating the meaning here. That is
very good. We have to understand with reference to these four methods. The
first is the method of identity. The second is the method of diversity. The
third is the method of uninterest. The fourth is the method of ineluctable
regularity. These are the four methods by which we must understand the
Dependent Origination. The method of identity means there is something like a
continuity going on. It is not just disconnected bits. They are connected bits.
There is some kind of continuity. Then there is the method of diversity.
Although they are a continuity, each one is different from the other. They are
actually diverse from one another. The ëmethod of uninterestí means unconcern.
Avijj» has no concern that it must condition mental formations. And mental
formations have no concern that they must produce consciousness and so on. That
is called the method of uninterest. The method of ineluctable regularity means
that mental formations are only conditioned by ignorance, not by other factors,
not by other things. I have had difficulty with this word ëineluctable
regularityí. I gave talks on Pa‘icca Samupp»da at my retreats and there was not
a single dictionary at that place. There were a lot of books, religious books,
but no dictionary. So I asked the yogis to tell me the meaning of this. Three
people offered me meanings they thought were correct, but they did not have
dictionaries either. All of them gave me the wrong meaning. They thought
ëineleuctableí was unknowable or something like that. In the dictionary it is
said ënot to be avoided or overcome or inevitableí, so inevitable regularity.
That means mental formations can be conditioned by avijj» only and so on. These
are the four methods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Actually the first two methods are the most important because
we must understand how to explain things. Although we say a being is reborn
there, we do not mean that it is identical or that something from one life goes
to another life. We have to understand Dependent Origination with at least
reference to these two methods, the methods of identity and diversity. So we
have to combine these two and understand them. If we take only one, we will
fall into one kind of wrong view. These four methods are very important.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>† </span>So we have come to the end of Dependent
Origination.</p>
