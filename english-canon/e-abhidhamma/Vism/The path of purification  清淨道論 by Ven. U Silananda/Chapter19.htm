<p class=MsoNormal>The next chapter is on overcoming doubt. Overcoming doubt
comes after the meditator sees cause and effect, the cause-effect relationship
between things. “Knowledge established by overcoming doubt about the three
divisions of time (That is past, present and future.) by means of discerning
the conditions of that same mentality-materiality is called ‘Purification by
Overcoming Doubt’.” In order to get to this stage we must first see
mentalitÿ-materiality clearly. Then we will see or we must find out the
conditions for mind and for matter. When we can see the conditions or the
causes for mind and matter, then we will be able to overcome doubts about
whether we have been in the past, or what we have been in the past, things like
that. We will come to that later. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This chapter deals with the Purification by Overcoming
Doubt. That means trying to find the causes or the conditions for mind and
matter. I think you will need a little knowledge of Abhidhamma to understand
this. “To begin wit, he considers thus: ‘Firstly, this mentality-materiality is
not causeless, because if that were so, it would follow that, [having no causes
to differentiate it], it would be identical everywhere always and for all.” If
mentality and materiality have no cause, it would be identical everywhere. They
would always be the same. For all beings would be the same. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“It has no Overlord, etc., because of the non-existence of
any Overlord, etc., over and above mentality-materiality. And because, if
people then argue that mentality-materiality itself is its Overlord, etc., then
it follows that their mentality-materiality, which they call the Overlord,
etc., would itself be causeless.” If they say that mentality-materiality itself
is Overlord, then mentality-materiality should be without cause, but
mentality-materiality are found to be with causes. So it is not correct to take
it that mentality-materiality itself is Overlord. “Consequently, there must be
a cause and a condition for it. What are they?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Having thus directed his attention to
mentality-materiality’s cause and condition, he first discerns the cause and
condition for the material body in this way: ‘When this body is born, it is not
born inside a blue, red or white lotus or water-lily, etc., or inside a store
of jewels or pearls, etc.; on the contrary, like a worm in a rotting fish, in a
rotting corpse, in rotting dough, in a drain, in a cesspool, etc., it is born
in between the receptacle for undigested food and the receptacle for the
digested food (This is for human beings.), <u>behind the belly lining, in front
of the backbone</u>.” Do you know what that means?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The real meaning is that the fetus lies in
the womb with its back to the belly lining of the mother and facing the
backbone. That is what is described here. I don’t know if that is really true.
Does the fetus in the mother face the back of the mother? We need a doctor. I
think instead of saying ‘behind the belly lining’, we should say ‘with its back
to the belly lining’. Instead of saying ‘in front’, we should say ‘keeping the
backbone in front of itself’. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“(The fetus is ) surrounded by the bowel and the entrails,
in a place that is stinking, disgusting, repulsive, and extremely cramped,
being itself stinking, disgusting and repulsive. When it is born thus, its
causes (<u>root-causes</u>) are the four things, namely, ignorance, craving,
clinging and kamma.” Please do not confuse ‘root-causes’ with the causes in
PaÔÔhÈna. You may remember the causal relations described in the chapter on
Dependent Origination. Among the 24 conditions the first one of them is
root-cause. There root-cause is the six roots (lobha, dosa, moha, alobha,
adosa, and amoha). Here the PÈÄi word ‘hetu’ is used, but it is not the hetu of
PaÔÔhÈna. We can dispense with root-causes’ here. “Its causes are the four
things, namely, ignorance, craving, clinging, and kamma.” Ignorance is one of
the roots. Craving is one of the roots. Clinging because it is craving is one
of the roots. But kamma is different. These four things are the causes of the
arising of the material body. “Since it is they that bring about its birth; and
nutriment is its condition, since it is that that consolidates it.” So all
together we get how many causes? Four causes (ignorance, craving, clinging,
kamma) and one condition (nutriment). There are four causes and one condition.
“So five things constitute its cause and condition. And of these, the three
beginning with ignorance are the decisive support for this body, as the mother
is for her infant, and kamma begets it, as the father does the child; and
nutriment sustains it as the wet-nurse does the infant.” So kamma produces the
physical body. It produces it with the help of, with the support of ignorance
and clinging. After producing it, nutriment sustains it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“After discerning the material body’s conditions in this
way, he again discerns the mental body in the way beginning: ‘Due to eye and to
visible object eye consciousness arises’.” When seeing consciousness arises, it
is not without cause or condition.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Due
to the eye and to visible object eye consciousness arises. When we see
something, there is seeing consciousness in us. But if we do not have the eye,
we will not see. And if there is nothing to be seen, there will be no seeing
consciousness. Seeing consciousness depends upon the eye and the visible object
for its arising. Actually there are not only these two but some more. What are
they? Light. If it is dark, we do not see anything. And then there must be
attention. Even though sometimes something passes in front of us, still we
don’t see. We don’t pay attention. Attention is also a condition for the
arising of seeing consciousness, hearing consciousness and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“When he has thus seen that the occurrence of mentality-materiality
is due to conditions, then he sees that, as now, so in the past too its
occurrence was due to conditions, and in the future too its occurrence will be
due to conditions.” The conditions of the present, he sees directly, but the
conditions of the past and for the future, he uses inference. He does not see
directly, but by inference he concludes that the past and the future must have
conditions also. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“When he sees in this way, all his uncertainty is
abandoned.” There are 16 kinds of doubt or uncertainty described in the
Discourses in many places. They are given here - five with regard to the past,
five with regard to the future and six with regard to the present. They are the
following: “1. Was I in the past? 2. Was I not in the past? 3. What was I in
the past? 4. How was I in the past?” ‘How was I in the past’ means was I a
king, or a brahmin, or an ordinary person or something like that. ‘What was I
in the past’ means was I tall, was I short, was I black, was I fair or
something like that. “ 5. Having been what, what was I in the past?” These are
the five doubts with regard to past lives or past aggregates. He is just
doubting. He does not come to any conclusion. If he says ‘I was I was in the
past’, there is no doubt. But here he is not sure - was he in the past or was
he not in the past and so on. It is similar for the future. “ 1. Shall I be in
the future? 2. Shall I not be in the future? 3. What shall I be in the future?
4. How shall I be in the future? 5. Having been what shall I be in the future?”
And also the six kinds of uncertainty about the present are stated thus: “ 1.
Am I? 2. Am I not? 3. What am I? 4. How am I?” How am I is strange. Am I black/
Am I white? Am I tall? Am I short? Do you have any thoughts about your height
or your color? No. The Sub-Commentary explains that it is with reference to
attÈ that he doubts. Do I identify attÈ with myself? How is that attÈ? Is that
attÈ tall or short, or black or white? It is not about one’s own height, or
color, or whatever, but about one’s attÈ. “ 5. Whence will this being have
come? 6. Whither will it be bound?” From where did I come? Where will I be born
and where am I going? These are doubts about the present. There are 16 kinds of
doubt. These are mentioned again and again in the Suttas. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the meditator sees there is mind and matter only and
that mind and matter have their own conditions for their arising, then doubts
are abandoned or given up. “Another sees the condition for mentality as
twofold, according to what is common to all and to what is not common to all,
and that for materiality as fourfold, according to kamma and so on.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The condition for mentality is twofold, as that which is
common to all and that which is not common to all. Herein, the six doors
beginning with the eye and the six objects beginning with visible data are a
condition common to all.” That mean they are common to all wholesome and
unwholesome consciousness. Whether you have a wholesome or an unwholesome
consciousness, they are always there. So they are common to all. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“But attention, etc., are not common to all; for wise
attention, hearing the Good Dhamma, etc., are a condition only for the
profitable (That is wholesome.), while the opposite kinds are a condition for
the unprofitable.” Now you find wise attention and unwise attention as a
condition for wholesome and unwholesome cittas. “Kamma, etc., are a condition
for the resultant mentality; and the life-continuum, etc., are a condition for
the functional.” In order to understand this you must understand-TAPE ENDS</p>
