color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The citta of the kamavacara-bhumi comprise the 
54 kamavacara-citta.&nbsp; In the Atthasalini Cittupadakandha there is an 
explanation of kamavacara-citta from 4 perspectives saying</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;<B>First 
aspect,</B> the term "kamavacara" means citta among the kamavacara-dhamma or is 
in the kama level (the complete term is kamavacara but can be shortened as kama) 
by wandering round in kama or sight, sound, smell, taste and body sense 
contact.&nbsp; The citta is of the kama level, 
kamavacara-citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Every moment in 
our daily life is kamavacara-citta whenever it is not of a finer and more 
intricate level than kama.&nbsp; The moment kusala-citta is developed to a more 
peaceful level by having rupa as arammana until the citta is more steadfast in 
the appana-samadhi level or the jhana-citta with rupa as arammana, it is 
rupavacara-bhumi or rupavacara-citta, beyond the level of kama.&nbsp; And when 
the citta is even more peaceful and steadfast by being the citta that is deeply 
tranquil in the arammana that is beyond rupa, it is arupavacara-citta.&nbsp; And 
the citta that is even finer and more intricate than arupavacara-citta is the 
lokuttara-citta, which fully realizes the characteristics of nibbana, and so it 
is of the lokuttara-bhumi.&nbsp; Thus citta differ in their bhumi.&nbsp; The 89 
citta are categorized as follows:</FONT></FONT></FONT>

lokuttara-citta</FONT></FONT></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face=Georgia><FONT 
color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Whenever a citta is not rupavacara-citta, 
arupavacara-citta or lokuttara-citta, that instant is 
kamavacara-citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Called <B>"kama"</B> 
because of the meaning what entities desire.&nbsp; There are two kama: 
kilesa-kama and vatthu-kama.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1><B>Kilesa-kama</B> is 
the chanda-raga or lobha-cetasika, a reality that is pleased with or attached to 
arammana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1><B>Vatthu-kama</B> is 
the reality on which pleasure and desire is based.&nbsp; Therefore vatthu-kama 
is vatta which evolve in the 3 bhumi: kamavacara-bhumi, rupavacara-bhumi and 
arupavacara-bhumi, since they are not beyond the objects of kilesa-kama.&nbsp; 
As long as lobha is not eradicated there would be vatthu-kama or realities in 
which kama-kilesa takes pleasure.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Kamavacara-citta that 
takes pleasure in sight, sound, smell, taste and body sense contact is very 
tenacious.&nbsp; The rupa appears only for the briefest instant or only when it 
comes into contact with cakkhuppasada or the eye, sound appears only for the 
briefest moment or when it comes into contact with the sotappasada, smell, taste 
and body sense contact likewise.&nbsp; They are all paritta-dhamma, or realities 
that appear only briefly and fall away, but citta is still pleased and attached 
to them.&nbsp; Because of their rapid continuation in the arising and falling 
away, they appear not to fall away.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The pleasure in 
kamarammana, or sight, sound, smell, taste and body sense contact, is 
infinite.&nbsp; Even though the sight, sound, smell, taste and body sense 
contact has fallen away, others arise in continuation causing pleasure and 
clinging to the said objects continually.&nbsp; When one sees any sight that is 
pleasing, one wishes to see it often.&nbsp; When one hears a pleasing sound, one 
wishes to hear it again.&nbsp; The same is true for smell, taste and body sense 
contact.&nbsp; When one has tasted pleasant things, one wishes to have it again 
and again.&nbsp; The pleasure one takes in sight, sound, smell, taste, body 
sense contact arise daily, repeatedly through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body 
sense and mind.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp; When we like 
something, we wish to see it all the time.&nbsp; Is it possible?&nbsp; No, 
because normally all sankhara-dhamma arise and fall away.&nbsp; When 
deliciousness appears, pleasure through the tongue arises.&nbsp; At that instant 
pleasure through the eye, ear, nose or body sense does not arise.&nbsp; When 
pleasure in smell arises, at that moment pleasure through the eye, ear, tongue 
and body sense does not arise because citta arises one at a time only.&nbsp; 
There cannot be two citta arising simultaneously.&nbsp; Everyone is pleased with 
things that alternately appear through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body sense 
and mind, not only in just one color, sound, smell, taste and body sense 
contact.&nbsp; This is because pleasure in sight, sound, smell, taste and body 
sense contact accumulates on and on in continuation from the past through the 
present and to the future.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;<B>Therefore 
kamavacara-citta or citta that wanders through sight, sound, smell, taste and 
body sense contact</B> is the citta that is pleased in sight, sound, smell, 
taste and body sense contact.&nbsp; It cannot emancipate beyond sight, sound, 
smell, taste and body sense contact.&nbsp; Some said they made merit and wished 
to be born in heaven.&nbsp; Heaven is not beyond sight, sound, smell, taste and 
body sense contact but with a more refined kamarammana than in the human 
world.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Therefore, from 
birth to death, when the citta is not as peaceful as in the appana-samadhi level 
or when it is not jhana-citta and not lokuttara-citta, it is 
kamavacara-citta.&nbsp; Asleep or awake, seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, 
knowing body sense contact and thinking, all these intelligence are not 
entities, people or the selves but citta of the kama-vacara level or the 
kama-vacara-citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Those who are not 
an Anagami or an Arahanta would still take pleasure in sight, sound, smell, 
taste and body sense contact, which shows how difficult it is to abandon 
pleasure in kamarammana that appears through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body 
sense and mind.&nbsp; Even though tranquility is developed to the level of 
jhana-citta and one is born in the Brahma world, one cannot be able to eradicate 
pleasure in sight, sound, smell, taste and body sense contact completely.&nbsp; 
While one is not yet an Anagami, one must return to being as such, pleased by 
sight, sound, smell, taste and body sense contact through the eye, ear, nose, 
tongue, body sense and mind.&nbsp; Therefore one should not be careless about 
kilesa and must understand realities as they really are and with reason, to be 
able to develop panna that could really eradicate kilesa 
completely.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The term 
"kamavacara" means citta among the kamavacara-dhamma.&nbsp; A passage in the 
Atthasalini states that the planes of kamavacara-dhamma, from avici, the lowest 
hell, to the highest deva plane of Paranimmita-vasavatti, are all kamarammana 
planes.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The word 
<B>"vatthu-kama"</B> has a broader meaning than sight, sound, smell, taste and 
body sense contact because no matter the reality if it is the basis of pleasure 
then it is vatthu-kama.&nbsp; When one is born as a brahma-puggala in the 
brahma-bhumi, the brahma world is vatthu-kama, or basis of pleasure for the 
rupa-brahma-puggala.&nbsp; For those born in the arupa-brahma world, the 
arupa-brahma-bhumi could be their vatthu-kama, or basis of pleasure for the 
arupa-brahma-puggala.&nbsp; Lobha-cetasika is the reality that takes pleasure in 
and is attached to all arammana except lokuttara-dhamma.&nbsp; Therefore except 
for lokuttara-dhamma, all dhamma can be vatthu-kama, or basis, the object of 
pleasure of lobha.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;<B>The first 
aspect of kamavacara-citta</B> is that it is the citta of the kama level, not 
beyond kama.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1><B>The second aspect</B> 
is that the citta wanders around in the 11 kama-bhumi of which there are 4 
apaya-bhumi, 1 manussa-bhumi (human plane) and the 6 
deva-bhumi.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1><B>The third aspect</B> 
is that it is called kamavacara-citta because it wanders around with the 
efficiency of rendering [objects] arammana or that sight, sound, smell, taste 
and body sense contact would travel through the citta with the efficiency of 
[the citta in] rendering [objects] arammana.&nbsp; Thus it is called 
kamavacara.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>To facilitate 
comprehension one might say that any citta involved with kama or sight, sound, 
smell, taste and body sense contact as arammana is a 
kamavacara-citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1><B>Question:</B>&nbsp; 
Does the arahanta have kamavacara-citta?</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1><B>Answer:</B>&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; 
When the arahanta sees ruparammana through the eyes, that ruparammana is 
kamarammana.&nbsp; The citta that sees is therefore kamavacara-citta whether it 
were the citta of the Sammasambuddha, of the arahanta disciples or anyone else's 
citta.&nbsp; Any instant there is kama or sight, sound, smell, taste and body 
sense contact as arammana, the citta is kamavacara-citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;<B>The fourth 
aspect</B>, in addition any citta renders the patisandhi to wander through kama 
or the kama plane (the four apaya-bhumi, one human and six heaven or deva 
planes) that citta is called kamavacara.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Everyone is in this 
human world because kamavacara-citta caused kama-patisandhi-citta to arise in 
the manussa-bhumi, which is a kama-bhumi.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>If the jhana-citta in 
one who develops samatha-bhavana until the citta reaches the level of 
appana-samadhi of peacefulness as rupa-jhana-citta or arupa-jhana-citta does not 
decline, and it arises before the cuti-citta, the jhana-kusala-citta would not 
be paccaya for birth in this world but in the rupa-brahma or arupa-brahma world 
according to the level of the distinct jhana.&nbsp; To be born a human is the 
result of kamavacara-kusala such as dana, sila, samatha-bhavana and the 
development of sati-patthana that is not beyond kama, therefore causing 
patisandhi in kama-bhumi.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The word <B>"bhumi"</B> 
has 2 meanings: <B>1) the citta as bhumi of sampayutta-dhamma or cetasika-dhamma 
that arise concurrently,</B> and <B>2) the "okasa" (place, occasion) or the 
birth place of worldly creatures.</B>&nbsp; The human world is one of 31 birth 
places [planes or bhumi].</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Since the citta differ 
in kinds and each kind greatly varies in intricacy, the bhumi where worldly 
creatures were born would be distinct.&nbsp; There is not only the human plane, 
or this world alone.&nbsp; And even for the kamavacara-kusala, the strength of 
saddha, panna and other sampayutta-dhamma or concurrent cetasika of the instant, 
would be diversely intricate and would organize the result or birth in different 
bhumi, not only in the human one.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The same applies to 
akusala-kamma.&nbsp; While any kind of akusala-kamma is being done, if one takes 
note, one would see the difference in the gravity of the akusala-dhamma of the 
action.&nbsp; Sometimes it is composed of much vengeance; others not.&nbsp; 
Sometimes it lacks endeavor, with no diligence or effort to hurt or harm, only 
an action composed of little intention yet resulting in the death of some small 
creatures.&nbsp; Since each past kamma was composed of sampayutta-dhamma or 
cetasika of different levels, the said akusala-kamma would be paccaya organizing 
akusala-vipaka-citta to perform patisandhi-kicca, or birth, in the four distinct 
bhumi.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Since kusala-kamma and 
akusala-kamma, which are causes for future results, differ intricately, the 
birth bhumi, which are appropriate to the diverse kamma, would be numerous, not 
only the manussa-bhumi.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The word <B>"bhumi"</B> 
means "okasa-loka", which is the birthplace of worldly creatures of which there 
are 31 bhumi, respective to the levels of citta, comprising 11 kama-bhumi, 16 
rupa-brahma-bhumi and 4 arupa-brahma-bhumi.&nbsp; Altogether there are 31 bhumi 
or levels of okasa-loka.&nbsp; Each level has a number of birthplaces, for 
example, even the human plane is not unique, there are other human 
worlds.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The <B>11 
kama-bhumi</B> comprise 4 apaya-bhumi, 1 manussa and 6 deva summarized 
as:</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The <B>4 
apaya-bhumi</B> comprise hell, animals, peta and asurakaya.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 

<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;There is not only 
one hell or netherworld.&nbsp; There are many major hell-worlds such as sanjiva, 
kal??asutta, sanghata, roruva, maharoruva, tapana, mahatapana and avici.&nbsp; 
Besides these major hells there are minor ones about which not much is mentioned 
in the Tipitaka because the intention of the Buddha was to manifest the causes 
and results of kusala-kamma and akusala-kamma through various births and 
planes.&nbsp; Whatever cannot be seen clearly and realized fully with one's own 
eyes would not merit so much attention as realities that can be proven by the 
development of panna.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Birth in the 4 
apaya-bhumi is the result of akusala-kamma.&nbsp; When the akusala-kamma is 
great, one is born in hell.&nbsp; If the akusala-kamma is very great, one is 
born in avici hell where the torture is unbearable.&nbsp; And when that term is 
over, one would be born in smaller hells since the results of the akusala-kamma 
are still effective.&nbsp; While one is performing akusala-kamma, one does not 
consider that hell is waiting that one has not arrived there only because one is 
still in this world.&nbsp; As long as we are still this person in this world, we 
would not yet leave for the next even though the cause or the akusala-kamma is 
there. Past performed akusala-kamma is paccaya to make one go to one apaya-bhumi 
or another when one has died.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The results of 
lesser akusala-kamma are paccaya for birth in other apaya-bhumi such as birth as 
an animal.&nbsp; One can see that animals have various curious shapes and 
features.&nbsp; Some have many legs, some few, others none.&nbsp; Some have 
wings, some none.&nbsp; Some live in water, some on land.&nbsp; The numerous 
variation of shapes and features are according to the intricacies of the 
citta.&nbsp; All humans have eyes, ears, noses, tongues and bodies but they 
still are different in complexion and height no matter how numerous people are 
in this world, in the past, present and future.&nbsp; Animals are more 
distinctly intricate than humans.&nbsp; There are aquatic, land and aerial 
animals that vary according to their kamma, which are the causes of different 
complex shapes.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The results of lesser 
akusala-kamma are paccaya for birth in the plane of <B>peta</B>.&nbsp; The peta 
suffers from perpetual hunger and their plane is of diverse 
complexities.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;All humans suffer 
from a chronic illness: hunger.&nbsp; One cannot deny that hunger is indeed a 
disease.&nbsp; Acute hunger would make itself felt.&nbsp; When one feels 
slightly hungry and takes food, if the food is good, one would forget that 
hunger is not the feeling of well being.&nbsp; Rather it is to be attenuated and 
remedied.&nbsp; Those who are very hungry but do not receive nutrition would 
know the suffering of hunger and how it could be in worst 
cases.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;One day a certain 
popular person received so many telephone calls from morning till evening and 
did not have time for meals.&nbsp; By evening he had learned the torture of 
intense hunger but was unable to quickly take food to satisfy his hunger because 
that would have caused fainting spells.&nbsp; He had to slowly and gradually 
remedy his hunger but nonetheless fainted.&nbsp; This shows how hunger is a 
major disease, a common everyday disease among nameless others.&nbsp; Imagine 
then how hungry a peta must be.&nbsp; In the peta plane there is no commerce, no 
agriculture so there can be no rice production, no cooking or trading with 
others for food.&nbsp; To be born a peta is the result of akusala-kamma.&nbsp; 
Whenever a peta anumodhana (appreciates someone else's kusala) others that had 
done kusala and dedicated it to him, the kusala-citta of that anumodhana would 
be paccaya for him to receive appropriate food for his plane of existence, or 
even allow him to escape from being a peta by leaving that life and being born 
in another plane, having expiated the results of the kamma that made him a 
peta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Another 
apaya-bhumi is the <B>asurakaya</B>.&nbsp; Birth as asurakaya is the result of 
akusala-kamma that is lighter than other akusala-kamma.&nbsp; The asurakaya does 
not have any entertainment, unlike in the human and heavenly planes.&nbsp; In 
the human plane there are newspapers, cinemas and theaters, music and 
such.&nbsp; But in the asurakaya-bhumi there are no pleasant entertainments like 
those found in the worlds of the sugati-bhumi.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Since the 
akusala-kamma are varied, the bhumi or the birth planes would vary according to 
the causes or the individual akusala-kamma.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>There are 7 bhumi which 
are the results of kamavacara-kusala, comprising 1 human and 6 heavenly 
bhumi.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The Tipitaka 
explains the human bhumi: the manussa-bhumi where humans are born, comprises 4

follows:</FONT></FONT></FONT>

complex and intricate nature according to the efficiency of the

categorize citta into different kinds according to several perspectives.&nbsp; 
For example, into 4 jati comprising kusala, akusala, vipaka and kiriya; into 4 
bhumi comprising kama-vacara-citta, rupa-vacara-citta, arupa-vacara-citta and

rupa-vacara-citta is cause for rupa-vacara-vipaka-citta to perform 
patisandhi-kicca as brahma-puggala in one of the 15 rupa-brahma worlds.&nbsp; 
The rupa-vacara-pancama-jhana is paccaya for the patisandhi of rupa as 
Asannisatta-brahma-puggala in the Asannisatta-brahma-bhumi.&nbsp; The 
rupa-vacara-kiriya is the kiriya-citta of the arahanta while there is 
rupa-jhana-citta of different levels.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

Cittupadakandha there is an explanation of the term <B>"mahaggata"</B> as 
follows.&nbsp; <B>Called "mahaggata" because it has attained eminence in its 
ability to dominate kilesa and because of its comprehensive 
results.</B></FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Kilesa is not an easy 
thing to suppress because when we see, we take pleasure or are displeased.&nbsp; 
But when there is appana-samadhi, the citta is a jhana-citta established 
steadfastly in the arammana through the mind-door.&nbsp; There is no seeing, 
hearing, smelling, tasting, knowing body sense contact.&nbsp; While there is 
jhana-citta over any period of time, the bhavanga-citta does not arise in 
between at all unlike when there is kama-vacara-citta, which are very few and 
short, being paritta-dhamma.&nbsp; The moments of seeing are short, as hearing, 
thinking etc.&nbsp; At the level of kama-vacara-citta one knows arammana during 
very short processes.&nbsp; As soon as cakkhu-dvara-vithi-citta arises to know 
ruparammana, or that which appears through the eyes, and then falls away 
immediately, bhavanga-citta follows before mano-dvara-vithi-citta could receive 
and perceive that which appears through the eyes in sequence to the 
cakkhu-dvara-vithi-citta.&nbsp; Kama-vacara-dhamma, or sight, sound, smell, 
taste, body sense contact, and the citta that knows them are only 
paritta-dhamma.&nbsp; But the mahaggata-citta, namely the rupa-vacara-citta and 
arupa-vacara-citta have attained eminence because they are able to repress 
kilesa and are therefore mahaggata-citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>When there is 
appana-samadhi, or jhana-citta, arising and falling in sequence, then there is 
no seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, knowing body sense contact through the 
eye, ear, nose, tongue or body sense, nor is there thinking about sight, sound, 
smell, taste, body sense contact of any kind, it is called repressing 
kilesa.&nbsp; But when the jhana-citta ends, the kama-vacara-citta arises in 
continuation.&nbsp; When the vithi-citta arise through different dvara, 
akusala-javana-vithi can also arise when there is no kusala.&nbsp; Because 
kilesa has not been eradicated completely, after seeing akusala-citta would 
arise, after hearing akusala-citta would arise, after experiencing body sense 
contact akusala-citta would arise.&nbsp; Does anyone realize that akusala-citta 
arises all the time?&nbsp; If no one does, none would repress it, and would not 
develop ways of eradicating kilesa.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Before the enlightenment 
of the Sammasambuddha the Arahanta those who saw the harm of akusala-citta that 
arise in continuation after seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, knowing body 
sense contact, had tried to find ways to repress kilesa.&nbsp; They knew that 
the only way to do so is not to see, hear, smell, taste, know body sense contact 
because if they did they could not block kilesa.&nbsp; Knowing that they 
developed kusala-citta that rendered them peaceful from lobha, dosa, moha up to 
the level of appana-samadhi, which does not see, hear, smell, taste, know body 
sense contact of any kind other than the uniquely mental arammana that makes the 
citta absolutely steadfast with peaceful kusala.&nbsp; Appana-samadhi, which is 
a jhana-citta, is not the way to eradicate kilesa because when jhana-citta does 
not arise, kilesa does.&nbsp; The moments of rupa-vacara-citta and 
arupa-vacara-citta are great realities, being mahaggata, because they can 
repress kilesa by not seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, knowing body sense 
contact.&nbsp; Unlike the anagami-puggala who still saw but had eradicated 
pleasure in sight, heard but had eradicated pleasure in sound, smelt but had 
eradicated pleasure in smell, tasted but had eradicated pleasure in taste, knew 
but had eradicated pleasure in cold and heat, softness and hardness, tension and 
motion that appeared.&nbsp; Therefore citta are categorized into 4 bhumi or 4 
levels.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

arise in consequence immediately with no other citta in between.&nbsp; All other 
kusala cannot bring immediate results, that is they cannot make vipaka-citta 
arise right after the kusala-citta but the lokuttara-kusala is paccaya for 
lokuttara-vipaka-citta to arise in continuation immediately, with no other citta 
interposing between the lokuttara-kusala-citta as the cause and 
lokuttara-vipaka-citta as the result.&nbsp; As soon as the 
sotapatti-magga-citta, which is the lokuttara-kusala, falls away, the 
sotapatti-phala-citta, which is the lokuttara-vipaka, would arise sequentially 
immediately.&nbsp; As soon as the Sakadagami-magga-citta, which is the

nibbana as arammana immediately following the lokuttara-kusala.&nbsp; Therefore 
phala-citta, which is a lokuttara-vipaka-citta, is javana-vithi like the

samsara-vatta, eradicating kilesa completely according to the level of the 
respective lokuttara-kusala-citta.&nbsp; But the lokuttara-vipaka-citta that

arammana in a series of two or three citta depending on the type of the 
puggala.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The 
sotapanna-puggala would be born again no more than seven lifetimes but the 
patisandhi-citta of the sotapanna is not a sotapatti-phala-citta.&nbsp; 
Depending on where the sotapanna-puggala is born, the vipaka-citta of the level 
of the bhumi would perform the patisandhi-kicca in that world.&nbsp; If the 
sotapanna-puggala is born in heaven, the kama-vacara-citta would perform the 
patisandhi-kicca.&nbsp; If the sotapanna-puggala is born in a brahma-bhumi,
