color=#993366>The Atthasalini Cittuppada-kandha further explains the word 
<B>"citta"</B> as follows:</FONT> 
<P><FONT color=#993366>&nbsp;To further explain <B>"citta"</B>: called citta 
because of the meaning "to think".&nbsp; Explanation: [to think is to] 
experience arammana clearly.&nbsp; In addition because the word "citta" is 
common to all citta, including kusala-citta, akusala-citta and mahakiriya-citta 
of the lokiya type.&nbsp; Called "citta" because it accumulates latent 
tendencies in continuation, with the efficiency of the javana-vithi.&nbsp; 
Called "citta" because they are realities where kamma-kilesa accumulate vipaka 
(result of kamma).&nbsp; Called "citta" because of its intricate nature as well 
as producing intricate results.</FONT> 
<P><FONT color=#993366>&nbsp;If we study texts collected from more recent 
periods, we learn that the six characteristics of citta given there come from 
passages of the Atthasalini, the commentary of Dhammasanganipakarana, which 
explains "citta" in separate perspectives:</FONT> 
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT color=#993366>1. Called "citta" because of the meaning "to 
  think".&nbsp; Explanation: because it experiences arammana clearly.</FONT> 
  <BR><FONT color=#993366>2. Called "citta" because it accumulates innate latent 
  tendencies with the efficiency of javana-vithi.</FONT> <BR><FONT 
  color=#993366>3. Called "citta" because it is a reality where kamma and kilesa 
  accumulate vipaka.</FONT> <BR><FONT color=#993366>4. Called "citta" because 
  its nature is intricate.&nbsp; (In later texts this is generally divided into 
  2 categories: in its intricate arammana and in its sampayutta-dhamma 
  (accompanying realities).</FONT> <BR><FONT color=#993366>5. Called "citta" 
  because it renders [accumulations] intricate.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT 
color=#993366>To facilitate understanding the characteristics of citta as 
explained in the Atthasalini we will proceed in the order above.</FONT> 
<P><B><FONT color=#993366>Called "citta" because of the meaning "to think", 
explanation: because it experiences arammana clearly.</FONT></B> 
<P><FONT color=#993366>Everybody thinks.&nbsp; If we take notice and consider 
thinking we will see that we really think a lot in diverse directions, without 
possibility of stopping, until some people don't want to think any longer.&nbsp; 
They wish for the peace of not thinking because they believe it brings 
unhappiness, worry, trouble and uneasiness from lobha or dosa and they 
misunderstand that it would be better if there were no thinking.&nbsp; But we 
should know it is the citta that is the reality that thinks.&nbsp; Rupa-dhamma 
cannot think.&nbsp; When we examine thoughts that the citta thinks, we find why 
citta thinks those thoughts which sometimes seem inappropriate.&nbsp; Normally 
citta arises to think thoughts about what appears through either eye, ear, nose, 
tongue, body sense or mind, continuously until it seems real.&nbsp; All seem 
real, however, only because citta arises to think about them and then falls 
away.&nbsp; If citta did not think about them, there would be no thoughts, no 
stories.</FONT> 
<P><FONT color=#993366>The passage in the Atthasalini says "called citta because 
of the meaning "to think", explanation: because it experiences arammana 
clearly."</FONT> 
<P><FONT color=#993366>The realities that <B>"know"</B> differ according to 
their distinct kinds.&nbsp; For example, cetasika is the conditioned reality 
that experiences arammana but it is not eminent in that function.&nbsp; Each 
type of cetasika arises simultaneously with the citta, cognizes the same 
arammana but each performs its own separate function.&nbsp; For example, 
phassa-cetasika arises concurrently with the citta but the phassa-cetasika is 
the reality that experiences arammana by coming into contact with it.&nbsp; If 
phassa-cetasika did not know, it would not come into contact with the 
arammana.&nbsp; Therefore phassa-cetasika knows arammana only through contact, 
it does not realizes arammana fully.&nbsp; Panna-cetasika is the reality that 
knows and sees dhamma as it really is.&nbsp; For example, it realizes the 
characteristics of non-self, not entity or person of whatever is appearing to 
the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body sense or mind.&nbsp; Citta that knows, 
experiences fully the arammana therefore it differs from phassa that is in 
contact with the arammana, and from sanna that knows from memory and cognition 
of the characteristics of the arammana, and from the wisdom of panna.&nbsp; 
Citta knows clearly the characteristics of the arammana that appears.&nbsp; Do 
things that now appear to the eyes differ?&nbsp; Realities are sacca-dhamma; 
they can be proven.&nbsp; Are we now seeing only one thing, one color, or seeing 
things that appear as different colors, so minutely that we are able to tell, 
for example, the differences between a real and false diamond?&nbsp; <B>Citta is 
the reality that sees clearly, experiences fully even the finest detail of each 
arammana like a clear, clean mirror that reflects any object that passes before 
it.</B>&nbsp; At present the cakkhuppasada is a rupa characterized by special 
cleanness and clarity, able to be in contact with what appears to the 
eyes.&nbsp; Sotappasada is able to be in contact only with what appears to the 
ear.&nbsp; Ghanappasada is able to be in contact only with what appears to the 
nose.&nbsp; Jivhappasada is able to be in contact only with what appears to the 
tongue.&nbsp; Kayappasada is able to be in contact only with what appears to the 
body sense.&nbsp; Any color, whether it is the color of real or false diamonds, 
jade, stone, or even the color of the jealous glint of the eye, can be perceived 
by the citta.&nbsp; At this moment what appears to the eyes appears also to the 
clearly experiencing citta.&nbsp; No matter the aspect, the citta would know 
precisely the characteristics that appear: see different colors as well as all 
that emanates.&nbsp; This is how we recognize, know the shape and size, as well 
as think of that which appears to the eyes.</FONT> 
<P><FONT color=#993366>&nbsp;Are all sounds that appear to the ear similar or 
different according to the paccaya that conditioned them?&nbsp; There are as 
many distinct voices as there are numbers of people.&nbsp; Citta clearly 
perceived all the different sounds—mockery, taunt, ridicule, the wind, the 
waterfall, animal cries.&nbsp; Different animals cry out differently or even in 
imitators of animal cries, the citta recognizes different characteristics of 
different animals.&nbsp; The hearing citta discerns clearly each and every 
different sound.</FONT> 
<P><FONT color=#993366>&nbsp;All realities can appear only because the citta 
arises to know the arammana.&nbsp; Citta that experiences clearly through the 
nose arises to know different smells.&nbsp; Animal, different varieties of 
plants and flower perfumes, food aroma--soup and dessert smells--even without 
seeing, one recognizes their smells.</FONT> 
<P><FONT color=#993366>&nbsp;Citta that experiences clearly through the tongue 
arises to taste a multitude of flavors: that of meat, vegetables, fruit, tea, 
coffee, salt, sugar, vinegar, lemon, tamarind; all different.&nbsp; Still, citta 
that savors clearly knows distinct tastes that appear no matter how minute the 
differences are, citta is able to experience exactly the diverse aspects.&nbsp; 
While tasting food, for example, the tasting citta knows clearly what flavor is 
lacking, how to season, what to use, which to add etc.</FONT> 
<P><FONT color=#993366>&nbsp;The citta that clearly knows that which comes into 
body sense contact experiences exactly so: characteristics of the cool wind, 
water or air, it discerns the feel of silk or wool, for example.</FONT> 
<P><FONT color=#993366>&nbsp;Someone once told me that while he was standing by 
the street, he happened to be mindful and realized the aspect of hardness that 
appeared.&nbsp; Then he thought that the hardness was the street, then the 
shoes, after that the socks.&nbsp; These are thoughts about the hardness that 
appears.&nbsp; The thinking citta arises because of condition.&nbsp; When 
hardness comes into contact we think what the hardness is, the street, after 
that the shoes, and then the socks.&nbsp; We see that no one can stop 
thoughts.&nbsp; But to know characteristics of realities as they really are, it 
takes panna to know that citta arises to clearly experience arammana at each 
instant and then very rapidly falls away.&nbsp; While we are thinking about the 
street, shoes, and socks, it is not the instant of realizing the aspect of 
hardness.</FONT> 
<P><FONT color=#993366>&nbsp;For panna to clearly experience characteristics of 
realities as they really are, it must realize that the instant of thinking is 
not the self but citta that knows the thoughts.&nbsp; The thinking citta is not 
the seeing citta.&nbsp; The seeing citta knows arammana through the eyes, the 
thinking citta through the mind.&nbsp; Ordinarily when a reality appears through 
the body sense whether it is an aspect of softness or hardness, at that moment 
we do not know what it is.&nbsp; Later we recognize what the softness or 
hardness was.&nbsp; If we were in the dark some might have to look, switch on 
the light to see what it was we were touching.&nbsp; In reality the moment citta 
knows hardness is not the moment of the thinking citta.&nbsp; While citta is 
realizing hardness, there is no world of socks, shoes or street, no world of 
sammati-pannatti (conventional term or idea as opposed to reality).&nbsp; There 
is only the reality that experiences the characteristics of hardness.&nbsp; Even 
the intelligence is not an entity or person but a reality that knows hardness 
and arises and falls away.&nbsp; The citta that arises after that then thinks of 
what had appeared through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body sense and mind.&nbsp; 
They are thoughts about sammati-pannatti of things that appear which make us 
forget that the citta that arose to know hardness has fallen away.&nbsp; Even 
the citta which thought about the hardness has also fallen away.&nbsp; 
Realities, both nama-dhamma and r?pa-dhamma, arise and fall away consecutively 
so very rapidly that we don't realize that these realities arise and fall away 
and are not the self.</FONT> 
<P><FONT color=#993366>&nbsp;Citta is a conditioned reality that clearly knows 
the arammana that appears, whether through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body 
sense or mind.&nbsp; When phassa-cetasika comes into contact with arammana, the 
citta which arises simultaneously with it knows clearly different aspects of the 
arammana.&nbsp; Therefore we should understand the term "clearly know arammana", 
which is a characteristic of citta, the reality that knows.&nbsp;<B> "To clearly 
know arammana" is to know different aspects of diverse arammana that appear,</B> 
whether through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body sense or mind.&nbsp; Citta is 
the reality that clearly knows arammana, therefore arammana is one condition for 
each kind of distinct citta to arise and experience it.&nbsp; Consequently, 
arammana is an arammana-paccaya, or paccaya for citta to arise by being its 
arammana.&nbsp; Each citta that arises has many other paccaya but citta cannot 
arise without knowing an arammana.&nbsp; So arammana is one among many paccaya 
that condition each citta to arise.</FONT>
