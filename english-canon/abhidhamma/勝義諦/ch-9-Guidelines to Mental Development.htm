<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 
as many as 40 kinds of arammana in the development of samatha-bhavana (the 
development of calm).&nbsp; The majority would prefer anapana-sati (mindfulness 
on breath).&nbsp; I understand that these methods cannot decorticate kilesa to 
the level of nibbana or attainment of any of the 
ariyasacca-dhamma.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A:&nbsp;&nbsp; If they 
are samatha-bhavana, they cannot eradicate kilesa because one cannot attain 
nibbana with these bhavana, which is the realization of the 
ariyasacca-dhamma.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q:&nbsp; The average 
person who wishes to decorticate and eliminate kilesa to the level of nibbana 
but who does not understand what is the cause of our attachments in daily life, 
would he be able to do so, not with comprehension but lobha or desire to abandon 
kilesa without knowing kilesa?&nbsp; Would he be able to develop 
sati-patthana?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A:&nbsp; It is not 
possible.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q:&nbsp; He can develop 
neither samatha-bhavana nor vipassana-bhavana (the development of 
insight).</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
would assume that he was developing one or the other but without panna, there 
can be no development of either samatha-bhavana or 
vipassana-bhavana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: Then what guidelines 
can you give him to develop sati-patthana?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A:&nbsp; No one can be 
rushed into the development of sati-patthana.&nbsp; To seat children in a row 
and tell them to develop sati-patthana without their comprehension of kilesa nor 
desire to abandon it, how can they be expected to develop sati-patthana?&nbsp; 
Grown-ups are not without kilesa; they are all with a great deal of 
kilesa.&nbsp; To ask grown-ups whether they want to eliminate kilesa, the 
majority would say no.&nbsp; Though some might say they do not wish to have 
<B>"kilesa"</B> but do they really know the meaning of the word?&nbsp; Lobha is 
kilesa.&nbsp; Does one want it?&nbsp; One does not like the name but one desires 
lobha at every moment.&nbsp; This shows that one does not understand the 
characteristics of lobha, which is a kilesa.&nbsp; Isn't the food 
delicious?&nbsp; Isn't the clothing nice?&nbsp; Isn't this song sweet?&nbsp; 
Doesn't that scent smell beautiful?&nbsp; Isn't this chair nice and soft, 
comfortable to the touch?&nbsp; This is not to like the name lobha but to desire 
it at every instant.&nbsp; To develop sati-patthana is to develop sati-panna 
(consciousness and wisdom), not to desire to meditate.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q:&nbsp; What is 
attasanna?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A:&nbsp; Attasanna is 
memory with attachments to [realities that one mistakes for] the self.&nbsp; We 
should not wonder about attasanna because we all have it.&nbsp; Only when we 
have realized ariyasacca-dhamma and attained the level of sotapanna-puggala can 
we eradicate the wrong view of mistaking realities as the self, an entity or a 
person.&nbsp; But before sati can arise and panna can study and understand the 
characteristics of realities until it clearly knows and&nbsp; realizes that 
realities are not the self, there must be attasanna.&nbsp; Since sati did not 
arise, we would not have been aware of the characteristics of realities that 
appeared through each dvara (sense-door) as they really were.&nbsp; This is why 
we mistake realities that appear as atta or as the self or something.&nbsp; 
Since we do not know the truth about realities we have attasanna, the memory 
that it is we who see and the memory that what we see is an entity, a person, 
the self etc.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The panna that 
arises from listening cannot realize that what we used to see as a human or an 
animal is in reality only things that appear through the eyes. Therefore, 
listening to the dhamma, studying the dhamma requires frequent examination 
continuously, again and again, and conscientious consideration until we 
understand the expressions that manifest the characteristics of realities.&nbsp; 
For example, <B>“things that appear to the eyes”</B> are right because it 
manifests that the element is a visual one that could only appear through the 
eyes.&nbsp; What we see, whether it were red, green, blue, yellow or white, 
clear or opaque, would appear only when in contact with the cakkhu-pasada 
(eye-sense).&nbsp; Since we do not know realities as they are when we see, we 
would have the attasanna that [visual objects] are people, animals and various 
things.&nbsp; Our interest in the different colors makes us think of the shapes 
and forms so that the memories in the shapes and forms arise therefore we see 
people, animals, diverse objects of which the shapes would be in various colors, 
such as black, white, tan, red and yellow etc.&nbsp; If</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;we had no memory 
of colors in different shapes, the concept of entities, persons and objects 
cannot exist.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Therefore, whenever 
we see and are interested, we are engrossed in the nimitta, or the shapes and 
forms, and anubyanjana, or details of what is appearing.&nbsp; We should know 
that at that moment colors appear to make us think of shapes and forms and other 
details.&nbsp; When sati arises to be mindful and panna begins to study and 
examine, one would start to understand that nimitta and anubyanjana, which are 
of different colors, are only things that appear through the eyes.&nbsp; This is 
panna beginning to penetrate the characteristics of realities that are not the 
self, the entity or the person, when sati arises to be mindful continuously, 
frequently, we would understand the meaning of what the Buddha said: Do not be 
attached to nimitta and anubyanjana (by developing panna that know realities 
appearing as what they really are) and begin to attenuate attasanna in things 
appear through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind according to the 
level of the panna developed.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Therefore we should 
know that no matter which words in which passage of the Tipitaka would be about 
realities in actual daily life of which sati would have to be mindful and 
examine until we understand, until panna would clearly know and realize 
characteristics of realities that appear until kilesa can be eradicated 
completely.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;This is for all of 
us to gradually consider, listen, study and examine under normal circumstances 
in real life since we are still unable to eradicate kilesa, lobha, dosa, moha 
etc.&nbsp; Many people would want so much to eradicate them all but we must know 
that kilesa could only be eradicated when lokuttara-magga-citta arises to 
eradicate sakaya-ditthi or the attachment to realities as the self, entities or 
persons through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind, to become the 
ariya-puggala of the sotapanna level.&nbsp; Only then would panna developed to 
realize the ariyasacca-dhamma to become the sakadagami, anagami and arahanta 
respectively.&nbsp; Therefore one must develop panna and not hurry towards days, 
months and years of practice without understanding causes and 
condition.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: Sati that is 
samma-sati, which is one of the eightfold magga, can only arise when one has 
already studied and comprehended the characteristics of realities that appear 
through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind.&nbsp; Then the 
samma-sati would arise to be mindful and panna begins to study and examine until 
it fully realizes the characteristics of realities in truly normal daily 
life.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>To develop sati-patthana 
is the threefold study (sikkhattaya) comprising adhisila-sikkha, 
adhicitta-sikkha and adhipanna-sikkha.&nbsp; The instant of sati that is mindful 
of the characteristics of realities that are appearing, is sila of a very 
refined [superior] nature or adhisila-sikkha.&nbsp; It is to be mindful of the 
characteristics of citta, cetasika and rupa of kusala-dhamma and akusala-dhamma 
prior to any bodily or verbal action.&nbsp; Sati-patthana is adhicitta-sikkha 
because it is the steadfastness of ekaggata-cetasika (samadhi) in the arammana 
appearing which rapidly arises and falls away. Sati-patthana is adhipanna-sikkha 
because it is the panna that conscientiously examines, studies and knows the 
characteristics of realities appearing normally as they really 
are.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: I beg the listeners' 
pardon, but what our learned lecturer just finished explaining is exactly my 
case.&nbsp; Not only am I the way she described, I don't understand more than 
that.&nbsp; For example, say, we were to develop sati-patthana, we could be 
developing the selves who use sati.&nbsp; There are also several doorways, 
dvara, for sati.&nbsp; So for the beginner, personally I haven't gotten anywhere 
with it, because having examined myself, I have not yet realized 
nama-rupa-paricchedanana.&nbsp; What to do?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: Each time we want to 
<B>do vipassana</B> there are difficulties because we want to 'do' it.&nbsp; How 
can we do it correctly if there still is the self to do so?&nbsp; When we begin 
to do it, we, evidently, have the desire to know the characteristics of 
nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma through one way or another.&nbsp; In fact, the 
characteristics of sati-patthana is that it is a reality that is conscious and 
mindful of the characteristics of realities that are appearing through one 
doorway or another at that instant.&nbsp; For example, through the eyes one 
could normally be aware of what is appearing now, little by little, and panna 
could begin to study, examine and know the characteristics that is nama-dhamma 
and rupa-dhamma gradually.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: How do we develop 
sati-patthana while seeing?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: While seeing we can be 
mindful that things appearing to sight are a kind of reality that only appears 
through the eyes.&nbsp; Whether we see it as hair, a table, a chair, columns, 
buildings or whatever, in reality it is something that appears only through the 
eyes, not through the ears, nose, tongue or bodysense. Since panna has not been 
sufficiently developed, there can be no 
nama-rupa-paricchedanana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: I would like to say 
that after I received the book "Mental Development in Daily Life", I have read 
and reread it several times, seven or eight at least.&nbsp; I tried to practice 
it but each time there was the self.&nbsp; Through the eyes it is I who see, not 
color as rupa or seeing as nama.&nbsp; The more I think about it, the more 
expansive it becomes, not specifically one doorway at a time, not separated or 
categorized as nama and rupa.&nbsp; Please explain.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: When there is seeing 
through the eyes, can there be mindfulness of realities appearing normally at 
that moment?&nbsp; In the first place, one must know that to develop knowledge 
unto plenary wisdom as nama-rupa-paricchedanana, one must start with sati being 
mindful and studying the distinct characteristics of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma 
that is appearing through one way or another in ordinary life.&nbsp; This is not 
the level of listening [to the theory], nor is it impatiently and restlessly 
trying to categorize, when there is seeing, things that are appearing as rupa, 
and the reality that is seeing as nama.&nbsp; That is not being mindful and 
studying the characteristics of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma.&nbsp; For 
sati-patthana to arise one must first understand the characteristics of 
nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma correctly that the nama-dhamma that is seeing is a 
consciousness without form or the self.&nbsp; There is no need for composing a 
stance, with arms, legs and feet, and calling it the standing position, and then 
see it; sitting position and see it; reclining position and see it.&nbsp; 
Sati-patthana is mindful of the actual seeing as a consciousness, not as 
ourselves, nor person, nor any entity.&nbsp; And when sati-patthana arises to be 
mindful of the characteristics of visual objects that appear through the eyes, 
it studies until it comprehends that sight is only a reality that is not the 
self, entities or persons.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><IMG height=24 src="ch-9-Guidelines to Mental Development.files/vine.gif" 
width=507></CENTER>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: For the practice to be 
steadfast and not restless as you said before, can we use the 
anapana-sati-patthana method?&nbsp; We use kaya, vedana, citta, dhamma together 
with anapana-sati, which I would call in my special terminology 
anapana-sati-patthana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;A: Generally, the 
desire for results would make us search for combined method.&nbsp; Because when 
one does not know what to do, one would try to combine this and that in case the 
sampajanna (thorough conscience) would be more complete and sati would be 
mindful and focussed on one place for a long period.&nbsp; But is that not the 
characteristic of desire?&nbsp; Some want to concentrate on one arammana or 
another for a long time but do not know how to be mindful [of realities] through 
the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense or mind.&nbsp; They cannot be mindful of 
normal, ordinary things.&nbsp; When they want the citta to concentrate on 
something, they try to mix together several methods because of desire, and 
therefore it is not the development of panna.&nbsp; Those who normally develop 
sati-patthana develop panna in order to know and then abandon [all 
realities].&nbsp; But since they do not know, they cannot abandon them.&nbsp; 
Does trying to concentrate make them abandon their desire?&nbsp; Nor is it the 
way to develop panna to understand and abandon clinging.&nbsp; Do not deviate to 
other things or combine practices because it will not make you know the 
characteristics of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma of the immediate moment that is 
appearing normally as they really are.&nbsp; Normal hearing, thinking, being 
happy and unhappy as usual are all dhamma.&nbsp; As long as sati does not arise 
to be mindful, it is not the development of sati-patthana.&nbsp; Because no 
matter how they try to combine different methods, panna would not arise to know 
the realities that are appearing normally as they truly are.&nbsp; Therefore, 
what is the use of mixing different practices when it is not panna that studies 
and examines the characteristics of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma as usual through 
the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;May I ask what is 
the use, what knowledge might one receive from combining 
practices?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: You asked what 
knowledge I received.&nbsp; I got knowledge of the tilakkhana because, according 
to your references, the dhamma experts alluded to three texts on 
anapana-sati.&nbsp; I have read the fourth Catukka that refers to anicca, 
dukkha, anatta and explains them as well.&nbsp; According to what I read, he 
stated that there are sixteen anapana-sati but the fourth Catukka is 
dhammanupassana-sati-patthana precisely about panna, not really about breathing 
in and out.&nbsp; So we use anapana-sati to control it so it would not spread to 
anything else.&nbsp; If we can't think of anything else or of the vipassana as 
you teach it, then control it with breathing in and out, encircle it.&nbsp; 
Breathe in and out to control it if you cannot think of anything.&nbsp; When 
there is a problem, we think this way.&nbsp; I do not deviate from the teachings 
in thinking this way.&nbsp; I would like to think that the eyes seeing is 
nama.&nbsp; I would like to think so: that it is not the self, just seeing, 
hearing, not the self.&nbsp; But then the self, this I, this we, this thinking 
comes all the time, that is what bothers me.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: It bothers you even 
you combine [the practices].&nbsp; This is because it is not panna that examines 
and studies the characteristics of realities that normally appear as they truly 
are.&nbsp; You say that what you gain is the knowledge of tilakkhana.&nbsp; 
Without knowing nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma, what do you know the tilakkhana 
of?&nbsp; Only the tilakkhana as described in books.&nbsp; It takes 
vipassana-nana to truly realize tilakkhana and the vipassana-nana cannot know 
anything other than the characteristics of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma.&nbsp; 
Therefore, it can be said that it is impossible to know tilakkhana without 
knowing the characteristics of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: Now we beg to know 
about mindfulness: how should one be mindful?&nbsp; A lot or a little.&nbsp; I 
believe this is an important matter.&nbsp; For example, sati, we know that it is 
mindfulness.&nbsp; How to be mindful?&nbsp; Already there is a problem.&nbsp; A 
little mindful?&nbsp; Deeply mindful?&nbsp; Mindful even about anicca, dukkha, 
anatta?&nbsp; Or think only of softness or hardness?&nbsp; I understand your 
teachings.&nbsp; I have listened to you for two or three years and I understand 
now.&nbsp; But when it comes to practicing I can't do it. Rupa?&nbsp; 
Nama?&nbsp; What are they?&nbsp; Even though I have studied the Tipitaka and 
understand it, but while I am mindful, at present when I am mindful, really at 
the moment, as I am mindful, how does one be mindful with a special 
method?&nbsp; The trick is very important.&nbsp; To be shallowly mindful, deeply 
mindful, a lot, lengthily, shortly, superficially?&nbsp; To pay attention is 
full of the self, us, them.&nbsp; This is nama thinking, and the 
other…</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: To try to make an 
effort is confusing indeed: should sati be mindful superficially or strongly, a 
lot or a little?&nbsp; To develop knowledge or panna, there is no special 
method, but begins with listening and studying what sati would be mindful of 
until there is more understanding, enough to be paccaya for sati to arise and be 
mindful precisely of the characteristics of the nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma 
normally as they truly are.&nbsp; Whatever the reality that appears, [one 
should] only be mindful of the actual truth as it is.&nbsp; Do not press hard, 
release to lighten, make it superficial or anything.&nbsp; To do so would be a 
matter of the self, not the examination and study of the characteristics of 
realities that appear as they truly are.&nbsp; Whatever the reality is actually 
like, <B>those who do not forget to be mindful, or those who are being mindful 
of the specific characteristics reality normally and precisely [would do so], 
and start to examine and know the characteristics of the particular nama-dhamma 
and rupa-dhamma little by little</B> without concentrating the sati even deeper 
or to make it a little more superficial or anything of the sort.&nbsp; When the 
sati that arises has fallen away, one may continue to forget sati, or sati may 
be mindful of other arammana in consequence.&nbsp; Then one can see the anatta 
of sati-patthana when one knows realities and sati-patthana are also 
anatta.&nbsp; Then there is no confusion, otherwise the feeling of the self 
would certainly make it confusing because even to be mindful one would not know 
how deep to be correct, how heavy or light, strong or superficial.&nbsp; If it 
were to be mindful, to study and examine to understand the characteristics of 
realities appearing, it would not be confusing at all.&nbsp; Since it is normal, 
how can it be confusing?&nbsp; Abnormality would be 
confusing.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: I still do not know 
the real characteristics of sati-patthana.&nbsp; Sometimes as I listen to your 
guidelines to the development of sati-patthana, when I pay attention I 
understand and there is sati knowing what you lecture about but I cannot 
consider it as nama and rupa at present.&nbsp; I don't know if this is 
sati-patthana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: When one does not know 
[things] as nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma, one is full of attachments to realities 
as the self.&nbsp; This self, which is so complete, could only be abandoned and 
eradicated with sati that is mindful and examine and study the characteristics 
of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma appearing, little by little.&nbsp; The knowledge 
that gradually arises would abandon ignorance about nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma 
bit by bit.&nbsp; To completely abandon [ignorance] at once is impossible 
because sati cannot immediately experience clearly that realities appearing are 
nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma .&nbsp; The knowledge that gradually arises is so 
little that one cannot feel it, similar to holding a knife handle, which begins 
to wear it so very imperceptibly because this is cirakala-bhavana .&nbsp; Some 
are not satisfied that sati and panna develop gradually.&nbsp; But there is no 
other way because if one is not satisfied and tries to combine other methods 
with this, it would make it more confusing.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: What is the difference 
between practicing normally and abnormally?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: Now we are seated 
normally.&nbsp; Be mindful of realities appearing as they truly are.&nbsp; For 
example, realities that are soft, hard which is appearing through the bodysense, 
or realities appearing through the eyes, these are normal.&nbsp; But it is not 
normal to think that when one develops sati, one must adopt the lotus position, 
concentrate on this or that.&nbsp; Because of the desire to selectively know 
realities that have not yet arisen, overlooking mindfulness of realities that 
are appearing.&nbsp; For example, there is reality that is seeing, hearing, 
realities appearing through the eyes, sound, smell, taste, cold, heat, softness, 
hardness etc.&nbsp; Even with the slightest misunderstanding, kilesa, tanha 
would prevent panna from arising to know realities appearing, normally as they 
truly are, at the moment.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;To be able to 
develop sati-patthana one must correctly understand the differences between the 
instant one forgets to be mindful and the instant one is mindful.&nbsp; If one 
does not know this, one cannot develop sati-patthana.&nbsp; One would continue 
not to be mindful as ever, or wants to choose to concentrate on an arammana and 
makes samadhi arise, which is still not the development of sati-patthana.&nbsp; 
Therefore, one must understand correctly that <B>the instant one forgets sati is 
when one does not know the characteristics of realities that are appearing as 
usual in one's daily life, when one is not mindful of realities that see or hear 
etc.</B> The instant there is sati is when we are mindful so we examine and know 
the characteristics of realities appearing normally through one way or the 
other; the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense or mind without controlling or 
specifying it.&nbsp; Do not choose and concentrate [on one thing] or want this 
or that arammana.&nbsp; If not, there could be no realization that sati is 
anatta.&nbsp; Therefore the instant there is sati is the instant one is mindful 
of each of the distinct realities appearing as they truly are 
respectively.&nbsp; For example, the instant smell appears, one is mindful of 
the characteristics of smell appearing through the nose, and examine to know 
that the smell is only a kind of reality that arises, appears and then falls 
away.&nbsp; Or one might be mindful of the reality that is knowing smell at the 
moment as only a consciousness that has arisen, knows smell and then falls away, 
not as an entity, a person or the self etc.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: The sotapanna-puggala 
knows clearly that the reality which is seeing is a kind of nama-dhamma, after 
seeing he would know what he is a man, an animal or an object.&nbsp; That kind 
of knowledge is also a kind of nama-dhamma that arises and falls away.&nbsp; Who

as they really are, other than the nama-dhamma that sees, also exist, [like] the 
nama-dhamma that recognizes what one sees.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

requested.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: That dukkha seems to 
be great in quantity is because of the mistaking of realities for the 
self.&nbsp;<B> If there were no wrong view, mistaking realities for the self, it 
will be lessened considerably.</B>&nbsp; The Buddha manifested that all dukkha 
would lessen if kilesa is eradicated, level by level, respectively.&nbsp; While 
kilesa has not been eradicated, rebirth would be innumerable.&nbsp; As long as 
there are rebirth, there would be dukkha.&nbsp; The sotapanna-puggala has 
eradicated the first levels of kilesa so they will be reborn only seven 
lifetimes.&nbsp; A passage in the sutta&nbsp; says that the Buddha took a little 
dust on the tip of his fingernail and said that the bit of dust on his 
fingernail is comparable to the sotapanna's future rebirths, which is only seven 
times.&nbsp; While the great earth is like the lifetimes to be reborn of the 
ordinary person. Since jati or the rebirth of the ordinary person are so 
innumerable, the dukkha that comes from jati are as innumerable as in the 
question asked.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: Everyone seated here 
would probably like to find out how to begin the practice of vipassana 
immediately.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: By being mindful of 
characteristics of realities that appear.&nbsp; The instant there is sati 
mindful of characteristics of realities of one kind or another, sammasamkappa 
(right thought) or vitaka-cetasika would think or concentrate on the 
characteristics of arammana which is appearing and panna begins to study and 
examine the true characteristics of realities that appear little by little until 
the knowledge grows.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Knowledge would ensue and 
develop from the examination of and learning about the characteristics of 
realities when sati is mindful of the realities.&nbsp; Realities arise, appear 
and then fall away so rapidly.&nbsp; Sometimes one does not have the time to 
study the characteristics such as when one hears, sati can only be mindful of 
the hearing very slightly.&nbsp; One does not have time to examine and study to 
know that it is the reality that knows sound, the hearing is already gone.&nbsp; 
Even though in the beginning the panna does not arise to clearly realize the 
characteristics of hearing, this is normal.&nbsp; No one can hold sound or run 
test on the nama-dhamma, inspect and study it, but hearing will arise 
again.&nbsp; Those who develop sati and panna would be able to be mindful of the 
characteristics of the nama-dhamma that hears the next 
time.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Right now sati can arise 
to be mindful of the characteristics of nama-dhamma or rupa-dhamma appearing 
through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense or mind, one way or the other, 
one characteristic at a time.&nbsp; And examine and study to know the 
characteristics of the specific reality little by little until panna could 
accumulate and clearly know the differences between nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma 
and is able to differentiate the distinct characteristics of the nama-dhamma 
that hears, from sound, etc.&nbsp; Finally one would be more accustomed to the 
characteristics of the nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma.&nbsp; Once that happens, the 
knowledge of the characteristics of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma would increase 
even more.&nbsp; No matter when and where which nama-dhamma or rupa-dhamma would 
arise, sati and panna would be able to arise and be mindful of their specific 
characteristics, in that instant, normally, as they really are.&nbsp; To develop 
sati-patthana is to develop sati and panna.&nbsp; Whichever knowledge is 
developed to arise that knowledge would accumulate and attenuate ignorance at 
the same time.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Q: Supposing after 
paying respect to the Buddha and reciting the mantra, we think of doing 
kammatthana (meditation), how should one "yonisomanasikara" so that there is no 
abhijjha and domanassa in the arammana?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: For to really be 
yonisomanasikara, there should be sammasati in the development of the eight 
magga (the eightfold path).&nbsp; Therefore one should not think of doing 
kammatthana.&nbsp; One thinks of it because one is mistaken that there is a self 
that can make sati arise on schedule.&nbsp; But sammasati does not need to wait 
til the end of paying respect to the Buddha or recital.&nbsp; Who is doing 
it?&nbsp; Since one does not know that it is nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma, one 
mistakes the realities that are performing the actions for the self, as we who 
are paying respect to the Buddha.&nbsp; While reciting mantra since one does not 
realize that it is only the nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma, one would take it as 
oneself who is reciting.&nbsp; Sammasati could arise and experience the 
characteristics of one reality or another while one is performing the rites or 
in any other instant no matter what position one is in.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: I would like to ask 
about developing sati-patthana.&nbsp; I have read Book II of the 
Abhidamma-pitaka, Khandha-vibhamga, the section on the twenty-eight rupa, 
including rupa that are not visible, not tangible, refined, far 
etc.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: There are altogether 
twenty-eight rupa and only one is visible: the ruparammana that appears through 
the eyes, which is visible (sanidassana-rupa) and which can come into contact 
(sappatigha-rupa).&nbsp; Another eleven rupa comprising 1) sound 2) smell 3) 
taste 4-6) bodysense contact 7) cakkhuppasada-rupa 8) sotappasada-rupa 9) 
ghanappasada-rupa 10) jivhappasada-rupa 11) kayappasada-rupa, are rupa that can 
come into contact but are not visible.&nbsp; The twelve rupa that can come into 
contact are coarse rupa and therefore close and can be examined and known.&nbsp; 
The other remaining sixteen rupa are not visible nor can they come into contact 
and therefore are refined and far from being proven and 
known.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Realities truly exist as 
the Buddha had manifested.&nbsp; Those who develop sati-patthana can prove the 
characteristics of distinct realities normally appearing as they actually 
are.&nbsp; But this is very intricate and profound, such as ruparammana which 
are realities that appear through the eyes.&nbsp; To hear this it seems not too 
difficult to understand but this is not the knowledge of the instant of 
seeing.&nbsp; If the person does not develop sati-patthana until panna is sharp 
and strong, he would not be able to experience the characteristics of 
nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma as they truly are.&nbsp; The instant of seeing 
through the eyes there must certainly be ruparammana but we see them as persons, 
animals and various objects until we wonder what ruparammana are like and what 
are their characteristics.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Ruparammana is the 
reality that appears when one opens one's eyes and sees without thinking of 
anything at all.&nbsp; That is the true characteristics of ruparammana which 
panna must develop until one understands and is used to the fact that 
ruparammana is not an entity, person or any object whatsoever.&nbsp; The true 
characteristics of ruparammana is that it only appears through the eyes.&nbsp; 
Therefore when sati-patthana has not yet arisen, one would not yet be mindful, 
study and examine the real characteristics of ruparammana that it is only what 
appears through the eyes so that one cannot attenuate the mistake in taking them 
as people, entities and objects.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: What does to study 
mean?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: When sati arises and 
is mindful of one reality or another that appears, and examines to know the 
characteristics of the reality (not to think in words) so as to realize the 
tilakkhana of consciousness and realities that are not consciousness that is the 
study, of characteristics that are not the self, of realities that 
appear.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: When we open our eyes, 
we see without noticing it.&nbsp; Is that so?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: No one can stop the 
natural continuation of arising and falling away of citta but when sati arises, 
it would be mindful of the characteristics of whatever realities appearing 
normally.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: If so, then the aims 
of developing sati-patthana in daily life which most of us normally practice is 
to escape dukkha, when there are problems. One can escape dukkha after panna has 
arisen.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: To escape dukkha is 
not an easy thing until panna has developed level by level and abandon 
ignorance, uncertainty, and misunderstanding that mistake realities for 
entities, persons and the self.&nbsp; The person who habitually develops 
sati-patthana knows that sati and panna would gradually develop because each day 
avijja arises more than kusala in the innumerable past lives as well as in the 
present one.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: The question arises 
that when something comes into contact we would generally lack 
sati.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: That is normal.&nbsp; 
When sati is not strong it is impossible for it to immediately 
arise.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: From the study of the 
text of the morning recital, which says&nbsp; upadanakkakhandha-dukkha or the 
attachment to the five khandha is dukkha, how does that 
apply?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: Certainly it must be 
so since one does not know realities that are appearing as they really are, one 
is pleased or displeased.&nbsp; The moment of pleasure or displeasure is a kind 
of dukkha because at that instant it is not free from kilesa.&nbsp; As long as 
panna has not yet arisen, one would not know the different characteristics of 
kusala-citta and akusala-citta.&nbsp; Everybody likes lobha and would not stop 
being pleased with lobha until panna arises to see the differences between the 
state of kusala without lobha and those that are with lobha which is fun and 
merry, desirous, pleased and attached.&nbsp; When panna does not arise there is 
pleasure in kilesa and lobha, which is never enough whether through the eyes, 
ears, nose, tongue, bodysense or mind without ever knowing that that instant is 
dukkha, harmful and dangerous.&nbsp; Therefore, the attachment to the five 
upadana-khandha is dukkha.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: Then if we are careful 
when there is contact between the eyes and rupa, the ears and sound and we have 
sati at that moment, there would not be pleasure or 
displeasure?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: No one can be careful 
and force sati to arise.&nbsp; When sati arises it knows the differences between 
the moments with sati and those without.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: The five khandha in 
ordinary people are the same as those in the arahanta.&nbsp; But the five 
khandha of the ordinary people are full of upadana that causes dukkha.&nbsp; So 
if we are careful when there is contact, between the eyes and rupa, the ears and 
sound, and we are mindful, would it be the correct way to develop 
sati?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: The right way to 
develop sati is to know that all realities are anatta, thereby knowing the 
instant sati arises, and which it does not.&nbsp; But if there is a self to 
being careful, it would not be sati-patthana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: The word "<B>anatta" 
</B>is like [the simile] "the hair that hides the mountain".&nbsp; Some people 
know the meaning of <B>"anatta"</B> or <B>"atta"</B>.&nbsp; But there are as 
many answers given as the number of people asked.&nbsp; Most say that anatta is 
not the self though they believe the self to exist.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: What is the 
self?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: Let's say that we are 
still ourselves but the Buddha said there are only the five khandha 
assembled.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: Since we khandha, we 
are not the selves.&nbsp; But since we did not know we were khandha, we mistook 
them as the selves.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: Even knowing this, 
when we see through the eyes, we say that we are the ones who 
see.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: That is because we had 
not fully realized the characteristics of khandha, that the khandha is a reality 
that arises and falls away very rapidly so it is categorized as past, future and 
present, inside and outside, coarse and fine, of low or high quality, far or 
near.&nbsp; When one has fully realized the true characteristics of khandha, one 
would know that each characteristic of realities that arise and fall away is 
only either rupa-, vedana-, sanna-, sankhara- or 
vinnana-khandha.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: Please explain how 
positions hide dukkha.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: To say positions hide 
dukkha, one must understand that it intends the dukkha-lakkhana of all 
realities, not only the dukkha-vedana.&nbsp; Though we may be seated, lying down 
or walking without yet feeling tired, [physical] positions hide the 
characteristics of dukkha which is the arising and falling away of nama-dhamma 
and rupa-dhamma, that arise concurrently in specific positions.&nbsp; The panna 
that fully realizes the arising and falling of the nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma 
does not know one position and then change to another position.&nbsp; Thus it is 
said that the positions hide dukkha.&nbsp; And if that were the case, one must 
say that to change position hides dukkha, which is not to know that it is the 
positions that hide dukkha.&nbsp; The reason that the Buddha-dhamma manifested 
that positions or stances hide dukkha is because the concurrent arising of nama 
and rupa as different positions would hide [from our knowledge] the 
characteristics of distinct rupa and nama that are arising and falling away 
continuously.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Some people admit 
that when they were asked after they just sat down whether it was dukkha, they 
answered no.&nbsp; Since there was no suffering, how can positions hide 
it?&nbsp; Without dukkha, one cannot say that positions hide dukkha.&nbsp; Only 
when there is dukkha can one say so.&nbsp; In reality, even though our positions 
are without dukkha-vedana, it already is hiding dukkha because one does not see 
the arising and falling away of nama and rupa at that instant.&nbsp; Without the 
development of panna to know the characteristics of nama and rupa, one 
mistakenly understood that one knows the dukkha before changing positions.&nbsp; 
What dukkha?&nbsp; When one does not even know the characteristics that is not 
the self of the eye consciousness and visual objects, ear consciousness and 
sound, nose consciousness and smell, tongue consciousness and taste, bodysense 
consciousness and bodysense contact, or thinking, happy or unhappy feelings 
etc.&nbsp; When one does not even know that the reality that thinks of changing 
positions is not the self, but a kind of nama-dhamma that arises and falls 
away.&nbsp; Since one is not mindful of the characteristics of nama-dhamma and 
rupa-dhamma normally as they truly are, panna would not be able to grow full, 
level by level.&nbsp; Then one would be unable to clearly realize dukkha- 
ariya-sacca since panna has not yet fully realized the characteristics of 
nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: Whenever there is 
sati, there is only dukkha that appears, and not the separation of rupa and nama

little educated and practiced only a little at practice centers.&nbsp; I have

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: Yes, somewhat.&nbsp; 
Since normally when we stay at home, a lot of akusala-citta arise.&nbsp; But 
when we go to practice centers, we meet good kalyanamittata (good company), 
quiet and peaceful place, so kusala-citta arise a lot: this is useful, I

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: Sotapattiyamga or the 
principal dhamma in the attainment of sotapanna comprises four components: 1) 
keeping company with sappurisa (the wise and virtuous) 2) listening to their 
dhamma&nbsp; 3) correctly considering the dhamma heard&nbsp; 4) practicing the 
dhamma accordingly.&nbsp; There is no location involved.&nbsp; Therefore we 
should go back to the time of the Buddha to consider the subject of practice 
centers to compare whether practice centers these days are like the one in the 
Buddhist order.&nbsp; In the Buddhist order in the past, the bhikkhu went to 
gather alms, discussed the dhamma, performed various functions according to the 
vinayapannati.&nbsp; The Buddha praised all forms of kusala.&nbsp; <B>But do the 
people at practice centers these days practice the same things as the Buddhist 
order then, or do they do more or differently?</B>&nbsp; If the causes or the 
practices differ, can the results be the same?&nbsp; In the times of the Buddha, 
lay people, such as Anathapindika the millionaire, went to the great vihara of 
Jetavana, which he had constructed, but they did not misunderstand that one can 
only attain supreme knowledge uniquely in those locations because they attained 
such knowledge and nibbana at different places according to their distinct 
normal daily lives.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

superstitions; 2) because they are possessed by coarse desire; 3) because they

Some think that one could realize the ariya-sacca-dhamma by staying in a 
forest.&nbsp; Those who believe so are they not forest-dwellers because of 
ignorance and superstitions?&nbsp; When one understands the reasons, one would 
see that no life is superior to that of an ordained person who gives up the life 
of a lay person for that of the Buddhist order, which is not to go to a practice 
center for a few moments in order to attain the supreme knowledge because they 
believe that to practice vipassana, which is not one's real normal behavior, 
would be the cause for the full realization of the ariya-sacca-dhamma.&nbsp; If 
that were so the laypersons who go to a practice center would be more 
praiseworthy than the bhikkhu in the Buddhist order who led normal life

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: I understand that it 
is not habitual but is it not appropriate to force oneself?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: One must consider the 
reason correctly.&nbsp; There are many bhikkhu who do not live in the 
forest.&nbsp; The Buddha never forced anyone to develop sati-patthana in the 
forest, or in the room, or in the place where one is not allowed to do 
anything.&nbsp; He praised dwelling in the forest, not mingling.&nbsp; He 
praised everything that is not paccaya for lobha, dosa and moha to arise but did 
not force or set down rules in developing panna because he knew the nature of 
worldly creatures.&nbsp;&nbsp; He manifested the dhamma so the Buddhist order 
might understand the dhamma correctly, to decorticate the kilesa, which really 
is there normally, by developing sati-patthana as an ordained or a 
layperson.&nbsp; When sati is mindful examines and studies the characteristics 
of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma more and more gradually, one can see that the old 
habit of being pleasantly laid along by the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense 
and mind by lobha, dosa and moha little by little is a real habit, not great 
momentary waves.&nbsp; It is not as some people say that the place of practice 
should not be painted because it induces lobha, but when they return home they 
paint their houses, plant trees and flowers according to their own real 
accumulated habits.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The supremely enlightened 
Buddha manifested the dhamma, which is sacca-dhamma or the truth, in order that 
right view arises in the causes and results of realities.&nbsp; He manifested 
the development of panna with the development of sati-patthana in order to 
attenuate the anusaya-kilesa, which is always present in the citta, continuously 
arising and falling away from the innumerable past lives to the present.&nbsp; 
Avijja, the ignorance of the characteristics of reality and the wrong view that 
used to mistake realities as the self, is an anusaya-kilesa.&nbsp; We always 
take the instant of seeing, hearing, tasting, knowing bodysense contact, feeling 
happy or unhappy as the self.&nbsp; Therefore the only way to abandon 
anusaya-kilesa is by developing sati-patthana.&nbsp; [One should] examine to 
know the characteristics of what is appearing and gradually clearly realize 
[what they are] level by level until the first level of vipassana-nana or 
nama-rupa-paricchedanana, which is the perfection of panna that fully realizes 
the distinct characteristics of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma that appears in the 
instant.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The development of panna 
is not the creation of dukkha by sitting, lying down, standing or walking for

through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind normally as they really 
are, which had arisen because of conditions no matter where one

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>S: The development of 
panna is a very intricate matter.&nbsp; Not everyone who reads the commentaries 
can practice it.&nbsp; Where is the door?&nbsp; If one does not know where the 
door is, how can one enter through it.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: The doorways are kaya, 
vedana, citta and dhamma.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: Since the doorways are 
kaya, vedana, citta and dhamma, what do we know through the kaya?&nbsp; One must 
conscientiously examine this.&nbsp; All dhamma, no matter whether it is khandha, 
ayatana, dhatu or ariya-sacca, are not entities, people or the selves because 
they are nama-dhamma, consciousness, or rupa-dhamma or non-consciousness.&nbsp; 
To understand this is not to clearly realize the characteristics of non-self of 
nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma.&nbsp; At the level of listening there is no more 
uncertainty the existence of rupa-dhamma. Rupa arises and appears through the 
eyes as distinct colors; sound is the rupa that appears through the ears; smell 
is the rupa that appears through the nose; taste through the tongue etc. 
Nama-dhamma is also real and arises to know different arammana.&nbsp; One can 
correctly understand at the level of listening but to know the characteristics 
of nama-dhamma that is a consciousness, the dhatu that knows, the knowing.&nbsp; 
How can it know unless it is mindful of the characteristics of 
consciousness?&nbsp; Therefore can developing&nbsp; kayanupassana-satipatthana 
alone make us realize the characteristics of nama-dhamma?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The sati in those who 
develop panna would be mindful of the characteristics of consciousness in the 
instant of seeing, would examine and study to know that it is only a 
consciousness.&nbsp; When hearing, they would be mindful to examine and 
understand the characteristics of the nama-dhamma that hears, to really know at 
that instant it is the consciousness that knows sound.&nbsp; When sati has been 
developed to examine, understand and know the characteristics of nama-dhamma 
through the eyes, ears, etc. often panna would know that there are still other 
nama-dhamma to be mindful of, until the characteristics of nama-dhamma, which is 
a consciousness or the knowing, would really appear to clearly realize that it 
is only a consciousness, the knowing, not the entity, person or 
self.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>If ever anyone would be 
mindful only of the characteristics of the nama-dhamma that hears but not that 
of seeing at all, with the intention to endeavor to know only the 
characteristics of the nama-dhamma that hears sound, can they understand the 
characteristics of the reality, which is a consciousness, while they see?&nbsp; 
Anyone can prove it for themselves that they cannot.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Therefore to develop 
panna by sati being mindful and examine and study to know the characteristics of 
nama-dhamma through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind, is towards 
the full realization of the characteristics of realities that is consciousness 
until there are no more questions.&nbsp; When sati arises and panna examines and 
knows the characteristics of nama-dhamma through the eyes as well as ears, nose, 
tongue, bodysense and mind thoroughly and gradually clarify all questions 
concerning the characteristics of nama-dhatu, which is the element that knows 
until panna, the clear knowledge of the characteristics of realities would 
accumulate level by level.&nbsp; <B>But if anyone wants to know only one nama it 
means that he would still be ignorant and uncertainty about other 
nama-dhamma.</B>&nbsp; Therefore to eliminate questions and ignorance about the 
characteristics of the dhatu of knowledge, it is impossible to know only the 
characteristics of one nama-dhamma.&nbsp; If one were really to know only one 
nama-dhamma, it means one surely would not know realities about the 
others.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: At the level of 
listening they would understand what they have heard, and when they practice, 
they would pass the nama-rupa-paricchedanana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: Pass 
how?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: I was not talking 
about myself.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: Therefore one should 
not be impressed by others' passing [anything].&nbsp; It has to be your own 
panna that examines and knows that the panna that has been developed 
increasingly until it becomes paccaya for vipassananana to arise would fully 
realize the characteristics of rupa-dhamma and nama-dhamma that are appearing as 
they normally do one at a time through the mano-dvara.&nbsp; It would realize 
the distinct characteristics of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma that are appearing, 
not only that of one nama-dhamma or rupa-dhamma.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: Those who have 
practiced until they reach nibbida-nana, practiced by looking at the seated, 
reclining, standing or walking rupa, I wonder how they do that?&nbsp; What is 
the practice that makes them attain nibbida-nana?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: Without knowing what 
the nama-rupa-paricchedanana is, it is impossible to attain nibbida-nana.&nbsp; 
Kayanupassana-satipatthana is the instant sati is mindful of the characteristics 
of rupa-paramattha-dhamma, which appears through the bodysense one at a time: 
rupa that is cold, heat, softness, hardness, tension or motion, not to watch 
rupa in a seated, reclining, standing or walking position.&nbsp; When cold 
appears to the bodysense, it is only a reality that is cold, therefore it is not 
us, not ours, nor the self.&nbsp; If one is ignorant of the characteristics of 
rupa-dhamma that appears through each dvara as only the rupa that appears 
through each dvara, one could never reach nama-rupa-paricchedanana and since 
panna has not reached nama-rupa-paricchedanana, it cannot reach 
nibbida-nana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: In the Book of 
Sampajanna, it is manifested that when we stand, we should know we are standing, 
when we walk, we should know we are walking and when we sit we should know we 
are sitting or bending or stretching, we should know the characteristics and 
features of these actions.&nbsp; The phrase 'when we walk, we should know we are 
walking', can it not mean that we practice the rupa that 
walks?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: If there were no rupa, 
can there be walking?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: With no rupa, there 
would be only air and air cannot walk.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: While walking, there 
can be rupa of distinct characteristics appearing to be known through each 
dvara.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: Isn't it the rupa that 
walks?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: The rupa that appears, 
whether while sitting, reclining, standing or walking, must appear through one 
way or the other: the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense or mind, without 
specifications, by being anatta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: This is intentional 
because in the commentary it is compared with entering the city gate.&nbsp; Any 
gate would give access to the city center.&nbsp; Therefore they only develop 
kayanupassana-sati-patthana, rejecting other patthana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: When we read the 
commentaries we must keep in mind what the panna, that can really abandon wrong 
view that mistakes reality as the self, knows.&nbsp; There are two realities, 
which are rupa-dhamma and nama-dhamma.&nbsp; If one does not clearly realize the 
characteristics of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma, one would still mistake both as 
the self.&nbsp; In the statement that says 'while walking, we should know that 
we walk', in reality there is no 'we', only the rupa.&nbsp; The instant 
sati-patthana is mindful of the characteristics of the rupa through the 
bodysense which appears as we walk is also kayanupassana-sati-patthana.&nbsp; 
But to force sati to be mindful of the rupa that appears through the bodysense 
all the time is impossible, it would depend on sati, which is anatta, and would 
arise to be mindful of the characteristics of any nama-dhamma or rupa-dhamma 
that arises and appears normally as they truly are.&nbsp; The panna that 
abandons the attachment that mistakes reality as the self knows the 
characteristics of nama-dhamma or rupa-dhamma that arises and appears through 
all six dvara.&nbsp; Then would clearly realize that they are truly not the 
self.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>In the Samyuttanikaya 
Salayattanavagga 3rd Samuddavagga Udayisutta 300, there is a passage 
saying:</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Once the Venerable Ananda 
and the Venerable Udayi were residing at Ghositaram near the city of 
Kosampi.&nbsp; One evening the Venerable Udayi left his lodging and went to the 
Venerable Ananda's.&nbsp; After exchanging greetings he sat down in an 
appropriate place and asked the Venerable Ananda, "Behold, Venerable Ananda, the 
body.&nbsp; The Buddha told us, revealed to us and manifested in several manners 
the reason why the body is anatta.&nbsp; But the soul, did he also tell, 
manifest, decree, establish, reveal, categorize, render fathomable, the reason 
why the soul is also anatta?"</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;When there is no 
clear knowledge in the reality that is nama-dhamma, there is still 
uncertainty.&nbsp; Since there is still uncertainty, how can there be the 
realization of the ariya-sacca-dhamma?&nbsp; Which doorway to enter? <B>The door 
mentioned means the instant the lokuttara-citta arises to realize nibbana.</B> 
Before the lokuttara-citta can arise, the kamavacara-citta must do so, depending 
on which of the four sati-patthana the kamavacara-citta has as arammana.&nbsp; 
Not that without clear realization of the characteristics of rupa, vedana, 
sanna, sankhara, vinnana, one would still be able to attain ariya-sacca-dhamma 
and realize the characteristics of nibbana by having nibbana as arammana.&nbsp; 
And until one understands that the kaya is anatta… even the vinnana is also 
anatta, the characteristics of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma, at the instant of 
seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, knowing bodysense contact and thinking now, 
must be told, manifested, decreed, established, revealed, categorized, made 
fathomable to us.&nbsp; This is because it is difficult to understand the 
meaning and to clearly realize the characteristics of realities that are 
anatta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The Venerable Ananda 
said, "Behold Venerable Udayi, the body, about which the Buddha told us, 
revealed to us and manifested in several manners the reason why the body is 
anatta.&nbsp; And in the same way, I could tell, manifest, decree, establish, 
reveal, categorize, render fathomable, the reason why the soul is also 
anatta."</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Had the Venerable Ananda 
not been a sotapanna-puggala, he would not have clearly realized the 
characteristics of all rupa-dhamma and nama-dhamma thoroughly and completely 
until he is able to abandon the wrong view that mistakes nama-dhamma and 
rupa-dhamma as the self, entity and person, nor would he have been able to say 
to the Venerable Udayi that "I could tell, manifest, decree, establish, reveal, 
categorize, render fathomable, the reason why the soul is also 
anatta."</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Therefore <B>whenever a 
person has attained a certain dhamma, that dhamma would appear to that 
person</B>.&nbsp; Now realities arise and fall away very rapidly.&nbsp; Since a 
person has not attained realization of the dhamma, that dhamma would not appear 
to that person.&nbsp; No matter how much that person is told that dhamma is a 
consciousness, the dhatu that knows in the instant of seeing, hearing, but since 
that person has not yet achieved that dhamma, that dhamma would not appear to 
him.&nbsp; Once the dhamma has appeared to that person, he would clearly realize 
the true characteristics of dhamma.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The venerable Ananda no 
longer questioned the characteristics of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma whether 
through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind.&nbsp; If a 
contemporary thinks that knowing only kayanupassana-sati-patthana, or only one 
nama or one rupa [is sufficient], is that really enough to say that he knows the 
true characteristics of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma?&nbsp; If he really knew it, 
why did he not know it through the eyes, since through the eyes there is the 
nama-dhamma that is the dhatu that knows, that is seeing?&nbsp; Why did he not 
know it through the ears since through the ears there is the nama-dhamma that is 
the dhatu that knows, that is hearing?&nbsp; If he really knew the 
characteristics of nama-dhamma, clearly realize the dhatu that knows, the 
knowing, why does he not know that thinking is only a nama-dhamma that is 
knowing events and words?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>To test panna to see 
whether one <B>really knows</B>, no matter which nama-dhamma or rupa-dhamma 
through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense or mind, one must know the 
characteristics of nama-dhamma, which is different from rupa-dhamma, while 
seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, knowing bodysense contact, or thinking, to 
be able to truly know the meaning and the characteristics of all realities as 
they are as anatta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The Venerable Ananda said 
to the Venerable Udayi, "Behold Venerable Udayi, does the cakkhu-vinnana arise 
because of the eyes and rupa?"</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Udayi: "That is so, 
sir."</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Ananda: "The causes and 
conditions from which cakkhu-vinnana arises, having fallen away, not the 
slightest bit remaining, would the cakkhu-vinnana appear 
then?"</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Udayi: "Not at all, 
sir."</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>In the instant of hearing 
there is no seeing.&nbsp; This is to realize the characteristics of realities as 
they truly are.&nbsp; In the instant of thinking thoughts, there is no seeing, 
no hearing, because of that instant there is knowledge of thoughts.&nbsp; The 
reality that knows is thinking thoughts at that moment.&nbsp; This is the 
realization of the characteristics of realities as they truly are. The Venerable 
Ananda therefore said to the Venerable Udayi that when cakkhu-vinnana or seeing 
arise because of cakkhu, or the eyes, and what appears through the eyes, since 
cakkhu and rupa are impermanent and has fallen away, how can there be 
seeing?&nbsp; The seeing must also fall away.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;At this instant for 
those who truly realize the characteristics of the reality that knows, the dhatu 
that knows as nama-rupa-paricchedanana, to develop panna unto the level of 
nibbida-nana, panna must develop until it knows the paccaya of realities that 
had arisen and attained paccayapariggaha-nana.&nbsp; Then panna could be 
developed further until it realizes the arising and falling away of realities 
that continue in sequence as sammasana-nana.&nbsp; Then panna would have to be 
developed further until it realizes the arising and falling away, the complete 
separation of each characteristic of each reality as udayabbaya-nana.&nbsp; Then 
further to the realization of the impermanence of&nbsp; realities that keep 
falling away as bhanga-nana.&nbsp; Further still to the realization of the harm 
of the falling away of realities as bhaya-nana, and then as adinava-nana.&nbsp; 
Even further to the level of realization of nibbida-nana.&nbsp; Panna must 
clearly realize by experiencing the characteristics of realities.&nbsp; One 
cannot enter the gates of nibbana by knowing only the position of sitting, 
reclining, standing or walking which are merely remembering rupa that arise 
together in the distinct features and positions, and not the knowledge of the 
characteristics that arise and appear through different doorways and then fall 
away as they normally do in reality.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The Venerable Ananda 
said, "As in this description of the cakkhu-vinnana by the Buddha, who told, 
revealed, manifested that this is the reason why the vinnana is anatta 
etc.&nbsp; The same applies to sota-vinnana, ghana-vinnana, jivha-vinnana, 
kaya-vinnana and mano-vinnana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;This sutta shows 
the benefits of the Buddha's meticulous manifestation of the dhamma about 
vinnana, which are nama-dhamma.&nbsp; If one is able to realize the 
ariya-sacca-dhamma with only one sati-patthana, why would the Buddha have 
manifested so extensively the other dhamma about seeing, hearing, smelling, 
tasting, knowing bodysense contact, thinking, happiness, unhappiness, memory, 
etc.&nbsp; All this is to help sati to be mindful, panna to examine, study, 
clearly know until it is able to completely eradicate uncertainty and wrong view 
that is attached to nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma.&nbsp; And to say that one can 
clearly realize the ariya-sacca-dhamma without knowing the characteristics of 
nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma as they normally, truly are, shows the doubt that 
one can know other nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma.&nbsp; Otherwise one would not 
say just know only one nama or rupa.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The Venerable Ananda 
said, "Behold, Venerable Udayi, a man desiring the wood core, seeking the wood 
core, takes a sharp axe into the forest.&nbsp; He finds a great banana plant, 
straight and free from twines.&nbsp; He cuts the base of the trunk, cuts the top 
and then peels off the layers but could not find even the sapwood, so how could 
he find the core?&nbsp; So behold, Venerable</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Udayi, neither can a bhikkhu 
examine and search to find the self or anything of the self in the six 
phassayatana.&nbsp; Seeing thus, he would not cling to anything in the 
world.&nbsp; Not clinging, he would not struggle.&nbsp; Since he does not 
struggle, he would reach nibbana, know clearly that rebirths are over, the 
chaste life is led, the task is done, other functions towards being thus do not 
exist.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The last part where the 
Venerable Ananda said, "Behold, Venerable Udayi, a man desiring the wood core, 
seeking the wood core, takes a sharp axe into the forest.&nbsp; He finds a great 
banana plant, straight and free from twines.&nbsp; Since it is a banana plant, 
it is still a position, for it is collective, a 
composition.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>"He cuts the base of the 
trunk, cuts the top and then peels off the layers" means he must disperse what 
he used to take as a whole, a conglomerate, an object, the self, a position. 
"But could not find even the sapwood, so how could he find the core?"&nbsp; Thus 
he is able to abandon mistaking it as a banana tree.&nbsp; Likewise, a whole ox 
with the skin unstripped, parts uncut, is still seen as an ox lying there.&nbsp; 
As long as rupa are assembled together, they are remembered as a position, a 
stance or another and still seen as an object, a person.&nbsp; Only when one 
knows the characteristics of realities as they truly are, could not one mistake 
realities as entities or persons, like the peeling of layers when no sapwood can 
be found, much less the core of the tree. "Behold, Venerable Udayi, neither can 
a bhikkhu examine and search to find the self or anything of the self in the six 
phassayatana."&nbsp; In the six phassayatana there are no positions.&nbsp; The 
eye is one ayatana.&nbsp; Rupayatana is only something that appears.&nbsp; As 
long as one still sees it as a person sitting, it cannot be said that it is not 
the self.&nbsp; It is only thinking that it is not the self.&nbsp; It is not the 
true realization that it is not the self when panna must know that this instant 
of seeing sees only what appears through the eyes.&nbsp; After that there is 
thinking or remembering the features of what appears and then the recognition of 
what appears.&nbsp; Even then it's only the nama-dhamma that knows and 
remembers, not an entity, a person or the self.&nbsp; Through the ears that are 
hearing sound, there are no memory remaining from the eyes that they were seeing 
people, conversing or talking because at that instant sati is being mindful of 
the characteristics of the reality that hears, which is only an element that 
knows sound.&nbsp; After which the citta would think of words or thoughts 
according to the high and low sound they hear and panna would know that the 
instant of knowing words is the nama-dhamma of the kind that knows 
words.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Once one realizes that 
all realities are nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma of distinct characteristics, the 
wrong view that mistakes realities for the self would be attenuated and the 
memory that mistakes rupa as a whole conglomerate in a position would cease and 
one would understand the meaning of <B>"inner peace"</B>.&nbsp; This is because 
the citta do not concern themselves with the external, which is the self, humans 
or animals.&nbsp; The old world, which is the outer world full of people, things 
that used to be mistaken as permanent and eternal persons, objects or 
things.&nbsp; The instant sati arises panna would clearly know, so the instant 
is inner peace because there are no persons, entities or objects of any 
kind.&nbsp; There is no peace because there are lots of people and events.&nbsp; 
If there has been interrelationship with the person, just to see him there is a 
long connection of thoughts.&nbsp; If it were someone one has never known, the 
connections of thoughts are shorter.&nbsp; After seeing, there is only a little 
thought, and that is all.&nbsp; It does not continue as various 
stories.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>When there is real 
development of panna, one would see the beneficence of the Buddha who manifested 
the dhamma in detail from the level of patimokkhasamvara-sila, the appropriate 
physical and verbal code of conduct of the bhikkhu or the ordained, peaceful 
person, who should look ahead only the distance of an oxbow, so that they should 
be mindful that thoughts should not be continued and lengthened: after seeing, 
one should not complexly identify the person or the events in multiple 
continuous thoughts.&nbsp; After seeing, one should know it is 
only</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT 
size=+1><B>"seeing"</B>, whether it is within the distance of an oxbow or not, 
once one has seen, it is over.&nbsp; At that instant there would be no 
attachment to, or concern about nimitta and anubyanjana,</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>When panna clearly 
realizes that what used to be seen as the outside world with a multitude of 
people is because of thoughts.&nbsp; If there were no thinking but seeing and 
then nothing, would there be many people?&nbsp; But because we are so used to 
thinking, we would think, depending on what of.&nbsp; To see the same thing, one 
would think differently according to the causes and conditions 
accumulated.&nbsp; For example, a flower: a person might be pleased with the 
beauty while another does not think it is pretty.&nbsp; Therefore beautiful or 
not beautiful are personal thoughts.&nbsp; The real world is, therefore, the 
world of individual thoughts.&nbsp; When sati is really mindful of the 
characteristics of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma, one would clearly know that the 
instant is only the nama-dhamma that is thinking diverse thoughts no matter what 
about.&nbsp; When one knows the characteristics of the nama-dhamma that thinks, 
one would know that relations involving people and entities do not really 
exist.&nbsp; The instant there is dukkha or worry one would know that it is 
dukkha because of thoughts.&nbsp; The instant of happiness likewise, while 
watching programs that we like on television, there is happiness because one 
thinks according to the pictures one sees.&nbsp; Therefore no matter the place 
one is still in the world of thoughts.&nbsp; Each instant of the world is, 
therefore, only the nama-dhamma that arises to know arammana that appears 
through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense or mind followed by thoughts 
through the mind in continuation as different relations.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

towards the arising of panna to know realities that are appearing now as usual 
as they truly are.&nbsp; No matter the amount of listening, learning, conversing 
and contemplating the dhamma, all this is to be sankharakkhandha composing the 
sati to arise and be mindful, to examine and know the characteristics of 
realities that are appearing through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and 
mind at this very moment.&nbsp; Though one has heard this again and&nbsp; again, 
one must examine to understand the characteristics of each reality that truly 
appears, which sati must be mindful of otherwise one would not be able to study 
and examine to know the characteristics of realities that are anatta in each of 
the passing day, which are nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma that arise and fall away 
at each instant with no remnant.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Everyone knows that the 
pleasant and unpleasant past that had arisen have all fallen away.&nbsp; There 
remains only the present instant, only a single instant in reality, which one 
must study to understand the characteristics that are not the selves, entities 
or persons.&nbsp; Some people desire not to meet this or that person in the next 
lifetime, which a person who understands the dhamma would not do.&nbsp; In the 
next lifetime there would not be that person or what is understood as this 
person in this lifetime any longer.&nbsp; Only in this lifetime is there still 
this person or that person.&nbsp; After death there is definitely no more being 
this person or that person of the present lifetime.&nbsp; In the next lifetime 
there must be entirely different people.&nbsp; Therefore do not worry that one 
might meet this or that person again, it is impossible because the state of 
being a certain person does not follow one to the next 
lifetime.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>If one were still angry 
or discontent with any person, one should understand the truth that there is no 
such person at all but only realities that are citta, cetasika and rupa that 
arise and fall away.&nbsp; All lives are there only for an 
instant.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>It is useful to think 
about death often to develop sati-patthana.&nbsp; To be</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;mindful that one 
might die this evening or tomorrow can be paccaya assisting sati to be mindful 
and know the characteristics of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma that is appearing 
since for those who have not clearly realized the ariyasacca-dhamma as 
ariyapuggala, it is uncertain where the rebirth will take place, in the 
sugati-bhumi or dukhati-bhumi or whether one would have another chance to hear 
the dhamma and develop sati-patthana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Death takes away all that 
is the present lifetime.&nbsp; There is nothing left, not even the memory 
thereof.&nbsp; Even as one cannot remember who, where, or what we were in the 
past life when we were reborn in this one, ending being that person in the past 
life completely, so in this lifetime no matter what kusala-kamma, akusala-kamma 
one has done as a person with mana (self importance) in his extraction, 
properties, honor, fame or anything else would all be gone.&nbsp; There would be 
no ties left to this world and this lifetime at all.&nbsp; There would no longer 
be attachment to each instant of this lifetime as <B>"us"</B> any 
longer.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>To clearly realize and 
experience the true characteristics of paramattha-dhamma would take away this 
clinging and mistaking realities that arise because of conditions as entities, 
persons or the selves.&nbsp; Even the memory that has arisen and fallen away 
would only be a kind of nama-dhamma.&nbsp; The sati that is mindful of the 
characteristics of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma until panna realizes and 
experiences the reality, would take away the self, the being this person in this 
lifetime when one realizes the characteristics of khanika-marana of all 
realities since marana or death are of three kinds comprising&nbsp; 1) 
khanika-marana 2) sammati-marana 3) samuccheda-marana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The <B>khanika-marana</B> 
is the arising and falling away of all sankhara-dhamma.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The 
<B>sammati-marana</B> is death in a world, a lifetime.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
