<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Classifying citta as 
lokiya-citta<B> and lokuttara-citta</B>.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>First, one should 
understand the meaning of the word <B>"loka"</B> in the discipline of the 
ariya-puggala as manifested by the Buddha in the Samyuttanikaya Salayatana 
Channavagga 4th Palokasutta where there is the following 
passage:</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;(101) Then the 
reverend Ananda entered the audience of the Buddha and asked "Sire, what is the 
reason why we call this world 'loka'?"&nbsp; The Buddha said, "Behold, Ananda, 
what is common to destruction is called 'loka' in the ariya-vinaya.&nbsp; And 
what is common to destruction?&nbsp; The eye is common to destruction. Rupa is 
common to destruction. Cakkhu-vinnana is common to destruction. Cakkhu contact 
is common to destruction.&nbsp; Sukha-vedana, dukkha-vedana or 
adukkhamasukha-vedana that arises from cakkhu contact as paccaya is common to 
destruction etc., likewise through the ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and 
mind.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>This is common to the 
ariya-puggala, but not to those who have not yet realized the rising and falling 
away of realities.&nbsp; Therefore one could see that those who are to become 
the ariya-puggala must realize the arising and falling away of realities that 
truly appear.&nbsp; The Buddha said, "Behold Ananda, whatever is common to 
destruction is called 'loka' in the ariya-vinaya."&nbsp; Loka is everything that 
arises and falls away.&nbsp; Therefore only realities that do not rise and fall 
away are not loka, but the reality that is above and beyond the world, the 
lokuttara or nibbana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>When citta is categorized 
as lokiya and lokuttara, any citta that does not realize the characteristics of 
nibbana or does not have nibbana as arammana is a <B>"lokiya-citta".&nbsp; Any 
citta with nibbana as arammana by eradicating kilesa or with nibbana as arammana 
by having eradicated kilesa is a " lokuttara-citta".</B></FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Those who would be the 
ariya-puggala must develop lokiya-panna, which knows the characteristics of 
nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma. Lokiya- panna is not the knowledge for construction 
of new scientific instruments, knowing anything other than the characteristics 
of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma is not lokiya- panna in the Buddhist 
religion.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Lokiya-panna knows the 
characteristics of the world or the realities that appear through the eyes, 
ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind that is not nibbana.&nbsp; Therefore 
other than the four magga-citta, which are lokuttara-kusala-citta with nibbana 
as arammana by eradicating kilesa, and the four phala-citta, which are 
lokuttara-vipaka-citta with nibbana as arammana after the eradication of kilesa, 
all citta are lokiya-citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;There 
  are altogether 8 lokuttara-citta consisting of 4 pairs:</FONT></FONT></FONT>

  and&nbsp; Arahatta phala-citta</FONT></FONT></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT 
face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>When the Sotapatti-magga-citta has 
arisen and eradicated kilesa with nibbana as arammana and has fallen away, the 
Sotapatti-phala-citta, having eradicated kilesa, arises in continuation with 
nibbana as arammana.&nbsp; The Sotapatti-magga-citta is a lokuttara-kusala-citta 
and paccaya for lokuttara-vipaka-citta or the Sotapatti-phala-citta to arise in 
continuation immediately after the Sotapatti-magga-citta without any citta 
arising in between.&nbsp; The result of the lokuttara-kusala is immediate, 
akaliko, one does not have to wait until a future life for it.&nbsp; None of the 
other kusala or akusala can give result as soon as it falls away like the 
lokuttara-kusala.&nbsp; Those who develop samatha-bhavana until they attain the 
level of jhana-kusala-citta still would not have jhana-vipaka-citta arise while 
they are humans because the jhana-vipaka-citta performs patisandhi-kicca, 
bhavanga-kicca and cuti-kicca in the Brahma world.&nbsp; In those whose 
jhana-citta do not dissipate the jhana-kusala-citta would arise before the 
cuti-citta and when the cuti-citta falls away the jhana-kusala-citta that 
precedes it would be paccaya for the jhana-vipaka-citta to perform 
patisandhi-kicca in the bhumi of one Brahma world or another.&nbsp; For example, 
the pathama-jhana-kusala-citta is paccaya for pathama-jhana-vipaka-citta to 
perform patisandhi-kicca in the pathama-jhana-brahma-bhumi and respectively 
higher unto the arupa-jhana-kusala or the akasanancayatana-kusala-citta which is 
paccaya for akasanancayatana-vipaka-citta to perform patisandhi in the 
akasanancayatana-bhumi.&nbsp; Higher still level by level is where the 
nevasannanasannayatana-kusala-citta is paccaya for 
nevasannanasannayatana-vipaka-citta to perform patisandhi-kicca in the 
nevasannanasannayatana-bhumi.&nbsp; All other kamma are followed by innumerable 
citta before it is time for the results to arise.&nbsp; The only kamma that 
results immediately without any other citta arising in between is the 
lokuttara-kusala-kamma.&nbsp; As soon as the lokuttara-kusala-citta has fallen 
away, the lokuttara-vipaka-citta arises immediately in continuation because 
lokuttara-vipaka-citta does not perform patisandhi-kicca, bhavanga-kicca, 
cuti-kicca or any other kicca like other vipaka-citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>In the Atthasalini 
Atthakatha Dhammasangani Cittuppadakandha explaining Culantaraduka, there is a 
passage saying</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Called 
<B>"lokiya-dhamma"</B> because it is part of the world, related to the 
world.&nbsp; Called <B>"uttara-dhamma"</B> or supreme-dhamma because it

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Citta, cetasika and rupa 
are sankhara-dhamma, realities that arise and fall away.&nbsp; Even the 
lokuttara citta and cetasika with nibbana as arammana must arise and fall 
away.&nbsp; But one categorizes citta and cetasika as lokiya- and 
lokuttara-citta because the lokuttara-citta has nibbana as arammana by 
eradicating kilesa (magga-citta) and by having eradicated kilesa 
(phala-citta).</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The passage in 
Khuddakanikaya Culaniddesa Second Part Mogharajamanavakapanhaniddesa is in 
accordance with the Samyuttanikaya Salayattanavagga Sunnasutta, 102, which 
says:</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Then the reverend Ananda 
asked the Buddha, "Sire, what is the reason why we call the world 
'empty'?"&nbsp; The Buddha said, "Behold, Ananda, because it is empty of the 
self or that belonging to the self.&nbsp; What is empty of the self or of that 
belonging to the self?&nbsp; The eye is empty of the self or of that belonging 
to the self. Rupa is empty of the self or of that belonging to the self. 
Cakkhu-vinnana is empty of the self or of that belonging to the self. Cakkhu 
contact is empty of the self or of that belonging to the self.&nbsp; 
Sukha-vedana, dukkha-vedana or adukkhamasukha-vedana that arises from cakkhu 
contact as paccaya is empty of the self or of that belonging to the self etc. 
The heart is empty of the self or of that belonging to the self.&nbsp; 
Dhammarammana is empty of the self or of that belonging to the self.&nbsp; 
Mano-vinnana is empty of the self or of that belonging to the self.&nbsp; Mano 
contact is empty of the self or of that belonging to the self.&nbsp; 
Sukha-vedana, dukkha-vedana or adukkhamasukha-vedana that arises from mano 
contact as paccaya is empty of the self or of that belonging to the self.&nbsp; 
Therefore the world is called empty.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<CENTER><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>End of the Second 
Sunnasutta</FONT></FONT></FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Not that one can 
make things empty without knowing what is empty, what it is empty of, or how it 
is empty.&nbsp; One must know accurately that to be empty of the self or that of 
belonging to the self because each is a reality that arises and falls away, 
through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind.&nbsp; Some might feel 
on some days that there seems to be nothing that is ours.&nbsp; Why have we 
never felt that before?&nbsp; We used to take things for us and ours.&nbsp; But 
all of a sudden one day after listening to a lot of dhamma we start to think 
that there is nothing at all that is ours.&nbsp; We should not have mistaken 
things for ours.&nbsp; But thinking alone is not enough because it cannot 
eradicate kilesa.&nbsp; If we do not know this, we might think we had acquired 
much panna already and are soon to become an ariya-puggala because we have never 
thought or felt this way before.&nbsp; Some feel that it is a wonder to think so 
but one should know that that is not the path to the eradication of kilesa since 
one does not know the characteristics of nama-dhamma, which is a consciousness 
that is seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, knowing bodysense contact and 
thinking etc.&nbsp; How is it the self?&nbsp; When one has not yet been mindful, 
not yet studied, examined, taken note, or developed panna to know the 
characteristics of realities appearing, one would not yet penetrate the meaning 
or the true characteristics of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma.&nbsp; Thus one would 
not be able to realize the characteristics of the arising and falling away of 
the nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma that constitute the world that arises and falls 
away at this moment.&nbsp; Therefore, no matter how much we think that we 
understand the characteristics of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma, we should not 
mistake it for panna that is able to eradicate kilesa.&nbsp; Because if sati 
does not arise to be mindful and examine the characteristics of realities that 
appear until there is realization of the distinct characteristics, one by one, 
of the nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma through the mind-door, which is to clearly 
experience the realization, panna would not have developed enough to know that 
<B>all realities are only empty worlds, void of attachment as the selves, 
entities or persons.</B></FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;In the 
Khuddakanikaya Culaniddesa Second Part Mogharajamanavakapanhaniddesa, 505, the

are grass, trees, branches and leaves in the compound of this vihara.&nbsp; 
People would take them away and burn them, or do with them as is 
appropriate.&nbsp; Do you ever feel as if it were us that people take away, burn 
or do what is appropriate to?”</FONT></FONT></FONT>

it,&nbsp; Abandoning it would be beneficent, be everlasting happiness. 
...Abandoning vedana... sanna... sankhara... vinnana would be beneficent, be 
everlasting happiness. A person would consider the world as being void 
thus.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;At the end of the 
passage the Buddha said, “Behold, Householder, when a person sees the concurrent 
arising of all dhamma, the continuance of all sankhara as what they truly are, 
there would be no harm.&nbsp; When a person considers the world in the same way 
that he does the grass and trees with panna , he would not desire existence, the 
self or anything else except for nibbana without patisandhi.&nbsp; The person 
would consider the world as a void thus.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;While we still do 
not feel towards the rupa that we used to take for ours, the vedana or feelings 
that we used to take for ours, sanna or memories that we, so named, are in this 
world, with such duty, or towards all sankhara, whether kusala-dhamma or 
akusala-dhamma, in the same way that we do towards the grass, trees, branches 
and leaves, we would not be able to abandon attachment to realities that are 
rupa, vedana, sanna, sankhara and vinnana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;If one has not 
studied and examined the dhamma that the Buddha manifested, nor developed 
sati-patthana, one cannot be said to know the world, even though one had lived 
in the world for such a long time in number of years or lifetimes.&nbsp; Since 
one does not know the world, one cannot escape it.&nbsp; Even extreme happiness 
cannot last forever because the feeling of happiness occurs an instant of citta 
that arises and falls away.&nbsp; Without the study of realities as they truly 
are, one would not know even what the world is or what it consists of.&nbsp; 
Everyone knows that there are things that appear through the eyes, sound, etc., 
because sound appears when one hears.&nbsp; But without consciousness, the 
element that knows, that is hearing, sound cannot appear.&nbsp; Therefore, 
arammana that appear through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind 
would show us that there is citta, which is consciousness, the element that 
knows which is the world that arises and falls away each instant.&nbsp; And 
without arammana that appears, no one would be able to know the characteristics 
of citta, the element that knows, arises and falls away.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;When one sees, 
hears, smells, tastes, knows bodysense contact without knowing the 
characteristics of realities as they truly are, arising and falling away in 
rapid continuation, one would take the signs and forms of things that appear as 
entities, persons and objects.&nbsp; As long as one has not yet clearly realized 
the characteristics of arising and falling away of each instant of realities as 
they truly are, one cannot be said to know the world as it actually is though 
one has studied the world through different sciences, geographically, 
historically or scientifically for hundreds of millions of zillions of 
years.&nbsp; The sciences could never emancipate us from this world because 
without knowledge of the world one cannot escape it.&nbsp; What substance does 
the world have each day?&nbsp; Sukha-vedana arises and falls away, gone with 
each instant impossible to recover ever again.&nbsp; No matter how much people 
with unhappiness and extreme suffering wish to escape the world, they could not, 
because they do not know the world as it really is.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The important point 
is whether one is ready to abandon the assumption that there are entities, 
persons and the selves.&nbsp; Though as this instant there is no self, is one 
prepared to abandon the world?&nbsp; To be able to eradicate and escape the 
world, one must clearly realize that there is no self, entity or person 
first.&nbsp; Some might find unbearable even the thought that there is no self 
that sees or hears etc., no family, no friends, no treasured possessions.&nbsp; 
Most would not really wish to escape the world.&nbsp; Therefore, to abandon the 
pleasure and attachment in taking realities for the selves and ours, we must 
develop panna until we realize distinct realities that appear as the world, for 
what they truly are.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;It is not easy to 
know the world as it really is.&nbsp; Those who have listened to the dhamma as 
the Buddha had manifested about the world according to the knowledge that he had 
become omnisciently enlightened with, should apply themselves to the 
consideration, practice and development of panna until it is advanced enough to 
experience the characteristics of the world as it really is.&nbsp; Not that one 
should know the world in other moments but the present instant one is actually 
seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, knowing bodysense contact.&nbsp; There is a 
way to develop panna until it is able to know the world that is arising and 
falling away now by studying and listening to the dhamma in order to understand 
and realize the characteristics of realities that are appearing through the 
eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind.&nbsp; Otherwise it is impossible 
to know the world in the least.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;In the 
Samyuttanikaya Salayattanavagga 4th Samiddhisutta, 75, the venerable Samiddhi 
asked the Buddha, “This so-called world, Sire, why do we call, or decree it as 
the world?”&nbsp; The Buddha said, “Behold Samiddhi, wherever there are cakkhu, 
rupa, cakkhu-vinnana and realities that one can know with the cakkhu-vinnana, 
there would be what we call or decree the world etc.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;One is able to know 
the world because one has eyes thus we see colors of the world, ears to hear the 
sounds of the world, nose to smell, tongue to taste, the bodysense to know cold, 
heat, softness, hardness, tension and motion of the world.&nbsp; Without these 
can the world appear to us?&nbsp; Without seeing, hearing, tasting, knowing 
bodysense contact can any world appear?&nbsp; None can.&nbsp; Therefore, because 
of seeing one takes [what one sees] for the world appearing.&nbsp; What does one 
see?&nbsp; The world.&nbsp; What appears through the eyes is the world.&nbsp; 
What does one hear?&nbsp; The sound of the world also.&nbsp; Without sound, 
without hearing, the world of sound would not exist.&nbsp; Therefore the world, 
composed of sight, sound, smell, taste, bodysense contact can appear because 
there are eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind so one does not have to 
search for the world elsewhere.&nbsp; No matter in which world we are, that 
world can appear only because the eyes are paccaya for seeing, ears for hearing, 
nose for smelling, tongue for tasting, the bodysense for bodysense contact and 
the mind for thinking of the things appearing through the same eyes, ears, nose, 
tongue, bodysense and mind.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The Buddha said, 
“Behold Samiddhi, wherever there are no cakkhu, rupa, cakkhu-vinnana and 
realities that one can know with the cakkhu-vinnana, there would not be what we 
call or decree the world.”</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Even if one desires 
to escape the world but one does not know the world as it really is, it is 
impossible to do so.&nbsp; One has lived in this world for very long time, and 
not uniquely in this world, but for an eternity of lifetimes one has lived in 
other worlds as well.&nbsp; And since we do not know the world one must continue 
to live in it for a long time, never knowing the world or seeing it as it really 
is, forever alternating between happiness and unhappiness.&nbsp; These days some 
say that the Buddha, although having attained absolute nibbana, is still 
existing and that they had entered his audience and offered him food.&nbsp; One 
should consider the passage in the Tipitaka in the Samyuttanikaya 
Salayattanavagga Phaggunasutta 99.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Then the Reverend 
Phagguna entered the audience of the Buddha and asked, “Sire, when a person

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;After parinibbana 
there are no more eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense or mind.&nbsp; After 
parinibbana one does not go to a place to preside over merit-making ceremonies, 
in which case it would not be beyond the world because there would still be 
eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind that arise and fall away.&nbsp; 
There would still be dukkha, not beyond it.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The world is what 
appears through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind.&nbsp; Without 
citta arising to see, hear, smell, taste, know bodysense contact or think, the 
world would not appear.&nbsp; Whenever sati is mindful, it examines or studies 
arammana or the characteristics of the world appearing through the eyes, ears, 
nose, tongue, bodysense and mind.&nbsp; Whenever one thinks of the world, at 
that moment, thinking is not knowing the characteristics of realities that are 
not entities, persons or the selves.&nbsp; It is the instant of knowing the 
world convention terms as entities, persons, the selves or material 
objects.&nbsp; It is the world of sammati-sacca (conventional truth), not 
paramattha-sacca (the ultimate truth).</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Each day one knows 
whether one is in the world of sammati-sacca or paramattha-sacca.&nbsp; Though 
citta is a consciousness when there is no seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, 
knowing bodysense contact, nor thinking, this world would not appear at that 
instant.&nbsp; Patisandhi-citta, or the first citta of this world, is a 
vipaka-citta, resulting from a kamma that causes patisandhi-citta to arise in 
sequence after cuti-citta, which is the last citta of the previous life.&nbsp; 
Patisandhi-citta knows the same arammana as the citta preceding the cuti-citta 
of the last life.&nbsp; Since it does not know this world's arammana, this world 
does not appear yet.&nbsp; And when patisandhi-citta has fallen away, the kamma 
that caused it to arise would make the bhavanga-citta arise in continuation

the patisandhi-citta.&nbsp; While bhavanga-citta arise and fall away, 
maintaining this lifetime, they do not know arammana of this world.&nbsp; They 
do not see, hear, smell, taste, know bodysense contact or think.&nbsp; The world 
does not appear while bhavanga-citta continue to arise and fall

color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Each pasada-rupa has the special 
characteristics to be able to come into contact with certain rupa, becoming the 
way through which citta arise and know the arammana in contact specifically with 
its own dvara.&nbsp; Not only is there seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and 
knowing bodysense contact, but also thinking diverse thoughts.&nbsp; When citta 
is conscious of arammana in sequence to the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and 
bodysense or thinking different thoughts, citta does not depend on 
cakkhuppasada-rupa, sotappasada-rupa, ghanappasada-rupa, jivhappasada-rupa, 
kayappasada-rupa, but depends on bhavangupaccheda-citta arising before the 
mano-dvaravajjana-citta, as dvara.&nbsp; That is the way for citta to arise and 
think diverse thoughts.&nbsp; Because if the bhavangupaccheda-citta does not 
arise, the first vithi-citta to know arammana through the mind, the 
mano-dvaravajjana-citta, will not arise.&nbsp; Therefore, the mano-dvara and the 
mano-dvaravajjana-citta are different.&nbsp; <B>The bhavangupaccheda-citta is 
the mano-dvara, a vipaka-citta, and not a vithi-citta.&nbsp; 
Mano-dvaravajjana-citta is not the mano-dvara.&nbsp; It is a kiriya-citta and 
the first vithi-citta that arises to know arammana through the 
mano-dvara.</B></FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;This is ordinary 
daily life.&nbsp; One should understand the characteristics of dvara so as to 
examine and know realities as they truly are, as well as how distinct&nbsp; 
kinds of realities that arise and fall away are not entities, persons or the 
selves.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;At this moment, 
probably no one thinks of the cakkhuppasada-rupa, which is a rupa that really 
exist, arising and falling away at the center of the eye.&nbsp; In the 
Atthasalini Rupakandha (the Pali text) cakkhayatananiddesa, 596, there is a 
passage saying,</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;What is 
<B>“rupa”</B> called <B>“cakkhayatana”</B>?&nbsp; Any cakkhu is pasada-rupa, 
based on the four mahabhuta-rupa considered part of the attabhava (self/body?) 
and is invisible but can be contacted.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;<B>Cakkhayatana</B> 
is a word composed of cakkhu and ayatana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;<B>Cakkhu</B> is 
the eye; <B>ayatana</B> is the meeting place, birth place.&nbsp; Therefore 
<B>cakkhayatana is the eye which is the meeting place, the birth 
place.</B></FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The Buddha 
manifested that when a process of vithi-citta has arisen to see and know 
ruparammana through the cakkhu-dvara, the bhavanga-citta would arise and fall 
away in sequence for several instants, then the citta would arise to know 
ruparammana that appears through the cakkhu-dvara and has fallen away, once 
again through the mano-dvara.&nbsp; The mano-dvara vithi-citta would arise to 
know the arammana through the mano-dvara in sequence from the 
cakkhu-dvara-vithi-citta that had fallen away completely, very rapidly, even 
with the interposition of the bhavanga-citta.&nbsp; Therefore one should know 
the beneficence of what the Buddha manifested about the dvara in detail.&nbsp; 
Thus one would not confuse the citta that knows arammana through the 
cakkhu-dvara with the citta that knows arammana in sequence through the 
mano-dvara.&nbsp; Likewise through the sota-dvara, ghana-dvara, jivha-dvara and 
kaya-dvara.&nbsp; <B>Each time the vithi-citta arises to know an arammana 
through any of the five dvara and falls away, and many instants of 
bhavanga-citta have arisen in between, the citta would always arise to know the 
same arammana through the mano-dvara.</B></FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The nama-dhamma, or 
citta and cetasika, arising rapidly in continuation.&nbsp; While we are sitting, 
we seem both to see and hear at the same time, but in reality the vithi-citta 
depend on a dvara to arise and know the arammana through that dvara and then 
fall very quickly away one process a dvara.&nbsp; (A process consists of several 
citta that arise and fall away in sequence through the same dvara.)&nbsp; The 
arising and falling away of citta is so rapid that one cannot know the real 
characteristics of citta that arise through the cakkhu-dvara as only knowing 
what appears through the eyes.&nbsp; When the mano-dvara-vithi-citta arise in 
continuation to know ruparammana that appear through the eyes and remember the 
shapes and forms of what appears until one forgets that what appears through the 
eyes are really only what appears through the eyes.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The cakkhu-dvara is 
like a truly vast, bottomless ocean.&nbsp; It can see the moon, the sun, 
extremely far-off stars that come into contact with the cakkhuppasada and appear 
to the cakkhu-dvara-vithi-citta.&nbsp; Thus it seems like the world is full of 
objects, universes, entities and persons.&nbsp; In reality the citta thinks of 
the shapes and forms of the earth, water, fire and wind elements that appear as 
entities, persons, the moon, the sun, stars and other objects, which, whenever 
they come into contact with the bodysense, appear cold or hot, soft or whenever 
they come into contact with the bodysense, appear cold or hot, soft or hard, 
tense or moving.&nbsp; Those who know realities as they really are would realize 
that the world is the reality that is not lasting, arises and falls away very 
rapidly with the mano-dvaravajjana-citta remembering the features of whatever 
appears through the eyes, the low and high pitches appearing through the ears, 
etc. as the conventional terms of things of which none is a reality that arises 
without falling away.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
