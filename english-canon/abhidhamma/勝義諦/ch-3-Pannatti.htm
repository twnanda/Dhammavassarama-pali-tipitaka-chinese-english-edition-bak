<P><BR>
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The paramattha-dhamma are 
realities that truly exist but not entities, persons or the self.&nbsp; The 
paramattha-dhamma are only citta, cetasika and rupa of distinct characteristics 
and signs that arise because of causes and conditions and fall rapidly 
away.&nbsp; Whenever one does not know the characteristics of citta, cetasika 
and rupa as paramattha-dhamma that arise and fall away in very rapid sequence, 
then there is knowledge of pannatti (concept/signification/name) or taking signs 
of rupa and nama, which arise and fall away in very rapid continuation as 
something.&nbsp; Therefore those who do not know the characteristics of 
paramattha-dhamma are in the world of sammati-sacca (conventional truth) because 
they take realities that appear by their signs and forms as something 
real.&nbsp; Only when they have studied the paramattha-dhamma and know the way 
to develop panna to study the characteristics of realities that arise and appear 
until panna has grown to the level where it is able to realize the arising and 
falling away of realities that are actually doing so, would one fully realize 
that there are not entities, persons or the self, only paramattha-dhamma of 
different characteristics exactly as the Buddha had become omnisciently 
enlightened with and manifested.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The profundity and 
tenacity of avijja that makes us take sammati-sacca as objects, entities and 
persons begin with the arising of patisandhi-citta with concurrent nama-dhamma 
and rupa-dhamma and subsequent arising and falling away continually.&nbsp; After 
we are delivered from our mother's womb, we would see the sights that appear, 
hear sound, smell smells, taste tastes that appear and know the cold and heat in 
contact with the bodysense.&nbsp; But we did not know that what appears through 
the eyes was only a kind of reality so we take the signs of realities that arise 
and fall away all the time and which appear not to arise and fall away, as 
something.&nbsp; At that moment there is ghana-pannatti (collective 
concept/signification/name) or attachment to the signs of collective realities 
without yet knowing what the convention terms for the object is.&nbsp; Small 
children who do not have the knowledge or ability to speak, and animals, would 
know ghana-pannatti in similar ways until they grow older and are able to 
understand the meaning of sounds and know the sammati-sacca (conventional 
truth), which is sammati-pannatti (conventional concept/signification/name) 
given to distinct realities so that everyone might understand one another.&nbsp; 
Therefore when a child has seen the signs of realities that appear as though 
they do not arise and fall away, as grown-ups they still see it that way, as 
that thing, for example as object, as animals, as persons.&nbsp; In reality, 
hardness, whether that of a cup, plate, spoon or fork is only the element of 
hardness, the pathavidhatu (earth element).&nbsp; But each day when we see or 
touch, we do not think that we are only touching a reality that is hard, but we 
feel that we are touching a spoon, fork, plate or cup, according to attachments 
we have formed in taking signs that arise and fall away very rapidly until they 
appear as different shapes and features.&nbsp; Although when touched the spoon, 
fork, cup and plate are hard because the true characteristics are hardness but 
by remembering different shapes we know that cups are not plates, spoons are not 
forks.&nbsp; Therefore though the reality is a rupa-dhamma characterized by 
hardness, we still remember the conventional aspects that are plates for food, 
bowls for soup, spoons for service.&nbsp; We remember the conventional aspects 
of hard elements such as iron, material components of a radio, a television or 
other objects without realizing the characteristics of each nama-dhamma and 
rupa-dhamma that arise, appear and then fall away.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;This is memory of 
sammati-pannatti for things appearing through the eyes, which is ever increasing 
with daily new inventions.&nbsp; The instant of knowing shapes, features and 
signs that appear together as diverse objects is the instant of knowing 
pannatti, sammati-sacca, not paramattha-sacca.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Besides knowing 
ghana-pannatti through the eyes, we also know sadda-pannatti or the meaning of 
sound.&nbsp; This is daily life, one must know exactly which reality is 
paramattha-dhamma and which are sammati.&nbsp; Sammati means that which is not 
paramattha-dhamma.&nbsp; When one knows the signs and features that appear as 
cups, plates, spoons, radios, cars, televisions etc. humans are also able to 
emit sounds as sammati-pannatti to call things that appear, to identify a 
certain object, an ability that animals do not possess to such extent.&nbsp; 
Sound is a reality that truly exists; <B>sound is called "nama" because without 
sound the nama or names or words cannot exist.</B>&nbsp; Even with eyes that see 
things, if there were no sounds there would be no words to call things 
seen.&nbsp; Thus to know the meaning of words is sadda-pannatti, which gives 
rise to words, names, events.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Everyone is 
attached to names that are distinct sammati-pannatti.&nbsp; Therefore one should 
know the characteristics of sound, which is a reality.&nbsp; There is no Pali 
word for "sound".&nbsp; The reality that is sound is called in conventional Pali 
<B>"sadda-rupa"</B>.&nbsp; Sound is real.&nbsp; It is not a consciousness.&nbsp; 
It is a rupa-dhamma that appears through the ears.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;In the 
Abhidhammatthavibhavinitika Atthakatha Abhidhammatthasangaha, the 8 Chapter, 
there is an explanation of paramattha-dhamma and sammati-pannatti, which 
constitutes daily life, and is profound yet worthy of elucidation, even in 
matters of names, that exist only because there is sound.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The statement says 
that sadda-rupa (sound) is called <B>"nama"</B> (in this context intends name as 
opposed to nama-dhamma, which is a consciousness) because of the meaning turned 
towards meaning.&nbsp; There are two kinds of nama, 1) nama (name) according to 
meaning; 2) nama (name) according to appellation or 
nomenclature.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;What do we talk 
about in a day?&nbsp; Why do we say it?&nbsp; We speak so that people might 
understand things, the meanings we want to convey.&nbsp; Therefore sadda-rupa is 
called nama, because of the meaning turned towards meaning or 
events.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;To make people 
understand meanings and relations would depend on personal preferences and the 
language to convey the intentions, relationships, or names.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Moreover, there is 
a passage in the Abhidammatthavibhavini explaining nama or name from several 
perspectives: there are four kinds of names according to their efficiency, 
namely <B>samanna-nama</B>, the common name such as sky, rain, wind, rice etc.; 
<B>guna-nama</B>, appelation according to qualities or beneficence such as 
Sammasambuddha the Arahanta, which none other than the&nbsp; Sammasambuddha may 
be called because no one else possesses the qualifications; <B>kiriya-nama</B>, 
the name of action; and&nbsp; <B>yathiccha-nama</B>, name according to 
preferences.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The study of the 
dhamma is a very intricate matter because it is the study of all realities about 
which the Buddha was omnisciently enlightened and manifested in his great 
beneficence to assist the Buddhists in the comprehension of realities appearing 
as they truly are.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;In the 
Abhidhammatthavibhavinitika the 7the chapter there is a passage saying 
:</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT 
  size=+1><B>Question:</B> Why did the Buddha manifest the dhamma in such great 
  quantity?</FONT></FONT></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1><B>Answer:</B> 
  For the benefit of three groups of entities.&nbsp; There are indeed three 
  groups: 1) those who have an affinity for or interest in nama, for rupa, and 
  for both nama and rupa; 2) those with strong, moderate and weak faculties 
  [mental capacity]; 3) those with predilection for brief, normal or detailed 
  explanations.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Of these three groups 
  of entities, those who are obsessed with nama would be able to understand the 
  khandha because they are assigned 4 nama.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Those who are obsessed 
  with rupa would understand ayatana because the rupa are assigned 10 categories 
  and a half of ayatana (because dhammayatana includes both namadhamma and 
  rupadhamma.)</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Those who are obsessed 
  by both nama and rupa would understand dhatu because by both nama and rupa are 
  categorized in detail into dhatu.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

an object or various things is the instant citta knows pannatti, not 
paramattha-arammana.&nbsp; Paramattha-arammana that appear through the eyes are 
only colors but the moments the mano-dvara-vithi-citta recognize them as

dhamma saying puts it, paramattha-dhamma is not pannatti, because it is a

characteristics. Pannatti, on the other hand, is not paramattha-dhamma because 
it is not a reality that truly exists, and it is called pannatti because it

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Dhamma would always 
be true to the dhamma.&nbsp; Names are pannatti because they are words that

knowing any languages.&nbsp; There is still pannatti in things appearing 
otherwise one would not recognize them.&nbsp; The instant one recognizes the 
things appearing is the instant one knows pannatti because pannatti is to make 
known in such and such a way.&nbsp; Even without naming them, to see painting of

that of seeing the fruits.&nbsp; Some might misunderstand that only the painting 
is Pannatti, and not the fruit.&nbsp; But in reality both the picture and the 
fruit that appear through the eyes are pannatti-arammana of the continued 
processes of the mano-dvara-vithi-citta because the cakkhu-dvara-vithi-citta

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: I don't 
  quite understand.&nbsp; Say that now we see a pen.&nbsp; You say that when we 
  see a pen, it means that it has passed through the panca-dvara onto the 
  mano-dvara already.&nbsp; Is there a way to study or practice so that it does 
  not pass through the panca-dvara first?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: One must listen 
  until one really understands which instant there is pannatti as arammana and 
  through which dvara the citta knows pannatti.&nbsp; At the instant citta has 
  paramattha-dhamma as arammana there is not entity, person, the self or any 
  object whatever.&nbsp; At this instant realities arise and fall away in 
  continuation so rapidly it is seen in the way as spinning fan is.&nbsp; For 
  any rupa to appear to move, there must be a multitude of rupa arising and 
  falling away in continuation to be seen as motion.&nbsp; Therefore 
  mano-dvara-vithi-citta with pannatti as arammana would be so numerous in 
  processes as to hide the characteristics of paramattha-dhamma, making one 
  ignorant of the specific characteristics of paramattha-dhamma as they really 
  are.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: If so, what do we do 
  with the word pannatti?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: Not to do away with 
  it but one should know the truth that the instant of recognition as knowing 
  animals, people and objects is the instant mano-dvara-vithi-citta are knowing 
  pannatti.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: It is a reality that 
  thinks words.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: Even the instant one 
  is not thinking words but instead knowing the features, the meanings and signs 
  that appear, is pannatti, and not paramattha-dhamma.&nbsp; One must correctly 
  precisely the characteristics of realities to be able to realize the arising 
  and falling away of paramattha-dhamma.&nbsp; Those who say they do not see a 
  chair arise and fall away since they had not separated the characteristics of 
  paramattha-dhamma that are assembled, they would see a chair.&nbsp; At that 
  moment there is knowing pannatti, so how can it fall away?&nbsp; In the 
  example with paintings of grapes and grapes, are they different to the touch 
  through the kaya-dvara?&nbsp; Are they not both hard?&nbsp; It is true that 
  the element of hardness arises from different sources, making it very hard or 
  slightly hard, very soft or slightly soft.&nbsp; But hardness is a reality 
  that appears through the bodysense, whether it be pictures or grapes.&nbsp; 
  But the grapes that are paintings do not have the taste of the fruits. Rupa 
  that arise concurrently and be recognized as a grape comprise, in reality, 
  rasa as one of the rupa, smell, cold or heat, soft or hard, tense or moving, 
  as others.&nbsp; When assembled and arising and falling away rapidly, they 
  make known pannatti in such a manner: as this thing, which seems not to fall 
  away, in reality, is only concurrent paramattha-dhamma of different 
  characteristics arising and falling away together.&nbsp; When assembled as 
  signs or features, the mano-dvara-vithi-citta would recognize them in such a 
  manner at which instant there is pannatti or the signs or features as 
  arammana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: But if the 
  mano-dvara recognizes that it is a pen, is it right or 
  wrong?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: It is nor wrong 
  because at that moment there is dhammarammana or pannatti as arammana.&nbsp; 
  But panna must correctly know the instants of the mano-dvara-vithi differ from 
  the instants of cakkhu-dvara-vithi, which those who had not developed panna 
  would know both the cakkhu-dvara-vithi and the mano-dvara-vithi together as 
  something or the other, for example an animal, a person or an object.&nbsp; 
  What do we like each day?&nbsp; What does lobha like?&nbsp; Everything, 
  including what?&nbsp; Everything pleasant.&nbsp; Lobha likes everything, 
  including pannatti.&nbsp; The world is full of pannatti, therefore one cannot 
  deny liking both paramattha-dhamma and pannatti.&nbsp; When one likes 
  something, one also like pannatti, not only paramattha-dhamma.&nbsp; To like a 
  belt is to like color appearing to the eyes.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

  the color is still only that which appear through the eyes, whether red, 
  green, blue, royal blue or white.&nbsp; Even so we still like the colors that

  pannatti.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT

instant one takes [something] for a woman or a man, which shows that it is not 
paramattha-dhamma.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever one knows that one sees a woman or a 
man, that instant one is grasping the nama or pannatti of the thing appearing 
through the eyes, not only knowing the paramattha-dhamma appearing then.&nbsp; 
There is the pannatti of the thing appearing as nimitta, or grasping the nimitta 
as woman, man or the nimitta that is the object of kilesa, such as subhanimitta, 
with the efficiency of chandaraga.&nbsp; If you like pannatti or the belt, it 
means that the belt has a subhanimitta for you to like with the power of 
chandaraga.&nbsp; If the belt were not pretty, not subhanimitta, one would not 
like it.&nbsp; Therefore, that which appears through the eyes is of distinct 
pannatti, or of subhanimitta or asubhanimitta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The passage 
continues:&nbsp; the term <B>anubyanjana-believer</B> means to mistake

anubyanjana are instrumental in the appearance of kilesa, or the arising of

  because that is not to know realities as they truly are: as what appears 
  through the eyes and then falls away, after which the mano-dvara-vithi-citta 
  would arise to recognize pannatti in continuation. Panna must know what the 
  rupa that appears through the cakkhu-dvara is really like, how it differs from 
  the citta that recognizes pannatti, to be able to attenuate mistaking the 
  ruparammana as animals and people, as objects on which pleasure is 
  based.&nbsp; And panna must know that the instant one sees women, men, animals 
  and diverse persons is to know nimitta or pannatti through the 
  mano-dvara.&nbsp; Those who develop sati-patthana and have not yet realized 
  the arising and falling away of the nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma do not yet 
  know the characteristics of realities that appear normally as they truly are, 
  that paramattha-dhamma is not pannatti.&nbsp; So one must continue to develop 
  panna in the instant realities are appearing through the eyes, ears, nose, 
  tongue, bodysense and mind.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

  pannatti is a kind of dhammarammana?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: Pannatti is a 
  dhammarammana because it's an arammana that can be known only through the

  <P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q:&nbsp; And this

  one may recognize the instant when there is pannatti as 
  arammana.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT 
color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Each day pannatti hides the characteristics of 
paramattha-dhamma through eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind so that 
one does not know realities as they truly are: that the reality appearing 
through the eyes, is not an entity, a person or the self, but only colors and 
features that appear when in contact with the cakkhuppasada.&nbsp; Only when 
panna has developed until it knows the truth when seeing could it attenuates 
attachment to the reality as a self, an entity or a person, and know the 
differences between paramattha-arammana and and pannatti-arammana.&nbsp; The 
same applies to the ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;What is the 
arammana while we are dreaming?&nbsp; Certainly everyone dreams because the only 
ones who do not are the arahanta.&nbsp; Everyone dreams and when they awaken 
they say they dreamed of elderly relatives who have passed away etc.&nbsp; Do 
they dream of pannatti or paramattha-arammana?&nbsp; If one does not examine 
this, one would not know because both are like seeing.&nbsp; Actually when asked 
what one saw, one answers people, elderly relatives, friends, entities, various 
persons.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is to dream of pannatti because at that instant no 
cakkhu-dvara-vithi-citta arises since one is asleep.&nbsp; But the 
mano-dvara-vithi-citta arose to think thoughts and see related things about 
entities and people.&nbsp; Therefore the instant there is dreaming, there is 
thinking about pannatti of things one had seen or heard, for example.&nbsp; 
Everyone reads a newspaper.&nbsp; There are various stories and pictures, 
too.&nbsp; The instant one knows of stories and sees pictures are all instants 
one thinks of pannatti.&nbsp; Therefore each day one does not differentiate the 
characteristics of paramattha-dhamma that appear from those of pannatti.&nbsp; 
Because whether one sees through the eyes, or read books or work wherever and 
whenever, one always thinks of pannatti.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Through the ears, 
after one is born as a baby, we often hear sounds, normally but we did not know 
words, or understand any languages.&nbsp; But sanna, the meaning of different 
sounds increased, so that we thought of pannatti, the meaning of sounds 
remembered.&nbsp; Babies see, hear, smell, taste, know bodysense contact, feel 
pain and anger, like, dislike and cry but they do not know the words to explain, 
speak, or tell until they are grown up.&nbsp; Can anyone remember events when 
one was just born?&nbsp; Even though then there was seeing, hearing etc, since 
there were not words to speak yet because one still does not understand the 
meaning of different sounds, the memory of events fade away.&nbsp; Once older 
and one knows the meanings of sounds, languages because other than remembering 
visual objects one also remembers things heard on the ears.&nbsp; Taken together 
as various stories, the world of sammati-pannatti would increase in never-ending 
evolution.&nbsp; After reading a story in a book, they had to make it into a 
film to be seen and heard.&nbsp; If we examine and compare, we could see how 
much the world of sammati hides the characteristics of the 
paramattha-dhamma.&nbsp; For example, while one is watching TV, what pannatti 
are there?&nbsp; What story?&nbsp; Who plays which part?&nbsp; It seems as 
though the television actors are actually real people.&nbsp; But in the same way 
that the plays and the players are pannatti, when paramattha-dhamma arise and 
appear then fall away in rapid continuation, the instant one recognizes this or 
that person is to know pannatti as well.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

  paramattha-dhamma can be arammana for sati-patthana.&nbsp; Any instant taste

  panca-dvaravajjana-citta, jivha-dvaravajjana-citta, sampaticchanna-citta, 
  santirana-citta, votthabbana-citta, javana-citta and tadalambana-citta.&nbsp; 
  Then taste falls away so there are no grapes.&nbsp; That is 
  paramattha-dhamma.&nbsp; But when assembled as a grape there is 
  pannatti.&nbsp; Therefore sati-patthana is the instant one is mindful of the

  mindful of paramattha-dhamma, not of pannatti?&nbsp; If so, realities that 
  appear through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and bodysense cannot avoid the 
  mano-dvara?&nbsp; When the eyes see the reality that sees arise, there is 
  interposition of bhavanga-citta followed by mano-dvara.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: The vithi-citta

  the process of javana-citta through the mano-dvara must also be the same kind 
  of lobha-mula-citta.&nbsp; The cakkhu-dvara-vithi-citta and the 
  mano-dvara-vithi-citta arise in continuation extremely rapidly like a bird 
  that flies up to sit on a branch and the moment the bird touches the branch 
  its shadow would appear on the ground.&nbsp; When an arammana appears through 
  the cakkhu-dvara it would immediately continue and appear through the 
  mano-dvara, then after several bhavanga-citta interpose very quickly so that 
  one does not know that the rupa had appeared through the eyes are only a kind

  <P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: Sight, taste, arise

  <P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: Therefore it is 
  conventionally termed as grapes, which in reality are taste that arises and 
  falls away, and hardness that arises and falls away. Pannatti comes from 
  several paramattha assembled in a conglomeration.&nbsp; When one has not 
  realized the arising and falling away of each of the realities that are 
  assembled, one takes their apparent signs as something.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: Is pannatti not 
  real? Pannatti comes from several paramattha, softness, hardness, cold, heat, 
  colors, smell, taste, composed into a conglomerate, a thing with such color, 
  such feature, or such shape, such build as that person. Pannatti comes from 
  paramattha.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: To know that 
  pannatti is not paramattha-dhamma one must separate paramattha-dhamma that 
  arise concurrently as specific characteristics of paramattha-dhamma that 
  appears through each dvara, and also realize the arising and falling away of 
  the rupa that appears through each dvara.&nbsp; Each sabhava-rupa lasts only 
  seventeen instants of citta and then falls away.&nbsp; The rupa that is there 
  only seventeen instants of citta has no time to stand or walk or do anything, 
  because to raise a hand takes more than seventeen instants of citta 
  already.&nbsp; Therefore what is seen as a person walking or holding his hand 
  up shows that the rupa had fallen away and arisen in continuation through the 
  cakkhu-dvara-vithi and mano-dvara-vithi for several processes, with interposed 
  bhavanga, until it appears as a person walking or holding his hand.&nbsp; In 
  reality seventeen instants of citta is extremely fast, which can be 
  comprehended accordingly by the examination that the rupa through the eyes, 
  which last seventeen instants, must have been fallen away before one can hear 
  sound, even though it appears as one can see and hear at the same time.&nbsp; 
  But between the citta that hears and the citta that sees there are more than 
  seventeen instants of citta, therefore what appears through the eyes now, 
  which lasts seventeen instants of citta, had to have fallen away for the citta 
  that hears to arise.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT 
face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Therefore that it appears as 
both hearing and seeing at the same time is because rupa arises and falls away 
in continuation both through the cakkhu-dvara-vithi and mano-dvara-vithi in such 
great numbers that it appears as a person walking or holding up his hand and 
moving etc.&nbsp; But since one has not realized the rapid arising and falling 
away of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma, one takes, through pannatti, what appears 
as a person, woman, man or objects.&nbsp; But one should keep in mind that from 
the moment one begins to study the paramattha-dhamma one knows that 
paramattha-dhamma is a reality that truly exists, which is not an entity, a 
person, the self, woman, man or any object.&nbsp; The dhamma that are 
sacca-dhamma must always be the truth from beginning to end until we can develop 
panna to the level where we can clearly realize realities, we are familiar with 
hearing and repeating that paramattha-dhamma is something that truly exists, 
which is not an entity, a person or the self.&nbsp; Taste exists, as does 
hardness.&nbsp; Conventionally termed the taste and hardness are grapes.&nbsp; 
But what is real is the reality that has arisen and fallen away. Therefore there 
are no grapes, no entities, no people, only rupa-dhamma and nama-dhamma that 
rapidly arise and fall away.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Paramattha-dhamma is 
paramattha-dhamma and not pannatti.&nbsp; The study and practice of dhamma must 
be accurate according to the study even at the beginning.&nbsp; It must also be 
accurate according to the realities as they truly are.&nbsp; For example, we 
have learned that paramattha-dhamma is anatta.&nbsp; We must penetrate the 
meaning of paramattha-dhamma at the levels of listening, examination and 
development of panna until we also truly realize the truth according to what we 
have learned.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: Just now someone in 
the audience asked whether pannatti is real.&nbsp; If one should say that 
reality is separated into paramattha-sacca and sammati-sacca, would pannatti be 
sammati-sacca?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: Yes, but pannatti is 
not paramattha.&nbsp; The name grape, for example, does not have any 
taste.&nbsp; Taste is a reality that truly exists and that taste is pannatti as 
grape.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT 
size=+1>Lobha-mula-citta-ditthigata-vippayutta, not only takes pleasure in 
sound, smell, taste, bodysense and pannatti in daily life but can also take 
pleasure in micchasamadhi.&nbsp; For example, those who take pleasure in 
physical exercise know that yoga exercises with the citta steadfastly 
concentrate on breathing would strengthen the body.&nbsp; At that instant there 
is a kind of samadhi, which since it is not kusala-citta, must be 
lobha-mula-citta, which is micchasamadhi.&nbsp; But the persons are without the 
wrong view that the method leads to the realization of the 
ariya-sacca-dhamma.&nbsp; They only take pleasure in the samadhi and the 
knowledge that at that moment they want to meditate for their physical 
well-being, and not for the mistaken view that one must first do this in order 
to be able to examine nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma more quickly.&nbsp; If that 
were the case, they would have misunderstood the characteristics of sammasamadhi 
nor would they know that sammasati is anatta.&nbsp; It is not that one should 
first exercise micchasamadhi to be able to assist panna to know the 
characteristics of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma.&nbsp; But for sati to be 
sammasati as one of the eight magga in the Eightfold Path, there must be 
sammaditthi, the understanding of the characteristics of the reality appearing, 
which are arammana that sati should be correctly mindful of, in more and more 
detail, to be sankhara-khandha composing sati to arise and be correctly mindful 
of the characteristics of realities appearing.&nbsp; For example, through the 
eyes when there is seeing, one could know which instants are pannatti and which 
are paramattha.&nbsp; The same applies to the ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and 
mind.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Therefore whether we 
watch TV, sports tournaments or whatever, read books, or look at paintings, we 
might know which instants are pannatti and which paramattha.&nbsp; Otherwise one 
might takes the stories on TV for pannatti but not when it is not stories on 
TV.&nbsp; In reality both the stories on TV and those that are not are pannatti 
alike.&nbsp; Even the names of everyone are nama-pannatti, words that are 
established to signify which citta, cetasika and rupa concurrently arising are 
supposed to be this or that person.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Micchasamadhi that are 
lobha-mula-citta-ditthigata-vippayutta differs from 
lobha-mula-citta-ditthigata-sampayutta, which mistakes the micchasamadhi for the 
way to the realization of the arisacca-dhamma.&nbsp; There is micchasamadhi in 
every country because any instant of meditation that is not 
kusala-nan?a-sampayutta, or composed with panna, has to be micchasamadhi.&nbsp; 
If anyone mistakes micchasamadhi for the way to make sati mindful of the 
characteristics of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma faster, he is wrong.&nbsp; 
Because <B>sammasati would only be mindful of the characteristics of the 
realities appearing only after there has been comprehension of the differences 
in the characteristics of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma</B> and not after 
previously practicing micchasamadhi.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

are arammana of the citta in daily life, whenever the citta does not have 
paramattha-dhamma as arammana.&nbsp; Therefore imagine how many there would be

about things that are appearing. Through the hearing ears there are related 
thoughts about the sound heard; the nose, smell and related things; the tongue, 
taste; the bodysense, bodysense contact.&nbsp; Each day the citta that arise 
through the mind know colors, sounds, smells, tastes, bodysense contacts and 
thoughts about their arammana.&nbsp; Are there any other arammana in a day than 
paramattha-arammana and pannatti-arammana?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Because there are 
only six arammana and among the six other than the paramattha-dhamma there is 
pannatti.&nbsp; Therefore there are no other arammana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Does the Buddha 
have pannatti as arammana?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;In the daily life 
of all entities and people, when the cakkhu-dvara-vithi-citta had all fallen 
away and the bhavanga-citta had interposed, the mano-dvara-vithi-citta would 
have the same paramattha-arammana as through the cakkhu-dvara-vithi-citta that 
had just fallen away.&nbsp; And when the bhavanga-citta had interposed, the 
mano-dvara-vithi-citta that arose in continuation would think of the shape and 
features of what appears because it is a kind of rupa that arises concurrently 
with the elements of earth, water, fire and wind.&nbsp; One cannot separate 
color from these elements because whenever there are the 4 mahabhuta-rupa, there 
must also be the color-rupa (vanna), smell, taste and oja, together with them 
inseparably.&nbsp; Since color cannot be extracted from the 4 mahabhuta-rupa, 
color would appear to be seen through the eyes and sanna remembers it as shapes 
and features to make known the pannatti of what the thing seen is.&nbsp; If 
there were no colors and if colors were taken from the mahabhuta-rupa, can 
things be seen as humans, entities or things?&nbsp; Even citta cannot arise to 
know arammana through the eyes because there is nothing in contact with the 
cakkhuppasada.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Thus, did the 
Buddha have pannatti as arammana?&nbsp; Certainly.&nbsp; To listen to the dhamma 
one must examine the reasons for the reality in conjunction.&nbsp; There are two 
arammana: <B>paramattha-dhamma and pannatti</B>.&nbsp; Any instant there is no 
paramattha-dhamma arammana there must be pannatti as arammana.&nbsp; This 
repetition is to help sati to be correctly mindful of the characteristics of the 
realities appearing that in the instant there are things appearing through the 
eyes as colors, since colors cannot be separated from the mahabhuta-rupa, the 
colors that arise with the mahabhuta-rupa would appear to be seen as different 
pannatti.&nbsp; When sati-patthana arises, it separately examines, notes 
correctly that what is appearing as diverse colors are kinds of realities that 
appear through the eyes.&nbsp; And the instant one recognizes what appears 
through the eyes is the vithi-citta that knows it through the 
mano-dvara.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;When one has 
studied and understood it, one can see that in the daily life of all entities 
and humans, sometimes the citta has paramattha-dhamma as arammana and sometimes 
pannatti in a sequence.&nbsp; For example, through the eyes there is not only 
the cakkhu-dvara-vithi-citta with color as arammana.&nbsp; When the 
cakkhu-dvara-vithi-citta have fallen away completely, the bhavanga-citta had 
interposed, the mano-dvara-vithi-citta would arise to recognize color in 
continuation from the cakkhu-dvara-vithi.&nbsp; When the first process of 
mano-dvara-vithi-citta had fallen away and the bhavanga-citta has interposed, 
the next process of mano-dvara-vithi-citta would arise with pannatti as 
arammana.&nbsp; Otherwise, how could one live if one does not know pannatti as 
tables, chairs, food, cups, dishes, spoons etc.&nbsp; We cannot live.&nbsp; Do 
animals have pannatti as arammana.&nbsp; They, too, must.&nbsp; Without pannatti 
as arammana even animals cannot live because they would not recognize which is 
food and which is not.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>How do those with 
pannatti as arammana, such as the Buddha, the arahanta, the anagami-puggala, the 
sakadagami-puggala, the sotapanna-puggala, the puthujjanas (the common or 
ordinary man), differ or not?&nbsp; <B>The arahanta and the ordinary persons 
differ in their panna.</B> The ordinary person does not know about 
paramattha-dhamma so they mistake pannatti for realities.&nbsp; But <B>those who 
have clearly realized the ariyasacca-dhamma would know that all dhamma are 
anatta.</B>&nbsp; Realities that arise and appear through the eyes, ears, nose, 
tongue, bodysense and mind are impermanent and pannatti is not 
paramattha-dhamma.&nbsp; It is called pannatti because it makes known in such a 
manner.&nbsp; Therefore pannatti is the arammana of the citta and cetasika when 
there is recognition of the meanings, or the attha, of what appears.&nbsp; 
Without citta and cetasika, can there be pannatti?&nbsp; Realities can be 
logically examined.&nbsp; If there were no citta and cetasika, there can be no 
pannatti.&nbsp; If there were only rupa-dhamma and no nama-dhamma, no citta or 
cetasika, can there be pannatti?&nbsp; No, because rupa is not a reality that 
knows arammana.&nbsp; Citta and cetasika do.&nbsp; If citta and cetasika do not 
arise there can be no knowledge of pannatti.&nbsp; Having pannatti as arammana 
for the ariyapuggala differs from that of those who are not in that the latter 
mistake pannatti as something that really exists while the former know which 
instant the citta has paramattha-dhamma as arammana and which has pannatti as 
arammana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Is the instant that citta 
knows pannatti or is having pannatti as arammana an instant of 
micchaditthi?&nbsp; It depends on the kind of citta that is having pannatti as 
arammana.&nbsp; The ariyapuggala have pannatti as arammana but they do not have 
micchaditthi because they have eradicated the micchaditthi-cetasika 
completely.&nbsp; If one does not conscientiously examine this, one does not 
know the different between lobha-mula-citta-ditthigata-sampayutta and 
lobha-mula-citta-ditthigata-vippayutta. Lobha-mula-citta-ditthigata-vippayutta 
is pleased with all arammana, with things that appear through the eyes, sounds 
through the ears and the pannatti of sounds heard through the ears.&nbsp; The

bodysense contact, which are kamarammana.&nbsp; As for the arahanta, even though 
they have the 6 arammana, these are not kusala-dhamma nor akusala-dhamma of any 
kind because the arahanta have eradicated all kilesa and akusala-dhamma 
completely.&nbsp; Those who are not arahanta, even if they know the 
characteristics of arammana according to the truth, which instant is 
paramattha-dhamma, which pannatti, yet they cannot eradicated all kilesa so they 
still have paccaya for happiness, unhappiness, pleasure or displeasure according 
to the paramattha-arammana and pannatti-arammana respective to their levels of 
attainment of each person.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Therefore, one must 
examine conscientiously which instant is micchaditthi.&nbsp; The moment one is 
attached to various pannatti with the wrong view that what is not 
paramattha-dhamma really exists.&nbsp; At that instant there is sakkayaditthi. 
Since pannatti is not paramattha-dhamma but one mistakes it as what is truly the 
self, the entity, the person and various things in reality, there is wrong view 
as sakkayaditthi.&nbsp; Since sakkayaditthi has not yet been eradicated, it 
would be paccaya for different wrong views to increasingly arise.&nbsp; For 
example, the belief that the kamma does not exist, nor does it result; or that 
there is a great god who created the world and all creatures and people.&nbsp; 
When one does not know the paccaya that makes all sankhara-dhamma arise, various 
wrong views would arise, but the instant that citta has pannatti as arammana 
there is not always micchaditthi with it because micchaditthi must be the 
instant one is attached to distinct various wrong views.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Can pannatti be 
arammana for akusala-citta?&nbsp; Yes, it usually is.&nbsp; Lobha-mula-citta 
arises to be pleased by pannatti.&nbsp; Moha-mula-citta arises to dislike 
pannatti, for example to be displeased with this or that person.&nbsp; What is 
the aramana at that instant? Pannatti.&nbsp; Therefore Pannatti could be aramana 
for any kind of akusala citta whatever.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Can pannatti be 
arammana for akusala-citta?&nbsp; Yes, because life must be what it is in 
reality.&nbsp; The characteristics of each reality cannot be changed in the 
least.&nbsp; At the moment of dana, if one does not know what the thing given 
is, kusala-citta cannot arise.&nbsp; At the moment of sila, abstention from bad 
behavior, if one does not know what appears, one cannot abstain from wrong 
action. At the instant of developing peace of the citta, which is 
samatha-bhavana, can there be pannatti as arammana?&nbsp; Some might think that 
they have not yet studied samatha-bhavana or its arammana in detail so they 
cannot answer.&nbsp; But if we do not forget the fact that any instant 
paramattha-dhamma is not arammana there would be pannatti as arammana.&nbsp; One 
can deduce that even samatha-bhavana could also have pannatti as arammana.&nbsp; 
<B>Besides sati-patthana and the panca-dvara-vithi-citta other citta could have 
pannatti as arammana.</B>&nbsp; To know which reality is paramattha-dhamma one 
must rely only on the development of sati-patthana.&nbsp; Any instant 
sati-patthana does not arise there is no examination, study, taking note of the 
characteristics of the realities that are paramattha-dhamma.&nbsp; Therefore 
daily life would sometimes have paramattha-dhamma as arammana and sometimes 
pannatti.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The development of 
sati-patthana is a very intricate matter because it is the development of panna 
to know realities that appear as they truly are.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: 
  Sati-patthana does not have pannatti as arammana. True or 
  false?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: 
  True.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Q: Is it right or wrong 
  to develop sati-patthana by trying not to let citta arise 
  to</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT 
  size=+1>&nbsp;know pannatti-arammana?</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
  <P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A: Wrong, because that 
  is not real.&nbsp; Who can stop citta from arising to know pannatti as 
  arammana?&nbsp; But panna can be developed to be able to know that the instant 
  there is pannatti as arammana, it is the citta, which is a nama-dhamma knowing 
  pannatti, otherwise there cannot be pannatti as arammana at that 
  instant.&nbsp; Therefore those who develop sati-patthana would not try not to 
  think anything, or try not to see or recognize as they always do normally 
  things that appear through the eyes.&nbsp; If they did so, they would not be 
  able to know the true characteristics of nama-dhamma that the instant there is 
  pannatti as arammana is also a nama-dhamma or citta and cetasika that arise 
  with pannatti as arammana at that instant. Sati-patthana would be mindful, 
  study and examine, take note that any instant there is thinking, that instant 
  there is nama-dhamma, the reality, dhatu or signs of knowing, not the self, 
  entity or person.&nbsp; And it knows the reality of anatta in all dhamma that 
  citta cannot be stopped from arising to think of events.&nbsp; Therefore, 
  panna must universally know the characteristics of nama-dhamma that have 
  distinct arammana through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind to 
  end uncertainty about the characteristics of nama-dhamma.&nbsp; If one 
  refrains from knowing pannatti or from thinking, it is not the development of 
  panna because in reality none can stop the arising and evolving of realities 
  in daily life.&nbsp; Because of ignorance one misunderstands that one should 
  try not to let citta think or know pannatti of things that 
  appear.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT 
color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Therefore one can deduce from methods of 
practice which one is not the development of panna that studies and notes the 
characteristics of nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma, but an attempt to do something 
different from what is actually the normal daily life.&nbsp; That path is 
<B>micchamagga</B> comprising micchaditthi, micchasankappa, micchavaca, 
micchakammanta, micchaajiva, micchavayama, micchasati and micchasamadhi, not 
sammamagga, which is the development of sati-patthana, 
vipassana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Not to know the 
characteristics of realities appearing, nor to know the causes and results of 
specific realities as they truly are misleads one to attachments, wrong views 
and pleasure in seeking ways to wrong practices with ignorance even in the 
instant of seeing distinct colors and things. In the Samyuttanikaya 
Mahavaravagga Maggasamyutta Brahmasutta, 12, there is a passage summarized as 
Savatthinidana (the Savatthi episode):</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;That morning the 
Venerable Ananda, dressed, with his bowl and robe, went to gather alms in the 
city of Savatthi.&nbsp; He saw the Brahmin Janussoni leaving Savatthi in a 
chariot with all-white attellage.&nbsp; It is said that the horses are white, 
with white ornaments; the chariot is white, the canopy, ropes, whip-handle, 
umbrellas, turban, robe, shoes, fan-handle all in white.&nbsp; People, upon 
seeing this person, say: "Gentlemen, what an excellent, handsome 
vehicle!"</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;(Just to see the 
color white, they mistook the white vehicle for an excellent one since they did 
not know realities or the way to clearly realize the reality that is not the 
self, so they seek other means and mistake things thus.)</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Then the Venerable 
Ananda had gathered alms in the city of Savatthi and after the meal, having 
returned from alms-gathering and entered the presence of the Buddha, 
respectfully greeted him, and sat down in an appropriate place.&nbsp; Then he 
related to the Buddha what he saw of the Brahmin Janussoni.&nbsp; The Buddha 
then manifested the ariyamagga, the Eightfold Path as the reality that 
eradicates kilesa, not white vehicle and everything in white.&nbsp; Then he 
continued in the following discourse.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The ariyamagga-nana 
has dhamma, <B>saddha and panna</B>, as yoke and <B>saddha</B> as yoke-pole; 
<B>hiri</B> as flag-pole; the <B>mind</B> as reins; <B>sati</B> as the 
charioteer; <B>sila</B> as ornaments, <B>jhana</B> as axle; <B>perseverance</B> 
as wheels; <B>upekkha-samadhi</B> as yoke-pole; <B>non-covetousness</B> as 
canopy.&nbsp; Any person of extraction is <B>without vengefulness</B>, 
<B>harm</B>, but with <B>viveka </B>(detachment, seclusion) as weapon, with 
<B>endurance</B> as leather sheild would evolve towards happiness from 
yoga.&nbsp; Should this supreme vehicle of Brahmans arise for anyone, these 
persons would be sages and leave the world with the certitude that they have 
won.</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT 
size=+1>&nbsp; (He manifested how the white vehicle and its all-white ornaments 
is not the ariyayana.)</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;In the Atthakatha 
Brahamanasutta there is a passage saying the Brahmin Janussoni would circle the 
city every six months.&nbsp; Each time it would be announced in advance that the 
Brahmin would circle the city in so many days.&nbsp; People who were leaving the 
city would delay the journey (when they heard that Janussoni was going to circle 
the city, even those who had business elsewhere would postpone.)&nbsp; Even 
those who were on a journey would return to see it, with the belief that they 
would see the splendid treasures of a blessed being.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;That day wherever 
the Brahmin would go, the citizens would sweep the streets for him at first 
light, sanded the streets, strewed them with popped rice and flowers, set up 
water containers, banana plants and flags and banners, and filled the city with 
the scents of incenses.&nbsp; The Brahmin circled the city with an ornate 
vehicle, with a four-horse chariot, with all-white attelage, the wheels and 
spokes were silver-plated.&nbsp; (All ornaments were white, whether from the 
silver or other decorations.)&nbsp; There were two kinds of chariots, the war 
chariot and ornate chariot.&nbsp; The war chariot was square and not too large, 
the capacity of two or three persons.&nbsp; But the ornate car was large, long 
and white.&nbsp; Eight or ten umbrella, fan and swish bearers could fit in the 
carriage where one is able to stand or lie down comfortably.&nbsp; The horses 
were all white, bedecked all in silver.&nbsp; The carriage was white from 
silver-plating and decorations of ivory in specific places.&nbsp; Other 
carriages were covered with lion or tiger skins or yellow woolen cloth but not 
so that of the Brahmin Janussoni because it was decked in fine cloth, the ropes 
covered with silver and coral.&nbsp; Even the whip-handle was plated in 
silver.&nbsp; Even the umbrellas were all in white, his seven-inch-wide turban 
was woven with silver, his robes were white, the color of foam.&nbsp; Among 
these clothing, the robe cost 500 and the capes 1000.&nbsp; As for the shoes, 
these are not the shoes for travelers or trekkers in the forest, but for riding 
in chariots, for they deck the feet in silver.&nbsp; The side shades and fans 
were white with crystal handles.&nbsp; These all white clothing were not the 
only thing the Brahmin had on, even his ornaments were in silver.&nbsp; For 
example, he wore white powder, flowers and all ten fingers had rings as well as 
both his ears.&nbsp; Even his retinue of about 10,000 brahmins were decked all 
in white, clothing, flowers and jewelry in approximately the same 
quantity.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp; The Brahmin 
Janussoni would wash his hair early in the morning, have breakfast and dress in 
attires such as white robes etc. descend from his tower and mount the 
chariot.&nbsp; The brahmins, dressed, powdered and garlanded all in white, would 
carry white umbrellas and surround him.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The people would 
shower fruit to young men to gather masses of people.&nbsp; Then they would 
shower them with small coins, then uniquely valuable ones.&nbsp; People would 
gather to cheer and toss streamers. The Brahmin would go through the city for 
great treasures.&nbsp; People desiring blessings and merit would make blessings 
and merit while others of fortune would go up to the first floor of their 
lodgings, for example, to watch from windows opened like parrot's wings. The 
Brahmin would then move towards the southern gate as if to take over the city 
with his prestige and treasures.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;When the people saw 
the chariot they would say, Gentlemen, what an excellent vehicle.&nbsp; But the 
Buddha said, Behold Ananda, people would give money to those who praised them 
and have singers sing the praise of their daughters' charms, beauty, wealth and 
plenteous possessions.&nbsp; But these descendants are not really so just by 
being praised.&nbsp; People see the Brahmin's chariot and praise it, Gentlemen, 
what an excellent vehicle.&nbsp; But praising does not make it so.&nbsp; In 
reality that vehicle is miserable, bad.&nbsp; Behold Ananda, according to 
paramattha, the vehicle is the name of the Eightfold Path.&nbsp; The ariyamagga 
is supreme because it is without harm, because the ariyans would reach nibbana 
with this ariyamagga.&nbsp; Thus it is called brahmayana or dhammayana because 
of its being dhamma and vehicle as the ultimate war chariots because there is 
nothing greater and because it has won the war or defeated 
kilesa.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;This is the 
difference that comes from just seeing, which gives us the wrong view, the 
misunderstanding of the way to practice, because of the belief that white is a 
blessed color that renders people pure, without kilesa.&nbsp; But in truth, the 
Buddha said that the vehicle is miserable, bad because it misleads people by 
making them think it is excellent.&nbsp; Therefore to know realities as they 
truly are would not concern colors of clothing and ornaments.&nbsp; <B>Only when 
sati and panna arise to be mindful of the characteristics of realities 
appearing, would it be said the person has this vehicle within him to take him 
to the eradication of kilesa.</B></FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;
