<P><BR><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Therefore 
<B>sankhara-khandha are the 50 cetasika excluding vedana-cetasika and 
sanna-cetasika. Sankhara-dhamma comprises all the 89 citta, all the 52 cetasika 
and all the 28 rupa.</B></FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The meaning of 
sankhara-dhamma is more comprehensive than sankhara-khandha because citta, 
cetasika and rupa are all sankhara-dhamma while only the 50 cetasika are 
sankhara-khandha.&nbsp; And out of the 50 cetasika, which are sankhara-khandha, 
only cetana-cetasika is abhisankhara.&nbsp; In the paticcasamuppada, avijja is 
paccaya for sankhara, sankhara is paccaya for vinnana etc.&nbsp; <B>Sankhara in 
the paticcasamuppada means cetana-cetasika, which is abhisankhara, the supreme 
composing reality, or kusala-kamma, or akusala-kamma which would result in 
vipaka-citta and -cetasika.</B>&nbsp; Even though other cetasika also condition 
citta to arise such as phassa-cetasika.&nbsp;&nbsp; Without phassa-cetasika, 
which is a reality that comes into contact with arammana, there can be no citta 
that sees, hears, smells, tastes, knows bodysense contact or thinks.&nbsp; But 
phassa-cetasika is still not abhisankhara because it only comes into contact 
with arammana and then is gone.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Therefore of 50 
sankhara-khandha only cetana-cetasika is abhisankhara, or reality that is 
supreme in conditioning or composing by being kusala-kamma or akusala-kamma as 
kamma-paccaya that results in vipaka-cetasika's arising.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;<B>There are 3 
sankhara in the paticcasamuppada:</B></FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR><B><FONT 
face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>1 punnabhisankhara,&nbsp; 2 
apunnabhisankhara&nbsp; 3 anenjabhisankhara.</FONT></FONT></FONT></B> <BR><FONT 
face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;<B>Punnabhisankhara</B> 
being cetana-cetasika that arises with kamavacara-kusala-citta and 
rupavacara-kusala-citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT 
color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;<B>Apunnabhisankhara</B> being cetana-cetasika 
that arises with akusala-citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT 
color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;<B>Anenjabhisankhara</B> being cetana-cetasika 
that arises with arupajhana-kusala-citta, which is a steadfast, imperturbable 
kusala.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT 
size=+1>&nbsp;Kamavacara-kusala-citta can only arise for short, little instants 
and easily disturbed because they arise only in processes with series of 7 
citta.&nbsp; Dana, the abstention from dishonesty and other developments of 
kusala would arise only occasionally.&nbsp; Other than that akusala-citta would 
arise in numerous processes. Rupavacara-kusala-citta is kusala-nana-sampayutta 
composed of panna-cetasika, or cetasika that is peaceful enough to attain the 
level of appana-samadhi with rupa as arammana.&nbsp; It, therefore, is a 
mahagghata-citta that is close to kamavacara-kusala because it still has rupa as 
arammana.&nbsp; Anenjabhisankhara is an arupajhana or the pancama-jhana with no 
rupa as arammana.&nbsp; That instant of citta is steadfast because there is no 
rupa as arammana so that the result is plenary which is to make 
arupajhana-vipaka-citta arise in the arupa-brahma-bhumi where life is very long 
according to the power of the arupajhana-kusala.&nbsp; To be born in heaven is 
happiness because there are no such diseases, hardships or physical sufferings 
as there are in human and apaya-bhumi.&nbsp; But life there is not as long as in 
the rupa-brahma-bhumi and that of the rupa-brahma-bhumi is not as long as life 
in the arupa-brahma-bhumi because the arupa-brahma-bhumi is the result of 
arupajhana-kusala, which is anenjabhisankhara.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT 
size=+1>&nbsp;<B>Sankhara-dhamma</B> comprises citta, cetasika and 
rupa.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;<B>Abhisankhara</B> 
is the cetana-cetasika (one of the 50 sankhara-khandha).</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Differentiation among 
citta according to the kinds of asankharika and sasankharika shows that the 
kusala-, akusala-, vipaka- or kiriya-citta that arise with cetana-cetasika also 
differ into 2 kinds.&nbsp; Some are asankharika and others sasankharika. In the 
Atthasalini Cittuppadakandha there is a passage explaining: <B>called sasankhara 
because it evolves with sankhara </B>(inducements).&nbsp; <B>Sankhara in this 
context means self-induced or induced by others, or ordered to 
perform.</B>&nbsp; This is the characteristics of citta in everyday life, 
whether it were kusala or akusala, it would arise by itself with the strong 
paccaya of past accumulations without inducements of any kind.&nbsp; This 
conditioned citta which arises without inducement is asankharika, or does not 
rely on inducements.&nbsp; Sometimes, however, whether it were kusala or 
akusala, it would arise weakly, only able to arise by relying on inducement from 
itself or from other people.&nbsp; The kusala or akusala of little strength, 
which relies on inducement to arise, is sasankharika-citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 

<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>This shows that even 
kusala or akusala are differentiated by the strength accumulated in itself as 
paccaya to arise and sometimes by the weakness and dependence on inducement of 
itself or from others to arise.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Akusala-citta sometimes 
arises immediately according to accumulations, to be pleased or not with the 
arammana at the time.&nbsp; Sometimes it is not so.&nbsp; For example, one does 
not want to go to the cinema or plays but when friends and relatives ask one to, 
one does.&nbsp; Does that instant of citta want to go?&nbsp; Just as soon go as 
not.&nbsp; But since someone asks, one goes.&nbsp; By oneself one would 
not.&nbsp; Or sometimes one thinks that the movie might be entertaining so one 
would like to see it but one does not go because the desire is not strong enough 
to go right away.&nbsp; In real daily life one can see which instant the citta 
is strong and when weak whether of the akusala-type, that is lobha and dosa, or 
of the kusala-type.&nbsp; Some people when they heard of robe-offering 
ceremonies, they wish to join immediately as well as ask others to join 
in.&nbsp; Others, even though they are asked, could not join if this or that 
person won't.&nbsp; Therefore aspects of kusala-citta and akusala-citta differ 
according to paccaya, or causes, that condition the arising and evolving of the 
instant, even though the cetasika that compose the citta are of equal 
numbers.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The Buddha 
manifested the asankharika and sasankharika so that we may see the minute 
details of citta: though citta may have the same number of cetasika in its 
composition, without variation, the aspects of citta differ into asankharika and 
sasankharika according to the strength of the cetasika arising with it.&nbsp; To 
demonstrate the great beneficent karuna of the Buddha, who has the great 
kindness in manifesting the dhamma minutely, the Atthasalini Atthakatha 
Dhammasangipagana Cittuppadakandha explains "ananta" or the 4 greatest expanses 
[infinity] as follows:</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT 
color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp; These are considered <B>the 4 "ananta", being 
1 akasa (space) is ananta, infinite; 2 the universe is ananta, infinite; 3 the 
sattanikaya (species of animals and entities) is ananta, infinite; 4 the 
Buddha-nana (the Buddha's omniscience) is ananta, 
infinite.</B></FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Truly it is not 
possible to calculate akasa to the north, south, east or west to be so many 
hundred or thousand yojana. (...)&nbsp; If one were to use an iron hammer as big 
as the sineru mountain to pound the earth in two and then toss the iron hammer 
in the space between, it would truly fall below.&nbsp; There would be nothing to 
restrain it.&nbsp; Called ananta, the akasa is infinite, 
thus.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;To calculate the 
universe as so many hundred, thousand or hundred thousand in number is 
impossible.&nbsp; Truly, if the four great Brahma born in the Akanittha-plane 
(the rupa-brahma-bhumi of the fifth level of the Sudhavasa, which is the highest 
level) who are so swift that they could pass ten thousand universes in the time 
it take an arrow of an archer of great strength to pass the shadow of the 
sugar-palm crosswise, were to run with such speed, thinking we shall see the 
edges of the universe, these great Brahma are certain to attain parinibbana 
before ever having done so.&nbsp; All the universes are thus called ananta, 
infinite.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;To calculate the 
number of aquatic and land animals in the universe is impossible. Sattanikaya is 
thus called ananta (infinite).</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The Buddha-nana is 
said to be more ananta than all the three ananta above 
together.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Akasa we can see is 
endless.&nbsp; None can measure how many hundred, thousand or hundred thousand 
yojana it is.&nbsp; Nor can one measure the universe, who wants to count stars, 
universes?&nbsp; One can never succeed because the universe is ananta, 
infinite.&nbsp; Even sattanikaya, or all the life forms of the universe, cannot 
be counted or made into statistics, humans, deva, Brahma, land animals, aquatic 
animals, animals in apaya.&nbsp; Still the Buddha-nana is said to be more ananta 
than all three: the innumerable beings, the boundless universe and the 
immeasurable space.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;(Considering the 
incalculably infinite number of entities in the universe, the citta of these 
entities must be very intricately different indeed.)</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp; The kusala-citta 
that is kamavacara somanassasahagata (arising with somanassa-vedana) 
nana-sampayutta and asankharika (arising spontaneously, without inducement) 
would arise in each entity in great numbers, since there are great numbers of 
entities, citta would proportionately arise in greater 
numbers.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;There is not one 
unique kusala-citta. Even the kusala-citta of the kamavacara-kusala kind arising 
with panna or, as nana-sampayutta, and asankharika, or with great strength, is 
not only of one kind.&nbsp; Citta must vary according to the numbers of 
entities, which each has citta that arise one at a time.&nbsp; Though the citta 
arise as numerously as the number of entities, but all kusala-citta are of the 
same type: by definition they are kamavacara, somanassasahagata, nana-sampayutta 
and with the common status of asankharika.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;The Sammasambuddha 
can determine the kamavacara-kusala-citta that arise with all the entities of 
incalculable numbers in all the universes of incalculable extent with his 
omniscience as if he weighed them on a great scale and measured them in 
bushels.&nbsp; Then he arranged them into 8 parts and manifested that these 
citta (kamavacara-kusala-citta) are of 8 kinds, with the explanation of which 
the pundits could only agree (they could not deny it).</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;This shows that as 
numerable as kamavacara-kusala-citta may be the Buddha could count and organize 
kamavacara-kusala into 8 kinds of mahakusala which no one can deny through the 
differences in the upekkha- or somanassa-vedana in the arising of panna or the 
absence thereof and in being asankharika or sasankharika.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><BR><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Have you ever been 
sleepy, tired or bored?&nbsp; Sometimes the citta have the idea of doing some 
kusala or other, but then grow weak or sleepy.&nbsp; Would sati be aware of the 
characteristics of that instant of citta.&nbsp; If not, then it becomes the 
self, with real sleepiness, discouragement, disheartenment and boredom.&nbsp; 
Weariness is real and if sati were not mindful of the characteristics of these 
realities as they truly are, there can be no knowledge of that reality as not an 
entity, a person or the self but only the characteristic of the citta that 
arises from conditions and causes and then falls away. The Buddha manifested 
different kinds of citta, for example, asankharika and sasankharika: there are 
lobha-mula-citta that are asankharika while others are sasankharika; there are 
dosha-mula-citta that are asankharika and sasankharika; likewise 
kusala-citta.&nbsp; Whenever sati is mindful of the characteristics of these 
realities, there can be knowledge that they are nama-dhamma and not 
rupa-dhamma.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Discouragement, 
disheartenment are not rupa but realities of citta that are sasankharika because 
they are citta that are not strong.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;<B>Only the 
kamavacara-citta differ into asankharika and sasankharika</B> because the 
kamavacara-citta is the citta of the lowest bhumi, the citta of the kind that 
arises commonly in daily life at every instant of seeing, hearing, smelling, 
tasting, knowing bodysense contact and thinking about sight, sound, smell, taste 
and bodysense contact.&nbsp; Sometimes they are strong, others weak according to 
causes and conditions.&nbsp; But citta of higher levels, such as the 
rupavacara-citta, arupavacara-citta or lokuttara-citta, are not differentiated 
as asankharika or sasankharika because by nature they are all sasankharika with 
the definition that these citta cannot arise by themselves but depend on 
development of the distinct citta to arise, unlike the kamavacara-citta that 
differ into strong citta and weak citta.&nbsp; This is because, for the 
rupajhana-kusala-citta, arupajhana-kusala-citta or lokuttara-kusala-citta to 
arise, the kamavacara-kusala-nana-sampayutta-citta must have arisen 
previously.&nbsp; Without the development of 
kamavacara-kusala-nana-sampayutta-citta as inducement, the jhana-kusala-citta or 
lokuttara-kusala-citta cannot arise at all.&nbsp; Therefore citta of other 
bhumi, or rupavacara-citta, arupavacara-citta and lokuttara-citta, are all 
sasankharika and nana-sampayutta without exception.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Each would be able 
to know the characteristics of asankharika- and sasankharika-citta of one's 
own.&nbsp; For example, do those who come to listen to the dhamma depend upon 
the inducement of others?&nbsp; At first maybe there was no desire to come but 
someone persuaded them to.&nbsp; But afterwards they come by themselves.&nbsp; 
The characteristics of the citta of those that came by themselves differ from 
those with inducements.&nbsp; Not that there is always sasankharika or only 
asankharika.&nbsp; As in those who were asked to go to a cinema.&nbsp; When 
asked, the citta was weak.&nbsp; But if the movie was entertaining, exciting, 
they laughed, enjoyed it and at that instant the citta was no longer weak.&nbsp; 
No one induced them to laugh and have fun.&nbsp; But the citta of that instant 
was strong and arose with somanassa- vedana so there was enjoyment and laughter 
and therefore the citta is asankharika.&nbsp; This demonstrates the 
characteristic of anatta of each instant of citta that arises and evolves 
according to conditions.&nbsp; Even though now it is so, the next instant it can 
be another way according to causes and conditions.</FONT></FONT></FONT>
