<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;To understand the 
meaning of the phrase "called citta because it accumulates latent tendencies in 
continuation, with the efficiency of the javana-vithi", we must comprehend that 
citta arises and falls away consecutively with great speed.&nbsp; The 
nama-dhamma that arises with each citta and falls away simultaneously 
accumulates in the successive citta that arise and fall 
away.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;When citta arises 
to see that which appears through the eyes or hears sound through the ear etc. 
normally one would not know that seeing or hearing are aspects of citta.&nbsp; 
However we do know when we feel anguish, sad, troubled, happy, cheerful, angry, 
kind, helpful, or friendly.&nbsp; Each instant of citta arises and falls away 
successively with great speed, all the while accumulating its own innate latent 
tendencies: kusala and akusala citta that arise and fall away are conditioned 
for the accumulation passed on consecutively to the ensuing citta.&nbsp; Because 
when a citta arises and falls away, the falling away of the citta is the 
condition for the next citta to arise in succession immediately.&nbsp; The citta 
following thus possesses the characteristics accumulated in the preceding citta 
and passes them on to the subsequent citta incessantly.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Each may notice 
that the individual has distinct demeanors and dispositions according to the 
accumulation of each moment of citta that arises and falls away in 
sequence.&nbsp; Some are beneficent because citta that are beneficent arise and 
fall away and subsequent citta accumulate kusala as conditions 
respectively.&nbsp; The same for akusala, whether the citta is composed of 
lobha, dosa or moha.&nbsp; When it falls away, it also conditions those ensuing 
citta to arise and inherit the characteristics accumulated in the preceding 
citta.&nbsp; Citta arise consecutively constantly because <B>each citta is 
anantara-paccaya, the condition for the next citta to arise consecutively 
immediately after the preceding citta falls away.&nbsp; Each citta conditions 
the succeeding citta to arise, except for the citta of the arahanta,</B> which 
is not an anantara-paccaya.&nbsp; When the cuti-citta (dying consciousness) of 
the arahanta falls away, parinibbana occurs.&nbsp; There are no more 
patisandhi-citta, or any other type of citta arising and falling away ever 
again.&nbsp; There are three of the said paccaya: sahajata-paccaya, 
arammana-paccaya and anantara-paccaya.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1><B>&nbsp;The second 
characteristic of citta.</B> In the Atthasalini is the following passage: In 
addition the word "citta" is common to all citta, including kusala-citta, 
akusala-citta and mahakiriya-citta of the lokiya type.&nbsp; Called citta 
because it accumulates latent tendencies in continuation, with the efficiency of 
the javana-vithi.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;It sounds 
complicated but it happens in real, daily life.&nbsp; Generally we hear the 
words "kusala-citta" and "akusala-citta" often enough but we are not familiar 
with the word "mahakiriya-citta of the lokiya type", nor "javana-vithi".&nbsp; 
All citta, irrespective of its type, when categorized by its arising or "jati", 
are classified as 1.&nbsp; kusala-citta&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; akusala-citta&nbsp; 
3.&nbsp; vipaka-citta&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; kiriya-citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Most of us are 
familiar with the words "kusala-citta" and "akusala-citta" but not with the word 
"vipaka-citta" nor "kiriya-citta".&nbsp; <B>Kusala-citta is a good citta, which 
causes kusala-vipaka as future results.&nbsp;</B> When kusala-citta and 
kusala-cetasika arose together as cause have fallen away, the dhamma that is 
kusala continues to accumulate in the next consecutive citta respectively, 
conditioning citta and cetasika which are kusala-vipaka-citta and 
kusala-vipaka-cetasika to ensue concurrently as result of the said kusala.&nbsp; 
According to the commentary, even though the vipaka-cetasika arises with the 
citta, since the citta is pre-eminent, the word vipaka-citta is used to include 
the accompanying cetasika as well.&nbsp; So too the word "cittaja-rupa" or rupa 
that arises with citta as condition.&nbsp; Cittaja-rupa arises because citta and 
cetasika simultaneously function as causes.&nbsp; But we use the word 
cittaja-rupa to include the cetasika arising together with it, which are all 
paccaya for the rupa to arise.&nbsp; To say vipaka-citta, therefore, also 
intends accompanying vipaka-cetasika.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1><B>&nbsp;Akusala-citta 
is a reality that is harmful, that cause results that are dukkha, unpleasant or 
akusala-vipaka-citta</B>.&nbsp; Other than kusala-citta akusala-citta and 
vipaka-citta, there is also another type of citta:<B> the kiriya-citta, which is 
not a condition for vipaka to arise.&nbsp; It is therefore not kusala, akusala 
or vipaka citta because kiriya-citta does not result from kusala or 
akusala-citta.</B></FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Citta can all be 
categorized into one of four jati, namely kusala, akusala, vipaka or 
kiriya.&nbsp; If we do not study carefully, we would not know which is 
kusala-citta, akusala-citta, vipaka-citta or kiriya-citta.&nbsp; For instance, 
the patisandhi-citta is the first citta that arises in this existence, this 
lifetime.&nbsp; Everyone is alive now because patisandhi-citta arose in this 
plane, in this life, resulting in this person.&nbsp; It can be neither 
kusala-citta nor akusala-citta.&nbsp; When it arises at the moment of birth, it 
does not perform any kamma, bodily, verbally or mentally. <B>Patisandhi-citta is 
a vipaka-citta that arises conditioned by one kamma or another.&nbsp;</B> 
Although there are innumerable past kamma in each lifetime,<B> whichever kamma 
is the paccaya of the patisandhi-citta and vipaka-citta to arise, that kamma is 
the kamma-paccaya of that patisandhi-citta and vipaka-citta.</B>&nbsp; If the 
citta is born in the human plane of existence, which is a sugati-bhumi (the 
happy plane), it must be the result of a&nbsp; kusala-vipaka.&nbsp; To be born 
in the apaya-bhumi (the unhappy existence) that is in hell, as peta, as asura, 
as animals, would be the result of akusala-kamma.&nbsp; The citta that arises in 
the apaya-bhumi is akusala-vipaka.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>When the 
patisandhi-citta falls away, the kamma not only makes the patisandhi-citta 
arise, but <B>the same kamma that conditioned the arising of the 
patisandhi-citta also serves as kamma-paccaya causing the next vipaka-citta to 
arise and performs bhavanga-kicca subsequently.</B>&nbsp; Patisandhi-citta is 
the citta that functions as successor to the cuti-citta (the last citta of the 
life before).&nbsp; As soon as the cuti-citta of the preceding life falls away, 
a past kamma is the paccaya for the patisandhi-citta to arise and become the 
first citta in this life, in continuation from the cuti-citta of the former 
life, then falls away.&nbsp; Then the same kamma conditions the following 
vipaka-citta to ensue and perform the bhavanga-kicca or the function of life 
continuum of this person consequently until the next cuti or the departure from 
this existence, the end of being this person in this life.&nbsp; While the next 
cuti has not yet arrived, other kamma are conditions for diverse vipaka-citta to 
arise and experience arammana through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body sense and 
mind.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1><B>Kusala is a reality 
that is virtuous, harmless.</B>&nbsp; Some might think that we are able to do 
kusala only when we have money or other possessions.&nbsp; But we forget 
generosity.&nbsp; Even without money, if there were things that could be shared 
to benefit other people, could we relinquish them to help others?&nbsp; If not, 
is that moment kusala or akusala?&nbsp; Those who do not know that kusala-citta 
is a beneficent citta, might regret that they lack funds to make merit.&nbsp; 
But in reality even without money to perform dana-kusala, there still are many 
other kusala that can be done.&nbsp; Whenever we, for example, are friendly with 
others, feel harmonious with them, have gentleness, kind and sincere words for 
them, or beneficence towards them, those are moments of kusala, the completely 
harmless reality.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Whenever there is 
mana, or conviction that one is superior in any way to others or even 
delimitations between "them" and "us", with no beneficence [for others], these 
are moments of akusala-citta: citta that are not good, realities that are 
harmful.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;When we really 
understand the characteristics of kusala, we are able to develop all kinds of 
the kusala.&nbsp; Even without money to donate, there still are minor things 
that can be conceded.&nbsp; If one really cannot give up things because of one's 
possessiveness, but still wants to have a peaceful citta or to eradicate kilesa 
and become a sotapanna, would one be able to relinquish anything?&nbsp; Each 
person has accumulated kusala and akusala differently.&nbsp; Thus one should 
examine one's citta whether one is still very possessive or can one begin to 
sacrifice things to benefit others, little by little, (until it becomes a habit, 
a powerful paccaya, to attenuate the clinging to nama-dhamma and rupa-dhamma 
that one takes for self,) until the sharply developed panna is able to realize 
nibbana.&nbsp; When those who want to eradicate kilesa (but are still pleased 
when kilesa, such as conceit or jealousy, arises,) are told to attenuate [these 
tendencies] and be glad in others' happiness, or to have metta even for those 
who are evil, could they do it?&nbsp; Those satisfied to be angry, degrading, 
conceited or jealous, would be unable to do so.&nbsp; To abandon kilesa is 
something that cannot be done all at once, but only gradually, by developing 
panna so it accumulates little by little.&nbsp; Those who really want to 
eradicate kilesa would know how to develop every kind of kusala, not only 
practice dana and jealously set aside other kusala.&nbsp; Some might wish for 
peace because there is much uneasiness and agitation each day.&nbsp; Thoughts 
bring anger, complications, trouble and anxiety because there is no examination 
of the citta of the moment, but rather of the person one is angry with.&nbsp; 
When the way we reflect about others bring akusala, the citta would become 
uneasy, agitated and anxious.&nbsp; When one knows one is anxious, one desires 
peace without realizing that if there were no anger, there would be no 
trouble.&nbsp; When one is angry, one feels uneasy, anxious, disturbed, which is 
akusala, a reality that is harmful.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;If we are able to 
be mindful at the moment of anger, and examine other people in a way that brings 
metta, mudita and upekkha, there could be peace immediately because the moment 
that citta has metta, mudita or upekkha, is kusala, (without lobha, dosa or 
moha,) so it is calm.&nbsp; All kusala-citta are peaceful.&nbsp; Therefore if 
one desires to eradicate kilesa, one must develop every kind of kusala, not only 
dana-kusala.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>A passage in the 
Atthasalini, the commentary of Dhammasanganipakarana, Cittupadakandha manifested 
the second characteristic of the citta as follows: In addition because the word 
"citta" is common to all citta, including kusala-citta, akusala-citta and 
mahakiriya-citta of the lokiya type.&nbsp; Called "citta" because it accumulates 
latent tendencies in continuation, with the efficiency of the 
javana-vithi.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The word 
<B>"santana"</B> or "santati" means arising and falling away in 
continuation.&nbsp; The citta that sees, hears, smells, tastes and feels 
contacts and touches are vipaka-citta, not kusala-citta or akusala-citta.&nbsp; 
They, therefore, do not accumulate latent tendencies in continuation.&nbsp; The 
citta that sees, hears, smells, tastes and feels contacts and touches are 
results of past kamma.&nbsp; When a kamma is ripe to bear fruit or fully 
composed of paccaya, it conditions vipaka-citta of various sorts to perform 
different functions such as see, hear etc.&nbsp; Vipaka-citta does not 
accumulate latent tendencies in continuation because each vipaka-citta arises 
from accumulated kusala-kamma or akusala-kamma as paccaya.&nbsp; <B>After the 
vipaka-citta has arisen and fallen away, it does not cause any other vipaka to 
arise.</B></FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;To understand the 
second characteristic of the citta as stated that "kusala-citta, akusala-citta 
and mahakiriya-citta of the lokiya type are called citta because it accumulates 
latent tendencies in continuation, with the efficiency of the javana-vithi", we 
must first understand vithi-citta.&nbsp; What kind of citta is 
vithi-citta?&nbsp; Where does it arise?&nbsp; We must also comprehend<B> 
javana-vithi, which is the moment when the citta accumulates its latent 
tendencies in continuation, which is either kusala or akusala while for the 
Arahanta it is mahakiriya-citta of the lokiya type.</B>&nbsp; For even though 
they are Arahanta, they still have physical, verbal and mental aspects that 
differ according to their accumulated latent tendencies in 
continuation.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Thus we must first 
understand the meaning of vithi-citta that it is the citta that is not 
patisandhi-citta, bhavanga-citta or cuti-citta.&nbsp; <B>Any citta that are not 
patisandhi-citta, bhavanga-citta or cuti-citta are all vithi-citta.</B>&nbsp; In 
each lifetime the patisandhi-citta arises only once or when it performs the 
function of patisandhi-kicca in continuation from the cuti-citta of the last 
lifetime.&nbsp; Only one citta is the patisandhi-citta.&nbsp; While the citta is 
performing patisandhi-citta, it does not see, hear, smell, taste, or know body 
sense contact.&nbsp; Patisandhi is a vipaka-citta, the result of kamma.&nbsp; 
Patisandhi-citta that arises in the human plane is a kusala-vipaka-citta.&nbsp; 
It is the result of kusala-kamma.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Kamma does not only 
result in making patisandhi-citta arise, but when the patisandhi-citta has 
fallen away, kamma also is paccaya for the vipaka-citta of the same kind to 
arise and perform bhavanga-kicca, of life continuum of that lifetime and being 
that person, until the moment of cuti.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Before cuti, <B>the 
bhavanga-citta arises and falls away repeatedly performing the function of 
continuing to be that person in the moment when there is no seeing, hearing, 
smelling, tasting, knowing body sense contact nor thinking.&nbsp;</B> Therefore, 
whenever the citta is patisandhi-citta, bhavanga-citta or cuti-citta, it is not 
vithi-citta.&nbsp; While we are deeply sleeping, we do not see, hear, smell, 
taste, know body sense contact or think, the bhavanga-citta arises and falls 
away continuously until we dream or wake up to see, hear, smell, taste, know 
body sense contact or think the arammana of the world.&nbsp; When the 
vipaka-citta arises to perform the functions of patisandhi-kicca, bhavanga-kicca 
or cuti-kicca, no arammana of the world appears.&nbsp; That this is the human 
world or its characteristics do not appear.&nbsp; If anyone were asleep now, he 
would not know or see who is here, what sounds there are, what smell, or whether 
it is hot or cold.&nbsp; This world does not appear to the patisandhi-citta, 
bhavanga-citta or cuti-citta in the least.&nbsp; When we are not asleep, we 
remember things about the world, people and happenings in this world.&nbsp; But 
while we are sleeping, the bhavanga-citta is severed from all arammana of the 
world.&nbsp; We do not know who we are, where we are, how we are related to 
anyone, what wealth, social rank, happiness or unhappiness are 
ours.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>The citta that sees is 
not a bhavanga-citta but a vithi-citta that arises and sees what appears through 
the eyes.&nbsp; Any citta that arises to see, know or be pleased with, what 
appears through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body sense or mind are 
vithi-citta.&nbsp; When we hear sound and are pleased or not, at that moment a 
citta is not a bhavanga-citta but a vithi-citta.&nbsp; All citta that arise to 
know rupa that appears through the eyes are cakkhu-dvara-vithi-citta.&nbsp; All 
citta that arise to know rupa that appears through the ears are 
sota-dvara-vithi-citta.&nbsp; All citta that arise to know rupa that appears 
through the nose are ghana-dvara-vithi-citta.&nbsp; All citta that arise to know 
rupa that appears through the tongue are jivha-dvara-vithi-citta.&nbsp; All 
citta that arise to know rupa that appears through the body sense are 
kaya-dvara-vithi-citta.&nbsp; All citta that arise to know rupa that appears 
through the mind are mano-dvara-vithi-citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

arises and falls away in daily life is the bhavanga-citta that arises and falls

<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>When one is born in the 
plane of the five khandha, with both rupa-khandha and nama-khandha, kamma is the 
paccaya that makes kammaja-rupa or cakkhuppasada-rupa, sotappasada-rupa, 
ghanappasada-rupa, jivhanappasada-rupa and kayappasada-rupa arise and fall away, 
maintaining the state of a person who is not blind or deaf etc.&nbsp; But when 
kamma is not paccaya for the cakkhuppasada-rupa to arise, that person would be 
completely blind.&nbsp; The seeing citta and every other citta arise from their 
particular paccaya.&nbsp; While the vithi-citta cannot arise, the bhavanga-citta 
arises and falls away in a continuous succession.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>When any rupa arises in 
contact with any pasada-rupa and the bhavanga, the vithi-citta cannot arise 
immediately.&nbsp; <B>To designate which citta the rupa arises in contact with, 
it is decreed that the bhavanga-citta with which rupa arises in contact be 
called "atita-bhavanga",</B> which is like the preceding bhavanga.&nbsp; 
Although rupa arises and falls away very rapidly, citta is faster still: a 
sabhava-rupa arises and falls away the time it takes 17 citta to arise and fall 
away consecutively.&nbsp; Atita-bhavanga is the bhavanga that the arising rupa 
and the pasada-rupa come into contact with; <B>thus we might know when the rupa 
contacting the pasada-rupa and the atita-bhavanga would fall away</B> since a 
rupa lasts only 17 moments of citta arising and falling away.&nbsp; When the 
atita-bhavanga falls away, it is the paccaya for the next bhavanga-citta to stir 
as "bhavanga-calana", which is still a bhavanga-citta because the vithi-citta 
cannot arise to cut immediately into the stream of bhavanga.&nbsp; When the 
bhavanga-calana has fallen away, the next bhavanga-citta to arise is the<B> 
"bhavangupaccheda", or the bhavanga that cuts the current of bhavanga because it 
is the last citta of that flow of bhavanga.</B>&nbsp; When the bhavangupaccheda 
has fallen away, then the vithi-citta can arise to know the arammana through the

mano-dvara-vithi-citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>Each citta arises, 
performs a function, and falls away.&nbsp; The patisandhi-citta performs the 
function of patisandhi-kicca in sequence from the cuti-citta of the previous 
life just once.&nbsp; All bhavanga-citta, including atita-bhavanga, 
bhavangupaccheda, bhavanga-calana, perform the function of life continuum of 
that lifetime.&nbsp; When bhavangupaccheda has fallen away the first vithi-citta 
that arises in sequence to the bhavangupaccheda performs avajjana-kicca, 
literally translated as perceiving the arammana that appears through the dvara, 
or, know the arammana in contact with the dvara.&nbsp; Called avajjana because 
it means move out of the continuum (the arising and falling away in 
continuation)&nbsp; which is a bhavanga, to incline and proceed towards the 
arammana contacting the dvara.&nbsp; In the case of the <B>panca-dvara, or the 
eye, ear, nose, tongue and body sense, the panca-dvaravajjana-citta, a kind of 
citta, would arise and perform the function of avajjana-kicca</B> to perceive 
the arammana that is in contact with one of the five dvara. But at that instant 
the citta does not yet see, hear, smell, taste or experience the body sense 
contact.&nbsp; In the case of the mano-dvara, or the mind, which is not 
cakkhuppasada, sotappasada, ghanappasada, jivhappasada or kayappasada, the 
<B>mano-dvaravajjana-citta, another kind of citta (as opposed to the 
panca-dvaravajjana-citta) would arise, perform the function of avajjana-kicca 
through the mano-dvara only.</B></FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>For example, when taste 
arises in contact with the jivhappasada after the bhavanga, namely the 
<B>atita-bhavanga</B>, falls away, the <B>bhavanga-calana</B> arises in 
continuation and falls away,&nbsp; followed by the 
<B>bhavangupaccheda</B>.&nbsp; Then the <B>panca-dvaravajjana-citta</B> arises 
to perceive or know that the arammana is in contact with the jivha-dvara but 
still does not experience the taste yet.&nbsp; Parallel to the moment we know a 
visitor is at the door but cannot yet see the guest, thus we do not know who it 
is.&nbsp; We only know that there is someone there.&nbsp; Everyone has visitors 
but when we think of them we generally think of people.&nbsp; But in reality 
visitors are different arammana that appear through eye, ear, nose, tongue, body 
sense and mind.&nbsp; When we see a sight, it is a guest.&nbsp; When we hear, 
sound is.&nbsp; When we do not hear, sound does not appear; the guest of the ear 
has not yet arrived.&nbsp; Taste is the guest of the tongue that appears for a 
moment and falls away.&nbsp; Whenever an arammana appears at a dvara, the 
arammana is a guest of that dvara for the shortest moment, then falls away never 
to return again in the samsara-vatta (perpetual rounds of wandering 
rebirth).&nbsp; Some elderly people, who met a multitude of people and enjoyed 
good company while they were not yet aged, feel lonely because when they grew 
older, guests, who are people to them, are less frequent.&nbsp; When we asked 
elderly people what they like best, some say they like people, meaning they like 
people to visit and enjoy a nice conversation.&nbsp; In reality everyone has 
guests each moment when there is seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching; 
and normally when the guests arrive, the lobha- mula-citta arises to take 
pleasure in the sight, sound, smell, taste and bodily 
contact.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>There are many kinds of 
guests.&nbsp; If they were robbers, no one would welcome them, but if they were 
relatives or friends, we await their arrival.&nbsp; But in reality the diverse 
arammana that appear through the eye, ear, nose,</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT 
face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>tongue, and body sense are only 
rupa-dhamma, with no malice for anyone, because rupa-dhamma is not an 
intelligence.&nbsp; Therefore, at which moment is the guest a robber or a 
relative?&nbsp; When the arammana appears and there is pleasure and attachment, 
the robber is there because the pleasure and attachment are 
akusala-dhamma.&nbsp; Akusala-dhamma is nobody's friend.&nbsp; Kusala-dhamma is 
like a close relative that is a benefactor in all circumstances.&nbsp; Thus we 
must know the different characteristics of citta: akusala-citta is harmful, a 
robber and not a friend.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Thinking of 
outlaws makes us afraid.&nbsp; We do not desire them as guests.&nbsp; But 
robbers are akusala-citta which are the causes for future outlaw guests.&nbsp; 
Kusala-citta, on the other hand, is comparable to relatives and friends, who 
will bring more relatives and friends in the future as 
well.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Rupa-dhamma, 
therefore, is not a cause.&nbsp; Rupa-dhamma is not a reality that knows or 
intelligence; it does not have any intentions.&nbsp; Sound that appears is not 
intelligence that wants anyone to hear or not to hear it.&nbsp; It does not 
discriminate and choose one person to hear and not another.&nbsp; Sound is a 
rupa-dhamma that arises according to its condition, and it is up to whose 
sotappasada comes into contact with which sound.&nbsp; Some people are fast 
asleep and do not hear frightening thunder.&nbsp; The thunder is, therefore, not 
those people's guest but the guest of those with the accumulated causes which 
bring their sotappasada into contact with the sound.&nbsp; When any arammana 
arises to be the guest of a person through the eye, ear, nose, tongue 
or</FONT></FONT></FONT> <BR><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT 
size=+1>&nbsp;body sense, it is because of causes and conditions or the 
accumulation of that person, which is paccaya for a vipaka-citta to arise and 
know that arammana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Therefore the 
guests that appear through the eye, ear, nose, tongue or body sense are sight, 
sound, smell, taste or body sense contact that appears for an instant and then 
falls away, never to return.&nbsp; They are not animals, people, the selves nor 
objects.&nbsp; Each day no one can tell which guest comes from where and 
when.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1><B>&nbsp;Whenever the 
citta is knowing arammana through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body sense and 
mind, it is the vithi-citta.&nbsp;</B> The panca-dvaravajjana-citta is the first 
vithi-citta to arise after the bhavangupaccheda.&nbsp; The 
panca-dvaravajjana-citta performs the function of avajjana-kicca or only knows 
that an arammana or another is in contact with one of the five dvara.&nbsp; Thus 
it is not the citta that is performing the function of seeing etc.<B> Other 
vithi-citta cannot arise through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body sense and mind 
at all if the panca-dvaravajjana-citta had not previously arisen and fallen 
away.</B>&nbsp; Therefore the panca-dvaravajjana-citta is the first vithi-citta 
to arise at any of the five dvara.&nbsp; Because this kind of citta can perform 
this function for all five dvara, it is called panca-dvaravajjana-citta (panca + 
dvara + avajjana).&nbsp; To distinguish the different dvara, when it appears 
through the cakkhu-dvara it is called the cakkhu-dvaravajjana; through the 
sota-dvara, called the sota-dvaravajjana; through the ghana-dvara, 
ghana-dvaravajjana; through the jivha-dvara, jivha-dvaravajjana; through the 
kaya-dvara, kaya-dvaravajjana.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Since this citta 
can perform avajjana-kicca for all five dvara, it is collectively called 
panca-dvaravajjana-citta.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp; As to the 
vithi-citta that arises to know diverse arammana through the mind, before the 
vithi-citta or the kusala or akusala citta etc. can arise to think, there must 
be avajjana-citta.&nbsp; The citta that performs the function of avajjana-kicca, 
or knowing the arammana in contact with the mind, is called 
<B>mano-dvaravajjana-citta.&nbsp; The mano-dvaravajjana-citta is the first 
vithi-citta to arise through the mano-dvara.&nbsp; If the 
mano-dvaravajjana-citta does not arise, the vithi-citta cannot arise to know the 
arammana through the mind or through the mano-dvara.</B>&nbsp; The 
mano-dvaravajjana-citta is not a panca-dvaravajjana-citta.&nbsp; They are 
distinct, of different kinds. <B>The panca-dvaravajjana-citta can only arise 
through the five dvara, never through the mano-dvara.&nbsp; The 
mano-dvaravajjana-citta can perform the avajjana-kicca uniquely through the 
mano-dvara.</B></FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Therefore <B>the 
vithi-citta that performs avajjana-kicca for the six dvara are of two kinds: the 
panca-dvaravajjana-citta, which performs the avajjana-kicca through the five 
dvara, and the mano-dvaravajjana-citta, which performs avajjana-kicca uniquely 
through the mano-dvara.</B></FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Is there 
panca-dvaravajjana-citta right now?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; If not, there would be no 
seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, or knowing body sense 
contact.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Is there 
mano-dvaravajjana-citta now?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; When the vithi-citta of any of the 
panca-dvara arises to know arammana and then falls away, many bhavanga-citta 
interpose.&nbsp; Then the mano-dvara-vithi-citta would arise to continue to 
experience the arammana through the mind, or based on the mind 
(bhavangupaccheda-citta), as mano-dvara.&nbsp; The mano-dvara would arise and 
know once again the same arammana as the citta that had known the arammana 
through the panca-dvara and had fallen away.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

the fourth vithi-citta is the santirana-citta, which arises to perform the

(mano-dvaravajjana-citta that arises to perform votthabbana-kicca through the 
panca-dvara) arises to be javana-patipadaka and perform the function of

the kusala, akusala-citta or mahakiriya-citta of the lokiya type, which arises 
to perform javana-kicca seven instants, also according to paccaya.&nbsp; The 
j<B>avana-vithi accumulates latent tendencies because it repeatedly arises and 
falls away seven times in sequence.&nbsp;</B> The citta that performs 
javana-kicca is kusala or akusala-citta for those who are not arahanta.&nbsp; 
But those who are, have eradicated all kilesa, therefore they do not have kusala 
or akusala-citta.&nbsp; The mahakiriya-citta would perform the javana-kicca 
since the arahanta do not have kusala or akusala-citta.&nbsp; The arahanta only 
have vipaka and kiriya-citta.&nbsp; There are many kinds of kiriya-citta.&nbsp; 
Whenever there is seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, knowing body sense contact 
or thinking, <B>the javana-citta of the arahanta is the kiriya-citta of the 
lokiya type, </B>or the citta that experiences the arammana of the world, namely 
sight, sound, smell, taste and body sense contact.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;There is merely 
one moment of seeing and then contentment in the sight, which causes citta that 
are lobha-mula-citta to rise and perform javana-kicca for seven instants, seven 
times the cakkhu-vinnana-citta which arises just one instant.&nbsp; This is the 
accumulation of akusala that everyone is really performing in daily life.&nbsp; 
To eradicate kilesa is, therefore, not easy and not by knowing nothing.&nbsp; 
Those who think that kilesa can be easily eliminated should realize the truth 
about the accumulation of avijja, lobha, dosa and other defilements which is 
seven times the amount of cakkhu-vinnana, sota-vinnana, ghana-vinnana, 
jivha-vinnana and kaya-vinnana.&nbsp; Those who hope to wait until they become 
enlightened with the ariya-sacca-dhamma do not think of causes and results in 
reality that have been accumulated through the samsara-vatta, that we must 
develop panna to realize more and more fully the characteristics of realities as 
they really are until we realize the ariya-sacca-dhamma and eradicate kilesa 
level by level.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;While we are 
listening, and studying citta, if sati-patthana is mindful of the realities 
appearing, that moment we are practicing or developing the path leading to the 
enlightenment of nibbana, which is the reality that eradicates kilesa.&nbsp; At 
any instant that sati does not realize the characteristics as they really are 
even if it is a moment of kusala, it is not the way to eradicate kilesa.&nbsp; 
The passage in the Atthasalini Cittupadakandha explains the word "acayagami" as 
follows:</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Georgia><FONT color=#993366><FONT size=+1>&nbsp;Akusala and kusala 
that are not magga is called <B>acayagami </B>because of the meaning "to build 
dhamma like a mason building a brick wall".&nbsp; Therefore when we are not 
mindful of the characteristics of realities that are appearing as they really 
are, whether akusala or kusala, we accumulate and build lifetimes like a person 
building a wall out of bricks one at a time, one on top of the other.&nbsp; When 
sati is mindful of the characteristics of realities as they really are, it is 
then the magga, the <B>apacayagami</B> because of the meaning "not to build the 
dhamma that goes on" like a man dismantling the wall that the mason has layered 
with bricks.&nbsp; Are we now taking down or piling up 
bricks?</FONT></FONT></FONT>
