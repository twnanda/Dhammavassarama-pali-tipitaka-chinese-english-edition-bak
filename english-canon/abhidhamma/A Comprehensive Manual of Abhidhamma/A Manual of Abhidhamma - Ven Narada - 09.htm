      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">A few practical hints are given 
      here for the benefit of the average reader. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Adopting a convenient posture, 
      breathe out and close the mouth. Then breathe in through the nostrils 
      calmly, without strain. Inhale first and count mentally one. Exhale and 
      count two, concentrating on the breathing process. In this manner count up 
      to ten, constantly focusing your attention on respiration. It is possible 
      for the mind to wander before one counts up to ten. But one need not be 
      discouraged. Try again until success is achieved. Gradually one can 
      increase the number of series, say five series of ten. Later one can 
      concentrate on the breathing process without counting. Some prefer 
      counting as it aids concentration; while others prefer not to count. What 
      is essential is concentration, and not counting, which is secondary. When 
      one does this concentration exercise one feels light in body and mind and 
      very peaceful. One might perhaps feel as if one were floating in the air. 
      When one practices this concentration for a certain period, a day may come 
      when one will realize that his so-called body is supported by mere breath, 
      and that the body perishes when breathing ceases. Thus one fully realizes 
      impermanence. Where there is change there cannot be a permanent entity or 
      an immortal soul. Insight might then be developed to gain Arahatship. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">It is now clear that the object 
      of this concentration on respiration is not merely to gain one-pointedness 
      but also to cultivate Insight in order to obtain Deliverance. </FONT></P>

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">24. <B>Vipassana</B> or Insight 
      is the third and final stage on the Path of Sainthood. The chief object of 
      Insight is to understand things as they truly are. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">25. <B>Anicca,</B> i.e., the 
      fleeting nature of both mind and matter. Changeableness is a 
      characteristic of everything that is conditioned. All conditioned things 
      are constantly changing, not remaining static for two consecutive moments. 
      Mind, in fact, changes even faster than matter. Normally matter endures 
      only for seventeen thought-moments. Commentators state that, during the 
      time occupied by a flash of lightning, billions of thought-moments may 
      arise. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">26. <B>Dukkha</B> - All 
      conditioned things are subject to suffering. Birth is suffering, decay is 
      suffering, disease is suffering, death is suffering. Union with the 
      unpleasant is suffering. Separation from the pleasant is suffering. Not to 
      get what one desires is suffering. In brief, the five aggregates of 
      attachment are suffering.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">27. <B>Anatta</B> - Or 
      Soullessness is the crux of Buddhism. As there is no permanent entity in 
      matter, so also there is no unchanging entity in mind conceived as an 
      'ego' or soul'. In everything mundane and supramundane conditioned and 
      non-conditioned, there is no permanent soul. Hence the Buddha in the 
      Dhammapada stated <I>'sabbe dhamma anatta</I> - all dhammas are soulless'. 
      With regard to <I>anicca</I> and <I>dukkha</I> the Buddha said 
      <I>'sankhara</I> - conditioned things'. With regard to <I>anatta,</I> the 
      Buddha employed the term <I>dhamma</I> to include supramundane 
      unconditioned Nibbana as well. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">It may be mentioned that it was 
      after hearing the 'Anattalakkhana Sutta', the discourse on soullessness, 
      that the first five monks attained Arahatship. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The aspirant does not usually 
      meditate on all these three characteristics. Of them, he takes only that 
      which appeals to him most. Deliverance, gained by meditating on one of 
      them, is named accordingly. </FONT></P>

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The first is 
      <I>patimokkhasamvarasila.</I> 'That which saves one who observes it from 
      woeful states' is the commentarial explanation of <I>'patimokkha'.</I> 
      <I>Pa</I> is also explained as the Buddhas Teaching. <I>Atipamokkha</I> 
      means extremely important. <I>Patimokkha</I> therefore means "Fundamental 
      Teaching" or "Fundamental Precepts". It deals with 220* disciplinary rules 
      which every Bhikkhu is expected to observe. As it restrains one from evil 
      deeds, etc., it is termed <I>'samvara'.</I> Sila is used in the sense of 
      'composure' <I>(samadhana) </I>and 'support' <I>(upadharana).</I> It is so 
      called because it tends to discipline thoughts, words, and deeds, and 
      because it acts as a support for other virtues. <I>Indrivasamvarasila</I> 
      the second <I>sila,</I> deals with the control of the six senses. 
      <I>Ajivaparisuddhisila,</I> the third <I>sila,</I> deals with the right 
      livelihood of a Bhikkhu. In obtaining the necessaries of life, a Bhikkhu 
      should not act in an unbecoming way. <I>Paccayasannissitasila</I> the 
      fourth <I>sila,</I> is concerned with the unselfish use of the four

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">37. <B>Cittavisuddhi</B> - is 
      the second 'Purity. It is the purity of mind, gained by developing the 
      <I>jhanas,</I> temporarily inhibiting the Hindrances. A purified mind is 
      like a polished mirror where everything is reflected in its true 
      perspective. With a purified mind one can see things as they truly are. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">38. <B>Ditthivisuddhi</B> - is 
      the third 'Purity'. It is so called because it purifies one from the false 
      theory of a permanent soul. This correct comprehension results from 
      investigating mind and matter as regards their salient characteristics 
      <I>(lakkhana),</I> function or essential properties <I>(rasa),</I> the way 
      of manifestation <I>(paccupatthana),</I> and their immediate cause 
      <I>(padatthana). </FONT></P></I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">39. 
      <B>Kankhavitaranavisuddhi</B> - is the fourth 'Purity' which attempts to 
      transcend skeptical doubts as regards cause and effect, the past, the 
      present, and the future. This is called a purity because it removes the 
      stain of erroneous views of 'chance', causelessness', etc.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">To achieve this purity one 
      meditates on the various causes that tend to produce present mind and 
      matter, and on the causes that sustain them in the present. He understands 
      that present mind and matter at conception were conditioned by past 
      ignorance, craving, grasping and Kamma, and, during lifetime, matter is 
      conditioned by kamma, mind, seasonal phenomena, and edible food, while 
      mind is sustained by the senses and their corresponding objects. Thus he 
      realizes the second noble truth of the cause of suffering and rids himself 
      of doubts. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">40. 
      <B>Maggamaggañanadassanavisuddhi</B> - This is the fifth 'Purity'. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The aspirant ho has cleared his 
      doubts, meditates again with better understanding on the three 
      characteristics of <I>anicca, dukkha,</I> and <I>anatta.</I> He realizes 
      that life is a mere flowing, a continuous undivided movement. He finds no 
      genuine happiness, for every form of pleasure is only a prelude to pain. 
      What is transient is painful, and where change and sorrow prevail there 
      cannot be a permanent ego or soul. The arising and passing away of 
      conditioned things become very conspicuous to him. As he is thus absorbed 
      in meditation he witnesses an aura <I>(obhaso)</I> emanating from his body 
      as a result of his keen insight. He experiences also an unprecedented joy 
      <I>(piti), </I>happiness <I>(sukha),</I> and quietude <I>(passaddhi).</I> 
      He becomes strenuous <I>(paggaho) </I>and even-minded <I>(upekkha).</I> 
      His religious fervour increases <I>(adhimokkha),</I> mindfulness <I>(sati) 
      </I>strengthens, and wisdom <I>(ñana)</I> ripens. Laboring under the 
      misconception that he has attained Sainthood, chiefly owing to the 
      presence of the aura, he yearns <I>(nikanti)</I> for this state of mind. 
      Soon he realizes that these temptations are only impediments 
      <I>(upakkilesa) </I>to Insight, and that he has not really attained 
      Sainthood. Accordingly he endeavours to distinguish between the right and 
      wrong path <I>(maggamaggañanadassana).</I> It is called a 'purity because 
      it clears up the misconception as regards the actual 'path'. He 
      understands, 'This is the right path, that is the wrong path'. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">41. 
      <B>Patipadañanadassanavisuddhi</B> - is the sixth 'Purity'. This term is 
      collectively applied to the nine kinds of Insight beginning with the 
      knowledge as regards the arising and passing away of conditioned things, 
      and ending with the knowledge of adaptation that occurs in the Path 
      thought-moment immediately preceding the <I>gotrabhu</I> moment. (See

      <I>sankharupekkha-ñana</I> and <I>anuloma-ñana</I> of the ten kinds of 
      Insight. It is so called because it leads to the Path emerging from woeful 
      states and signs of conditioned things. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">45. <B>Gotrabhu</B> - lit, 
      means 'overcoming the worldly lineage'. The object of this thought-moment 
      is Nibbana, but the actual realization of Nibbana by the eradication of 
      passions occurs at the Path thought-moment that immediately follows. This 
      particular thought-moment in the three higher stages of Sainthood is 
      termed <I>'vodana'</I> (pure) as the aspirant is already an Ariya. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">46. Immediately after the 
      <I>gotrabhu</I> thought-moment there arises the Path thought-moment of the 
      Sotapanna. It is at this stage that one comprehends the Truth of 
      Suffering, eradicates craving, the cause of suffering, and actually 
      realizes Nibbana for the first time in his life. The eight factors that 
      constitute the Noble Path are also fully developed at this stage. This 
      particular thought-moment is termed <I>'sotapatti-magga'.</I> <I>Sota</I> 
      here means the stream that leads to Nibbana. It is the Noble Eightfold 
      Path. <I>Apatti</I> means 'entering for the first time'. It is called 
      <I>'magga'</I> because it arises, destroying the passions. This Path 
      thought-moment arises only once in the course of one's lifetime, and is 
      immediately followed by two or three 'Fruit' <I>(phala)</I> moments before 
      the stream of consciousness lapses into <I>bhavanga.</I> This is the 
      reason why the Dhamma is called <I>'akalika'</I> (immediately effective). 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">47. <B>Paccavekkhanañanani</B> 
      - As a rule after each of the four stages of Sainthood one reflects on the 
      Path and Fruit one has attained, on the Nibbana one has realized, on the 
      defilements one has destroyed, and in the case of the first three stages, 
      on the defilements one has yet to destroy. An Arahat who has no more 
      defilements to destroy knows that he is delivered. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">There are altogether 19 kinds 
      of such reflective knowledge, 15 pertaining to the first three stages of 
      Sainthood, and 4 to the last stage. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The Pali phrase - <I>n'aparam 
      itthatthaya</I> - No more of this state again - refers to this process of 
      reflection. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">48. <B>Nanadassanavisuddhi</B> 
      is the name given to the contemplative knowledge, a mental state of wisdom 
      found in the Path-Consciousness. It is called a 'purity', because it is 
      completely free from all stains or defilements, resulting from the

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">When the <I>jhanas</I> are 
      developed, the mind is so purified, that it resembles a polished mirror, 
      where everything is clearly reflected in true perspective. Still, there is 
      not complete freedom from unwholesome thoughts, for, by concentration, the 
      evil tendencies are only temporarily inhibited. They may rise to the 
      surface at quite unexpected moments. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Discipline regulates words and

      eradicate wholly the defilements inhibited by <I>samadhi</I>. </FONT></P>

      'Purity of Vision' <I>(ditthi visuddhi)</I> (the third member of the Path 
      of Purity) in order to see things as they truly are. With a one-pointed 
      mind he analyses and examines this so-called being. This searching 
      examination shows that what he has called 'I', is merely a complex 
      compound of mind and matter which are in a state of constant flux. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Having thus gained a correct 
      view of the real nature of this so-called being, freed from the false 
      notion of a permanent soul, he searches for the causes of this 'I' 
      personality. He realizes that there is nothing in the world which is not 
      conditioned by some cause or causes, past or present, and that his present 
      existence is due to past ignorance <I>(avijja),</I> craving 
      <I>(tanha),</I> attachment <I>(upadana),</I> Kamma, and physical food of 
      the present life. On account of these five causes this so-called being has 
      arisen, and as past causes have conditioned the present, so the present 
      will condition the future. Meditating thus, he transcends all doubts with 
      regard to past, present and future (<I>kankhavitaranavisuddhi,</I> the 
      fourth member of the Path of Purity). </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Thereupon he contemplates the 
      truth that all conditioned things are transient <I>(anicca), </I>subject 
      to suffering <I>(dukkha),</I> and devoid of an immortal soul 
      <I>(anatta).</I> Wherever he turns his eyes he sees naught but these three 
      characteristics standing out in bold relief. He realizes that life is a 
      flux conditioned by internal and external causes. Nowhere does he find any 
      genuine happiness for everything is fleeting. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">As he thus contemplates the 
      real nature of life, and is absorbed in meditation a day comes, when, to 
      his surprise, he witnesses an aura <I>(obhasa)</I> emitted by his body. He 
      experiences an unprecedented pleasure happiness and quietude. He becomes 
      even-minded, his religious fervour increases, mindfulness becomes clear 
      and insight keen. Mistaking this advanced state of moral progress for 
      Sainthood, chiefly owing to the presence of the aura, he develops a liking 
      for this mental state. Soon the realization comes that these new 
      developments are impediments to moral progress and he cultivates the 
      purity of knowledge with regard to the Path and Non-Path 
      (<I>maggamaggañanadassanavisuddhi,</I> the fifth member of the Path of 
      Purity).</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Perceiving the right path, he 
      resumes his meditation on the arising <I>(udaya ñana)</I> and passing away 
      <I>(vaya ñana)</I> of all conditioned things. Of these two states the 
      latter becomes more impressed on his mind since change is more conspicuous 
      than becoming. Therefore he directs his attention to contemplation of the 
      dissolution of things <I>(bhanga ñana).</I> He perceives that both mind 
      and matter which constitute this so-called being are in a state of 
      constant flux, not remaining the same for two consecutive moments. To him 
      then comes the knowledge that all dissolving things are fearful <I>(bhaya 
      ñana).</I> The whole world appears to him like a pit of burning embers, a 
      source of danger. Subsequently he reflects on the wretchedness and vanity 
      <I>(adinava ñana) </I>of the fearful and deluded world, and develops a 
      feeling of disgust <I>(nibbida ñana),</I> followed by a strong will for 
      deliverance from it <I>(muñcitukamyata ñana). </FONT></P></I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">With this object in view, he 
      resumes his meditation on the three characteristics of transiency, sorrow, 
      and soullessness <I>(patisankha ñana),</I> and thereafter develops

      attachment nor aversion for any worldly object <I>(upekkha

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">When the spiritual pilgrim

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">On attaining this first stage

      that bind him to existence, namely: </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">1. <B>Sakkaya-ditthi</B> - 
      <I>sati + kaye + ditthi,</I> literally, view when a group exists. Here 
      <I>kaya</I> refers to the five Aggregates of matter, feeling, perception, 
      mental states, and consciousness, or, in other words, to the 
      complex-compound of mind and matter. The view that there is one unchanging 
      entity, a permanent soul, when there is a complex-compound of psycho 
      physical aggregates is termed <I>sakkaya-ditthi.</I> Dhammasangani 
      enumerates twenty kinds of such soul theories (see Dhammasangani 
      Translation, pp. 257-259). <I>Sakkaya-ditthi</I> is usually rendered by 
      self-illusion, theory of individuality, illusion of individualism. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">2. <B>Vicikiccha</B> - Doubts. 
      They are doubts about 1. the Buddha, 2. the Dhamma, 3. the Sangha, 4. the

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">3. <B>Silabbataparamasa</B> - 
      Adherence to (wrongful) rites and ceremonies. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Dhammasangani explains it thus: 
      "It is the theory held by ascetics an Brahmins outside this doctrine, that 
      purification is obtained by rules of moral conduct, or by rites, or by 
      both rules of moral conduct and rites". </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">For the eradication of the 
      remaining seven Fetters a Sotapanna is reborn seven times at most. He 
      gains implicit confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. He 
      would not for any reason violate any of the five precepts. He is not 
      subject to states of woe as he is destined for Enlightenment. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">With fresh courage as a result 
      of this distant glimpse of Nibbana, the noble pilgrim makes rapid 
      progress, and perfecting his Insight, becomes a Sakadagami - Once-Returner 
      - reaching the second stage of Sainthood by attenuating two other Fetters, 
      namely, sense-desires <I>(kamaraga)</I> and ill will <I>(patigha).</I> 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Now he is called a 
      Once-Returner because he is born in the human realm only once, should he 
      not attain Arahatship in that birth itself. It is interesting to note that 
      the Ariya Saint who has attained the second stage of Sainthood can only 
      weaken these two powerful Fetters with which he is bound from a 
      beginningless past. At times, though to a slight extent, he harbours 
      thoughts of lust and anger. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">It is by attaining the third 
      State of Sainthood, that of the Anagami (Never-Returner), that he 
      completely eradicates these two Fetters. Thereafter he neither returns to 
      this world nor is he born in the celestial realms, since he has rooted out 
      the desire for sensual gratification. After death he is reborn in the Pure 
      Abodes (Suddhavasa), an environment exclusively reserved for Anagamis and 
      Arahats. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">A layman may become an Anagami, 
      provided he leads a celibate life. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The Anagami Saint now makes his 
      final advance and destroying the remaining five Fetters, namely, 
      attachment to Realms of Form <I>(ruparaga)</I> attachment to Formless 
      Realms <I>(aruparaga),</I> pride <I>(mana), </I>restlessness 
      <I>(uddhacca), </I>and ignorance <I>(avijja), </I>attains Arahatship the 
      final state of Sainthood. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Stream-Winners, Once-Returners, 
      Never-Returners are called Sekhas because they have yet to undergo 
      training. Arahats are called Asekhas because they no longer need any 
      training. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">An Arahat, literally, a Worthy 
      One, is not subject to rebirth because he does not accomplish fresh Karmic 
      activities, the seeds of his reproduction in matter have all been 
      destroyed. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The Arahat realizes that what 
      was to be accomplished has been done. A heavy burden of sorrow has finally 
      been relinquished, and all forms of craving and all shades of ignorance 
      are totally annihilated. The happy pilgrim now stands on heights more than 
      celestial, far removed from uncontrolled passions and the defilements of 
      the world. </FONT></P>

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">56. <B>Nirodhasamapatti</B> - 
      Lit., 'attainment to cessation'. It is so called because during this 
      period the stream of consciousness temporarily ceases to flow. Mind is 
      suspended, but vitality persists. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">It is only an Anagami or an 
      Arahat who has developed the <I>rupa</I> and <I>arupa</I> <I>jhanas</I> 
      who can attain to this supreme state of ecstasy. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">When such a person wishes to 
      attain to <I>nirodhasamapatti,</I> he first attains to the first 
      <I>jhana</I> and, emerging from it, he meditates on the transiency, 
      sorrowfulness, and soullessness of conditioned states found in that 
      particular <I>jhana.</I> Likewise, he attains, in order, to the remaining 
      <I>jhanas</I> and meditates in the same way until the <I>arupaj jhana</I> 
      of 'Nothingness'.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Emerging from this 
      <I>jhana,</I> he makes the following four resolutions: </FONT></P>
      <DIR>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">(i) that his fourfold 
      requisites be not destroyed, </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">(ii) that he should arise in 
      time when his services are needed by the Sangha, </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">(iii) that he should arise in 
      time when he is summoned by the Buddha, </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">(iv) whether he will live for 
      more than seven days from that moment. </FONT></P></DIR>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">He has to think of his 
      age-limit as this ecstatic state normally extends to seven days. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">After making these resolutions, 
      he attains to the last <I>arupaj jhana</I> of 'Neither Perception nor 
      Non-Perception', and remains in that state for two <I>javana</I> thought 
      moments. Immediately after, he attains to <I>nirodha-samapatti</I> when 
      his stream of consciousness, is temporarily suspended. After seven days he 
      emerges from this state and experiences for a single moment an Anagami 
      Phala consciousness in the case of an Anagami, or an Arahat Phala 
      consciousness in the case of an Arahat. Thereafter arises the <I>bhavanga 
      citta. </FONT></P></I>
