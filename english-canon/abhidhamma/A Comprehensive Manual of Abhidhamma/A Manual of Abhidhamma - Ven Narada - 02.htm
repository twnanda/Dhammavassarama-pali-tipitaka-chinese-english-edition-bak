      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Introduction</FONT></P></B>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">In the 89 types of 
      consciousness, enumerated in the first chapter, 52 mental states arise in 
      varying degree. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">There are 7 concomitants common 
      to every consciousness. There are 6 others that may or may not arise in 
      each and every consciousness. They are termed <I>Pakinnaka</I> 
      (Particulars). </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">All these 13 are designated 
      <I>aññasamana,</I> a rather peculiar technical term. <I>Añña</I> means 
      'other', <I>samana</I> means 'common'. <I>Sobhanas,</I> (Good), when 
      compared with <I>asobhanas</I> (Evil,) are called <I>añña</I> - 'other', 
      being of the opposite category. So are the <I>asobhanas</I> in 
      contradistinction to <I>Sobhanas</I>. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">These 13 become moral or 
      immoral according to the type of consciousness in which they occur. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">14 concomitants are variably 
      found in every type of immoral consciousness. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">19 are common to all types of 
      moral consciousness. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">6 other moral concomitants 
      occur as occasion arises. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Thus these fifty-two (7 + 6 + 
      14 + 19 + 6 = 52) are found in the respective types of consciousness in 
      different proportions. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">In this chapter all the 52 
      mental states are enumerated and classified. Every type of consciousness 
      is microscopically analyzed, and the accompanying mental states are given 
      in detail. The type of consciousness in which each mental state occurs, is 
      also described. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">To an impatient lay reader this 
      chapter will appear rather dry and uninteresting. To a critical and 
      intelligent reader it will, on the contrary, serve as an intellectual 
      treat. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">At the outset, for instance, a 
      student of chemistry may find the numerous chemical formulas somewhat 
      perplexing. But he finds the subject interesting and edifying, when he 
      seriously attempts to analyze and examine the various substances with 
      different tests. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">In like manner a student of 
      Abhidhamma who reads this chapter should first try to analyze and examine 
      care fully every type of consciousness and see for himself the mental 
      states thereof according to his own reasoning. Later, he should compare 
      his results with the original text. He will then find this chapter most 
      illuminating, and instead of wasting time in memorizing numbers, he will 
      intelligently grasp the meaning of the text. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">For example, let us analyze the 
      first immoral type of consciousness, rooted in attachment. </FONT></P><I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Somanassa-sahagata -</I> 
      Accompanied by pleasure,</FONT></P><I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Ditthigata-sampayutta -</I> 
      Connected with misbelief,</FONT></P><I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Asankharika -</I> Unprompted. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">This consciousness, when 
      analyzed, will show that the <I>vedana</I> or feeling is pleasure'. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The 7 Universals and all the 
      Particulars are found in it.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The 4 Immoral mental states 
      common to all immorals such as <I>moha</I> (delusion), <I>ahirika</I> 
      (shamelessness), <I>anottappa,</I> (fearlessness), and <I>uddhacca</I> 
      (restlessness) must arise in it. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">What about the remaining ten? 
      </FONT></P><I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Lobha</I> - attachment must 
      arise. </FONT></P><I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Ditthi</I> - misbelief must 
      arise. </FONT></P><I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Mana</I> - conceit cannot 
      arise. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Conceit does not arise in 
      <I>lobha</I> consciousness, together with misbelief. <I>Ditthi</I> is 
      connected with wrong view, while <I>mana</I> is concerned with egoism. 
      Both of them, say the commentators, are like two lions that cannot live 
      together in one cave. </FONT></P><I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Dosa</I> (hatred), <I>issa</I> 
      (envy), <I>macchariya</I> (avarice), and <I>kukkucca</I> (brooding) cannot 
      arise, because these four are akin to aversion. They are found only in 
      hateful consciousness.</FONT></P><I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Thina</I> and <I>middha</I> - 
      (sloth and torpor) do not arise because this is an unprompted 
      consciousness. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">No <I>sobhanas</I> - 
      (beautiful) occur in an immoral consciousness. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Total - 7 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 19. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Thus, on analysis, we see that 
      the first immoral consciousness consists of 19 mental states. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The other types of 
      consciousness should be similarly analyzed. </FONT></P>

      from its concomitants. Both consciousness and its respective co-adjuncts 
      arise and perish simultaneously. But there are some material qualities 
      such as <I>viññatti rupa*</I> (Modes of Intimation) - that arise and 
      perish simultaneously with the consciousness. To exclude them the third 
      property of having a common object has been attributed. That which

      <I>phas,</I> to contact.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">For any sense-impression to 
      occur, three things are essential - namely, consciousness, respective 
      sense and the object. For instance, one sees an object with the 
      consciousness through the eye as its instrument. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">When an object presents itself 
      to the consciousness through one of the six senses there arises the mental 
      state-contact. "It should not be understood that mere collision is 
      contact<I> (Na sangatimatto eva Phasso). </FONT></P></I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Like a pillar which acts as a 
      strong support to the rest of the structure, even so is contact to the 
      coexistent mental concomitants. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">"Contact means 'it touches' 
      <I>(phusati'ti).</I> It has touching <I>(phusana)</I> as its salient 
      characteristic <I>(lakkhana), </I>impact <I>(sanghattana)</I> as its 
      function <I>(rasa), </I>coinciding (of the physical basis, object and 
      consciousness) as its manifestation <I>(sannipata paccupatthana),</I> and 
      the object which has entered the avenue (of awareness) as proximate cause 
      <I>(padatthana)."</I> </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Contact is mentioned first 
      because it precedes all other mental states. "Touching by contact, 
      consciousness experiences by feeling, perceives by perception, wills by 
      volition - <I>(Phassena phusitva, vedanaya vediyati, saññaya sañjanati, 
      cetanaya ceteti)".</I> According to <I>Paticca-Samuppada,</I> too, Contact 
      conditions Feeling. But strictly speaking, there is no reason for the 
      sequence because all these mental states are coexistent. The Atthasalini 
      states - "For of states, arisen in one conscious moment, it is not valid 
      to say that 'this' arises first, 'that' afterwards. The reason is not 
      because contact is a strong support. Contact is just mentioned first in 
      the order of teaching, but it was also permissible to bring it in thus: - 
      There are feeling and contact, perception and contact, volition and 
      contact; there are consciousness and contact, feeling, perception, 
      volition, initial application of mind. In the order of teaching, however, 
      contact is mentioned first. Nor is the sequence of words among the 
      remaining states of any special significance." </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">"Contact is given priority of 
      place, as standing for the inception of the thought, and as the sine qua 
      non of all the allied states, conditioning them much as the roof-tree of a 
      storeyed house supports all the other combinations of material." -- (Mrs. 
      Rhys Davids - Buddhist Psychology, p. 6.) </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">3. <B>Vedana</B> - Derived from 
      <I>vid,</I> to experience. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Feeling is a more appropriate 
      rendering for <I>vedana</I> than sensation. Like contact, feeling is an 
      essential property of every consciousness. It may be pleasurable painful, 
      or neutral. Pain and pleasure pertain to body as well. But physical 
      feeling is not of ethical importance. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">According to the commentators 
      feeling is like a master who enjoys a dish prepared by a cook. The latter 
      is compared to the remaining mental states that constitute a 
      thought-complex. Strictly speaking, it is feeling that experiences an 
      object when it comes in contact with the senses. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">It is this feeling that 
      experiences the desirable or undesirable fruits of an action done in this 
      or in a previous birth. Besides this mental state there is no soul or any 
      other agent to experience the result of the action. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">It should be understood here 
      that Nibbanic bliss is not connected with feeling. Nibbanic bliss is 
      certainly the highest happiness <I>(sukha),</I> but it is the happiness of 
      relief from suffering. It is not the enjoyment of a pleasurable object.

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The meaning of this term widely 
      varies according to the context. To avoid unnecessary confusion, it is 
      best to understand the specific meaning used in the particular connection 
      as a universal mental state. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The chief characteristic of 
      <I>sañña</I> is the cognition of an object by way of a mark as blue etc. 
      It is <I>sañña</I> that enables one to recognize an object that has once 
      been perceived by the mind through the senses. "Its procedure is likened 
      to the carpenter's recognition of certain kinds of wood by the mark he had 
      made on each; to the treasurer's specifying certain articles of jewelry by 
      the ticket on each; to the wild animal's discernment in the scarecrow of 
      the work of man." </FONT></P><I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Sañña,</I> therefore, means 
      simple sense perception.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">"Perception," according to a 
      modern Dictionary of Philosophy, "is the apprehension of ordinary 
      sense-objects, such as trees, houses, chairs, etc., on the occasion of 
      sensory stimulation." </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Perception is not used here in 
      the sense employed by early modern philosophers such as Bacon, Descartes, 
      Spinoza, and Leibniz. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">As one of the five 
      <I>khandhas</I> (Aggregates) <I>sañña</I> is used in the sense of 
      perception. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Could it be that memory is due

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Sañña, viññana</I> and 
      <I>pañña</I> should be differentiated from one another. <I>Sañña</I> is 
      like the mere perception of a rupee coin by a child. By its whiteness, 
      roundness and size it merely recognizes the coin as a rupee, utterly 
      ignorant of its monetary value. A man, for instance, discerns its value 
      and its utility, but is not aware of its chemical composition. 
      <I>Viññana</I> is comparable to the ordinary man's knowledge of the rupee. 
      <I>Pañña</I> is like the analytical knowledge of a chemist who knows all

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">In the case of <I>citta</I> - 
      mind or consciousness - the root assumes the meaning of discernment

      co-ordination <I>(abhisandhana) </I>and accumulation 
      <I>(ayuhana).</FONT></P></I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">According to the Atthasalini 
      and Vibhavini Tika <I>cetana</I> is that which co-ordinates the mental 
      states associated with itself on the object of consciousness. <I>(Attana 
      sampayutta-dhamme arammane abhisandahati). </I>Like a chief disciple, or 
      like a carpenter who fulfills his duties and regulates the work of others

      function of other concomitants associated with itself.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">A further explanation has been

      cetana).</I> <I>Cetana</I> is that which plays a predominant part in all 
      actions, moral and immoral.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Shwe Zan Aung says that 
      according to Ledi Sayadaw, the Burmese Abhidhamma scholar, "Cetana acts on 
      its concomitants, acts in getting the object, and acts on accomplishing 
      the task, i.e., determines action." (Compendium, p. 236).</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The most significant mental 
      state in the Mundane Consciousness <I>(lokiya)</I> is this <I>cetana,</I> 
      while in the Supra mundane it is <I>pañña,</I> wisdom or insight. Mundane 
      thoughts tend to accumulate Kamma. Supra mundane thoughts, on the 
      contrary, tend to eradicate Kamma. Hence <I>cetana</I> in the supra 
      mundane consciousness does not constitute Kamma. <I>Cetana</I> in every 
      moral and immoral type of mundane consciousness, on the other hand, is 
      regarded as Kamma. Although <I>Cetana</I> is found in <I>Vipaka</I> types 
      of consciousness too, it is of no moral significance as it lacks 
      accumulative power. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">It is this <I>cetana</I> that

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">From a psychological standpoint

      <I>ottappa,</I> as analyzed by Buddhaghosa present points of considerable 
      ethical interest. Taken together they give us the emotional and conative 
      aspect of the modern notion of conscience, just as <I>sati</I> represents 
      its intellectual side. The former term 'is equivalent to shame 
      <I>(lajja),' </I>the latter to 'anguish <I>(ubbego) </I>over evildoing.' 
      <I>Hiri</I> has its source within; <I>ottappa</I> spring from without. 
      <I>Hiri</I> is autonomous <I>(attadhipati); ottappa,</I> heteronomous, 
      influenced by society <I>(lokadhipati). </I>The former is established on 
      shame; the latter on dread. The former is marked by consistency; the 
      latter by discernment of the danger and fearsomeness of error. The 
      subjective source of <I>hiri</I> is fourfold, viz., the idea of what is 
      due to one's birth, age, worth, and education. Thus, one having 
      <I>hiri</I> will think 'Only mean folk (fishers etc.) children, poor 
      wretches, the blind and ignorant, would do such an act,' and refrains. The 
      external source of <I>ottappa</I> is, the idea that 'the body of the 
      faithful will blame you,' and hence one refrains. If a man has 
      <I>hiri,</I> he is, as said the Buddha, his own best master. To one who is 
      sensitive by way of <I>ottappa,</I> the masters of the faith are the best 
      guides."</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">In a supplementary paragraph 
      the 'marks' (consistency etc.) are thus explained: 'In <I>hiri</I> one 
      reflects on the worth of one's birth, one's teacher, one's estate, and 
      one's fellow students. In <I>ottappa</I> one feels dread at self-reproach,

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">"Alobha </I>is the cause of

      Through <I>amoha</I> what is unperverted is taken, for the deluded take

      such and admits it, but the greedy conceal it. Through <I>adosa</I> one 
      regards a manifest virtue as such and admits it, but the hateful efface

      from association with the unbeloved since disagreeableness is the 
      intrinsic nature of the hateful as well as the inability to bear the 
      association with the unbeloved. Through <I>amoha</I> there arises no

      beings are born in woeful states resembling hatred. <I>Adosa</I> is the

      being not burnt by the fire of anger which causes wrinkles and grey hair.

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">49. </B>The following 
      illuminating note by Mrs. Rhys Davids on these four virtues is well worth 
      reading. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">"On these four great exercises, 
      see Rhys Davids, S. B. E. xi 201, n.; and on their emancipating efficacy, 
      M. i. 38. Buddhaghosa again refers to the reader to his Visuddhi Magga for 
      a more detailed commentary (vide chap. ix, and cf. Hardy, 'Eastern 
      Monachism', p . 243 et seq. )... The object of thought <I>(arammana)</I> 
      in this connection will be 'limited' if the student dwells in love etc., 
      on but a restricted number of beings; 'infinite' if his heart embraces 
      vast numbers.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">'The commentator has not a 
      little to say in the present work, however, on the nature and mutual 
      relations of the 'Abodes' (pp. 193-195). First, the characteristics of 
      each are fully set forth, together with their false manifestation 
      <I>(vipatti). </I>Clinging <I>(sinehasambhavo)</I> is the <I>vipatti</I> 
      of love, the essential mark of which is the carrying on of beneficent 
      conduct etc. Tears and the like are less truly characteristic of pity 
      <I>(karuna)</I> than is the bearing and relieving the woes of others. 
      Laughter and the like are less genuine expressions of sympathy <I>(mudita) 
      </I>than is appreciation of what others have achieved. And there is a 
      condition of disinterestedness <I>(upekkha)</I> which is prompted by 
      ignorance, and not by that insight into the karma of mankind which can 
      avail to calm the passions.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">"He next designates the four 
      antisocial attitudes which are to be extirpated by these ethical 
      disciplines taken in order - ill-will <I>(vyapada),</I> cruelty 
      <I>(vihesa),</I> aversion <I>(arati), </I>and passion <I>(raga) </I>- and 
      shows how each virtue has also a second vice opposed to it. This he terms 
      its near enemy, as being less directly assailed by it than its ethical 
      opposite, the latter resembling an enemy who has to lurk afar in the 
      jungle and the hills. Love and vengeful conduct cannot coexist. To prevail 
      in this respect, let love be developed fearlessly. But where love and its 
      object have too much in common, love is threatened by lust. On this side 
      let love be guarded well. Again the near enemy to pity, more insidious 
      than cruelty, is the self-pity pining for what one has not got or has lost 
      - a low, profane melancholy. And the corresponding worldly happiness in 
      what one has, or in consequence of obliviousness as to what one has lost, 
      lies in wait to stifle appreciation of the good fortune of others. Lastly, 
      there is the unintelligent indifference of the worldling who has not 
      triumphed over limitations nor mastered cause and effect, being unable to 
      transcend external things. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">"The remainder of his remarks 
      are occupied with the necessary sequence in the four Abodes, and the 
      importance of observing method in their cultivation, and finally with 
      their other technical appellation of <I>appamañña</I> or infinitudes. In 
      this connection he repeats the touching illustration given in Hardy (op. 
      Cit., 249) of the mother, and the four children. Her desire for the growth 
      of the infant is as <I>metta;</I> for the recovery of the sick child as 
      <I>karuna;</I> for the maintenance of the gifts displayed by the youth as 
      <I>mudita;</I> while her care not to hinder the career of her grown-up son 
      is as <I>upekkha.</I> </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">"It may be remarked, by the 
      way, that when Hardy with a foreigner's want of <I>mudita</I> calumniates 
      the Buddhist mendicant (p. 250) as one who thinks about the virtues of 
      solidarity without practicing them, he quite forgets that these exercises 
      are but preparations of the will for that ministering to the intellectual 
      need of others to which the recluse's life was largely devoted, and the 
      importance of which the Western, in his zeal for material forms of 
      charity, does not even now appreciate at its real value. And Buddhism did 
      not believe in giving the rein to good impulses unregulated by 
      intellectual control". -- (Buddhist Psychology, pp- 65-37).</FONT></P><B>

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Pa</I> = rightly; <I>ña,</I> to

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Its chief characteristic is

      a controlling faculty <I>(indriya). </FONT></P></I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">In Abhidhamma <I>ñana, 
      pañña,</I> and <I>amoha</I> are used as interchangeable terms. In types of 
      consciousness connected with knowledge <I>(ñana-sampayutta)</I> the 
      reference is to this <I>pañña.</I> By <I>amoha,</I> one of the three moral 
      roots, is also meant this <I>pañña</I>. As one of the four means of 
      accomplishing one's ends <I>(iddhi-pada)</I> it assumes the name of 
      <I>vimamsa</I> (lit., examination). When purified by <I>samadhi,</I> 
      <I>pañña</I> assumes the honorable role of <I>abhiñña</I> (higher 
      knowledge). Highly developed <I>pañña</I> is elevated to the state of a 
      <I>bojjhanga-dhamma-vicaya</I> (Investigation of the Truth) and 
      <I>magganga-samma ditthi,</I> Right View. The culmination of <I>pañña</I> 
      is the Omniscience of a Buddha. </FONT></P><I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Pañña,</I> in the strictest 
      sense of the term, is seeing things as they truly are, i.e., in the light 
      of <I>anicca</I> (impermanence), <I>dukkha</I> (sorrow), and <I>anatta</I> 
      (soullessness). </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Reason, intellect, insight, 
      knowledge, wisdom, intelligence - all convey some aspects of <I>pañña,</I> 
      but none of them exactly corresponds to the Pali term. Both knowledge and 
      wisdom are employed here according to the context. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Mrs. Rhys David's comment on 
      this important term is interesting. She writes:- </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">"To fit the term <I>pañña</I> 
      with its approximate European equivalent is one of the cruxes of Buddhist 
      philosophy. I have tried in turn reason, intellect, insight, science, 
      understanding and knowledge. All of these have been, and are, used in the 
      literature of philosophy with varying shades of connotation, according as 
      the sense to be conveyed is popular and vague, psychological and precise 
      or transcendental and - <I>passez-moi le mot</I> - having precise 
      vagueness.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">And each of them might, with 
      one implication or another, represent <I>pañña</I>. The main difficulty in 
      choice lay in determining whether, to the Buddhist, <I>pañña </I>stood for 
      mental function, or for the aggregate product of certain mental 
      functioning, or for both. When all the allusions to <I>pañña </I>in the 
      Sutta Pitaka have been collated, a final translation becomes possible. 
      Here it must suffice to quote two. M i. 292, he who has <I>pañña (paññava) 
      </I>is declared in virtue thereof to understand <I>(pajanati)</I> the 
      nature of the phenomenon of pain or ill (the Four Noble Truths). In D. i. 
      124 Gotama asks: what is this <I>pañña</I>? and himself sets out its 
      content as consisting in certain intellectual attainments, viz., the 
      Jhanas, insight into the nature of impermanence, the mental image of one's 
      self, the power of <I>iddhi,</I> the cosmic Ear, insight into other minds, 
      into one's own past lives, the cosmic Eye, and the elimination of all 
      vitiating tendencies. Buddhaghosa also (Visuddhi Magga Ch. XIV,) 
      distinguishes <I>pañña</I> from <I>sañña</I> and <I>viññana.</I> He 
      describes it as adequate to discern not only what these can, viz., 
      sense-objects and the Three Marks (impermanence, pain and 
      non-substantiality) respectively, but also the path. For him, then, it 
      might be called intellect 'at a higher power'. And in Gotama's reply, all 
      those terms are described in terms of intellectual process. Nevertheless, 
      it is clear that the term did not stand for bare mental process of a 
      certain degree of complexity, but that it also implied mental process as 
      cultivated in accordance with a certain system of concepts objectively 
      valid for all Buddhist adepts. Hence I think it best to reject such terms 
      as reason, intellect, and understanding, and to choose wisdom, or science, 
      or knowledge, or philosophy. Only they must be understood in this 
      connection as implying the body of learning as assimilated and applied by 
      the intellect of a given individual". -- (Buddhist Psychology. pp. 17-18).

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Of the 52 types of mental 
      states eleven are called <I>aniyatayogi</I> - unfixed adjuncts. They arise 
      in different kinds of consciousness separately because their particular 
      objects differ. They may or may not arise in those types of consciousness 
      to which they are allied. For instance, <I>issa, macchariya,</I> and 
      <I>kukkucca</I> must arise in a consciousness connected with aversion. One 
      of the three must arise at one particular moment. All the three do not 
      occur simultaneously. Besides they are not bound to be present in such a 
      consciousness. So are the three Abstinences, two Illimitables, Conceit, 
      Sloth and Torpor. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The remaining 41 types are

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">53. Abstinences 
-</FONT></P></B>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">These three are collectively 
      found only in the Supra mundane consciousness, as they constitute three of 
      eight factors of the Noble Path. They cannot arise in the 
      <I>rupavacara</I> and <I>arupavacara,</I> nor in the <I>kamavacara 
      vipaka</I> and <I>kriya cittas.</I> They deal with three forms of 
      refraining from committing evil through word, deed, and livelihood. As 
      such they arise separately only in the eight types of moral consciousness 
      according to the abstinence from the particular evil. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">These Abstinences appear in 
      full force only in the <I>lokuttara-cittas,</I> because the corresponding 
      evils are completely eradicated by them. In the 
      <I>kamavacara-kusala-cittas</I> there is only a temporary inhibition of 
      evil.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">As 
      <I>kamavacara-vipaka-cittas</I> are merely effects they cannot arise in 
      them. Since <I>kriya-cittas</I> are experienced only by Arahats, they do 
      not arise in them. In the <I>rupavacara</I> and <I>arupavacara</I> planes 
      they do not occur because the need for moral purification, the function of 
      these abstinences, does not arise there. </FONT></P><B>

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">It should be noted that the 
      objects of these tables are beings. Therefore they cannot arise in the 
      Supra mundane consciousness which has for its object Nibbana. This does 
      not mean that Arahats and other Aryans do not possess these virtues. They

      <I>upekkha.</I> In the eight <I>kiriya cittas,</I> which the Arahats
