      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Notes - </FONT></P></B>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">3. <B>Vedana</B> is a 
      significant mental state which is common to all types of consciousness. 
      Feeling is its characteristic <I>(vedayita-lakkhana), </I>and is born of 
      contact. Sensation, therefore, is not an appropriate rendering for 
      <I>vedana. </FONT></P></I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Feeling is defined as: "a 
      conscious, subjective impression which does not involve cognition or 
      representation of an object.''</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Sensation is explained as: "the 
      content of sensuous intuition, or the way in which a conscious subject is 
      modified by the presence of an object." </FONT></P><I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Vedana</I> modifies the stream 
      of consciousness and serves both as a life-promoting and life-destroying 
      force. Pleasure, for example, promotes life; pain impairs it. As such 
      feeling plays a very important part in the life of man. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Experiencing the taste of an 
      object is the function of <I>vedana (anubhavana rasa).</I> Particular 
      likes and dislikes depend on the desirability and the undesirability of 
      the external object. Generally they are mechanistic. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Sometimes the freewill of a 
      person determines the mode of feeling independent of the nature of the 
      object. The sight of an enemy, for example, would normally be a source of 
      displeasure, but a right-understanding person would, on the contrary, 
      extend his loving-kindness towards him and experience some kind of 
      pleasure. Socrates, for instance, drank that cup of poison with joy and 
      faced a happy death. Once a certain Brahman poured a torrent of abuse on 
      the Buddha, but He kept smiling and returned love unto him. The ascetic 
      Khantivadi, who was brutally tortured by a drunkard king, wished him long 
      life instead of cursing him. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">A bigoted non-Buddhist, on the 
      other hand, may even, at the sight of a Buddha, harbour a thought of 
      hatred. His feeling will be one of displeasure. Likewise a similar feeling 
      may arise in the heart of a bigoted Buddhist at the sight of a religious 
      teacher of an alien faith. What is meat and drink to one, may be poison to 
      another. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Material pleasures, for 
      instance, would be highly prized by an average person. An understanding 
      recluse would find happiness in renouncing them and leading a life of 
      voluntary poverty in perfect solitude. Such a solitary life, a sensualist 
      may view as hell. Yes, what is heaven to one may be hell to another; what 
      is hell to one may be heaven to another. We ourselves create them, and 
      they are more or less mind-made. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">"There are, o Bhikkhus, two 
      kinds of feeling-pain and happiness", says the Buddha. Well, then, how can 
      there be a third which is neither pain nor happiness? The commentary 
      states that blameless neutral feeling is included in happiness and the 
      blameworthy in pain. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Again, the Buddha has stated 
      that whatever is felt in this world, all that is pain. It is because of 
      the changeable nature of all conditioned things. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">From another standpoint 
      considering all forms of feeling as purely mental, there are only three 
      kinds - namely, happiness <I>(sukha),</I> pain <I>(dukkha), </I>and 
      neutral <I>(adukkhamasukha). </FONT></P></I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Atthasalini explains them, as 
      follows:-</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The term <I>sukha</I> means 
      'pleasurable feeling' <I>(sukha-vedana), </I>'root of happiness' 
      <I>(sukha-mula),</I> 'pleasurable object' <I>(sukharammana),</I> 'cause of 
      happiness' <I>(sukha-hetu),</I> 'conditioning state of pleasure, 
      <I>(sukha-paccayatthana),</I> free from troubles' <I>(abyapajjha),</I> 
      'Nibbana', etc.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">In the expression: "By 
      eliminating <I>sukha</I>" - <I>sukha</I> means pleasurable feeling. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">In the expression: 
      "<I>Sukha</I> is non-attachment in this world". Here <I>sukha</I> means 
      root of pleasure. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">In the expression: "Since, o 
      Mahali, form is <I>sukha,</I> falls and descends on sukha". Here 
      <I>sukha</I> means object of pleasure. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">"Merit, o Bhikkhus, is a 
      synonym for <I>sukha</I>." Here <I>sukha</I> means cause of pleasure. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">"Not easy is it, o Bhikkhus, to 
      attain to heavenly <I>sukha</I> by description". "They know not 
      <I>sukha</I> who do not see <I>nandana</I>". Here <I>sukha</I> means 
      conditioning state of pleasure. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">"These states constitute a 
      <I>sukha</I> life in this very world". Here <I>sukha</I> means freedom 
      from troubles.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">"Nibbana is supreme 
      <I>sukha''.</I> Here <I>sukha</I> means Nibbana. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">From these quotations the 
      reader can understand in what different senses the term <I>sukha</I> is 
      used in the texts. In this particular connection the term <I>sukha</I> is 
      used in the sense of pleasurable feeling. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Nibbana is stated to be supreme 
      bliss <I>(sukha). </I>This does not mean that there is a pleasurable 
      feeling in Nibbana although the term <I>sukha</I> is used. Nibbana is a 
      bliss of relief. The release from suffering is itself Nibbanic bliss. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The term <I>dukkha</I> means 
      'painful feeling', 'basis of pain', object of pain', cause of pain', 
      'conditioning state of pain', etc. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">''By eliminating <I>dukkha</I>" 
      - here <I>dukkha</I> means painful feeling. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">"Birth too is <I>dukkha</I>" - 
      here <I>dukkha</I> means basis of pain. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">"Since, o Mahali, form is 
      <I>dukkha</I>, falls and descends on pain" - here <I>dukkha</I> means

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">"Accumulation of evil is 
      <I>dukkha</I>" - here <I>dukkha</I> means cause of pain. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">"It is not easy, o Bhikkhus, to

      means "conditioning states of pain." </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">In this particular connection 
      the term <I>dukkha</I> is used in the sense of painful feeling. 
</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">In the Dhammacakka Sutta the 
      Buddha enumerates eight divisions of <I>dukkha </I>-namely: </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">1. Birth is suffering, 2. decay 
      is suffering, 3. disease is suffering, 4. death is suffering, 5. 
      association with the unpleasant is suffering, 6. separation from the 
      beloved is suffering, 7. when one does not obtain what one desires there 
      is suffering, 8. in brief the Five Aggregates are suffering. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">All these are the causes of 
      <I>dukkha.</I> </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">When the Buddha addresses Devas 
      and men He speaks of eight kinds of <I>dukkha.</I> When He addresses only 
      men He speaks of twelve. Instead of <I>vyadhi</I> (disease) He says 
      <I>soka</I> (grief), <I>parideva</I> (lamentation), <I>dukkha</I> (pain), 
      <I>domanassa</I> (displeasure) <I>upayasa</I> (despair) are suffering. All 
      these five are included in <I>vyadhi</I> which embraces both physical and 
      mental disharmony. </FONT></P><I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Soka, domanassa,</I> and 
      <I>upayasa</I> are mental, while <I>dukkha</I> and <I>parideva</I> are 
      physical. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Practically there is no marked 
      difference between the two formulas. </FONT></P><B>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Adukkha-m-asukha</B> is that 
      which is neither pain nor happiness. It is a neutral feeling. This 
      corresponds to both stolid indifference and Stoic indifference. The Pali 
      term <I>upekkha,</I> which has a wider connotation, is more frequently 
      used to denote this kind of neutral feeling. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">In an immoral type of 
      consciousness <I>upekkha</I> assumes the role of stolid indifference 
      because it is prompted by ignorance. In an <I>ahetuka</I> resultant 
      consciousness, such as a sense-impression, <I>upekkha</I> means simple 
      neutral feeling which has no ethical value. <I>Adukkha-m-asukha</I> 
      strictly applies in this connection. <I>Upekkha</I> latent in a 
      <I>kamavacara sobhana citta</I> (Beautiful type of consciousness 
      pertaining to the Sense-sphere) may be any of the following states - 
      simple indifference (not stolid because there is no ignorance), simple 
      neutral feeling, disinterestedness, unbiased feeling, Stoic indifference, 
      and perfect equanimity. </FONT></P><I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Upekkha</I> in the <I>jhana</I>

      his introductory essay to the Compendium: -</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">"The sense of touch alone is 
      accompanied by the positive hedonic elements of pain and pleasure; the 
      other four senses are accompanied by hedonic indifference. This 
      exceptional distinction is assigned to the sense of touch, because the 
      impact between the sentient surface <I>(pasada rupa) </I>and the 
      respective objects of other senses, both sets of which are secondary 
      qualities of body, is not strong enough to produce physical pain or 
      pleasure. But in the case of touch there is contact with one or other, or 
      all the three primary qualities (locality - <I>pathavi,</I> temperature - 
      <I>tejo,</I> pressure - <I>vayo)</I> and this is strong enough to affect 
      those primary qualities in the percipient's own body. Just as cotton wool 
      on the anvil does not affect the latter, but a hammer striking cotton wool 
      imparts its check to the anvil also.'' -- (Compendium of Philosophy p. 
      14). </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">In the case of touch the impact 
      is strong. The "essentials", <I>pathavi, tejo</I> and <I>vayo</I> 
      (extension, heat, and motion) - <I>apo,</I> cohesion, is excluded being 
      intangible - forcibly and directly strike against the essentials of the 
      body. Consequently there is either pain or happiness. In the case of 
      seeing, hearing, smelling, and tasting, there is a bare impact. The 
      consequent feeling is neither pain nor happiness. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Although these 
      sense-impressions may be <I>sukha, dukkha,</I> or <I>upekkha</I> the 
      <I>javana</I> thought processes conditioned thereby may not necessarily be 
      associated with a similar feeling. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">For instance, the Buddha 
      experienced a body-consciousness associated with pain when a rock splinter 
      struck His foot, but His <I>javana</I> thought-process conditioned thereby 
      would not necessarily be associate with displeasure. Unaffected by the 
      pain, He would have experienced perfect equanimity. The immanent feeling 
      in the stream of consciousness would have been <I>upekkha.</I> Similarly 
      at the sight of the Buddha, a right-understanding person would 
      automatically experience an eye-consciousness associated with indifference 
      <I>(upekkha-sahagata cakkhu-viññana)</I> but his <I>javana</I> thought 
      would be moral. The innate feeling would be pleasure <I>(somanassa). 
      </FONT></P></I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">This intricate point should be 
      clearly understood. </FONT></P><I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Somanassa</I> (good-mindedness 
      ) and <I>domanassa</I> (bad-mindedness) are purely mental. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">These five kinds of feeling 
      could be reduced to three, the three to two, and the two to one as 
      follows:-</FONT></P>
      <DIR>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">i. <I>sukha + somanassa; 
      upekkha; dukkha + domanassa <BR></I>ii. <I>sukha ; upekkha; dukkha 
      <BR></I>iii. <I>sukha; dukkha <BR></I>iv. <I>dukkha</I> 
      <BR><I>(Upekkha</I> is merged in <I>sukha,</I> and <I>sukha</I> is 
      ultimately merged in <I>dukkha).</I> </FONT></P></DIR>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">4. <B>Sukha</B> - physical 
      happiness should be differentiated from <I>somanassa</I> - mental 
      pleasure. So should <I>dukkha</I> - physical pain - be differentiated from 
      <I>domanassa</I> - mental displeasure. There is only one consciousness 
      accompanied by <I>sukha.</I> Similarly there is only one accompanied by 
      <I>dukkha.</I> Both of them are the effects of good and bad actions 
      respectively. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">When the Buddha, for instance, 
      was injured by Devadatta Thera, He experienced a body-consciousness 
      accompanied by pain. This was the result of a past evil action of His. 
      When we sit on a comfortable seat we experience a body consciousness 
      accompanied by happiness. This is the result of a past good action. All 
      forms of physical pain and happiness are the inevitable results of our own 
      Kamma. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">5. Readers will note that 
      pleasurable types of consciousness exceed all others. As such during a 
      life-time a person experiences more happy moments than painful ones. This 
      does not contradict the statement that life is sorrow <I>(dukkha). 
      </I>Here <I>dukkha</I> is not used in the sense of painful feeling but in 
      the sense of oppression or impeding <I>(pilana). </I>A careful reading of 
      the description of <I>dukkha,</I> given in the Dhammacakka Sutta will make 
      the matter clear. </FONT></P>

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">7. There is displeasure only in 
      the two types of consciousness connected with <I>patigha</I> or aversion. 
      We experience displeasure when we get angry. </FONT></P>

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The type of consciousness one 
      experiences at the moment of conception is termed <I>patisandhi citta.</I> 
      It is so called because it links the past with the present. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">This <I>patisandhi citta,</I> 
      also termed 'rebirth-consciousness,' is conditioned by the powerful 
      thought one experiences at the dying moment, and is regarded as the source 
      of the present life-stream. In the course of one particular life there is 
      only one <I>patisandhi citta.</I> The mental contents of <I>bhavanga,</I> 
      which later arises an infinite number of times during one's lifetime, and 
      of <I>cuti,</I> which arises only once at the final moment of death, are

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">One experiences only one 
      thought-moment at any particular time. No two thought-moments coexist. 
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Each thought-moment hangs on to 
      some kind of object. No consciousness arises without an object, either 
      mental or physical. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">When a person is fast asleep 
      and is in a dreamless state he experiences a kind of consciousness which 
      is more passive than active. It is similar to the consciousness one 
      experiences at the initial moment of conception and at the final moment of 
      death. This type of consciousness is in Abhidhamma termed <I>bhavanga.</I> 
      Like any other consciousness it also consists of three aspects - genesis 
      <I>(uppada),</I> static <I>(thiti)</I> and cessation <I>(bhanga).</I> 
      Arising and perishing every moment it flows on like a stream not remaining 
      the same for two consecutive moments. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">When an object enters this 
      stream through the sense-doors, the <I>bhavanga</I> consciousness is 
      arrested and another type of consciousness appropriate to the object 
      perceived arises. Not only in a dreamless state but also in our waking 
      state we experience <I>bhavanga</I> thought-moments more than any other 
      types of consciousness. Hence <I>bhavanga</I> becomes an indispensable 
      condition of life. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Mrs. Rhys Davids and Mr. Aung 
      compare <I>bhavanga</I> to "Leibniz's state of obscure perception, not 
      amounting to consciousness, in dreamless sleep.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">One cannot agree because 
      <I>bhavanga</I> is a type of consciousness. There is no obscure perception 
      here. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Some identify <I>bhavanga</I> 
      with sub-consciousness. According to the Dictionary of Philosophy 
      sub-consciousness is ''a compartment of the mind alleged by certain 
      psychologists and philosophers to exist below the threshold of 
      consciousness." In the opinion of Western philosophers sub-consciousness 
      and consciousness coexist. According to Abhidhamma no two types of 
      consciousness coexist. Nor is <I>bhavanga</I> a sub-plane.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The Compendium further states 
      that "bhavanga denotes a functional state (or moment ) of 
      sub-consciousness. As such it is the sub-conscious state of mind - 'below 
      the threshold' of consciousness - by which we conceive continuous 
      subjective existence as possible. Thus it corresponds to F. W. Myer's 
      'subliminal consciousness'".(p.266)</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The Dictionary of Philosophy 
      explains ''subliminal (sub, under + limen, the threshold) as allegedly 
      unconscious mental processes especially sensations which lie below the 
      threshold of consciousness." Strictly speaking, it does not correspond to 
      subliminal consciousness either.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">There does not seem to be any 
      place for <I>bhavanga</I> in Western Psychology.</FONT></P><I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Bhavanga</I> is so called 
      because it is an essential condition for continued subjective existence.

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Whenever the mind does not 
      receive a fresh external object, one experiences a <I>bhavanga</I>

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">This is another important 
      technical term which should be clearly understood. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Ordinarily the term is employed 
      in the sense of swift. <I>Javanahamsa,</I> for example, means swift swan; 
      <I>javana-pañña</I> means swift understanding. In the Abhidhamma it is 
      used in a purely technical sense. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Here Javana means running. It 
      is so called because in the course of a thought-process it runs 
      consecutively for seven thought-moments or five, hanging on to an 
      identical object. The mental states occurring in all these thought moments 
      are similar, but the potential force differs.</FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">When the consciousness 
      perceives a vivid object usually seven moments of Javana arise in the 
      particular thought-process. In the case of death or when the Buddha 
      performs the Twin Psychic Phenomenon <I>(Yamaka Patihariya)</I> only five 
      thought moments arise. In the Supramundane Javana process the 
      Path-consciousness arises only for one moment. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">This javana stage is the most 
      important from a ethical standpoint. It is at this psychological stage 
      that good or evil is actually done. Irrespective of the desirability or 
      the undesirability of the object presented to the mind, one can make the 
      Javana process good or bad. If, for instance, one meets an enemy, a 
      thought of hatred will arise almost automatically. A wise and forbearing 
      person might, on the contrary, harbour a thought of love towards him. This 
      is the reason why the Buddha has stated in the Dhammapada (V. 
      165)</FONT></P>

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">True indeed that circumstances, 
      habitual tendencies, environment, etc., condition our thoughts. Then the 
      freewill is subordinated to the mechanistic course of events. There is

      thought moments, the first is the weakest potentially as it lacks any

      distinguished between perception (the inner state as representing outer 
      things) and apperception (the inner state as reflectively aware of 
      itself). In Kant, apperception denotes the unity of self-consciousness 
      pertaining to either the empirical ego (empirical apperception) or to the 
      pure ego (transcendental apperception)." p. 15. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Commenting on Javana Mrs. Rhys 
      Davids says:- </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">""I have spent many hours over 
      Javana, and am content to throw apperception overboard for a better term, 
      or for Javana, untranslated and as easy to pronounce as our own 'javelin.' 
      It suffices to remember that it is the mental aspect or parallel of that 
      moment in nerve-process, when central function is about to become efferent 
      activity or 'innervation.' Teachers in Ceylon associate it with the word 
      'dynamic.' And its dominant interest for European psychologists is the 
      fusion of intellect and will in Buddhist Psychology...." -- (Compendium of 
      Philosophy, p . 249). </FONT></P>

      On the other hand what space is to matter, time is to mind. Conventionally 
      we speak of past <I>(atita),</I> present<I> (paccuppanna), </I>and future 
      <I>(anagata). </FONT></P></I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Past is defined as that which 
      has gone beyond its own state or the moments of genesis, development, and 
      cessation <I>(attano sabhavam uppadadikkhanam va atita atikkanta atita). 
      </FONT></P></I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Present is that which on 
      account of this and that reason enters, goes, exists above the moments of 
      genesis etc. <I>(tam tam karanam paticca uppadadikkhanam uddham panna, 
      gata, pavatta = paccuppanna). </FONT></P></I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Future is that which has not 
      yet reached both states <I>(tadubhayam' pi na agata sampatta). 
      </FONT></P></I>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">According to Abhidhamma each 
      consciousness consists of three phases - <I>uppada</I> (genesis), 
      <I>thiti</I> (development), and <I>bhanga</I> (dissolution or cessation). 
      In the view of some commentators there is no intermediate <I>thiti</I> 
      stage but only the stages of arising and passing away. Each thought-moment 
      is followed by another. Time is thus the <I>sine qua non</I> of the 
      succession of mental states. The fundamental unit of time is the duration 
      of a thought-moment. Commentators say that the rapidity of these fleeting 
      thought moments is such that within the brief duration of a flash of 
      lightning there may be billions of thought-moments. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Matter, which also constantly 
      changes, endures only for seventeen thought-moments, being the time 
      duration for one thought-process. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Past is gone, Future has not 
      come. We live only for one thought-moment and that slips into the 
      irrevocable past. In one sense there is only the eternal NOW. In another 
      sense the so-called present is the transitional stage from the future to 
      the past. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The Dictionary of Philosophy 
      defines time "as the general medium in which all events take place in 
      succession or appear to take place in succession." </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Atthasalini states that time is 
      a concept derived from this or that phenomenon. And it does not exist in

      the eyelashes without. There are fourteen constituents: the four elements, 
      the six attributes dependent on them, viz., colour, odour, taste, sap of 
      life, form <I>(santhanam),</I> and collocation <I>(sambhavo); 
      </I>vitality, sex, body-sensibility <I>(kayappasado),</I> and the visual 
      sentient organ. The last four have their source in kamma. When 'the world, 
      seeing an obvious extended white object fancies it perceives the eye, it 
      only perceives the basis (or seat-<I>vatthu)</I> of the eye. And this ball 
      of flesh, bound to the brain by nerve-fibers, is white, black and red, and 
      contains the solid, the liquid, the lambent and the gaseous. It is white 
      by superfluity of humour, black by superfluity of bile, red by superfluity 
      of blood, rigid by superfluity of the solid, exuding by superfluity of the 
      liquid, inflamed by superfluity of the lambent, quivering by superfluity 
      of the gaseous. But that sentient organ <I>(pasado)</I> which is there 
      bound, inherent, derived from the four great principles - this is the 
      visual sense <I>(pasada-cakkhu).</I> Placed in the midst and in the front 
      of the black disc of the composite eye, the white disc surrounding it 
      (note that the iris is either not distinguished or is itself the 'black 
      disc') and in the circle of vision, in the region where the forms of 
      adjacent bodies come to appear, it permeates the seven ocular membranes as 
      sprinkled oil will permeate seven cotton wicks. And so it stands, aided by 
      the four elements, sustaining, maturing, moving (samudiranam) - like an 
      infant prince and four nurses, feeding, bathing, dressing, and fanning him 
      - maintained by nutriment both physical <I>(utu)</I> and mental, protected 
      by the (normal) span of life, invested with colour, smell, taste, and so 
      forth, in size the measure of a louse's head - stands duly constituting 
      itself the door of the seat of visual cognitions etc. For as it has been

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">According to the commentators, 
      <I>hadayavatthu</I> is the seat of consciousness. Tradition says that 
      within the cavity of the heart there is some blood, and depending on which 
      lies the seat of consciousness. It was this cardiac theory that prevailed 
      in the Buddha's time, and this was evidently supported by the Upanishads.

      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">The Buddha could have adopted 
      this popular theory, but He did not commit Himself. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman">Mr. Aung in his Compendium 
      argues that the Buddha was silent on this point. He did not positively 
      assert that the seat of consciousness was either in the heart or in the 
      brain. In the Dhammasangani the term <I>hadayavatthu</I> has purposely 
      been omitted. In the Patthana, instead of using hadaya as the seat of 
      consciousness, the Buddha has simply stated <I>'yam rupain nissaya'</I> - 
      'depending on that <I>rupa.'</I> Mr. Aung's opinion is that the Buddha did 
      not want to reject the popular theory. Nor did He advance a new theory 
      that brain is the seat of consciousness as is regarded by modern 
      scientists. </FONT></P>
