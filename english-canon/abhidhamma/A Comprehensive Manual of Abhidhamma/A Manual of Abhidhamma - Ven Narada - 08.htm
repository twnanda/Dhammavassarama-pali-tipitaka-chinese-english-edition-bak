            <P align=left>Introductory verse</P></B>
            <P align=left>§ 1. I shall now explain here, in a fitting manner, 
            how causal states act as relations to the conditioned states (1). 
            </P>
            <P align=left>§ 2. The compendium of relations is twofold: </P>
            <DIR>
            <P align=left>A. The Law of Dependent Arising (2), and <BR>B. The 
            Law of Causal Relations (3). </P></DIR>
            <P align=left>Of these, the Law of Dependent Arising is marked by 
            the simple happening of a state dependent on its antecedent state 
            (4). </P>
            <P align=left>The Law of Causal Relations is said with reference to 
            the existence of conditions that relate to one another. </P>
            <P align=left>Teachers explain them by mixing both methods. </P><B>
            <P align=left>The Law of Dependent Arising</P></B>
            <P align=left>Therein: </P>
            <DIR>
            <P align=left>Dependent on Ignorance (5 ) arise Conditioning 
            Activities (6). <BR>Dependent on Conditioning Activities arises 
            (Rebirth) Consciousness (7). <BR>Dependent on (Rebirth) 
            Consciousness arise Mind and Matter (8). <BR>Dependent on Mind and 
            Matter arise the six (Sense) Bases (9).<BR>Dependent on the six 
            (sense) Bases arises contact (10).<BR>Dependent on Contact arises 
            Feeling (11). <BR>Dependent on Feeling arises Craving (12). 
            <BR>Dependent on Craving arises Grasping (13). <BR>Dependent on 
            Grasping arises Action or Becoming (14)<BR>Dependent on Action 
            arises Birth (15). <BR>Dependent on Birth arise Decay, Death, 
            Sorrow, Lamentation, Pain, Grief, and Despair. <BR>Thus arises the 
            whole mass of suffering. </P>
            <P align=left>Herein this is the Law of the Dependent Arising. 
            </P></DIR>
            <P align=left>It should be understood that there are three periods 
            twelve factors, twenty modes, three connections, four divisions, 
            three rounds, and two roots. </P>
            <P align=left>How ? </P>
            <P align=left>Ignorance and Conditioning Activities belong to the 
            past; Birth, Decay, Death belong to the future; the intermediate 
            eight to the present. Thus there are three periods. </P>
            <P align=left>Ignorance, (moral and immoral) Activities, (Rebirth) 
            Consciousness, Mind and Matter, Six Sense Bases, Contact, Feeling, 
            Craving, Grasping, Action, Birth, Decay and Death are the twelve 
            factors. The terms Sorrow and so on are shown as incidental 
            consequences (of Birth). </P>
            <P align=left>Here, by taking ignorance and activities, craving, 
            grasping, and action are also taken. Likewise, by taking craving, 
            grasping, and action, ignorance and activities are also taken. By 
            taking birth, decay and death, the five effects with consciousness 
            and so on are taken also. Thus there are: </P>
            <P align=left>Five causes pertaining to the past, and five effects 
            to the present; five causes pertaining to the present, and five 
            effects to the future. </P>
            <P align=left>There are twenty, modes, three connections and four 
            divisions. </P>
            <P align=left>The three Rounds: </P>
            <DIR>
            <P align=left>1. Ignorance, craving, and grasping belong to the 
            Round of Passions; <BR>2. One part of becoming <I>(bhava)</I> known 
            as action and (moral and immoral) activities belongs to the Round of 
            Kamma. <BR>3. One part of becoming known as renewed existence 
            <I>(upapattibhava)</I> and the rest belong to the Round of Effects. 
            </P></DIR>
            <P align=left>Ignorance and craving should be understood as the two 
            roots (10) (see diagrams XVI and XVII).</P><B>
            <P align=left>Summary</P></B>
            <P align=left>By the destruction of these roots does the Round 
            cease. </P>
            <P align=left>The ignorance, originating from defilements (17), 
            increases in the constantly oppressed who faint by decay and death. 
            </P>
            <P align=left>The Great Sage has thus expounded this entangled, 
            beginningless existence in the triple sphere as the 'Law of 
            Dependent Arising'. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><B>

      <P align=left>1. <FONT 
      face="Times New Roman"><B>Sankhatadhammanam</B></FONT> - To the 
      conditioned <FONT face="Times New Roman"><I>nama</I></FONT> and <FONT 
      face="Times New Roman"><I>rupa</I></FONT> described in the previous 
      chapters. </P>
      <P align=left>2. <FONT 
      face="Times New Roman"><B>Paticcasamuppada</B></FONT> - <I>Paticca</I> = 
      because of, on account of; <FONT 
      face="Times New Roman"><I>samuppada</I></FONT> = arising, origination. 
      Although the literal meaning of the term is 'arising because of' or 
      dependent arising or origination, it is applied to the whole causal 
      formula which consists of twelve interdependent causes and effects, 
      technically called <I>paccaya</I> and <I>paccayuppanna. </P></I>
      <P align=left>S. Z. Aung renders <FONT 
      face="Times New Roman"><I>paticcasamuppadanaya</I></FONT> by 'The Law of 
      happening by way of cause'. </P><FONT face="Times New Roman">
      <P align=left>In this chapter the Law of Dependent Arising is not mixed up 
      with the Patthananaya as in the Visuddhi-Magga. </P></FONT>
      <P align=left>3. <FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>Patthananaya</B></FONT> - 
      According to the Ceylon Commentary here the prefix <I>'pa'</I> means 
      'various' <FONT face="Times New Roman"><I>(nanappakara).</I></FONT> Ledi 
      Sayadaw says 'principal' <I>(padh<FONT face="Times New Roman">ana). 
      Thana</FONT></I> (lit. station) signifies 'cause' <I>(paccaya)</I> which 
      is paraphrased by <FONT face="Times New Roman"><I>'upakarakadhamma'</I> - 
      aiding or supportive conditions. These various or principal causes are 
      described in detail in the Patthanapakarana, the seventh book of the 
      Abhidhamma Pitaka. The system expounded in this treatise is called 
      Patthananaya. </P></FONT>
      <P align=left>The difference between the two understood as follows: </P>
      <DIR>
      <P align=left>i. Because of A arises B. Because of B arises C. When there 
      is no A there is no B. When there is no B there is no C. In other words 
      'this being so, that is; this not being so, that is not' <I>(imasmim sati, 
      idam hoti; imasmim asati, idam na hoti).</I> This is the <FONT 
      face="Times New Roman"><I>paticcasamuppadanaya</I></FONT>. </P>
      <P align=left>ii. When we say that A is related to B in the way of 
      'coexistence', 'interdependence', we get an illustration of <FONT 
      face="Times New Roman"><I>patthananaya.</I></FONT> </P></DIR><FONT

      face="Times New Roman"><B>Tabbhavabhavibhavakaramatta;</B></FONT> <FONT 
      face="Times New Roman"><I>bhavakaramatta</I></FONT> = the simple happening 
      of a state; <FONT face="Times New Roman"><I>tabbhavabhavi</I></FONT> = 
      dependent on its antecedent state. </P>
      <P align=left>5. <FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>Avijja,</B></FONT> lit., 
      not-knowingness, i.e., of the<FONT face="Times New Roman"> four Noble 
      Truths. It is also explained as 'that which causes beings to run in the 
      endless Samsara' <I>(antavirahite samsare satte javapeti).</I></FONT> 
      'Whereby the fruit is produced' is termed <I>'paccaya',</I> which is the 
      cause. When ignorance is destroyed and turned into knowingness, all 
      causality is shattered as in the case of Buddhas and Arahats. </P>
      <P align=left>6. <FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>Sankhara</B></FONT> - 
      This is a multisignificant term which should be understood according to 
      the context. Here the term signifies immoral <I>(akusala), </I>moral 
      <I>(kusala),</I> and unshakable <I><FONT 
      face="Times New Roman">(a</FONT>neñj<FONT 
      face="Times New Roman">a)</FONT></I> volitions <FONT 
      face="Times New Roman"><I>(cetana)</I></FONT> which constitute Kamma that 
      produces rebirth. The first embraces all volitions in the 12 types of 
      immoral consciousness; the second, all volitions in the 8 types of 
      Beautiful <I>(kusala)</I> consciousness and the 5 types of <FONT 
      face="Times New Roman"><I>kusala rupa-jhana</I></FONT> consciousness; the 
      third, all volitions in the 4 types of <FONT 
      face="Times New Roman"><I>kusala arupa-jhanas.</I> Where is no proper 
      English equivalent which gives the exact connotation of this Pali term. 
      <I>Sankhara,</I></FONT> as one of the five aggregates, implies the 50 
      mental states excluding feeling and perception. </P>
      <P align=left>The volitions of the four supramundane Path consciousnesses 
      <I>(lokuttara-magga-citta)</I> are not regarded as <FONT 
      face="Times New Roman"><I>sankhara</I></FONT> because they tend to 
      eradicate ignorance. Wisdom <I>(paññ<FONT 
      face="Times New Roman">a)</FONT></I> is predominant in Supramundane types 
      of consciousness, while volition <FONT 
      face="Times New Roman"><I>(cetana)</I></FONT> is predominant in the 
      mundane types of consciousness. </P>
      <P align=left>Ignorance is predominant in immoral activities, while it is 
      latent in moral activities. Hence both moral and immoral actions are 
      regarded as caused by ignorance. </P>
      <P align=left>7. <B>Viññ<FONT face="Times New Roman">ana</FONT></B> - 
      strictly denotes the 19 types of rebirth-consciousness <I>(patisandhi 
      viññ<FONT face="Times New Roman">ana)</FONT></I> described in chapter V. 
      All the 32 types of resultant consciousness<FONT 
      face="Times New Roman"><I> (vipaka-citta)</I></FONT> experienced during 
      lifetime, are also implied by the term. </P>
      <P align=left>The foetus in the mother's womb is formed by the combination 
      of this relinking-consciousness with the sperm and ovum cells of the 
      parents. In this consciousness are latent all the past impressions, 
      characteristics and tendencies of that particular individual life-flux. 
      </P>
      <P align=left>This relinking-consciousness is regarded as "radiant" 
      <I>(pabhassara)</I> as it is either devoid of immoral roots of lust, 
      hatred and delusion (as in the case of rootless resultants - 
      <I>ahetuka-vip<FONT face="Times New Roman">aka),</FONT></I> or accompanied 
      by moral roots (as in the case of resultants with roots).</P>

      <P align=left>From this it is evident that sex is determined by past Kamma

      <P align=left>Here <FONT face="Times New Roman"><I>kaya</I></FONT> means 
      the sensitive part of the body. Sex is not developed at the moment of

      During the embryonic period the six sense-bases gradually evolve from the 
      psycho physical phenomena in which are latent infinite potentialities. The 
      insignificant, infinitesimally small speck now develops into a complex 
      six-sense-machine which now operates almost mechanically without any agent 
      like a soul to act as the operator. The six sense-bases are eye, ear, 
      nose, tongue, body, and mind. The first five refer to the sensitive organs 
      that evolve by degrees. Mind-base has already been explained. </P>

      (Craving) is threefold, namely, craving for sensual pleasures <FONT 
      face="Times New Roman"><I>(kama-tanha),</I></FONT> craving for sensual 
      pleasures associated with the view of eternalism <FONT 
      face="Times New Roman"><I>(bhava-tanha)</I></FONT> i.e., enjoying, 
      pleasures thinking that they are imperishable, and craving for sensual 
      pleasures associated with the view of nihilism <FONT 
      face="Times New Roman"><I>(vibhava-tanha)</I></FONT> i.e., enjoying 
      pleasures thinking that everything perishes after death. The last is the

      <P align=left>Bhava-tanha</I></FONT> and <FONT

      attachment to <FONT face="Times New Roman"><I>rupa</I></FONT> and <FONT 
      face="Times New Roman"><I>arupa</I></FONT> Planes respectively. Usually 
      these two terms are rendered by craving for existence and non-existence. 
      </P>
      <P align=left>There are six kinds of craving corresponding to the six 
      sense-objects such as form, sound, and so on. They become 12 when they are 
      treated as internal and external. They are reckoned as 36 when past, 
      present and future are taken into consideration. When multiplied by the 
      foregoing three kinds of craving they amount to 108. </P>

            <P align=left>D. Only in one way is matter related to mind: </P>

            <P align=left>Therein object is sixfold as form, etc. But

            season, lodging conditions, internal and external, as the case may 
            be, are related to moral states, etc. Kamma, too, is similarly 
            related to its effects. </P>
            <P align=left>F. Mind and matter are related to mind and matter in 
            nine ways according to circumstances - namely, by way of 
            <B>predominance, conascence, reciprocity, dependence, nutriment,

            <P align=left>Therein relation of <B>predominance</B> is twofold: 
            </P>
            <DIR>
            <P align=left>i. The object to which weight is attached is related 
            to states of mind by way of objective predominance. </P>
            <P align=left>ii. The fourfold coexisting predominance is related to 
            coexisting mind and matter by way of conascence. </P></DIR>
            <P align=left>The relation of conascence is threefold: consciousness 
            and mental states are related to one another and to the coexisting 
            material states; the four Great Essentials mutually and to the 
            derived material qualities; the heart-base and the resultant (mental 
            aggregates) to one another at the moment of rebirth. </P>
            <P align=left>The relation of reciprocity is threefold: 
            consciousness and mental states are related to one another; the four 
            Great Essentials, to one another; the heart-base and the resultant 
            mental aggregates to one another at the moment of rebirth. </P>
            <P align=left>The relation of dependence is threefold: consciousness 
            and mental states are related to one another and coexisting matter; 
            the four chief elements, to one another and derived material 
            qualities; and six bases, to the seven cognitive elements. </P>
            <P align=left>The relation of nutriment is twofold: edible food is 
            related to this body; and immaterial nutriment, to the coexisting 
            mind and matter. </P>
            <P align=left>The relation of control is threefold: the five 
            sensitive organs are related to the five kinds of cognition; the 
            controlling power of material vitality, to the material qualities 
            that have been grasped at; the immaterial controlling factors, to 
            the coexistent mind and matter. </P>
            <P align=left>The law of dissociation is threefold: at the moment of 
            conception the basis of mind is related to the effects (of kamma), 
            and consciousness and mental states, to coexistent mind and matter 
            by way of coexistence; the subsequent consciousness and mental

            <P align=left>The five kinds of relations - coexistence,

      <P align=left>18. <B>Hetu-paccaya</B> - Here <I>paccaya</I> presents some 
      difficulty. It is defined as that by means of which an effect comes to be. 
      In other words it is the cause. Furthermore, it is explained as a 
      'serviceable or supportive factor' <FONT 
      face="Times New Roman"><I>(upakarako dhammo).</I></FONT> <I>Hetu</I> is 
      defined as 'that by which an effect is established'. It is used in the 
      sense of 'root' <FONT face="Times New Roman"><I>(mulatthena).</I></FONT> 
      Like the roots of a tree are hetu; like water and manure that aid its 
      growth are <I>paccaya.</I> In the Abhidhamma these two related terms are 
      used in two different senses. In the Suttas, however, they are invariably 
      employed as Synonymous terms, without any distinction, as, for example 
      <I>ko hetu, ko paccayo</I> - what is the reason? what is the cause? 
      </P><FONT face="Times New Roman">
      <P align=left>In the Patthana 24 such </FONT><I>paccayas</I> are 
      enumerated, and <I>hetu</I> is one of them. <I>Hetu-paccaya</I> is 
      explained as <I>'hetu</I> itself is a <I>paccaya'</I> or 'as <I>hetu</I> 
      it becomes a <I>paccaya'</I>. It is interpreted as a supportive or 
      serviceable factor in the sense of root <FONT 
      face="Times New Roman"><I>(mulatthena upakarako dhammo). </I>The causal 
      relation by way of 'root' may be suggested as the closest rendering. (See 
      Compendium, p. 279; Journal of the Pali Text Society, 1915-1916, pp. 
      29-53.) </P></FONT>
      <P align=left>'Roots are purely mental. They are the six moral and immoral 
      roots. See Chapter I. </P>
      <P align=left>19. <FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>Arammana</B></FONT> - or 
      <FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>alambana</B></FONT>. The former is derived 
      from <I>a + Ö ram,</I> to delight in; the latter from <FONT 
      face="Times New Roman"><I>a + Ö lamb, </I></FONT>to hang upon. Things 
      which the subject delights in or hangs upon are 'objects'. There are six 
      classes of objects. A form, for instance, acts as a causal relation to 
      visual-consciousness by way of an 'object'. It should be stated that there 
      is nothing mundane or supramundane that does not become an object for 
      mind. </P>
      <P align=left>20. <B>Adhipati</B> - Lit., mastery or lordship over one's 
      own. 0ne of the four dominant factors - namely, wish, thought, effort and 
      reasoning - may, at one time, causally relate itself to coexistent mental 
      states and material phenomena by way of predominance. "Whenever such 
      phenomena as consciousness and mental states arise by giving pred<FONT 
      face="Times New Roman">ominance to one of these four factors, then this 
      phenomenon is to the other phenomenon a condition by way of predominance". 
      (Patthana)</P></FONT>
      <P align=left>21. <B>Anantara</B> and <B>Samanantara</B> - In meaning 
      there is no difference between the two terms. They differ only in 
      etymology. According to Buddhist philosophy one thought-moment perishes, 
      immediately giving birth to another. The succeeding thought-moment 
      inherits all the potentialities of its immediate predecessor. The 
      perishing preceding states causally relate themselves to immediately 
      following states by way of contiguity and immediacy. </P>
      <P align=left>22. <B>Sahaj<FONT face="Times New Roman">ata</FONT></B> - 
      The causal relation by way of conascence, as, for instance, the four 
      mental aggregates, the different mental states that simultaneously arise 
      in a particular type of consciousness, the four Great Essentials that 
      arise together, the appearance of the three 'decads' at the moment of 
      conception, etc. In the <I>paticca</I>-<FONT 
      face="Times New Roman"><I>samuppada</I></FONT> it may be mentioned that 
      both contact and feeling which appear as causes and effect are conascent. 
      </P>
      <P align=left>A mental state may be conascent with a mental state, a 
      mental with a physical, a physical with a physical, and a physical with a 
      mental. </P>
      <P align=left>23. <B>Aññamañña</B> - Just as the legs of a tripod are 
      reciprocally helpful, even so mental or physical state or states may be 
      causally related by way of reciprocity (or mutuality). Causal relations of 
      conascence and reciprocity should be differentiated. They are not 
      identical. For instance, mind-born material phenomena are not reciprocally 
      related to the coexisting mind, nor are the material derivatives to the 
      coexisting Great Essentials. As a rule, mind and matter are reciprocally 
      related. </P>
      <P align=left>24. <B>Nissaya</B> and <B>Upanissaya</B> - derived from 
      <I>upa + ni + Ö si,</I> to lie. <I>Upa</I> is an intensive prefix. As 
      trees depend on the ground for their support, and as pictures depend on a 
      canvas on which they are painted, so is the causal relation of dependence. 
      <I>Upanissaya</I> is defined as a stronger form of Nissaya. It is compared 
      to the rains on which depend the growth of trees. S. Z. Aung renders 
      <I>upanissaya</I> by 'sufficing condition'. For instance, one of the five 
      heinous crimes such as matricide, parricide and so on, will serve as an 
      <I>upanissaya</I> to effect a birth in a woeful state. Good environments, 
      early education, etc., will serve as a causal relation by way of 
      'dependence' (nissaya) for the acquisition of health, wealth and knowledge 
      in later life. Just as good actions become <I>upanissaya</I> for future 
      good deeds, even so they may become <I>upanissaya</I> for evil too as, for 
      instance, spiritual pride. See Ledi Sayadaw's learned article on this 
      subject in P.T.S. Journal, 1916, pp. 49-53. </P>
      <P align=left>25. <B>Pur<FONT face="Times New Roman">ejata</FONT></B> - 
      lit., born before or that which pre-exists. The six physical bases and six 
      sensual objects are regarded as pre-existent. The pre-existent things are 
      regarded as causal relations only when they continue to exist in the 
      present and not by mere antecedence. Priority is not a good rendering. 
</P>
      <P align=left>26. <FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>Pacchajata</B></FONT> - 
      Of the 89 types of consciousness, 85 types, excluding the four <FONT 
      face="Times New Roman"><I>arupa</I></FONT> resultants, and the 52 mental 
      states, are causally related to the antecedent physical body by way of 
      post-occurrence. </P>
      <P align=left>27. <B><FONT face="Times New Roman">Aseva</FONT>na</B> - 
      Repeated practice, as a rule, leads to proficiency. This applies to both 
      good and evil things. By repetition one acquires a certain amount of skill 
      in any particular thing. <FONT 
      face="Times New Roman"><I>Asevana</I></FONT> denotes this repeated 
      practice. In <I>javana</I> process the second thought moment is causally 
      related to the first, the third to the second, the fourth to the third, by 
      way of recurrence. This is the reason why the fourth <I>javana</I> 
      thought-moment is considered very powerful. </P>
      <P align=left>28. <B>Kamma</B> means the volition that plays the most 
      important part in moral and immoral thoughts, words, and deeds. This 
      volition, technically known as Kamma, is causally related to the 
      Kamma-born material phenomena, etc. As a seed to a tree so is Kamma 
      causally related to its inevitable results. </P>
      <P align=left>29. <B>Vip<FONT face="Times New Roman">aka</FONT></B> - Like 
      a cool breeze that pacifies a person seated under the cool shade of a 
      tree, even so mental states of resultant types of consciousness are 
      causally related to coexistent mental states and material phenomena by way 
      of 'effect' due to their effortless peaceful nature. </P>
      <P align=left>30. <FONT face="Times New Roman"><B>Ahara</B></FONT> - Just 
      as material food sustains the physical body, even so mental foods sustain 
      mental states. Edible food is causally related to the body by way of 
      nutriment or food; so are mental contacts or impressions <I>(phassa)</I> 
      to feelings; volitions or moral and immoral actions <I>(mano-sañetan<FONT 
      face="Times New Roman">a)</FONT></I> to rebirth-consciousness 
      <I>(patisandhi viññ<FONT face="Times New Roman">ana);</FONT></I> and 
      rebirth-consciousness <I>(viññ<FONT face="Times New Roman">ana)</FONT></I> 
      to mind and matter.</P>
      <P align=left>31. <B>Indriya</B> - The controlling factors enumerated in 
      Chapter VII become causally related to the coexistent mental states and 
      material phenomena because they exercise control in their respective 
      spheres. For instance, confidence controls its co-adjuncts in religious 
      convictions; psychic and physical life, in vivifying mind and matter; 
      mindfulness, in contemplative exercise; feelings, in grief and happiness, 
      etc.</P>
      <P align=left>32. <B>Jh<FONT face="Times New Roman">ana</FONT></B> - The 
      seven <FONT face="Times New Roman"><I>jhana</I></FONT> factors of (1) 
      initial application, (2) sustained application, (3) rapture, (4) 
      happiness, (5) equanimity, (6) displeasure and (7) one-pointedness are 
      causally related to one another and other concomitants by way of close 
      perception and contemplation. For instance, the initial application 
      <I>(vitakka)</I> is causally related to its concomitants in directing them 
      towards the desired object. See Chapter 1. </P>
      <P align=left>1, 2, 3, 4, 7 are found in two classes of consciousness 
      rooted in attachment; 1, 2, 6, 7, in hateful consciousness; 1, 2, 5, 7, in 
      deluded consciousness. </P>
      <P align=left>33. <B>Magga</B> - means a way or road. One way leads to 
      woeful states; the other, to states of bliss. The vehicles that convey 
      travelers to the former are the evil 'Path Constituents' of wrong views, 
      wrong application, wrong effort, and wrong one-pointedness. The vehicles 
      that ply on the latter way are right understanding, right aspirations, 
      right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right 
      mindfulness, and right one-pointedness. These path factors are causally 
      related to both mind and body, leading downwards in the case of bad ones, 
      and leading away from existence (niyy<FONT face="Times New Roman">ana) in 
      the case of good ones. </P></FONT>
      <P align=left>34. <B>Sampayutta</B> - Though possessing distinct 
      characteristics from an ultimate standpoint yet, as certain mental states 
      arise together, perish together, have one identical object and one 
      identical base, they are causally related to one another by way of 
      'association'. </P>
      <P align=left>35. <B>Vippayutta</B> is the opposite of the foregoing. 
      Sweet and bitter tastes may be helpful to each other in being dissimilar. 
      For instance, mind that depends on the heart-basis is causally related to 
      it by way of dissociation because, both mind and heart-basis are not 
      mutually bound, as water on a lotus leaf. </P>
      <P align=left>36. <B>Atthi</B> is the causal relation of states that exist 
      in the present to similar states like the causal relation of coexistence. 
      The visibility of objects, for instance, is due to the presence of light. 
      </P>
      <P align=left>37. <B>Natthi</B> - As with the disappearance of light, 
      darkness spreads, so with the disappearance of the predecessor, the 
      successor appears. Such is the causal relation by way of absence. For 
      instance, the visual consciousness <I>(dassana)</I> is causally related to 
      the immediately following receiving consciousness <I>(sampaticchana) 
      </I>by way of absence. </P>
      <P align=left>38. <B>Vigata</B> and <B>Avigata</B> are similar to Natthi 
      and Atthi respectively.</P>

      <P align=left>Notes:</P></B>
      <P align=left>39. <B>Paññatti</B> - There are two kinds of <I>paññatti</I> 
      or concepts - namely, <I>attha-paññatti</I> and <I><FONT 
      face="Times New Roman">nama-pa</FONT>ññatti.</I> The former is made known, 
      that is, the object conveyed by the concept. The latter is that which 
      makes known, that is, the name given to the object. </P>
      <P align=left>Land, mountain, etc. are called <I><FONT 
      face="Times New Roman">'santhana-pa</FONT>ññatti'</I>, formal concepts, 
      since they correspond to the form of things. </P>
      <P align=left>Chariot, village, etc., are called <I><FONT 
      face="Times New Roman">'samuha-pa</FONT>ññatti'</I>, collective concepts, 
      since they correspond to a collection or group of things. </P>
      <P align=left>East, west, etc., are called <I><FONT 
      face="Times New Roman">'disa-pa</FONT>ññatti'</I>, local concepts, since 
      they correspond to locality. </P>
      <P align=left>Morning, noon, etc., are called <I><FONT 
      face="Times New Roman">'kala-pa</FONT>ññatti'</I>, time concepts, since 
      they correspond to time. </P>
      <P align=left>Well, cave, etc., are called <I><FONT 
      face="Times New Roman">'akasa-pa</FONT>ññatti'</I>, space-concepts, since 
      they correspond to open space. </P>
      <P align=left>Visualized image, conceptualized image, etc. are called 
      <I>'nimitta-paññatti'</I>, since they correspond to mental signs gained by 
      mental development. </P>
      <P align=left>40. Six kinds of <B>Paññatti</B> -</P>
      <P align=left>1. Matter, feeling, etc., exist in an ultimate sense. </P>
      <P align=left>2. Land, mountain, etc., are terms given to things that do 
      not exist in an ultimate sense. </P>
      <P align=left>3. 'Possessor of sixfold supernormal vision.' </P>
      <P align=left>Here the former does not exist in an ultimate sense, but the 
      latter does. </P>
      <P align=left>4. Woman's voice. Here the voice exists in an ultimate 
      sense, but not the woman. </P>
      <P align=left>5. Eye-consciousness. Here the sensitive eye exists in an 
      ultimate sense, and so does the consciousness dependent on it. </P>
      <P align=left>6. King's son. Here neither the son nor the king exists in 
      an ultimate sense. </P>
