      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the heart of 
      the Abhidhamma philosophy is the <B>Abhidhamma Pitaka</B>, one of the 
      divisions of the Pali Canon recognized by Theravada Buddhism as the 
      authoritative recension of the Buddha's teachings. This canon was compiled 
      at the three great Buddhist councils held in India in the early centuries 
      following the Buddha's demise: the first, at Rajagaha, convened three 
      months after the Buddha's Parinibbana by five hundred senior monks under 
      the leadership of the Elder Mahakassapa; the second, at Vesali, a hundred 
      years later, and the third, at Pataliputta, two hundred years later. The 
      canon that emerged from these councils, preserved in the Middle Indian 
      language now called Pali, is known as the Tipitaka, the three "baskets" or 
      collections of the teachings. The first collection, the Vinaya Pitaka, is 
      the book of discipline, containing the rules of conduct for the bhikkhus 
      and Bhikkhunis - the monks and nuns - and the regulations governing the 
      Sangha, the monastic order. The Sutta Pitaka, the second collection, 
      brings together the Buddha's discourses spoken by him on various occasions 
      during his active ministry of forty five years. And the third collection 
      is the Abhidhamma Pitaka, the "basket" of the Buddha's "higher" or 
      "special" doctrine.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This third 
      great division of the Pali Canon bears a distinctly different character 
      from the other two divisions. Whereas the Suttas and Vinaya serve an 
      obvious practical purpose, namely, to proclaim a clear-cut message of 
      deliverance and to lay down a method of personal training, the Abhidhamma 
      Pitaka presents the appearance of an abstract and highly technical 
      systemization of the doctrine. <B><FONT color=#0000ff>The collection 
      consists of seven books: the <I>Dhammasangani, </I>the <I>Vibhanga, 
      </I>the <I>Dhatukatha, </I>the <I>Puggalapannatti, </I>the <I>Kathavatthu, 
      </I>the <I>Yamaka, </I>and the <I>Patthana. </I></FONT></B>Unlike the 
      Suttas, these are not records of discourses and discussions occurring in 
      real-life settings; they are, rather, full-blown treatises in which the 
      principles of the doctrine have been methodically organized, minutely 
      defined, and meticulously tabulated and classified. Though they were no 
      doubt originally composed and transmitted orally and only written down 
      later, with the rest of the canon in the first century B.C., they exhibit 
      the qualities of structured thought and rigorous consistency more typical 
      of written documents.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 
      Theravada tradition the Abhidhamma Pitaka is held in the highest esteem, 
      revered as the crown jewel of the Buddhist scriptures. As examples of this 
      high regard, in Sri Lanka King Kassapa V (tenth century A.C.) had the 
      whole Abhidhamma Pitaka inscribed on gold plates and the first book set in 
      gems, while another king, Vijayabahu (eleventh century) used to study the 
      <I>Dhammasangani </I>each morning before taking up his royal duties and 
      composed a translation of it into Sinhala. On a cursory reading, however, 
      this veneration given to the Abhidhamma seems difficult to understand. The 
      texts appear to be merely a scholastic exercise in manipulating sets of 
      doctrinal terms, ponderous and tediously repetitive.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason the 
      Abhidhamma Pitaka is so deeply revered only becomes clear as a result of 
      thorough study and profound reflection, undertaken in the conviction that 
      these ancient books have something significant to communicate. When one 
      approaches the Abhidhamma treatises in such a spirit and gains some 
      insight into their wide implications and organic unity, one will find that 
      they are attempting nothing less than to articulate a comprehensive vision 
      of the totality of experienced reality, a vision marked by extensiveness 
      of range, systematic completeness, and analytical precision. From the 
      standpoint of Theravada orthodoxy the system that they expound is not a 
      figment of speculative thought, not a mosaic put together out of 
      metaphysical hypotheses, but a disclosure of the true nature of existence 
      as apprehended by a mind that has penetrated the totality of things both 
      in depth and in the finest detail. Because it bears this character, the 
      Theravada tradition regards the Abhidhamma as the most perfect expression 
      possible of the Buddha's unimpeded omniscient knowledge 
      <I>(sabbannuta-nana). </I>It is his statement of the way things appear to 
      the mind of a Fully Enlightened One, ordered in accordance with the two 
      poles of his teaching: suffering and the cessation of suffering.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system that 
      the Abhidhamma Pitaka articulates is simultaneously a philosophy, a 
      psychology, and an ethics, all integrated into the framework of a program 
      for liberation. The Abhidhamma may be described as a philosophy because it 
      proposes an ontology, a perspective on the nature of the real. This 
      perspective has been designated the "dhamma theory" <I>(dhammavada). 
      </I>Briefly, the dhamma theory maintains that ultimate reality consists of 
      a multiplicity of elementary constituents called <I>dhammas, </I>The 
      dhammas are not noumena hidden behind phenomena, not "things in 
      themselves" as opposed to "mere appearances, but the fundamental 
      components of actuality. The dhammas fall into two broad classes: the 
      unconditioned dhamma, which is solely Nibbana, and the conditioned 
      dhammas, which are the momentary mental and material phenomena that 
      constitute the process of experience. The familiar world of substantial 
      objects and enduring persons is, according to the dhamma theory, a 
      conceptual construct fashioned by the mind out of the raw data provided by 
      the dhammas. The entities of our everyday frame of reference possess 
      merely a consensual reality derivative upon the foundational stratum of 
      the dhammas. It is the dhammas alone that possess ultimate reality: 
      determinate existence "from their own side" <I>(sarupato) </I>independent 
      of the mind's conceptual processing of the data.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a 
      conception of the nature of the real seems to be already implicit in the 
      Sutta Pitaka, particularly in the Buddha's disquisitions on the 
      aggregates, sense bases, elements, dependent arising, etc., but it remains 
      there tacitly in the background as the underpinning to the more 
      pragmatically formulated teachings of the Suttas. Even in the Abhidhamma 
      Pitaka itself the dhamma theory is not yet expressed as an explicit 
      philosophical tenet; this comes only later, in the Commentaries. 
      Nevertheless, though as yet implicit, the theory still comes into focus in 
      its role as the regulating principle behind the Abhidhamma's more evident 
      task, the project of systemization.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project 
      starts from the premise that to attain the wisdom that knows things "as 
      they really are," a sharp wedge must be driven between those types of 
      entities that possess ontological ultimacy, that is, the dhammas, and 
      those types of entities that exist only as conceptual constructs but are 
      mistakenly grasped as ultimately real. Proceeding from this distinction, 
      the Abhidhamma posits a fixed number of dhammas as the building blocks of 
      actuality, most of which are drawn from the Suttas. It then sets out to 
      define all the doctrinal terms used in the Suttas in ways that reveal 
      their identity with the ontological ultimates recognized by the system. On 
      the basis of these definitions, it exhaustively classifies the dhammas 
      into a net of pre-determined categories and modes of relatedness which 
      highlight their place within the system's structure. And since the system 
      is held to be a true reflection of actuality, this means that the 
      classification pinpoints the place of each dhamma within the overall 
      structure of actuality.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
      Abhidhamma's attempt to comprehend the nature of reality, contrary to that 
      of classical science in the West, does not proceed from the standpoint of 
      a neutral observer looking outwards towards the external world. The 
      primary concern of the Abhidhamma is to understand the nature of 
      experience, and thus the reality on which it focuses is conscious reality, 
      the world as given in experience, comprising both knowledge and the known 
      in the widest sense. For this reason the philosophical enterprise of the 
      Abhidhamma shades off into a phenomenological psychology. To facilitate 
      the understanding of experienced reality, the Abhidhamma embarks upon an 
      elaborate analysis of the mind as it presents itself to introspective 
      meditation. It classifies consciousness into a variety of types, specifies 
      the factors and functions of each type, correlates them with their objects 
      and physiological bases, and shows how the different types of 
      consciousness link up with each other and with material phenomena to 
      constitute the ongoing process of experience.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This analysis 
      of mind is not motivated by theoretical curiosity but by the overriding 
      practical aim of the Buddha's teaching, the attainment of deliverance from 
      suffering. Since the Buddha traces suffering to our tainted attitudes - a 
      mental orientation rooted in greed, hatred, and delusion - the 
      Abhidhamma's phenomenological psychology also takes on the character of a 
      psychological ethics, understanding the term "ethics" not in the narrow 
      sense of a code of morality but as a complete guide to noble living and 
      mental purification. Accordingly we find that the Abhidhamma distinguishes 
      states of mind principally on the basis of ethical criteria: the wholesome 
      and the unwholesome, the beautiful factors and the defilements. Its 
      schematization of consciousness follows a hierarchical plan that 
      corresponds to the successive stages of purity to which the Buddhist 
      disciple attains by practice of the Buddha's path. This plan traces the 
      refinement of the mind through the progression of meditative absorptions, 
      the fine-material-sphere and immaterial-sphere jhanas, then through the 
      stages of insight and the wisdom of the supramundane paths and fruits. 
      Finally, it shows the whole scale of ethical development to culminate in 
      the perfection of purity attained with the mind's irreversible 
      emancipation from all defilements.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All three 
      dimensions of the Abhidhamma - the philosophical, the psychological, and 
      the ethical - derive their final justification from the cornerstone of the 
      Buddha's teaching, the program of liberation announced by the Four Noble 
      Truths. The ontological survey of dhammas stems from the Buddha's 
      injunction that the noble truth of suffering, identified with the world of 
      conditioned phenomena as a whole, must be fully understood 
      <I>(parinneyya). </I>The prominence of mental defilements and requisites 
      of enlightenment in its schemes of categories, indicative of its 
      psychological and ethical concerns, connects the Abhidhamma to the second 
      and fourth noble truths, the origin of suffering and the way leading to 
      its end. And the entire taxonomy of dhammas elaborated by the system 
      reaches its consummation in the "unconditioned element" <I>(asankhata 
      dhatu), </I>which is Nibbana, the third noble truth, that of the cessation 
      of suffering.</P>
      <P align=center><FONT color=#0000ff><B>The Twofold Method</B></FONT> </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great 
      Buddhist commentator, Acariya Buddhaghosa, explains the word <B><FONT 
      color=#0000ff>"Abhidhamma"</FONT></B> as meaning "that which exceeds and 
      is distinguished from the Dhamma" <I>(dhammdtireka-dhammavisesa), </I>the 
      prefix <I><B>abhi </B></I>having the sense of preponderance and 
      distinction, and <I><B>dhamma</B> </I>here signifying the teaching of the 
      Sutta Pitaka.' When the Abhidhamma is said to surpass the teaching of the 
      Suttas, this is not intended to suggest that the Suttanta teaching is 
      defective in any degree or that the Abhidhamma proclaims some new 
      revelation of esoteric doctrine unknown to the Suttas. Both the Suttas and 
      the Abhidhamma are grounded upon the Buddha's unique doctrine of the Four 
      Noble Truths, and all the principles essential to the attainment of 
      enlightenment are already expounded in the Sutta Pitaka. The difference 
      between the two in no way concerns fundamentals but is, rather, partly a 
      matter of scope and partly a matter of method.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to scope, 
      the Abhidhamma offers a thoroughness and completeness of treatment that 
      cannot be found in the Sutta Pitaka. Acariya Buddhaghosa explains that in 
      the Suttas such doctrinal categories as the five aggregates, the twelve 
      sense bases, the eighteen elements, and so forth, are classified only 
      partly, while in the Abhidhamma Pitaka they are classified fully according 
      to different schemes of classification, some common to the Suttas, others 
      unique to the Abhidhamma. Thus the Abhidhamma has a scope and an intricacy 
      of detail that set it apart from the Sutta Pitaka.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other major 
      area of difference concerns method. The discourses contained in the Sutta 
      Pitaka were expounded by the Buddha under diverse circumstances to 
      listeners with very different capacities for comprehension. They are 
      primarily pedagogical in intent, set forth in the way that will be most 
      effective in guiding the listener in the practice of the teaching and in 
      arriving at a penetration of its truth. To achieve this end the Buddha 
      freely employs the didactic means required to make the doctrine 
      intelligible to his listeners. He uses simile and metaphor he exhorts, 
      advises, and inspires; he sizes up the inclinations and aptitudes of his 
      audience and adjusts the presentation of the teaching so that it will 
      awaken a positive response. For this reason the Suttanta method of 
      teaching is described as <I>pariyaya-dbammadesana, </I>the figurative or 
      embellished discourse on the Dhamma.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to 
      the Suttas, the Abhidhamma Pitaka is intended to divulge as starkly and 
      directly as possible the totalistic system that underlies the Suttanta 
      expositions and upon which the individual discourses draw. The Abhidhamma 
      takes no account of the personal inclinations and cognitive capacities of 
      the listeners; it makes no concessions to particular pragmatic 
      requirements. It reveals the architectonics of actuality in an abstract, 
      formalistic manner utterly devoid of literary embellishments and 
      pedagogical expedients. Thus the Abhidhamma method is described as the 
      <I>nippariyaya-dbammadesana, </I>the literal or unembellished discourse on 
      the Dhamma.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This difference 
      in technique between the two methods also influences their respective 
      terminologies. In the Suttas the Buddha regularly makes use of 
      conventional language <I>(voharavacana) </I>and accepts conventional truth 
      <I>(sammutisacca),</I>truth expressed in terms of entities that do not 
      possess ontological ultimacy but can still be legitimately referred to 
      them. Thus in the Suttas the Buddha speaks of "I" and "you," of "man" and 
      "woman," of living beings, persons, and even self as though they were 
      concrete realities. The Abhidhamma method of exposition, however, 
      rigorously restricts itself to terms that are valid from the standpoint of 
      ultimate truth <I>(paramatthasacca): </I>dhammas, their characteristics, 
      their functions, and their relations. Thus in the Abhidhamma all such 
      conceptual entities provisionally accepted in the Suttas for purposes of 
      meaningful communication are resolved into their ontological ultimates, 
      into bare mental and material phenomena that are impermanent, conditioned, 
      and dependently arisen, empty of any abiding self or substance.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a 
      qualification is necessary. When a distinction is drawn between the two 
      methods, this should be understood to be based on what is most 
      characteristic of each Pitaka and should not be interpreted as an absolute 
      dichotomy. To some degree the two methods overlap and interpenetrate. Thus 
      in the Sutta Pitaka we find discourses that employ the strictly 
      philosophical terminology of aggregates, sense bases, elements, etc., and 
      thus come within the bounds of the Abhidhamma method. Again, within the 
      Abhidhamma Pitaka we find sections, even a whole book (the 
      <I>Puggalapannatti), </I>that depart from the rigorous manner of 
      expression and employ conventional terminology, thus coming within the 
      range of the Suttanta method.</P>
      <P align=center><FONT color=#0000ff><B>Distinctive Features of the 
      Abhidhamma</B></FONT> </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from its 
      strict adherence to the philosophical method of exposition, the Abhidhamma 
      makes a number of other noteworthy contributions integral to its task of 
      systemization. One is the employment, in the main books of the Abhidhamma 
      Pitaka, of a <I>matika - </I>a matrix or schedule of categories - as the 
      blueprint for the entire edifice. This matrix, which comes at the very 
      beginning of the <I>Dhammasangani </I>as a preface to the Abhidhamma 
      Pitaka proper, consists of 122 modes of classification special to the 
      Abhidhamma method. Of these, twenty - two are triads <I>(tika), </I>sets 
      of three terms into which the fundamental dhammas are to be distributed; 
      the remaining hundred are dyads <I>(duka), </I>sets of two terms used as a 
      basis for classification. The matrix serves as a kind of grid for sorting 
      out the complex manifold of experience in accordance with principles 
      determined by the purposes of the Dhamma. For example, the triads include 
      such sets as states that are wholesome, unwholesome, indeterminate; states 
      associated with pleasant feeling, painful feeling, neutral feeling; states 
      that are kamma results, productive of kamma results, neither; and so 
      forth. The dyads include such sets as states that are roots, not roots; 
      states concomitant with roots, not so concomitant; states that are 
      conditioned, unconditioned; states that are mundane, supramundane; and so 
      forth. By means of its selection of categories, the matrix embraces the 
      totality of phenomena, illuminating it from a variety of angles 
      philosophical, psychological, and ethical in nature.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second 
      distinguishing feature of the Abhidhamma is the dissection of the 
      apparently continuous stream of consciousness into a succession of 
      discrete evanescent cognitive events called <I>cittas, </I>each a complex 
      unity involving consciousness itself, as the basic awareness of an object, 
      and a constellation of mental factors <I>(cetasika) </I>exercising more 
      specialized tasks in the act of cognition. Such a view of consciousness, 
      at least in outline, can readily be derived from the Sutta Pitaka's 
      analysis of experience into the five aggregates, among which the four 
      mental aggregates are always inseparably conjoined, but the conception 
      remains there merely suggestive. In the Abhidhamma Pitaka the suggestion 
      is not simply picked up, but is expanded into an extraordinarily detailed 
      and coherent picture of the functioning of consciousness both in its 
      microscopic immediacy and in its extended continuity from life to 
life.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third 
      contribution arises from the urge to establish order among the welter of 
      technical terms making up the currency of Buddhist discourse. In defining 
      each of the dhammas, the Abhidhamma texts collate long lists of synonyms 
      drawn mostly from the Suttas. This method of definition shows how a single 
      dhamma may enter under different names into different sets of categories. 
      For example, among the defilements, the mental factor of greed <I>(lobha) 
      </I>may be found as the taint of sensual desire, the taint of (attachment 
      to) existence, the bodily knot of covetousness, clinging to sensual 
      pleasures, the hindrance of sensual desire, etc.; among the requisites of 
      enlightenment, the mental factor of wisdom (panna) may be found as the 
      faculty and power of wisdom, the enlightenment factor of investigation of 
      states, the path factor of right view, etc. In establishing these 
      correspondences, the Abhidhamma helps to exhibit the interconnections 
      between doctrinal terms that might not be apparent from the Suttas 
      themselves. In the process it also provides a precision-made tool for 
      interpreting the Buddha's discourses.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Abhidhamma 
      conception of consciousness further results in a new primary scheme for 
      classifying the ultimate constituents of existence, a scheme which 
      eventually, in the later Abhidhamma literature, takes precedence over the 
      schemes inherited from the Suttas such as the aggregates, sense bases, and 
      elements. In the Abhidhamma Pitaka the latter categories still loom large, 
      but the view of mind as consisting of momentary concurrences of 
      consciousness and its concomitants leads to a fourfold method of 
      classification more congenial to the system. This is the division of 
      actuality into the four ultimate realities <I>(paramattha):</I> 
      consciousness, mental factors, material phenomena, and Nibbana <I>(citta, 
      cetasika, rupa, nibbana), </I>the first three comprising conditioned 
      reality and the last the unconditioned element.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last novel 
      feature of the Abhidhamma method to be noted here - contributed by the 
      final book of the Pitaka, the Patthana - is a set of twenty-four 
      conditional relations laid down for the purpose of showing how the 
      ultimate realities are welded into orderly processes. This scheme of 
      conditions supplies the necessary complement to the analytical approach 
      that dominates the earlier books of the Abhidhamma. The method of analysis 
      proceeds by dissecting apparent wholes into their component parts, thereby 
      exposing their voidness of any indivisible core that might qualify as self 
      or substance. The synthetic method plots the conditional relations of the 
      bare phenomena obtained by analysis to show that they are not isolated 
      self-contained units but nodes in a vast multi-layered web of 
      inter-related, inter-dependent events. Taken in conjunction, the 
      analytical method of the earlier treatises of the Abhidhamma Pitaka and 
      the synthetic method of the <I>Patthana </I>establish the essential unity 
      of the twin philosophical principles of Buddhism, non-self or egolessness 
      (anatta) and dependent arising or conditionality <I>(paticca samuppdda). 
      </I>Thus the foundation of the Abhidhamma methodology remains in perfect 
      harmony with the insights that lie at the heart of the entire Dhamma.</P>
      <P align=center><FONT color=#0000ff><B>The Origins of the 
      Abhidhamma</B></FONT> </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although modern 
      critical scholarship attempts to explain the formation of the Abhidhamma 
      by a gradual evolutionary process, Theravada orthodoxy assigns its genesis 
      to the Buddha himself. According to the Great Commentary 
      <I>(maha-atthakatha) </I>quoted by Acariya Buddhaghosa, "What is known as 
      Abhidhamma is not the province nor the sphere of a disciple; it is the 
      province, the sphere of the Buddhas." The commentarial tradition holds, 
      moreover, that it was not merely the spirit of the Abhidhamma, but the 
      letter as well, that was already realized and expounded by the Buddha 
      during his lifetime.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
      <I>Atthasalini </I>relates that in the fourth week after the 
      Enlightenment, while the Blessed One was still dwelling in the vicinity of 
      the Bodhi Tree, he sat in a jewel house <I>(ratanaghara) </I>in the 
      northwest direction. This jewel house was not literally a house made of 
      precious stones, but was the place where he contemplated the seven books 
      of the Abhidhamma Pitaka. He contemplated their contents in turn, 
      beginning with the <I>Dhammasangani, </I>but while investigating the first 
      six books his body did not emit rays. However, upon coming to the 
      <I>Patthana, </I>when "he began to contemplate the twenty-four universal 
      conditional relations of root, object, and so on, his omniscience 
      certainly found its opportunity therein. For as the great fish 
      Timiratipingala finds room only in the great ocean 84,000 yojanas in 
      depth, so his omniscience truly finds room only in the Great Book. Rays of 
      six colours - indigo, golden, red, white, tawny, and dazzling - issued 
      from the Teacher's body, as he was contemplating the subtle and abstruse 
      Dhamma by his omniscience which had found such opportunity."</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theravada 
      orthodoxy thus maintains that the Abhidhamma Pitaka is authentic Word of 
      the Buddha, in this respect differing from an early rival school, the 
      Sarvastivadins. This school also had an Abhidhamma Pitaka consisting of 
      seven books, considerably different in detail from the Theravada 
      treatises. According to the Sarvastivadins, the books of the Abhidhamma 
      Pitaka were composed by Buddhist disciples, several being attributed to 
      authors who appeared generations after the Buddha. The Theravada school, 
      however, holds that the Blessed One himself expounded the books of the 
      Abhidhamma, except for the detailed refutation of deviant views in the 
      <I>Katadvatthu, </I>which was the work of the Elder Moggaliputta Tissa 
      during the reign of Emperor Asoka.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pali 
      Commentaries, apparently drawing upon an old oral tradition, maintain that 
      the Buddha expounded the Abhidhamma, not in the human world to his human 
      disciples, but to the assembly of devas or gods in the Tavatimsa heaven. 
      According to this tradition, just prior to his seventh annual rains 
      retreat the Blessed One ascended to the Tavatimsa heaven and there, seated 
      on the Pandukambala stone at the foot of the Paricchattaka tree, for the 
      three months of the rains he taught the Abhidhamma to the devas who had 
      assembled from the ten thousand world-systems. He made the chief recipient 
      of the teaching his mother, Mahamaya-devi, who had been reborn as a deva. 
      The reason the Buddha taught the Abhidhamma in the deva world rather than 
      in the human realm, it is said, is because in order to give a complete 
      picture of the Abhidhamma it has to be expounded from the beginning to the 
      end to the same audience in a single session. Since the full exposition of 
      the Abhidhamma requires three months, only devas and Brahmas could receive 
      it in unbroken continuity, for they alone are capable of remaining in one 
      posture for such a length of time.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, each 
      day, to sustain his body, the Buddha would descend to the human world to 
      go on almsround in the northern region of Uttarakuru. After collecting 
      almsfood he went to the shore of Anotatta Lake to partake of his meal. The 
      Elder Sariputta, the General of the Dhamma, would meet the Buddha there 
      and receive a synopsis of the teaching given that day in the deva world: 
      "Then to him the Teacher gave the method, saying, 'Sariputta, so much 
      doctrine has been shown.' Thus the giving of the method was to the chief 
      disciple, who was endowed with analytical knowledge, as though the Buddha 
      stood on the edge of the shore and pointed out the ocean with his open 
      hand. To the Elder also the doctrine taught by the Blessed One in hundreds 
      and thousands of methods became very clear."</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having learnt 
      the Dhamma taught him by the Blessed One, Sariputta in turn taught it to 
      his own circle of 500 pupils, and thus the textual recension of the 
      Abhidhamma Pitaka was established. To the Venerable Sariputta is ascribed 
      the textual order of the Abhidhamma treatises as well as the numerical 
      series in the <I>Patthana. </I>Perhaps we should see in these admissions 
      of the <I>Atthasalini </I>an implicit acknowledgment that while the 
      philosophical vision of the Abhidhamma and its basic architecture 
      originate from the Buddha, the actual working out of the details, and 
      perhaps even the prototypes of the texts themselves, are to be ascribed to 
      the illustrious Chief Disciple and his entourage of students. In other 
      early Buddhist schools, too, the Abhidhamma is closely connected with the 
      Venerable Sariputta, who in some traditions is regarded as the literal 
      author of Abhidhamma treatises.</P>
      <P align=center><FONT color=#0000ff><B>The Seven Books</B></FONT> </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brief outline 
      of the contents of the seven canonical Abhidhamma books will provide some 
      insight into the plethora of textual material to be condensed and 
      summarized by the <I>Abhidhammattha Sangaha. </I>The first book, the 
      <I><B><FONT color=#800040>Dhammasangani, </FONT></B></I>is the 
      fountainhead of the entire system. The title may be translated 
      "Enumeration of Phenomena," and the work does in fact undertake to compile 
      an exhaustive catalogue of the ultimate constituents of existence.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening with 
      the <I>,matika, </I>the schedule of categories which serves as the 
      framework for the whole Abhidhamma, the text proper is divided into four 
      chapters. The first, "States of Consciousness," takes up about half of the 
      book and unfolds as an analysis of the first triad in the <I>matika, 
      </I>that of the wholesome, the unwholesome, and the indeterminate. To 
      supply that analysis, the text enumerates 121 types of consciousness 
      classified by way of their ethical quality. Each type of consciousness is 
      in turn dissected into its concomitant mental factors, which are 
      individually defined in full. The second chapter, "On Matter," continues 
      the inquiry into the ethically indeterminate by enumerating and 
      classifying the different types of material phenomena. The third chapter, 
      called "The Summary," offers concise explanations of all the terms in the 
      Abhidhamma matrix and the Suttanta matrix as well. Finally, a concluding 
      "Synopsis" provides a more condensed explanation of the Abhidhamma matrix 
      but omits the Suttanta matrix.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <FONT 
      color=#800040><B><I>Vibhanga, </I></B></FONT>the "Book of Analysis," 
      consists of eighteen chapters, each a self-contained dissertation, dealing 
      in turn with the following: aggregates, sense bases, elements, truths, 
      faculties, dependent arising, foundations of mindfulness, supreme efforts, 
      means to accomplishment, factors of enlightenment, the eightfold path, 
      jhanas, illimitables, training rules, analytical knowledges, kinds of 
      knowledge, minor points (a numerical inventory of defilements), and "the 
      heart of the doctrine" <I>(dhammahadaya), </I>a psycho-cosmic topography 
      of the Buddhist universe. Most of the chapters in the <I>Vibhanga, 
      </I>though not all, involve three subsections: an analysis according to 
      the methodology of the Suttas; an analysis according to the methodology of 
      the Abhidhamma proper; and an interrogation section, which applies the 
      categories of the matrix to the subject under investigation.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <B><FONT 
      color=#800040><I>Dhatukatha, </I></FONT></B>the "Discourse on Elements," 
      is written entirely in catechism form. It discusses all phenomena with 
      reference to the three schemata of aggregates, sense bases, and elements, 
      seeking to determine whether, and to what extent, they are included or not 
      included in them, and whether they are associated with them or dissociated 
      from them.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <B><FONT 
      color=#800040><I>Puggalapannatti, </I></FONT></B>"Concepts of 
      Individuals," is the one book of the Abhidhamma Pitaka that is more akin 
      to the method of the Suttas than to the Abhidhamma proper. The work begins 
      with a general enumeration of types of concepts, and this suggests that it 
      was originally intended as a supplement to the other books in order to 
      take account of the conceptual realities excluded by the strict 
      application of the Abhidhamma method. The bulk of the work provides formal 
      definitions of different types of individuals. It has ten chapters: the 
      first deals with single types of individuals; the second with pairs; the 
      third with groups of three, etc.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <B><FONT 
      color=#800040><I>Kathavatthu, </I></FONT></B>"Points of Controversy," is a 
      polemical treatise ascribed to the Elder Moggaliputta Tissa. He is said to 
      have compiled it during the time of Emperor Asoka, 218 years after the 
      Buddha's Parinibbana, in order to refute the heterodox opinions of the 
      Buddhist schools outside the Theravadin fold. The Commentaries defend its 
      inclusion in the Canon by holding that the Buddha himself, foreseeing the 
      errors that would arise, laid down the outline of rebuttal, which 
      Moggaliputta Tissa merely filled in according to the Master's 
      intention.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <B><FONT 
      color=#800040><I>Yamaka, </I></FONT></B>the "Book of Pairs," has the 
      purpose of resolving ambiguities and defining the precise usage of 
      technical terms. It is so called owing to its method of treatment, which 
      throughout employs the dual grouping of a question and its converse 
      formulation. For instance, the first pair of questions in the first 
      chapter runs thus: "Are all wholesome phenomena wholesome roots? And are 
      all wholesome roots wholesome phenomena?" The book contains ten chapters: 
      roots, aggregates, sense bases, elements, truths, formations, latent 
      dispositions, consciousness, phenomena, and faculties.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <B><FONT 
      color=#800040><I>Patthana, </I></FONT></B>the "Book of Conditional 
      Relations," is probably the most important work of the Abhidhamma Pitaka 
      and thus is tradition ally designated the "Great Treatise" 
      <I>(mahapakarana). </I>Gigantic in ex tent as well as in substance, the 
      book comprises five volumes totalling 2500 pages in the Burmese-script 
      Sixth Council edition. The purpose of the <I>Patthana </I>is to apply its 
      scheme of twenty-four conditional relations to all the phenomena 
      incorporated in the Abhidhamma matrix. The main body of the work has four 
      great divisions: origination according to the positive method, according 
      to the negative method, according to the positive-negative method, and 
      according to the negative-positive method. Each of these in turn has six 
      sub-divisions: origination of triads, of dyads, of dyads and triads 
      combined, of triads and dyads combined, of triads and triads combined, and 
      of dyads and dyads combined. Within this pattern of twenty-four sections, 
      the twenty-four modes of conditionality are applied in due order to all 
      the phenomena of existence in all their conceivable permutations. Despite 
      its dry and tabular format, even from a "profane" humanistic viewpoint the 
      <I>Patthana </I>can easily qualify as one of the truly monumental products 
      of the human mind, astounding in its breadth of vision, its rigorous 
      consistency, and its painstaking attention to detail. To Theravada 
      orthodoxy, it is the most eloquent testimony to the Buddha's unimpeded 
      knowledge of omniscience.</P>
      <P align=center><FONT color=#0000ff><B>The Commentaries</B></FONT> </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The books of 
      the Abhidhamma Pitaka have inspired a voluminous mass of exegetical 
      literature composed in order to fill out, by way of explanation and 
      exemplification, the scaffoldings erected by the canonical texts. The most 
      important works of this class are the authorized commentaries of Acariya 
      Buddhaghosa. These are three in number: the <I>Atthasalini, </I>"The 
      Expositor," the commentary to the <I>Dhammasangani; </I>the 
      <I>Sammohavinodani </I>, "The Dispeller of Delusion," the commentary to 
      the <I>Vibhanga; </I>and the <I>Pancappakarana Atthakatha, </I>the 
      combined commentary to the other five treatises. To this same stratum of 
      literature also belongs the <I>Visuddhimagga, </I>"The Path of 
      Purification," also composed by Buddhaghosa. Although this last work is 
      primarily an encyclopedic guide to meditation, its chapters on "the soil 
      of under standing" (XIV-XVII) lay out the theory to be mastered prior to 
      developing insight and thus constitute in effect a compact dissertation on 
      Abhidhamma. Each of the commentaries in turn has its subcommentary 
      <I>(mulatika), </I>by an elder of Sri Lanka named Acariya Ananda, and 
      these in turn each have a sub-subcommentary <I>(anutika), </I>by Ananda's 
      pupil Dhammapala (who is to be distinguished from the great Acariya 
      Dhammapala, author of the <I>tikas </I>to Buddhaghosa's works).</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the 
      authorship of the Commentaries is ascribed to Acariya Buddhaghosa, it 
      should not be supposed that they are in any way original compositions, or 
      even original attempts to interpret traditional material. They are, 
      rather, carefully edited versions of the vast body of accumulated 
      exegetical material that Buddhaghosa found at the Mahavihara in 
      Anuradhapura. This material must have preceded the great commentator by 
      centuries, representing the collective efforts of generations of erudite 
      Buddhist teachers to elucidate the meaning of the canonical Abhidhamma. 
      While it is tempting to try to discern evidence of historical development 
      in the Commentaries over and beyond the ideas embedded in the Abhidhamma 
      Pitaka, it is risky to push this line too far, for a great deal of the 
      canonical Abhidhamma seems to require the Commentaries to contribute the 
      unifying context in which the individual elements hang together as parts 
      of a systematic whole and without which they lose important dimensions of 
      meaning. It is thus not unreasonable to assume that a substantial portion 
      of the commentarial apparatus originated in close proximity to the 
      canonical Abhidhamma and was transmitted concurrently with the latter, 
      though lacking the stamp of finality it was open to modification and 
      amplification in a way that the canonical texts were not.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing this in 
      mind, we might briefly note a few of the Abhidhammic conceptions that are 
      characteristic of the Commentaries but either unknown or recessive in the 
      Abhidhamma Pitaka itself. One is the detailed account of the cognitive 
      process <I>(cittavithi). </I>While this conception seems to be tacitly 
      recognized in the canonical books, it now comes to be drawn out for use as 
      an explanatory tool in its own right. The functions of the <I>cittas, 
      </I>the different types of consciousness, are specified, and in time the 
      <I>cittas </I>themselves come to be designated by way of their functions. 
      The term <I>khana, </I>"moment," replaces the canonical <I>samaya, 
      </I>"occasion," as the basic unit for delimiting the occurrence of events, 
      and the duration of a material phenomenon is determined to be seventeen 
      moments of mental phenomena. The division of a moment into three 
      sub-moments - arising, presence, and dissolution - also seems to be new to 
      the Commentaries.' The organization of material phenomena into groups 
      <I>(kalapa), </I>though implied by the distinction between the primary 
      elements of matter and derived matter, is first spelled out in the 
      Commentaries, as is the specification of the heart-base <I>(hadayavatthu) 
      </I>as the material basis for mind element and mind-consciousness 
      element.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
      Commentaries introduce many (though not all) of the categories for 
      classifying kamma, and work out the detailed correlations between kamma 
      and its results. They also close off the total number of mental factors 
      <I>(cetasika). </I>The phrase in the <I>Dhammasangani, </I>"or what ever 
      other (unmentioned) conditionally arisen immaterial phenomena there are on 
      that occasion," apparently envisages an open-ended universe of mental 
      factors, which the Commentaries delimit by specifying the "or- whatever 
      states' <I>(yevapanaka dhamma). </I>Again, the Commentaries consummate the 
      dhamma theory by supplying the formal definition of dhammas as "things 
      which bear their own intrinsic nature" <I>(attano sabhavam dharenti ti 
      dhamma)</I>. The task of defining specific dhammas is finally rounded off 
      by the extensive employment of the fourfold defining device of 
      characteristic, function, manifestation, and proximate cause, a device 
      derived from a pair of old exegetical texts, the <I>Petakopadesa </I>and 
      the <I>Nettipakarana.</I></P>

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the 
      Abhidhamma system, already massive in its canonical version, grew in 
      volume and complexity, it must have become increasingly unwieldy for 
      purposes of study and comprehension. Thus at a certain stage in the 
      evolution of Theravada Buddhist thought the need must have become felt for 
      concise summaries of the Abhidhamma as a whole in order to provide the 
      novice student of the subject with a clear picture of its main outlines - 
      faithfully and thoroughly, yet without an unmanageable mass of detail.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet this

      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among these, 
      the work that has dominated Abhidhamma studies from about the twelfth 
      century to the present day is the first mentioned, the <I>Abhidhammattha 
      Sangaha, </I>"The Compendium of Things contained in the Abhidhamma." Its 
      popularity may be accounted for by its remarkable balance between 
      concision and comprehensiveness. Within its short scope all the essentials 
      of the Abhidhamma are briefly and carefully summarized. Although the 
      book's manner of treatment is extremely terse even to the point of 
      obscurity when read alone, when studied under a qualified teacher or with 
      the aid of an explanatory guide, it leads the student confidently through 
      the winding maze of the system to a clear perception of its entire 
      structure. For this reason throughout the Theravada Buddhist world the 
      <I>Abhidhammattha Sangaha </I>is always used as the first textbook in 
      Abhidhamma studies. In Buddhist monasteries, especially in Burma, novices 
      and young bhikkhus are required to learn the <I>Sangaha </I>by heart 
      before they are permitted to study the books of the Abhidhamma Pitaka and 
      its Commentaries.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detailed 
      information about the author of the manual, Acariya Anuruddha, is 
      virtually non-existent. He is regarded as the author of two other manuals, 
      cited above, and it is believed in Buddhist countries that he wrote 
      altogether nine compendia, of which only these three have survived. The 
      <I>Paramattha-vinicchaya </I>is written in an elegant style of Pali and 
      attains a high standard of literary excellence. According to the colophon, 
      its author was born in Kaveri in the state of Kancipura (Conjeevaram) in 
      South India. Acariya Buddhadatta and Acariya Buddhaghosa are also said to 
      have resided in the same area, and the subcommentator Acariya Dhammapala 
      was probably a native of the region. There is evidence that for several 
      centuries Kancipura had been an important centre of Theravada Buddhism 
      from which learned bhikkhus went to Sri Lanka for further study.</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not known 
      exactly when Acariya Anuruddha lived and wrote his manuals. An old 
      monastic tradition regards him as having been a fellow student of Acariya 
      Buddhadatta under the same teacher, which would place him in the fifth 
      century. According to this tradition, the two elders wrote their 
      respective books, the <I>Abhidhammattha Sangaha </I>and the 
      <I>Abhidhammavatara. </I>as gifts of gratitude to their teacher, who 
      remarked: "Buddhadatta has filled a room with all kinds of treasure and 
      locked the door, while Anuruddha has also filled a room with treasure but 
      left the door open." Modem scholars, however, do not endorse this 
      tradition, maintaining on the basis of the style and content of 
      Anuruddha's work that he could not have lived earlier than the eighth 
      century, more probably between the tenth and early twelfth centuries.'</P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the colophon 
      to the <I>Abhidhammattha Sangaha </I>Acariya Anuruddha states that he 
      wrote the manual at the Mulasoma Monastery, which all exegetical 
      traditions place in Sri Lanka. There are several ways to reconcile this 
      fact with the concluding stanzas of the <I>Paramattha-vinicchaya, 
      </I>which state that he was born in Kancipura. One hypothesis is that he 
      was of South Indian descent but came to Sri Lanka, where he wrote the 
      <I>Sangaha. </I>Another, advanced by G.P. Malalasekera, holds that he was 
      a native of Sri Lanka who spent time at Kancipura (which, however, passes 
      over his statement that he was <I>born</I> in Kancipura). Still a third 
      hypothesis, proposed by Ven. A.P. Buddhadatta Mahathera, asserts that</P>
      <P align=justify>there were two different monks named Anuruddha, one in 
      Sri Lanka who was the author of the <I>Abhidhammattha Sangaha, </I>another 
      in Kancipura who wrote the <I>Paramattha-vinicchaya.</I></P>

      Sangaha</B></FONT></P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owing to its 
      extreme concision, the <I>Abhidhammattha Sangaha </I>cannot be easily 
      understood without explanation. Therefore to elucidate its terse and pithy 
      synopsis of the Abhidhamma philosophy, a great number of <I>tikas </I>or 
      commentaries have been written upon it. In fact, this work has probably 
      stimulated more commentaries than any other Pali text, written not only in 
      the Pali language but also in Burmese, Sinhala, Thai, etc. Since the 
      fifteenth century Burma has been the international centre of Abhidhamma 
      studies, and therefore we find many commentaries written on it by Burmese 
      scholars both in Pali and in Burmese. Commentaries on the <I>Sangaha 
      </I>in Pali alone number nineteen, of which the following are the most 
      important: </P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <I><B><FONT 
      color=#ff00ff>Abhidhammatthasangaha-Tika</FONT></B>, </I>also known as the 
      <I>Porana-Tika, </I>"the Old Commentary." This is a very small <I>tika 
      </I>written in Sri Lanka in the twelfth century by an elder named Acariya 
      Navavimalabuddhi.</P>

      color=#ff00ff><I>Abhidhammathavibhavini-Tika, </I></FONT></B>or in brief, 
      the <I>Vibhavini, </I>written by Acariya Sumangalasami, pupil of the 
      eminent Sri Lankan elder Sariputta Mahasami, also in the twelfth century. 
      This <I>tika </I>quickly superceded the Old Commentary and is generally 
      considered the most profound and reliable exegetical work on the 
      <I>Sangaha. </I>In Burma this work is known as <I>tika-gyaw, </I>"the 
      Famous Commentary." The author is greatly respected for his erudition and 
      mastery of the Abhidhamma. He relies heavily on older authorities such as 
      the <I>Abhidhamma-Anutika </I>and the <I>Visuddhimagga-Mahatika </I>(also 
      known as the <I>Paramatthamanjusa).</I></P>
      <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Ledi 
      Sayadaw (see below) criticized the <I>Vibhavini </I>extensively in his own 
      commentary on the <I>Sangaha, </I>its popularity has not diminished but 
      indeed has even increased, and several Burmese scholars have risen to 
      defend it against Ledi Sayadaw's criticisms.</P>
